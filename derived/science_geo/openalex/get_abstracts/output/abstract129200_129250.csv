https://openalex.org/W2159979956,"Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is controlled by sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of its inhibitory subunit IkappaB. A large multiprotein complex, the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalsome, was purified from HeLa cells and found to contain a cytokine-inducible IkappaB kinase activity that phosphorylates IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta. Two components of the IKK signalsome, IKK-1 and IKK-2, were identified as closely related protein serine kinases containing leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix protein interaction motifs. Mutant versions of IKK-2 had pronounced effects on RelA nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter activity, consistent with a critical role for the IKK kinases in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1997509253,"Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) by inflammatory cytokines requires the successive action of NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK) and IκB kinase–α (IKK-α). A widely expressed protein kinase was identified that is 52 percent identical to IKK-α. IκB kinase–β (IKK-β) activated NF-κB when overexpressed and phosphorylated serine residues 32 and 36 of IκB-α and serines 19 and 23 of IκB-β. The activity of IKK-β was stimulated by tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 treatment. IKK-α and IKK-β formed heterodimers that interacted with NIK. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of IKK-β blocked cytokine-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, an active IκB kinase complex may require three distinct protein kinases."

Binding of molecules induced changes in the refractive index of the porous silicon. The validity and sensitivity of the system are demonstrated for small organic molecules (biotin and digoxigenin), 16-nucleotide DNA oligomers, and proteins (streptavidin and antibodies) at pico- and femtomolar analyte concentrations. The sensor is also highly effective for detecting single and multilayered molecular assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2061040884,"Reactive and potentially toxic cofactors such as copper ions are imported into eukaryotic cells and incorporated into target proteins by unknown mechanisms. Atx1, a prototypical copper chaperone protein from yeast, has now been shown to act as a soluble cytoplasmic copper(I) receptor that can adopt either a two- or three-coordinate metal center in the active site. Atx1 also associated directly with the Atx1-like cytosolic domains of Ccc2, a vesicular protein defined in genetic studies as a member of the copper-trafficking pathway. The unusual structure and dynamics of Atx1 suggest a copper exchange function for this protein and related domains in the Menkes and Wilson disease proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2044258586,"Photochemical smog, or ground-level ozone, has been the most recalcitrant of air pollution problems, but reductions in emissions of sulfur and hydrocarbons may yield unanticipated benefits in air quality. While sulfate and some organic aerosol particles scatter solar radiation back into space and can cool Earth's surface, they also change the actinic flux of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Observations and numerical models show that UV-scattering particles in the boundary layer accelerate photochemical reactions and smog production, but UV-absorbing aerosols such as mineral dust and soot inhibit smog production. Results could have major implications for the control of air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2013652077,"The carboxyl-terminal domain, residues 146 to 231, of the human immunodeficiency virus–1 (HIV-1) capsid protein [CA(146–231)] is required for capsid dimerization and viral assembly. This domain contains a stretch of 20 residues, called the major homology region (MHR), which is conserved across retroviruses and is essential for viral assembly, maturation, and infectivity. The crystal structures of CA(146–231) and CA(151–231) reveal that the globular domain is composed of four helices and an extended amino-terminal strand. CA(146–231) dimerizes through parallel packing of helix 2 across a dyad. The MHR is distinct from the dimer interface and instead forms an intricate hydrogen-bonding network that interconnects strand 1 and helices 1 and 2. Alignment of the CA(146–231) dimer with the crystal structure of the capsid amino-terminal domain provides a model for the intact protein and extends models for assembly of the central conical core of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2022958779,"Forces generated by protein polymerization are important for various forms of cellular motility. Assembling microtubules, for instance, are believed to exert pushing forces on chromosomes during mitosis. The force that a single microtubule can generate was measured by attaching microtubules to a substrate at one end and causing them to push against a microfabricated rigid barrier at the other end. The subsequent buckling of the microtubules was analyzed to determine both the force on each microtubule end and the growth velocity. The growth velocity decreased from 1.2 micrometers per minute at zero force to 0.2 micrometer per minute at forces of 3 to 4 piconewtons. The force-velocity relation fits well to a decaying exponential, in agreement with theoretical models, but the rate of decay is faster than predicted."
https://openalex.org/W2028348480,"Mothers against Dpp-related or Smad proteins are essential components of serine/threonine kinase receptor signaling pathways that are regulated by phosphorylation. Recently, it was demonstrated that Smad2 interacts transiently with and is a direct substrate of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type I receptor, TβRI. Phosphorylation sites on Smad2 were localized to a carboxyl-terminal fragment containing three serine residues at positions 464, 465, and 467. In this report, we show that TβRI specifically phosphorylates Smad2 on serines 465 and 467. Serine 464 is not a site of phosphorylation, but is important for efficient phosphorylation of Smad2. Phosphorylation at both sites is required to mediate association of Smad2 with Smad4 in mammalian cells, while in yeast, Smad2 interacts directly with Smad4 and does not require phosphorylation. Mutation of either serine residue 465 or 467 prevents dissociation of Smad2 from activated TβRI and blocks TGF-β-dependent signaling and Smad2 transcriptional activity. These results indicate that receptor-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 on serines 465 and 467 is required in mammalian cells to permit association with Smad4 and to propagate TGF-β signals.

Initiation of the signaling cascade has been most extensively studied for TGF-β and its type I and type II receptors, TβRI and TβRII. In the absence of ligand both TβRI and TβRII exist as independent homomers on the cell surface (3Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzén P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of a heteromeric receptor complex occurs when TGF-β binds to TβRII which then leads to the recruitment of TβRI. TβRII, a constitutively active kinase, can then transphosphorylate TβRI in a conserved region of the receptor known as the “GS domain” (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated in this glycine and serine-rich domain, TβRI is activated and can signal to Smad2, also known as MADR2, a downstream substrate of the type I kinase (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Smad2 is a member of the Mothers AgainstDpp (MAD)-related family of proteins that have been identified in organisms as diverse as Drosophila (MAD; Refs.7Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A.

Smad proteins lack any known structural motifs, but all members possess two highly conserved amino and carboxyl-terminal domains (MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively) that are separated by a nonconserved linker region. Biochemical and biological studies have clearly demonstrated that Smad proteins are essential components of Ser/Thr kinase receptor signaling pathways and that different Smad proteins can convey distinct biological signals. For example, Smad2 and Smad3 act in TGF-β/activin signaling pathways (14Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I. Thomsen G.

Smad4 (also known as DPC4), originally identified as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic carcinomas (22Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Shamsul Hoque A.T.M. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L.

Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar), appears to function in multiple pathways and can form heteromeric complexes with either Smad1, Smad2, or Smad3 in response to activation of signaling (23Lagna G.

Interestingly unlike other MAD-related family members, the recently identified Smad7 protein appears to block TGF-β signaling (27Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.-Y. Grinnell B.W.

Several studies have indicated that Smad proteins mediate signaling through a nuclear function. Both Smad1 and Smad2 appear to accumulate in the nucleus upon activation of the appropriate signaling pathways, and several Smad proteins have been demonstrated to function as transcriptional activators in heterologous assay systems (15Baker J.C. Harland R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 19Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Furthermore, in Xenopus, Smad2 can associate with FAST1, a winged-helix transcription factor, to form a regulatory complex that is involved in the activin-dependent transcriptional induction of the homeobox gene, Mix.2(16Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Smad proteins are regulated by rapid ligand-dependent phosphorylation in response to specific signaling pathways (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, Smad1 phosphorylation is induced by BMPs through the highly related type I receptors ALK3 or ALK6 and not by TGF-β (19Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In an analagous manner, Smad2 is phosphorylated in response to TGF-β or activin and not to BMPs (14Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I. Thomsen G. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad1 occurs on the carboxyl terminus within the last three serine residues and is directly mediated by the TGF-β type I receptor, TβRI (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), or by the BMP type I receptor, ALK6 (24Kretzchmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), respectively. Phosphorylation of Smad proteins is critical for their biological activity. For example, mutations in Smad2, identified in colorectal carcinomas, that block Smad2 phosphorylation yield functionally inactive proteins (14Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I. Thomsen G. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the serine residues that encompass the phosphorylation site in Smad1 or Smad2 yields proteins that cannot accumulate in the nucleus upon activation of signaling pathways. In addition, these mutants can act as dominant-negatives in TGF-β signaling (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and can prevent their transcriptional activity (24Kretzchmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad proteins by Ser/Thr kinase receptors provides a rapid and specific mechanism for transducing TGF-β superfamily signals. However, precisely which residues are phosphorylated, the mechanism of phosphorylation, and the role that individual phosphorylation events play in Smad function are unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that Smad2 is phosphorylated by the TGF-β type I receptor kinase on Ser465 and Ser467. Phosphorylation can occur independently on either site, but phosphorylation of both serines is required for dissociation of Smad2 from the activated receptor complex. We also show that Ser464 is not phosphorylated by the receptor kinase, but that this serine is required for efficient phosphorylation of Smad2 on serines 465 and 467. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in mammalian cells, association of Smad4 and Smad2 requires phosphorylation of Smad2 at both sites. In functional assays, we show that Smad2 harboring point mutations of serine to alanine residues at either 465 or 467 acts as a dominant-negative in TGF-β signaling and is inactive as a transcriptional activator. Thus Smad2 phosphorylation at Ser465 and Ser467 is essential for Smad2-Smad4 complex formation and for TGF-β signaling. The construction of pCMV5B-FlagSmad2 and pGEX4T1-Smad2 has been described previously (14Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I. Thomsen G. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). To generate mammalian and bacterial expression constructs of mutant versions of Smad2 (S464A, S465A, S467A, S464/465A, S464/467A, S465/467A), mutations were introduced using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy and the products were subcloned into pCMV5B-FlagSmad2 and pGEX4T1-Smad2, respectively. Mouse Smad4, cloned as described previously (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), was tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the carboxyl terminus by polymerase chain reaction. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The pG5E1b-Lux construct, containing the luciferase reporter gene downstream of the GAL4-DNA binding element and the E1b TATA box, was generated by subcloning an XhoI/EcoRI insert of pG5E1b-CAT (a kind gift from A. Bonni (Division of Neuroscience, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School)), intoXhoI/HindIII of pGL2-Basic. pCMV5B-GAL4-Smad2, consisting of Smad2 fused to the DNA binding and dimerizing domains of GAL4 (amino acids 1–147), was constructed by subcloning the GAL4-Smad2 insert from pGBT9-Smad2 into pCMV5B usingHindIII/XbaI sites. To generate GAL4-Smad2 constructs harboring serine to alanine mutations,SalI/XbaI fragments from the mutant versions of Smad2 in pCMV5B were subcloned intoSalI/XbaI-digested pCMV5B-GAL4-Smad2. pCMV5B-GAL4 was generated from pCMV5B-GAL4-Smad2 vector by digestion withEcoRI/XbaI. Mv1Lu and HepG2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids, and COS-1 cells were grown in high glucose-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfections, HepG2 cells were seeded at 10–25% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected overnight with 0.5 μg DNA/well using the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method as described previously (19Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). For transfections in COS-1, cells were seeded at 50–70% confluence and were transfected with DEAE-dextran as described previously (31Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For [32P]Phosphate labeling, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were washed and preincubated with phosphate-free medium containing 0.2% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cells were then incubated with media containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate for 2 h at 37 °C as described previously (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation. For anti-Flag immunoprecipitations, cells lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) followed by adsorption to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (19Hoodless P.A.

For TGF-β receptor complex or anti-HA immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TβRII antibody C16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-HA (12CA5) antibody, respectively, followed by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. For determination of Flag/Smad2 or Smad4/HA protein levels, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and assayed by immunoblotting as described previously (19Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S.

Receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated from Mv1Lu cells and incubated with wild type or mutant Smad2 proteins as a substrate in the kinase assay, as described previously (6Macı́as-Silva M.

Smad2 proteins were expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified as described (32Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 16.7.1-16.7.8Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For p3TP-Lux reporter and GAL4-Smad2 transcriptional assays, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the reporter plasmids p3TP-Lux and pG5E1b-Lux, respectively, pCMVβ-gal, and the indicated Smad2 or GAL4-Smad2 constructs. Cells were treated overnight with or without TGF-β, and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer. To determine transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase activity assay was performed as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.6.6-16.6.7Google Scholar). The luciferase assay results were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Phosphorylation of Smad2 by the TGF-β receptor complex is essential for its function as an intracellular transducer of TGF-β signals and is mediated by the type I receptor kinase. Our previous studies mapped the ligand-dependent phosphorylation site to a five-amino acid tryptic peptide at the COOH-terminal tail of Smad2. This peptide contains three serine residues, and mutation of all three residues to alanine abolishes phosphorylation, thus confirming this region as the site of TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Recently, the same region was also identified on Smad1 as the site of BMP-dependent phosphorylation (24Kretzchmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To determine more precisely which of the three serine residues located within this tryptic peptide are phosphorylated, we generated a series of single, double, and triple mutants of Smad2 that contain all combinations of serine to alanine mutations in the COOH-terminal peptide (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of these mutants by the TGF-β type I receptor was then evaluated in intact cells. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant Smad2 in combination with either wild type or constitutively active TβRI. This constitutively active receptor, which was constructed by substitution of a threonine in the GS domain to an aspartic acid, signals TGF-β responses in the absence of ligand or type II receptor (34Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [32P]phosphate and receptor-mediated phosphorylation examined by immunoprecipitation of Flag epitope-tagged Smad2 using α-Flag antibodies. As described previously, the phosphorylation of wild type Smad2 in the absence or the presence of wild type TβRI was low (Fig. 2 A). However, in the presence of constitutively active TβRI, a dramatic increase in Smad2 phosphorylation was detected. In contrast, when we evaluated the phosphorylation of any of the single serine to alanine mutants of Smad2, little or no increase in total phosphorylation was observed in the presence of activated TβRI. Similar results were also obtained with each of the double and triple mutants of Smad2.Figure 2Mutation of the COOH-terminal serine residues of Smad2 blocks receptor-dependent phosphorylation. A, TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation of wild type and mutant Smad2. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (−) alone or a combination of wild type (WT) or activated (A) TβRI together with wild type (WT) or mutant versions of Smad2 harboring single (upper panel), double (lower panel), or triple (both panels) serine to alanine mutations as indicated. Cells were labeled with [32P]phosphate and FlagSmad2 was purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (32PO4). Expression of FlagSmad2 protein was determined by immunoblotting total cell lysates using anti-Flag M2 antibodies (α-Flag blot).B, phosphopeptide mapping of wild type and mutant Smad2. Tryptic digest products of gel-purified wild type Smad2 and single serine to alanine mutant versions of Smad2, coexpressed with activated TβRI from lanes in A, were resolved in two dimensions by electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer and chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer. The relevant phosphopeptides (arrows) and the location of the sample application (+) are marked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are several explanations as to how mutation of each serine residue might appear to block phosphorylation of Smad2. Individual serine residues may be direct phosphorylation sites, they may be required for efficient phosphorylation at adjacent residues, or they may function in both capacities. Thus, to distinguish these possibilities and to provide a higher level of resolution for these studies, we also performed tryptic phosphopeptide mapping experiments. Wild type or single mutants of Smad2, expressed in COS-1 cells together with activated TβRI, were isolated from [32P]phosphate-labeled cells, digested with trypsin, and then analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography. Phosphorylated wild type Smad2 yielded a distinct phosphopeptide that migrated toward the anode (Fig. 2 B) and corresponded to the COOH-terminal tryptic peptide, as described previously (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the Smad2(S464A) mutant displayed the same pattern as for wild type Smad2, although the relative level of phosphorylation at the COOH-terminal peptide was considerably lower. In contrast, when tryptic maps of the other single mutants, Smad2(S465A) and (S467A), were examined, the characteristic COOH-terminal tryptic phosphopeptide was never observed (Fig. 2 B). Thus, while mutation of any serine in the COOH terminus of Smad2 affects its net phosphorylation in intact cells, only mutations at serines 465 or 467 failed to yield a phosphorylated COOH-terminal tryptic peptide. These observations suggest that the last two COOH-terminal serine residues on Smad2 (Serine residues 465 and 467) may be the target sites for phosphorylation by TβRI. Furthermore, since the pattern of phosphorylation of Smad2(S464A) is similar to wild type, but is present at reduced levels, our observations suggest that serine 464 is not a phosphorylation site, but is required for efficient phosphorylation of Smad2 in intact cells. The low level of phosphorylation observed in intact cells for the Smad2 mutants made it difficult to conclusively demonstrate that serines 465 and 467 were the sites phosphorylated by the receptor. Thus, to show that these are the phosphorylation sites and to gain insights into the mechanism of phosphorylation at these adjacent sites, we employed an in vitro kinase assay utilizing isolated TGF-β receptor complexes and recombinant Smad2 proteins (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Endogenous TGF-β receptors were isolated from Mv1Lu cells incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β, using antibodies directed against TβRII. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to anin vitro kinase assay using bacterially expressed wild type or mutant GST-Smad2 as a substrate. When receptors were isolated in the absence of TGF-β addition, only low levels of Smad2 phosphorylation were observed (Fig. 3 A). However, pretreatment of the cells with TGF-β resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of both wild type and mutant forms of Smad2 (Fig. 3 A). To characterize the sites of phosphorylation, the phosphorylated proteins were then analyzed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Both wild type Smad2 and Smad2(S464A) displayed similar phosphopeptide maps, which consisted of one major phosphopeptide corresponding to the phosphopeptide obtained in vivo and an additional peptide previously identified as a phosphoisomer of the COOH-terminal peptide (Fig. 3 B; Refs. 6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar and 35Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201B: 110-149Crossref Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the data obtained in intact cells and confirm that serine 464 is unlikely to be a phosphorylation site. In contrast to Smad2(S464A), the maps derived from the single mutants S465A and S467A lacked the phosphopeptide observed in vivo(Fig. 3 B). However, both displayed a phosphopeptide that corresponded to the phosphoisomer identified in the wild type maps. Furthermore, this phosphoisomer was also clearly detected in maps derived from either Smad2 (S464/465A) or (S464/467A). In the case of Smad2(S465/467A), neither of the two phosphopeptides were observed (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, although all the phosphoisomers analyzed here have the same charge and migrated similar distances in the electrophoretic dimensions, changes in hydrophobicity obtained upon substitution of serine for alanine in the mutants yielded slight differences in the migration in the second dimension. Together, these mapping data demonstrate that mutation of either serine 465 or 467 prevents the appearance of the more highly phosphorylated tryptic peptide normally observed in intact cells. These results suggest strongly that these two serine residues are the specific sites of phosphorylation by the TGF-β type I receptor kinase. In addition, since a phosphoisomer is detected when either 465 or 467 is mutated, these results further suggest that phosphorylation of one residue is not required for phosphorylation at the second site. Thus phosphorylation of Smad2 by the TGF-β receptor does not occur in an ordered, sequential manner."

Based on work with rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), it has been postulated that members of the GPCR superfamily desensitize via a common mechanism involving the arresting proteins visual arrestin, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (10Gurevich V.V.

However, mainly due to the inherent difficulties of examining the interaction of the components mediating desensitization in their native environment or the need for purified reconstituted systems, this has not been clearly established for many GPCRs. Biochemical studies indicate that arrestins regulate GPCR signal transduction (desensitization) by binding agonist-activated receptors that have been phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (12Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). While the functional source of arrestin molecules targeted to receptors remains unknown, it is apparent that arrestin binding terminates signaling by interdicting receptor interaction with G proteins (12Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To characterize the interaction between β-arrestin and different GPCRs and to assess the contribution of GRKs to this process, we examined using confocal microscopy how a green fluorescent protein/β-arrestin2 conjugate responded to ligand-mediated receptor activation. The results demonstrate a critical role for GRKs in the apparently universal regulation of GPCRs by β-arrestins. Moreover, they provide the first real-time, live-cell demonstration of a GPCR interacting with one of its regulatory proteins and demonstrate a practical role for βarr2-GFP in the study of GPCR activation. Isoproterenol was obtained from Sigma and Research Biochemicals International. Anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Sigma and Molecular Probes. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the 12CA5 epitope was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Cell culture medium was obtained from Mediatech and fetal bovine serum from Atlanta Biologicals.

The βarr2-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 1 A), which is approximately 50% larger than β-arrestin2 and migrates more slowly on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B), still retains its biological activity with respect to facilitating β2AR sequestration (22Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In the absence of supplemental β-arrestins, the β2AR normally sequesters poorly in COS-7 cells (16Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). βarr2-GFP overexpression increases sequestration to the same extent as wild type β-arrestin2. (Fig. 1 C). Confocal microscopy of βarr2-GFP in an HEK-293 cell (Fig.2 A) shows that in the absence of receptor activation β-arrestins are distributed throughout the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus. Moreover, the data demonstrate that β-arrestins are not predominantly compartmentalized at the plasma membrane prior to agonist stimulation. Upon the addition of saturating concentrations of the agonist isoproterenol to the cell medium, an enhancement of plasma membrane fluorescence and a concomitant loss of cytosolic fluorescence (Fig. 2 B) can be readily observed and quantified (Figs. 2, C andD). This observation indicates that β-arrestins are not discretely compartmentalized and that the entire cytoplasmic content represents a functional β-arrestin reservoir. HEK-293 cells overexpressing the β2AR were used to investigate whether the main target of translocated βarr2-GFP was a plasma membrane site other than a GPCR. N-terminal epitope-tagged β2ARs were cross-linked to one another prior to agonist exposure using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the epitope and a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to the fluorophore Texas Red. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the geometry of the agonist-induced time-dependent translocation of βarr2-GFP to the plasma membrane mirrors the distribution of preaggregated β2ARs, strongly suggesting that the primary targeted site of β-arrestin is the β2AR. βarr2-GFP translocation to β2ARs is not limited to HEK-293 cells, but is also observable in COS-7 cells (Fig.4). Consistent with their relatively larger surface area and lower efficiency of β2AR sequestration compared with HEK-293 cells, agonist-mediated βarr2-GFP translocation was less apparent in the COS cells. (Fig. 4, Aand corresponding image C) (16Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, by coexpressing GRK2, the agonist-mediated βarr2-GFP translocation could be enhanced (Fig. 4, B and corresponding image D), suggesting that GRK phosphorylation increases the affinity of the receptor for β-arrestin (22Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of GRK phosphorylation in β-arrestin translocation, we examined the ability of a GRK phosphorylation-impaired mutant Y326A-β2AR to support β-arrestin redistribution (11Gurevich V.V.

Consistent with its inability to be phosphorylated by endogenous GRKs, the Y326A-β2AR mutant did not induce βarr2-GFP translocation with agonist exposure (Fig. 5 A). However, with overexpression of GRK2 and agonist treatment, the Y326A mutant-mediated βarr2-GFP translocation (Fig. 5 B) was indistinguishable from β2AR-mediated translocation (7Tsuga H. Kameyama K.

These results indicate βarr2-GFP translocation not only accurately monitors the biology of the GPCR activation process but the GPCR phosphorylation state as well.Figure 5Influence of overexpressed GRK on redistribution of βarr2-GFP to the Y326A-β2AR in HEK-293 cells. The effect of overexpressed GRK2 on the agonist-mediated interaction between the phosphorylation-impaired Y326A-β2AR and βarr2-GFP in HEK-293 cells is shown. Cells without (A) and with (B) overexpressed GRK2 were exposed to agonist. βarr2-GFP translocation in cells containing overexpressed GRK2 is more robust, as demonstrated (B), indicating an increased affinity of βarr2-GFP for receptor.Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish that agonist-induced βarr2-GFP translocation represents a general property of GPCR activation and is not limited to the β2AR, other members of the GPCR superfamily were evaluated for their ability to mediate the movement of βarr2-GFP in HEK-293 cells. Shown in Fig.6 are results with the dopamine D1A receptor. Its behavior is representative of 16 different GPCRs that were tested belonging to the the angiotensin, α- and β-adrenergic, dopamine, endothelin, intestinal peptide, chemokine, and opioid receptor subfamilies. Activation of the D1A receptor with 20 μm dopamine produced an increase in the amount of membrane-associated βarr2-GFP. Moreover, the increase in βarr2-GFP translocation was enhanced in the presence of overexpressed GRK2 (Fig. 6 D). In this work we demonstrate that β-arrestin interacts with GPCRs immediately following agonist stimulation and GRK phosphorylation. βarr2-GFP translocation was observed in response to more than 15 different GPCRs. Even though these GPCRs respond to a diverse array of ligands and different classes of G proteins, activation of each of the GPCRs elicits the agonist-dependent translocation of βarr2-GFP, with the magnitudes of plasma membrane fluorescence signals ranging up to 10–20-fold above the intracellular background. While β-arrestin behavior is regulated by multiple components of the signal transduction system, it is particularly sensitive to how well cellular GRKs are able to phosphorylate a particular GPCR. This was demonstrated with both GRK2 and GRK5 (data not shown). For instance, following overexpression of GRK2 to force phosphorylation of the Y326A-β2AR mutant, the mutant-mediated βarr2-GFP translocation is indistinguishable from the wild type β2AR-mediated response. Consequently, with the appropriate cellular system, such as COS-7 cells in which endogenous GRKs and β-arrestins are relatively poorly expressed, the β-arrestin translocation paradigm could also be used to easily monitor the activity and specificity of each of the members of the GRK and arrestin families. Biochemical measurements of GPCR properties, such as ligand binding, activation of G proteins or effectors, generation of second messengers, or extent of phosphorylation, assess functions that are receptor-specific and do not easily lend themselves to the development of rapid or convenient screening methods. However, since GPCR activation ultimately terminates with the association of β-arrestin and receptor, a convergent step of the GPCR signal transduction paradigm, the cellular visualization of the agonist-mediated translocation of βarr2-GFP provides a universal measure for detecting the activation of unknown GPCRs. Despite its present large size, the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily continues to expand rapidly as new receptors are discovered through automated sequencing of cDNA libraries. It is estimated that several thousand GPCRs may exist in the human genome, and at present with only a fraction of the genome sequenced, as many as 250 GPCRs have been cloned and only as few as 150 have been associated with ligands (4Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar).2 The means by which these or newly discovered orphan receptors will be associated with their cognate ligands and physiological functions represents a major challenge to biological and biomedical research. The identification of an orphan receptor generally requires an individualized assay and a guess as to its function. The interrogation of a GPCR's signaling behavior by monitoring βarr2-GFP translocation eliminates these prerequisites, since it can be performed with unlabeled ligands and without any prior knowledge of other signaling events. It is sensitive, rapid, easily performed, and should be potentially applicable to nearly all GPCRs, since the majority of these receptors should desensitize by a common mechanism, i.e. interaction with β-arrestins. The visualization of β-arrestin2 translocation represents the first direct real-time assessment in a living cell of the interaction of a GPCR with one of its regulatory components. Moreover, the rapid and profound increases in the relative and absolute amounts of plasma membrane-bound β-arrestin provide an optical detection of GPCR signal transduction that is as sensitive as any chemical amplification normally produced by second messenger cascades. Therefore, βarr2-GFP is not only exquisitely adept as a biosensor for monitoring GPCR activation, but represents an excellent tool to study the kinetics and specificity of components involved in the regulation of GPCR activity. Furthermore, when used as an optical sensor, βarr2-GFP provides the unique potential to unite orphan GPCRs with their corresponding ligands."

We report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human cDNA encoding TRAM-1, athyroid hormone receptor activatormolecule, a ∼160-kDa protein homologous with SRC-1/TIF2, by far-Western-based expression screening. TRAM-1 binds to thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and other NRs in a ligand-dependent manner and enhances ligand-induced transcriptional activity of TR. The AF-2 region in NRs has been thought to play a critical role in mediating ligand-dependent transactivation by the interaction with coactivators. Surprisingly, TRAM-1 retains strong ligand-dependent interaction with an AF-2 mutant of TR (E457A), while SRC-1 fails to interact with this mutant. Furthermore, we identified a critical TRAM-1 binding site in rat TRβ1 outside of AF-2, as TRAM-1 shows weak ligand-dependent interaction with a helix 3 ligand binding domain TR mutant (K288A), compared with SRC-1. These results suggest that TRAM-1 is a coactivator that may exhibit its activity by interacting with subdomains of NRs other than the AF-2 region, in contrast to SRC-1/TIF2.

The liganded NRs bind to their cognate response elements, located in the promoter regions of target genes, and stimulate transcription by the interaction with coactivators. Functional analysis of NRs has shown that there are two major activation domains. The N-terminal domain (AF-1) contains a ligand-independent activation function, whereas the extreme C-terminal region of the ligand binding domain (AF-2) exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation (1Lees J.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The AF-2 region is conserved among NRs, and deletion or point mutations in this region impair transcriptional activation without changing ligand and DNA binding affinities (2Danielian P.S. White R.

Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the ligand binding domain of NRs revealed that the ligand induces a major conformational change in the AF-2 region (5Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P.

Using bacterially expressed thyroid hormone receptor (TR) as a probe, a cDNA expression library was screened, and a novel cDNA encoding TRAM-1, a putative thyroid hormone receptoractivator molecule, was isolated. TRAM-1 belongs to a nuclear receptor coactivator (NCoA) gene family that includes SRC-1 and TIF2. TRAM-1 exhibits ligand-dependent, and unexpectedly, AF-2-independent interaction with TR, a biochemical feature distinct from SRC-1/TIF2. Our findings suggest that TRAM-1 may serve a novel pathway for transcriptional activation of NRs by interacting with subdomains other than the AF-2 region. GST-rat TRβ1 (wild type), GST-rat TRβ1 mutant (E457A), GST-mouse retinoid X receptor β (RXRβ), GST-human retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ), and GST-human estrogen receptor (ER) plasmids were described previously (10Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Human p/CAF in pCX (Dr. Y. Nakatani, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was subcloned into pBK-CMV (Stratagene), and mouse CBP (residues 1626–2260) was subcloned in pSKII (Dr. M. Montminy, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Two fragments of TRAM-1, residues 577–800 or 800–1215, were fused to a GST plasmid (15Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) by insertingBamHI/XbaI- andXbaI/SacI-digested fragments of TRAM-1(PIT) cDNA in pBluescript (Stratagene) to generate GST-TRAM-1A-(577–800) and GST-TRAM-1B-(800–1215), respectively. GST-SRC-1A-(595–780) was constructed by inserting a PCR-generated fragment of F-SRC-1 (residues 595–780) (10Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) into the GST plasmid. Expression vectors for rat TRβ1 and its mutants (E457A and K288A) and mouse RXRβ1 were based in pcDNA/AMP (Invitrogen). E457A was created by PCR amplification using primers containing the codon 457 mutation and restriction enzyme sites at both ends. K288A was created using an in vitromutagenesis kit (Promega). F-SRC-1 in pBluescript was subcloned into pcDNA/AMP. N-TRAM-1 in pBK-CMV was created by restriction digestion of full-length TRAM-1 in pBK-CMV by XbaI, followed by self-ligation. C-TRAM-1 in pBK-CMV was created by subcloning of theXbaI-digested fragment into pBK-CMV in the proper orientation. The luciferase (LUC) reporter constructs, the chick lysozyme thyroid hormone response element (TRE), F2-thymidine kinase (TK)-LUC in PT109, and artificial direct repeat TRE, DR4-TK-LUC in PT109, were described previously (16Yen P.M. Liu Y. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The expression cDNA library screen by far-Western blotting was performed as described previously (10Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Human pituitary (Stratagene) and 293 kidney embryonic cell libraries (Dr. J. A. DeCaprio, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) in λZAPII were screened using 105 cpm/ml of32P-labeled ligand binding domain (LBD) of rat TRβ1 in the presence of 1 μm T3. The remaining 5′-end sequence was cloned by PCR amplification from the human pituitary library with the pBS-specific sense primer, 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACG-3′, and the cDNA-specific antisense primer of the original clone obtained by far-Western screening, 5′-AAACACTTGTGTTAACCAGGTCCTCTTGCT-3′. A full-length cDNA (TRAM-1) was reconstructed in pBK-CMV from overlapping TRAM-1 clones. Nucleotide sequences of positive clones were determined using an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer. Northern blot analysis was performed using human multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNAs (2 μg per lane;CLONTECH), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The random primed 32P-labeled DNA probes used were nucleotides 1153–2213 of TRAM-1 and nucleotides 1274–1896 of F-SRC-1. Full-length and fragments of TRAM-1 in pBK-CMV, and TR and RXR in pcDNA/AMP, were transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with 35S-methionine according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The GST-fusion protein pull-down assay was performed as described previously (10Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Deoxyribonucleotides containing F2 or DR4 TRE (16Yen P.M. Liu Y. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unlabeled in vitro translated receptor proteins, 20 ng of GST-fusion proteins, and a 50,000-cpm oligonucleotide probe were mixed and incubated together before being subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method in 6-well plates with 1.7 μg of reporter plasmid containing the F2 or DR4 TRE, fused to TK-LUC cDNA; 20 ng of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-β-galactosidase plasmid as a internal control; 100 ng of TRβ1; and various amounts of TRAM-1 or F-SRC-1 expression plasmids as detailed in the legend of Fig. 2. Empty expression vectors were added to equalize total transfected plasmid DNA concentrations. Cells were grown for 24 h in the absence or presence of 10−7m T3 in serum-free media and harvested. Cell extracts were then analyzed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities to correct for transfection efficiency. The corrected luciferase activities of untreated samples were normalized to the luciferase activities of samples containing the vector alone in the absence of the ligand (1-fold basal). The results shown are the mean ± S.D. (n = 3). To identify TRAMs, we employed a far-Western approach previously used to clone a full-length version of human SRC-1 (F-SRC-1) cDNA (10Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We screened cDNA expression libraries with a 32P-labeled probe containing the LBD of rat TRβ1 in the presence of T3. Two positive clones, termed TRAM-1(293) and TRAM-1(PIT), from a 293 cell line and a human pituitary library, respectively, were identified. The nucleotide sequences of the coding regions and 3′-ends of these two clones were determined and found to be overlapping. TRAM-1(293) cDNA is ∼6 kb in length, contains a poly(A) signal, and encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of 913 amino acids (aa), whereas TRAM-1(PIT) cDNA contains an ORF of 848 aa. The remaining 5′-sequence of TRAM-1 mRNA was cloned using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. A full-length version of the cDNA, designated as TRAM-1 cDNA, consists of a protein coding region of 4272 base pairs flanked by 191 base pairs of 5′-untranslated and ∼3.5 kb of 3′-untranslated regions with a poly(A) tail. The ORF of TRAM-1 cDNA encodes 1424 aa with a calculated molecular mass size of TRAM-1 of 155.3 kDa. In TRAM-1(293) cDNA, the region corresponding to aa 904–918 was missing, probably due to alternative splicing. Comparison of these sequences with those in the GenBank showed that TRAM-1 shares homology with SRC-1 (Fig. 1 A) and TIF2 sequences (33.2 and 42.2% identity, respectively). Thus, TRAM-1 belongs to the 160-kDa protein subset of the NCoA gene family, which has a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS domain in the N-terminal, a nuclear receptor binding domain in the central, and a glutamine (Q) rich sequence in the C-terminal regions (Fig. 1 C).Figure 1Features of TRAM-1. A, amino acid sequence comparison of TRAM-1 and F-SRC-1. Amino acids are denoted by the single letter amino acid code. An alignment of TRAM-1 and F-SRC-1 (10Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was performed using Genestream Search (http://genome.eerie.fr). Sequence alignment is shown with amino acid identity (:), and conservative substitution (·) is indicated in the line between the two sequences. The two primary cDNAs encoding TRAM-1(293) and TRAM-1(PIT) start at amino acid residues 497 and 577, respectively (boldface). The alternative splicing region of TRAM-1 (aa 904–918) is underlined. Interaction consensus motifs (LXXLL) in TRAM-1 (aa 621–625, 685–689, 738–742, and 1057–1061) and F-SRC-1 (aa 633–637, 690–694, 749–753, and 1434–1437) are indicated by bold letters. B, multiple human tissue Northern blot analysis using TRAM-1 (top panel) and SRC-1 (bottom panel). Top panel, TRAM-1 shows a major ∼9-kb transcript with a minor ∼5.5-kb mRNA (arrows). Bottom panel, SRC-1 shows a major ∼8.5-kb transcript with a minor ∼7-kb mRNA (arrows).C, schematic diagram of comparison of TRAM-1 with p/CIP. The poly Q region of TRAM-1 is located at the C terminus, compared with that of p/CIP. The C-terminal tail sequence of TRAM-1 bears no homology with that of p/CIP. D, nucleotide and deduced amino acid comparison between the C-terminal tails of TRAM-1 and p/CIP. TRAM-1 is highly conserved with p/CIP until amino acid residue 1321. One nucleotide deletion of p/CIP at codons 1296–1297 (TAG) results in a protein sequence again homologous with TRAM-1, shown byshaded box.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNAs from human tissues (Fig. 1 B) indicated that the major TRAM-1 mRNA is ∼9 kb; a minor species (∼5.5 kb) is also seen in several tissues. Although TRAM-1 is ubiquitously expressed, the expression pattern of TRAM-1 (top panel) is different from that of SRC-1 (bottom panel). TRAM-1 is highly expressed in placenta, whereas SRC-1 is most abundant in brain. This result suggests that the expression of TRAM-1 and SRC-1 may be differentially regulated and thus may play specific roles in NR-mediated gene expression in different target tissues. To investigate the coactivator activity of TRAM-1, cotransfection studies in CV-1 cells were performed with TR and TRAM-1 as well as SRC-1 expression plasmids and reporter plasmids containing F2 or DR4 TRE. As shown in Fig. 2, cotransfection of TRAM-1 enhances T3-mediated transactivation on both F2 and DR4 TREs, similar to SRC-1, although TRAM-1 seems to increase basal activity as well. Thus, TRAM-1 has coactivator activity for TR function. While our work was in progress, Torchia et al. (17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) reported a mouse cDNA clone, p/CIP, encoding a 152-kDa coactivator protein. The amino acid sequence of TRAM-1 has 74.2% identity with that of p/CIP. Therefore, TRAM-1 may be a human homolog of p/CIP. Of note, there are two major differences as illustrated in Fig. 1 C. One is the different position of the poly Q region. The poly Q stretch of TRAM-1 is located ∼300 aa downstream of a comparable region in p/CIP. The other difference exists at the C terminus. There is no significant homology between TRAM-1 and p/CIP in the ∼100 aa of C-terminal tail, despite shared homology of TRAM-1 and SRC-1/TIF2 in this region. Comparison of TRAM-1 and p/CIP DNA sequences revealed that a single nucleotide insertion present in p/CIP cDNA at codons 1296–1297 causes a putative frameshift, as nucleotide deletion of this codon in p/CIP results in an alternate coding sequence that shows 80.4% identity with that of TRAM-1 (Fig. 1 D). In cotransfection experiments, p/CIP has not shown any significant coactivator function (17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), whereas TRAM-1 has such activity. Thus, the apparent functional differences between TRAM-1 and p/CIP may be due to different C-terminal tails, although a sequencing error of p/CIP cannot be ruled out. Binding of TRAM-1 to NRs was tested using GST-fusion proteins. As shown in Fig.3 A, in vitrotranslation of TRAM-1 mRNA generated a major full-length35S-labeled product (∼160 kDa) (lane 1). In the presence of cognate ligands, 35S-labeled TRAM-1 protein showed increased binding with GST-TR (lanes 2 and3), GST-ER (lanes 4 and 5), GST-RAR (lanes 6 and 7), and GST-RXR (lanes 8and 9) fusion proteins. Thus, TRAM-1 can interact with several members of NRs in a ligand-dependent manner. Recently, a consensus interaction motif, an helical leucine-charged residue-rich domain (LXXLL), was identified in a number of coactivators such as SRC-1, TIF2, RIP140, TIF1, and CBP/p300 (14Thénot S. Henriquet C. Rochefort H. Cavaillès V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar,18Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Since TRAM-1 contains three such motifs in the central region between aa 621–742 (region A), and another at aa 1052–1060 (region B), we generated N-terminal and C-terminal halves of TRAM-1 as in vitro translated proteins, termed N-TRAM-1 (aa1-780; containing region A) and C-TRAM-1 (aa 877-1424; containing region B), and studied their interaction with TR and its AF-2 mutant, E457A (Fig.3 B). Both N-TRAM-1 and C-TRAM-1 showed ligand-dependent interaction with GST-TR (lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8), indicating that there are multiple nuclear receptor interaction sites, probably via LXXLL motifs in these region. Surprisingly, while C-TRAM-1 failed to show ligand-dependent interaction with GST-E457A (lanes 9and 10), N-TRAM-1 retains this function (lanes 4 and 5) similar to wild type. This result suggests that region A may mediate ligand-dependent, but AF-2 independent, interactions with TR. Next, we generated GST-TRAM-1A (aa 577–800) and GST-TRAM-1B (aa 800–1215) fusion proteins, which contain regions A and B, respectively, and tested their interactions with in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled TR and RXR. As shown in Fig.3 C, TR showed ligand-dependent interaction with TRAM-1A (lanes 2 and 3) and little or no ligand-dependent interaction with TRAM-1B (lanes 4 and 5). RXR showed ligand-dependent interaction with TRAM-1A (lanes 7 and 8) but not TRAM-1B (lanes 9 and 10). This result confirms the recent reports that the function of an LXXLL motif also depends on other sequences (17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 18Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Region A, which contains three LXXLL motifs, is highly conserved among members of the NCoA (SRC-1, TIF2, p/CIP, and TRAM-1) gene family. On the other hand, the LXXLL motif in region B is not present in SRC-1, TIF2, and p/CIP. A transfection study using an SRC-1 mutated in the LXXLL motif in region A has shown that the mutant fails to enhance ligand-induced RAR- or ER-mediated transactivation (17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 18Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Therefore, region A of TRAM-1 may play a more important role for ligand-dependent interaction with NRs than region B. In pull-down experiments, region A also displayed ligand-dependent interaction with the AF-2 mutant, E457A. To compare the interaction properties between TRAM-1 and SRC-1 with TR and its mutants, we generated a GST-SRC-1A fusion protein (aa 595–780) containing a homologous region of GST-TRAM-1A, and we used GST-TRAM-1A and GST-SRC-1A for EMSA. As shown in Fig.4 A, wild-type TR forms homodimers (lane 1) and heterodimers with RXR (lane 7) on an inverted palindrome TRE, F2. Addition of T3decreased homodimer formation (lane 2) as noted previously (19Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Forgione M. Umeda P.K. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

Incubation of TR and TR/RXR with GST-SRC-1A produced a ligand-dependent TR/SRC-1A (lane 4) and TR/RXR/SRC-1A (lane 10) complex, respectively. Similarly, GST-TRAM-1A showed ligand-dependent interaction with TR (lane 6) and TR/RXR (lane 12). The mobilities of TR/RXR/SRC-1A and TR/RXR/TRAM-1A were slightly less than those of TR/SRC-1A and TR/TRAM-1A, respectively. In addition, a RXR antibody could supershift TR/RXR/SRC-1A and TR/RXR/TRAM-1A complexes (data not shown), indicating that both SRC-1 and TRAM-1 can form a ligand-induced complex with TR/RXR heterodimer on F2 TRE. Interestingly, GST-TRAM-1B did not show any interaction with TR or TR/RXR on EMSA (data not shown), consistent with region A being more important for ligand-dependent interaction with NRs than region B. Next, we compared the interaction of an AF-2 mutant of TR, E457A, with TRAM-1 and SRC-1. As shown in Fig. 4 B, E457A showed similar properties of homo- and heterodimers formation as wild-type TR. While SRC-1A fails to show ligand-dependent interaction with E457A (lane 4) and E457A/RXR (lane 10), TRAM-1A still exhibits strong ligand-dependent interaction with E457A (lane 6) and E457A/RXR (lane 12). We speculated that TRAM-1 may interact with subdomains of NRs other than AF-2, in contrast to SRC-1. Previously, O'Donnell and Koenig (20O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that TRβ1 point mutants of aa 288–300 (helix 3 region in the LBD of TR), which are conserved among NRs, have impaired transcriptional activation without altered ligand and DNA binding, similar to AF-2 mutants. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the AF-2 region comes into close contact with the helix 3 region after ligand binding (5Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 6Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In EMSA (Fig. 4 C), K288A also showed similar properties of homo- and heterodimers formation as wild-type TR. Interestingly, TRAM-1A shows negligible ligand-dependent interaction with K288A and K288A/RXR, compared with SRC-1. Similar results were obtained when we used the direct repeat TRE DR4 (data not shown). These EMSA studies indicate that although both TRAM-1 and SRC-1 interact with liganded TR, SRC-1 may preferentially bind to the AF-2 region; on the other hand, TRAM-1 may preferentially bind to helix 3 in the LBD of TR. The C-terminal region of CBP has been reported to interact with SRC-1 (9Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). In addition, the progesterone receptor has been shown to interact directly with P/CAF (22Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether CBP or P/CAF interacts with TRAM-1. As shown in Fig.5, both CBP (aa 1626–2260) and P/CAF were significantly retained on GST-TRAM-1B compared with GST-TRAM-1A. This observation suggests that TR, TRAM-1, CBP/p300, and P/CAF can potentially form a ligand-dependent complex to mediate ligand-induced transactivation. In summary, we have isolated cDNA, encoding a putative thyroid hormone receptor coactivator TRAM-1. TRAM-1 belongs to a 160-kDa NCoA family that includes SRC-1 and TIF2. However, TRAM-1 exhibits expression and interaction properties distinct from SRC-1. As such, TRAM-1 may be another component of a TR coactivator complex critical for TR action. We thank Dr. J. A. DeCaprio for the 293 cell library, Dr. M. Montminy for the CBP plasmid, and Dr. Y. Nakatani for the P/CAF plasmid. We also appreciate helpful suggestions by Drs. P. Yen and A. Hollenberg.

A tail-deletion mutant was found to present two preferred views of phage heads: views along the axis through the capsid vertex where the connector protein resides and via which DNA is packaged; and side views perpendicular to this axis. The resulting images reveal striking patterns of concentric rings in axial views, and punctate arrays in side views. As corroborated by computer modeling, these data establish that the T7 chromosome is spooled around this axis in approximately six coaxial shells in a quasi-crystalline packing, possibly guided by the core complex on the inner surface of the connector."

Prion diseases comprise a group of transmissible neurodegenerative disorders. The best known animal forms of the disease are scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy; the human versions include kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia (1Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Prusiner S.B. Trends Biochem.

Gambetti P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 181-187Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). All of these disorders are characterized by cerebral accumulation of an abnormal protein, designated PrPres, which has a strong tendency to aggregate into insoluble fibrils. According to the “protein only hypothesis” (5Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 6Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), PrPres constitutes the sole component of the infectious pathogen responsible for the transmission of prion disease. PrPres is derived from a host-encoded glycoprotein, the prion protein (PrP). 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; huPrP(90–231), human prion protein domain 90–231; bis-ANS, 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid. The transition between the cellular form of PrP, designated PrPC, and PrPres occurs by a post-translational mechanism and appears to take place without any detectable covalent modifications to the protein molecule (7Stahl N.

One of the main characteristics distinguishing PrPC from PrPresis the resistance of the latter to proteolytic digestion (8Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B.

Furthermore, recent spectroscopic studies indicate that the two isoforms have profoundly different conformation: while the secondary structure of PrPC consists largely of α-helices (10Pan K.M.

In line with these observations, the current view is that prion diseases may be classified as disorders resulting from abnormal protein folding and that the key event in the pathogenic process is the transition between the “benign” conformation of PrPCand the “pathological” conformation of PrPres. It is believed that the propagation of the disease can be described according to nucleation-dependent polymerization and/or template-assisted models (6Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 14Gajdusek D.C. J. Neuroimmunol. 1988; 20: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Jarrett J.T.

However, the molecular mechanism and potential intermediate forms of PrP underlying the conformational transition between the normal and pathogenic isoforms of the protein remain unknown. Recent studies have provided an insight into the three-dimensional structure of the recombinant mouse prion protein fragment 121–231 (18Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 614-619Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar,19Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). However, bacterial expression of larger PrP fragments proved to be more difficult, resulting in an aggregated protein that could only be solubilized using refolding procedures (20Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Stockel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M. Fletterick R. Cohen F.E. Vandlen R. Henner D. Prusiner S.B.

In the present study, we have developed an expression system that produces soluble protein corresponding to human prion protein domain encompassing residues 90–231 (huPrP(90–231)). Spectroscopic data show that the stability and conformation of the protein are strongly pH-dependent and suggest that conditions of acidic pH may be conducive to the transition between the conformational states characteristic of PrPC and PrPres. The DNA sequence corresponding to the huPrP(90–231) (Met129 variant) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a clone containing the coding region (22Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Ulrig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CAGCTGGAGAGGAATTCTCAGCTCGATCCT-3′ and 5′-CATGGTGGTGGATCCGGGTCAAGGAGG-3′. The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and BamHI (sites indicated in bold in the primer sequences) and cloned into the pET22b(+) vector (Novagen). The cloned protein contained the vector sequence MDIGINSDP fused to the N terminus of the huPrP(90–231). The final construct was confirmed by sequencing the coding region using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Corp.) and transformed into an Escherichia coliexpression strain, B834(DE3) (Novagen). DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A midlog phase liquid culture of B834(DE3) cells in 2 × YT medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin was diluted 9-fold with a fresh medium (to a total volume of 2 liters) and grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached a value of approximately 2. At that time, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cultures were grown for an additional hour. Cells from four liters of medium were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in 200 ml of buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). After removal of cellular debris, the nucleic acids and some acidic proteins were removed by batch-mode chromatography (in buffer A), using DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) followed by QA resin (Sigma) (in each step, about 2 g of preequilibrated resin was used to treat material recovered from a 4-liter cell culture). The protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and purified by cation-exchange chromatography on a prepacked 5-ml FPLC SP HiTrap column (Pharmacia). About 100 ml of crude material was loaded on the column, and the protein was eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.2 m) and a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting; those containing huPrP(90–231) (between approximately 5 and 50 ml of gradient volume) were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and concentrated to a volume of approximately 6 ml. After this step, the huPrP(90–231) preparation was 80–85% pure. Final purification of the protein was accomplished by size-exclusion chromatography on a 1.6 × 60-cm HiLoad Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia). Two ml of a concentrated material was applied on the column (preequilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7), and the protein was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein was finally dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, concentrated to 1 mg/ml and stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. To study the unfolding of huPrP(90–231) in GdnHCl, native protein was diluted (to a final concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/ml) in a 50 mm buffer (sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 or sodium acetate at pH 5 and below) containing different concentrations of GdnHCl. Samples were incubated for 24 h at room temperature, and the ellipticity at 222 nm was measured in a 1-mm cell by averaging the signal over 2 min. The denaturation curves were analyzed according to the two- or three-state protein unfolding models (24Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 25Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Full far-UV CD spectra of huPrP(90–231) in the presence of 1 mGdnHCl were obtained in a 0.2-mm cell at a protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. All CD measurements were carried out at room temperature on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. Protein concentration was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 20,800m−1 cm−1, as calculated based on the extinction coefficients of aromatic residues (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Protein from a stock solution was diluted to a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8 and 8.0, or phosphate-citric acid, pH 7–2.6, buffers containing 8 μm bis-ANS (Molecular Probes). After 1-h incubation in the dark, fluorescence of bis-ANS was measured on an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 395 and 495 nm, respectively. To minimize photobleaching of the dye, the excitation slit was set at 1 nm. In this study, we developed an efficient system for expression of soluble recombinant human prion protein 90–231. The protein was secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli. A simple chromatographic procedure yielded a homogenous protein of a purity greater than 98% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The identity of huPrP(90–231) was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1), mass spectroscopy, and N-terminal sequencing. The CD spectrum of the native protein at neutral pH (Fig. 2) exhibits a double minimum at 208 and 222 nm (with a mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm of −10,000 degree cm2 dmol−1) typical of highly α-helical proteins (27Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum characteristic of α-helical structure was preserved through the entire pH range between 7.2 and 2.6. However, at pH 2.6 there was a decrease in the ratio of the ellipticity at 222 nm to that at 208 nm, likely indicating a small rearrangement and/or loss of α-helical structure. Equilibrium unfolding of huPrP(90–231) in GdnHCl was monitored by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of denaturant concentration. As shown in Fig. 3, at pH 7.2 the protein undergoes a highly cooperative, two-state transition characterized by a midpoint unfolding GdnHCl concentration (C m) of 2.2 m and a free energy difference between the native and unfolded state (ΔG 0) of 19 kJ/M. A two-state transition unfolding of huPrP(90–231) was also apparent at pH 5.0; however, at this pH, ΔG 0 and C mwere reduced to 10 kJ/M and 1.5 m, respectively. A different protein unfolding pattern was observed at pH below 5. Representative unfolding curves at low pH (4.0 and 3.6) show two distinctive transition regions and clearly indicate the presence of a relatively stable folding intermediate state (Fig. 3). The unfolding curve at pH 3.6 could be successfully approximated by a three-state transition model (25Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), yielding for the first transition ΔG 0 and C m of 13 kJ/M and 0.5 m, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters for the second transition are ΔG 0 of 21 kJ/M andC m of 2.4 m. To gain insight into the conformational properties of huPrP(90–231) under conditions corresponding to the presence of a stable folding intermediate, we measured the far-UV CD spectra of the protein at various pH values in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl. In the pH range between 7.2 and 5, the spectra in 1 m denaturant are essentially indistinguishable from those in the absence of GdnHCl and indicate a largely α-helical structure of the protein. These spectra drastically differ from those obtained in the presence of 1m GdnHCl at pH 4 and 3.6, i.e. under conditions leading to the formation of a stable folding intermediate of huPrP(90–231). In the latter spectra (Fig.4), the double minimum at 222 and 208 nm is replaced by a single minimum at approximately 215 nm, a feature characteristic of proteins rich in β-sheet structure (27Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). It should be noted that at a protein concentration equivalent to that used in CD measurements, the elution pattern of the folding intermediate on a size exclusion column (Superose 6) is indistinguishable from that of native huPrP(90–231), indicating, in either case, a monomeric state of the protein (data not shown for brevity). The fluorescence of bis-ANS is strongly dependent on the polarity of the environment: it is very weak in water and increases greatly upon binding to hydrophobic sites of proteins. This compound has been widely used to probe conformational changes in proteins as well as to assess the exposure of hydrophobic patches on the protein surface (28Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Das K.P. Petrasch J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, there is very little fluorescence of bis-ANS in the presence of huPrP(90–231) in the pH range between 9 and 6. However, further decrease in pH results in a dramatic (about 30-fold) enhancement of the fluorescence intensity, which reaches maximum at around pH 4.4. Since the fluorescence of bis-ANS alone is pH-independent, the acid-induced fluorescence enhancement in the presence of huPrP(90–231) thus reflects binding of the probe to the protein as a result of an increased exposure of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the protein molecule. The apparent pK of this conformational transition in huPrP(90–231) is about 5.1. The key molecular event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases appears to be a conformational change in PrP, resulting in the conversion of a large portion of the protein molecule from an α-helical conformation to a β-sheet-rich, protease-resistant structure (1Prusiner S.B.

Recent structural studies of the C-terminal domain (residues 121–231) of mouse PrP have revealed that this part of the protein forms an autonomous folding unit, consisting of three α-helices and two short β-strands (18Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 614-619Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). However, very little information is currently available regarding the molecular basis of the conformational transition(s) that predispose conversion of PrPC to PrPres. In addition, little is known about the role of the N-terminal portion in the folding of different PrP isoforms. To address these issues, we developed a bacterial expression system that allowed us to obtain a recombinant protein corresponding to human PrP domain 90–231. This region of PrP appears to be of special functional importance, since it encompasses the entire sequence of protease-resistant protein found in prion diseased brain, contains all known point mutations associated with human prion disorders, and is sufficient for the propagation of the disease (1Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Prusiner S.B. Trends Biochem.

Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 614-619Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) indicates that the percentage of α-helical structure in the longer protein is reduced (mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, Θ222, of −15,600 and −12,000 degree cm2 dmol−1 for mouse PrP(121–231) and huPrP(90–231), respectively). However, the Θ222 values for both proteins became remarkably similar when the data for huPrP(90–231) were normalized assuming that the N-terminal fragment 90–120 does not contribute to the ellipticity at 222 nm. This observation, together with apparently similar thermodynamic stability of mouse PrP(121–231) and huPrP(90–231) (ΔG 0 for GdnHCl unfolding at pH 7 of 21.8 and 20 kJ/M, respectively), strongly supports the recent prediction that the C-terminal domain comprising residues 121–231 constitutes the only polypeptide segment within PrP with a global fold and ordered structure (30Billeter M. Riek R. Wider G. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7281-7285Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and argues against the model postulating a fourth α-helix between residues 109 and 122 (31Huang Z. Gabriel J.M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The lack of ordered structure in the N-terminal portion of huPrP(90–231) is also indicated by the fluorescence properties of the sole tryptophan residue at position 99. 2W. Swietnicki, R. Petersen, P. Gambetti, and W. K. Surewicz, unpublished data. While generally consistent with structural data available for the shorter polypeptide corresponding to mouse PrP(121–231), the properties of huPrP(90–231) appear to differ in some respects (e.g. GdnHCl denaturation curves at pH 5) from those reported for the recombinant protein corresponding to Syrian hamster PrP(90–231) (21Zhang H. Stockel J. Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3543-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these discrepancies reflect species-specific differences in the primary structure of PrP. However, it should also be noted that the polypeptide corresponding to hamster PrP was expressed as an insoluble (presumably misfolded) protein aggregate; its purification involved chromatography in an organic solvent, followed by a refolding step from a concentrated solution of GdnHCl (20Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Stockel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M. Fletterick R. Cohen F.E. Vandlen R. Henner D. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Zhang H. Stockel J. Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3543-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This treatment may result in a structure that does not represent the native conformation of PrP. Our expression system produces a secreted protein that is soluble, hence not requiring any refolding treatment. The availability of a soluble recombinant protein corresponding to a major portion of human prion protein allows studies on the pathway of PrP folding and the nature of protein folding intermediates that are likely to precede formation of PrPres from PrPC(32Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Safar J. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 207-214Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The key finding of the present study is that the conformational properties of huPrP(90–231) are strongly pH-dependent. One manifestation of this pH-dependent behavior is the conformational transition at pH between 6 and 4.4. This transition involves a massive increase in the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, without affecting the overall secondary structure of huPrP(90–231). Furthermore, acidic pH induces a profound change in the unfolding pathway of the protein. Thus, in the pH range 5–7, the denaturation of huPrP(90–231) in GdnHCl occurs as a simple two-state transition typical for many small globular proteins. In contrast, the unfolding curves at lower pH values indicate a three-state transition, with the presence of protein folding intermediate. This intermediate appears to have a remarkably high thermodynamic stability; the free energy of its unfolding in GdnHCl is at least as high as that of the native protein at pH 7.2. Most importantly, while the secondary structure of the native huPrP(90–231) is largely α-helical, spectroscopic properties of the intermediate state are characteristic of a protein rich in β-sheet structure. It should be emphasized that the folding intermediate described above is soluble and thus unlikely to represent the infectious species (although infectivity has not been tested in the present study). However, the finding that the recombinant huPrP(90–231) can exist in two stable monomeric forms that, depending on environmental conditions, have markedly different secondary structures has important implications for understanding the pathway involved in the PrPC → PrPres conversion. In this context, we postulate that the properties of the intermediate state (surface-exposed hydrophobic patches, β-sheet-rich structure) render this conformer as a good candidate for the prototype of a soluble PrP folding intermediate that may immediately precede the formation of an insoluble PrPres aggregate. In the present in vitroexperiments, the transition to an intermediate state was promoted by acidic conditions. This is of potential significance, since the conversion of PrPC to PrPres appears to take place, at least in part, along the endocytic pathway which contains acidic compartments (34Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-65603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, one can envisage that underin vivo conditions the formation of a PrP folding intermediate similar to that found in this study may also be facilitated by other factors (e.g. interaction with auxiliary proteins (36Yehiely F. Bamborough P. Da Costa M. Perry B.J. Thinakaran G. Cohen F.E. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 339-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the properties of the protein may be affected by the mutations specific to hereditary forms of prion disease (4Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 181-187Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The ability to produce large quantities of soluble PrP in a bacterial expression system provides a basis for studying the effect of these pathogenic mutations on both the folding pathway and conformational stability of PrP."

The immunophilins are proteins that bind the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A (CsA), 1The abbreviations used are: CsA, cyclosporin A; FKBP, FK506 binding protein; CN, calcineurin; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; aa, amino acid(s); NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; PKA, protein kinase A; AKAP, A-kinase-anchoring protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. FK506, and rapamycin with high affinity and are responsible for their therapeutic actions (for review, see Refs. 1Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar and 2Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A, a cyclic undecapeptide, binds to members of the cyclophilin family, whereas the structurally unrelated FK506 and rapamycin bind to the family of FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs). Although the cyclophilins and FKBPs lack amino acid sequence homology, both classes of proteins display peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, which is inhibited by their respective immunosuppressant ligands. However, inhibition of this rotamase activity does not explain immunosuppression, as some potent ligands of the immunophilins inhibit rotamase activity but lack immunosuppressant effects (3Bierer B.E. Somers P.K. Wandless T.J. Burakoff S.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1990; 250: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Immunosuppression appears to stem from the binding of the drug-immunophilin complex to the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CN) to inhibit catalytic activity resulting in an accumulation of phosphorylated CN substrates (4Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). One of these substrates, the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) in its unphosphorylated state passes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to stimulate interleukin-2 formation. Following treatment with immunosuppressant drugs, phosphorylated levels of NFAT accumulate in the cytoplasm and are unable to enter the nucleus with the associated decrease in interleukin-2 formation being involved in immunosuppressant actions (5O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 6Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Whereas pharmacologic actions of immunosuppressant drugs are readily explained by the above model, the physiologic roles of the immunophilins remain obscure despite the fact that they are among the most abundant and conserved proteins in biology. A few proteins, such as collagen and transferrin, have been shown to serve as substrates for immunophilin rotamase activity (7Steinmann B. Bruckner P. Supertifurga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1299-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14835-14838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether these are the sole or principal physiologic substrates for the rotamase activity of these proteins. Moreover, it is possible that the immunophilins bind to and regulate intracellular proteins without altering their tertiary structure by rotamase influences. Recently physiologic interactions of FKBP12 have been demonstrated with the two major intracellular calcium channels, the ryanodine receptor and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (9Jayaraman T.

In both instances FKBP12 is tightly associated with the channel and appears to be a physiologic subunit of the channel protein complex. Dissociating FKBP12 from either channel perturbs the physiologic calcium flux of the channel (10Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated a ternary complex between IP3R, FKBP12, and CN (13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Within the complex, CN dephosphorylates IP3R especially when it has been phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The cycle of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of IP3R in this complex appears to modulate the calcium flux of the channel. Thus, in this instance FKBP12 appears to anchor calcineurin to IP3R with regulation of IP3R function determined by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and possibly not via a rotamase effect of FKBP12 upon IP3R. Evidence that rotamase activity of FKBP12 is not crucial to influences upon calcium channel function comes from studies by Fleischer and associates (14Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) showing that FKBP12 mutants that lack rotamase activity nonetheless bind to the ryanodine receptor and influence its calcium flux. Mechanisms whereby FKBP12, IP3R, and CN interact have not been established. Because FK506 displaces IP3R from FKBP12, we speculated that IP3R functions as an “endogenous FK506,” binding to FKBP12 at the same site as FK506. Although it is a small organic molecule, FK506 serves as “molecular glue” enabling a CN-FKBP12 interaction, which does not occur in the absence of the drug ligand. Specific surface residues of FKBP12 have been identified that participate in the CN interaction once they are activated by FK506 binding (15Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18935-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to our model an FK506 look-alike portion of IP3R would bind FKBP12 and thereby enable it to interact with CN. Alternatively, CN might associate with IP3R at a site distant from the binding of FKBP12 with interactions regulating calcium flux mediated by allosteric influences. Understanding the exact sites where IP3R binds FKBP12 and CN might clarify how FKBP12 functions in cells physiologically in the absence of drugs such as FK506. In the present study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the site in IP3R that binds FKBP12 and localized this to a specific leucyl-proline dipeptide that is also crucial for CN binding. We further demonstrate that the FKBP12·IP3R·CN complex is independent of FKBP12 rotamase activity but that unique sites on FKBP12 participate in anchoring CN to the IP3R·FKBP complex just as they participate in the formation of the CN·FK506·FKBP complex.

The yeast two-hybrid assay for protein-protein interactions was performed as described previously (17Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Briefly, constructs were synthesized as described above and co-transformed into both Y190 and PJ69–4A yeast strains. Yeast were plated on Leu-Trp-His+ and Leu-Trp-His− plates to assay for successful co-transformation via growth on His+ plates and protein-protein interaction via growth on His− plates. All co-transformants were also assayed by β-galactosidase nitrocellulose lift assays as described previously (17Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described. 2Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1994)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 13.6.1–13.6.6, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Briefly, transformed yeast were grown to saturation overnight and diluted the following morning. Diluted yeast were grown to an optical density (A 600) of 1 and pelleted. Yeast were resuspended in 1 ml of Z buffer (prepared as described) and then diluted in Z buffer at 1:10 and 1:20. Yeast were lysed with chloroform and SDS and incubated with 4 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside at 30 °C until they turned yellow. The reaction was stopped with 1 mNa2CO3, and an A 420 was measured. β-Galactosidase activity was computed as described. Site-directed mutagenesis of IP3R was carried out using the Stratagene Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit as described in the instructions. Mutating oligonucleotides were synthesized as follows: P1370S, GATGAGAACAGCTCTCTCATGTACCACATCC;P11401S, AACTCCCTGCTCTCGCTGGATGACATCG; P1401A, AACTCCCTGCTCGCGCTGGATGACATCG; P1401Q, AACTCCCTGCTCCAGCTGGATGACATCG; P1401K, AACTCCCTGCTCAAGCTGGATGACATCG; P1416S, GAGGACTGCATCTCTGAGGTTAAAATTGC; P1416A, GAGGACTGCATCGCTGAGGTTAAAATTGC, and to knock out the AATII site as described: TAAGTAAGTAAGCCGTCGAGCTCTAAGTAAGTAACG. A third yeast expression vector, pAUD6 (referred to as p3HYB in Fig. 5 and has been described previously (18Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7762-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)), was obtained and used for three-hybrid assay studies. The pAUD6 vector contains the URA3 gene (orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase) allowing for selection of triply transformed yeast colonies on Leu-Trp-Ura− plates. PJ69–4A strain but not Y190 are Ura− and were thus used for three-hybrid assays. Three constructs were expressed instead of two as above, and co-transformants were assayed for their ability to grow on Leu-Trp-Ura-His− plates via the liquid β-galactosidase assay as described above. FK506 was included in the agar plates at 1 μm where indicated. IP3R is one of the largest membrane proteins in biology comprising 2,749 amino acids. The receptor is suggested to encompass six transmembrane domains in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule that participates in the formation of the calcium ion pore, whereas a very large N-terminal portion of the molecule is free in the cytoplasm (for review, see Ref. 19Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We systematically truncated IP3R into overlapping successive regions and examined its interactions with FKBP12 in the yeast two-hybrid system. An initial series of truncations reveals the binding domain to be in the central modulatory portion of IP3R, amino acids 942–1770 (Fig.1, A and B). Further truncations of this region localize the binding site to 112 amino acids, 1349–1460 (Fig. 1, C and D). It is possible to speculate where FKBP12 binds within this 112 amino acid portion of the IP3R based on extensive x-ray crystallographic modeling and in vitro studies of FKBP12-substrate interactions. FK506 has been proposed to mimic protein ligands to, or substrates of FKBP12 with the pyranose rings, α-ketoamide functions, and homoprolyl moieties of the natural product showing structural similarities to the transition state structures forcis-trans isomerization of leucyl-prolyl and valyl-prolyl substrates, which are optimal rotamase substrates for FKBP12 (20Ikeda Y. Schultz W. Clardy J. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4143-4144Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The 1349–1460 region of IP3R contains three proline residues, only one of which is preceded by either a leucine or a valine residue. Proline 1401 is preceded by a leucine. Mutations of the other two prolines contained within this region, which occur at the 1370 and 1416 positions and are preceded by a serine and an isoleucine, respectively, have no effect upon FKBP12 binding activity, whereas four distinct mutations of proline 1401 eliminate the IP3R-FKBP12 interaction (Fig.2). We wondered whether the IP3R sequence responsible for FKBP12 binding is conserved in the other proteins known to bind FKBP12. Besides IP3R and the ryanodine receptor, the type 1 TGF-β receptor has been shown to interact with FKBP12 (22Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Three subtypes of IP3R, the ryanodine receptor, and type-1 TGF-β receptors possess the proline corresponding to Pro-1401 of IP3R (Fig.3). Type 2 TGF-β receptors lack the SGSGSGLP motif present in type 1 receptors (23Derynck R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 533-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and also fail to interact with FKBP12 (22Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Wang T. Li B.-Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the ryanodine receptor this proline is preceded by a valine, whereas in the other receptors it is preceded by a leucine. In all of the receptors that bind FKBP12, the proline is followed by a leucine. Because FKBP12 seems to associate with and regulate calcium flux of the IP3R and the ryanodine receptor in a similar fashion, one might expect FKBP12 to bind to the two channels at an analogous site. The ryanodine receptor comprises 5,037 amino acids and is the largest ion channel currently known. We constructed a 114-amino acid fragment of the ryanodine receptor (aa 2, 407–2, 520) comprising the domain that corresponds to the portion of IP3R that binds to FKBP12. This small fragment binds robustly to FKBP12 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3). The finding that FKBP12 binds to IP3R at a discrete leucyl-proline dipeptide is consistent with the observedin vitro rotamase substrate specificity of FKBP12 (21Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This would suggest that FKBP12 regulates IP3R channel function by altering the conformation of the protein via rotamase influences. However, Fleischer and colleagues (14Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) found that FKBP12 mutants devoid of rotamase activity retain the ability to associate with and modulate the Ca2+ flux properties of the ryanodine receptor. We examined whether the observed association of FKBP12 and IP3R requires FKBP12 rotamase activity. We compared wild-type FKBP12 with four previously described FKBP12 mutants, one that is devoid of rotamase activity and another that displays half that of wild-type FKBP12. 3M. T. DeCenzo, S. T. Park, B. P. Jarrett, R. A. Aldape, O. Futer, M. A. Murcko, and D. J. Livingston, submitted for publication. Each FKBP12 mutant interacts robustly with the IP3R regardless of its peptidyl-prolyl rotamase activity (Fig.4). Expression of these FKBP12 mutants and subsequent analysis of their ability to interact with and modulate IP3R that has been purified and “stripped” of endogenously associated wild-type FKBP12 is currently underway. In our earlier study (13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) establishing a ternary complex of FKBP12, IP3R, and CN, the sites of interaction of the three proteins were unclear. It was not established in that study whether CN was associating with the IP3R·FKBP12 complex via an FKBP12 anchor or at an allosteric site on IP3R. We set out to distinguish between these two possibilities using the yeast two-hybrid system and a modification of it. We first generated a CN-A construct consisting of amino acids 1–394 that contains the FKBP12 binding portion of the molecule (26Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 27Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca E. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of CN to interact directly with IP3R using this construct and observe no direct CN-IP3R interaction with any of our IP3R constructs including IP3R aa 1349–1460 (data not shown). CN likewise fails to interact with FKBP12 in the yeast two-hybrid system until FK506 is added to the agar plates during preparation (Fig.5) as previously observed (28Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained a third vector suitable for expressing proteins in one of the yeast strains that we were using in our two-hybrid assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). With this vector, however, expressed proteins are not synthesized as part of a GAL4 transcription factor fusion protein. We attempted to recreate a three protein interaction in the yeast system using a known ternary complex: the CN·PKA·AKAP (A-kinase-anchoring protein) complex described by Scott and associates (29Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Kicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). CN has no direct affinity for PKA in a traditional yeast two-hybrid system assay (data not shown), but the two molecules are brought together in the presence of the anchoring protein AKAP79 (Fig.5). We next investigated whether the IP3R, aa 1349–1460, mimicks FK506 by promoting an FKBP12-CN interaction in this yeast three-hybrid system. Replacing FK506 with the 112 amino acid domain of IP3R that binds FKBP12 results in a robust FKBP12-CN interaction (Fig. 5). Mutants of FKBP12 have been developed that vary in their ability to participate in binding CN (15Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Aldape R.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18935-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).3 Some mutants with almost no rotamase activity still bind CN tightly in the presence of FK506, i.e. FKBP(W59A), whereas others retain rotamase activity but are unable to bind CN when FK506 is present,i.e. FKBP(R42K/H87V) (Fig. 5). We examined the ability of certain of these mutants to support the ternary complex of FKBP12, CN, and IP3R. A mutant previously demonstrated to be almost devoid of rotamase activity, but binds CN, interacts robustly in our yeast three-hybrid assay (Fig. 5). This further supports the finding that rotamase activity is not crucial for the ternary complex. On the other hand, a mutant that is known not to interact with CN, although it possesses rotamase activity, fails to bind in the yeast three-hybrid system (Fig. 5). In the present study we have localized the exact peptide sequence within IP3R that binds to FKBP12 as a leucyl-proline dipeptide. An analogous leucyl-prolyl or valyl-prolyl sequence is conserved throughout all subtypes of IP3R, the ryanodine receptor, and the type 1 TGF-β receptors shown to interact with FKBP12 indicating that this sequence may represent a universal ligand selective for FKBP12 binding. The leucyl-proline and valyl-prolyl sequences correspond well with the substrate specificity that Schreiber and associates (21Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown to be optimal for in vitroFKBP12-peptide interactions. There are several limitations to our current study utilizing the yeast two- and three-hybrid interaction trap assays. First, although it is now routine to use this assay to map interacting domains within proteins known to associate, this method does not provide for quantification of the affinity of the interaction being studied. Some insight into this question has been attained in previous studies in which relatively high concentrations of the drug FK506 were required to disrupt the FKBP-IP3R interaction (EC50 10–100 nm), and in the case of the FKBP-ryanodine receptor interaction, Fleischer and colleagues (14Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have predicted an EC50 of 0.30 μm (13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Likewise, although the FKBP-IP3R protein-protein interaction has been demonstrated in previous reports by traditional protein biochemistry methodology including co-purification, co-immunoprecipitation, and direct binding assays (10Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), the current study does not repeat those techniques when identifying the site of interaction. Rather the yeast two-hybrid assay is employed to identify the site of interaction, and noninteracting portions of these proteins and mutant constructs are used to ensure the specificity of the interaction. Ideally, the entire 310-kDa IP3R would be expressed as a recombinant protein with and without mutations at proline 1401 and tested for its ability to interact with FKBP in a biochemical assay. These ambitious experiments are currently underway to confirm the data obtained in the present round of yeast two-hybrid experiments. Finally, our data reported here do not speak to how small a domain of IP3R is required to mediate FKBP binding. We have shown that a 112-amino acid truncation of IP3R including proline 1401 is sufficient for FKBP binding and that proline 1401 is necessary. In an attempt to further narrow down how many residues surrounding Pro-1401 are required for FKBP interaction, we have generated an 11-amino acid peptide consisting of IP3R aa 1396–1406. This peptide was not able to support the FKBP-CN interaction in a binding assay, implying that three-dimensional structural motifs contained with the surrounding 112 amino acids also participate in the IP3R·FKBP·CN complex (data not shown). The crucial leucyl-proline sequence in IP3R implies that FKBP12 regulates IP3R by its rotamase activity. However, we showed that rotamase activity is not required for FKBP12 binding to IP3R, and Fleischer and colleagues (14Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have likewise shown that this rotamase activity is not necessary for the association of FKBP12 with or modulation of the ryanodine receptor. More important than rotamase activity in regulating IP3R function is the ability of FKBP12 to serve as a scaffold linking CN to IP3R. Because of the numerous similarities of the ryanodine receptor and IP3R, we suggest that FKBP12 also regulates the ryanodine receptor function by a link to CN. FKBP12 has been proposed to play such an anchoring role when it associates with the type 1 TGF-β receptor (24Wang T. Li B.-Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Previous findings from our laboratory demonstrated that calcineurin complexed to IP3R via FKBP12 was catalytically active (13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent x-ray crystallographic evidence suggests that FK506-FKBP12 binds to calcineurin at a site removed from the phosphatase active site of the enzyme and therefore would not be likely to inhibit phosphatase activity (26Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Rather, binding of FK506-FKBP12 seems to sterically block the association with and subsequent dephosphorylation of some substrates (i.e. NFAT) while not affecting or actually promoting the dephosphorylation by calcineurin of others (4Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). If calcineurin is shown to be the cytoplasmic protein associated with the TGF-β receptor·FKBP12 complex as proposed then the recent data of Wang et al. (22Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Wang T. Li B.-Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) indicate calcineurin would be catalytically active in such a complex as well. Although FKBP12 has been studied extensively, its physiologic substrates have not been well characterized. No major normal function of a protein has been shown to be regulated by the rotamase activity of FKBP12. Thus, it is possible that the anchoring function of FKBP12 represents its major physiologic role. Anchoring of CN and perhaps other phosphatases and kinases to appropriate substrates might regulate phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events. Such a model is reminiscent of the AKAP, which anchors CN to appropriate substrates at the postsynaptic density via an FKBP-like domain within its sequence. Besides anchoring PKA and CN to their appropriate subcellular locales, AKAP serves as a scaffolding anchor for protein kinase C (25Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The AKAP complex thus includes both phosphatase and kinase enzymes. By analogy, there might exist a physiologic quaternary complex including a protein kinase with FKBP12, IP3R and CN. In support of this model, our earlier study showed that calcium flux of IP3R was most strikingly regulated by interactions between calcineurin and protein kinase C (13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Conceivably protein kinase C exists in a quaternary complex with IP3R, FKBP12, and CN. Within the ternary complex, IP3R seems to mimic the role of FK506 in promoting the association of calcineurin with FKBP12. Indeed, it is remarkable that a small organic molecule such as FK506 could contain two distinct domains to participate in binding to two different proteins, something that one would expect a protein such as IP3R to accomplish more efficiently. Our experiments with various truncations of IP3R establish that the domain of IP3R that is responsible for FKBP12 binding also enables bound FKBP12 to associate with calcineurin. The high affinity and selectivity of FK506 binding to FKBP12 has suggested to many investigators the existence of an endogenous FK506-like ligand, conceivably a small peptide, analogous to the enkephalins serving as endogenous ligands for the opiate receptor. Since the chemical structure of FK506 resembles a leucyl-proline dipeptide, it would not be surprising if the endogenous FK506-like ligand would comprise such a structure. Indeed, our results indicate that the leucyl-proline dipeptide within IP3R represents that endogenous ligand, except it is buried within a large protein. Situating the endogenous ligand within a large protein enables it to carry out a bridging function linking calcineurin via FKBP12 to an appropriate cellular substrate of its phosphatase activity (Fig.6).

Several groups have reported involvement of PI 3-kinase in the activation of Erk1 and Erk2, whereas many other groups have shown that activation of Erk1 and Erk2 is not sensitive to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase such as wortmannin. Here we show that wortmannin inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway is cell type- and ligand-specific. Wortmannin blocks platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent activation of Raf-1 and the MAP kinase cascade in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which have few PDGF receptors, but has no significant effect on Erk activation in Swiss 3T3 cells, which have high levels of PDGF receptors. However, wortmannin blocks activation of Erk proteins if Swiss 3T3 cells are stimulated with lower, physiological levels of PDGF. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase is in an efficient pathway for activation of MAP kinase, but that MAP kinase can be stimulated by a redundant pathway when a large number of receptors are activated. We present evidence that a protein kinase C family member downstream of phospholipase Cγ is involved in the redundant pathway.

Lipid Second Messengers. 8. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 125-175Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase with growth factors results in the appearance of the lipid products of this enzyme, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, within seconds to minutes. There is also a correlation between the elevation in PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels and cell transformation. These correlations have suggested an important role for PI 3-kinase in signal transduction pathways leading to cell growth and transformation. Indeed, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (p110α) has recently been identified as a retroviral oncogene (3Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 270: 1848-1850Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p110α in chick embryo fibroblasts results in constitutive elevation of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and cell transformation. The MAP kinase pathway is another key component in the transduction of signals leading to growth and transformation. This pathway consists of a linear cascade of the protein kinases Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase/Erk; like PI 3-kinase, Erk1 and Erk2 are acutely activated by growth factors and are found constitutively activated in many transformed cell lines. The Erk proteins are phosphorylated and activated by the dual specificity kinase MEK (MAP kinase/Erkkinase), which is phosphorylated and activated by the serine/threonine kinase Raf. Raf is recruited to the membrane of activated cells by direct binding to Ras-GTP. This recruitment by activated Ras is necessary but not sufficient for full activation of Raf (4Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar); therefore, other factors that are necessary for activation of the MAP kinase pathway may feed into the pathway at Raf. A search for other sources that feed into the MAP kinase pathway has yielded several candidates including Src, members of the PKC family, and PI 3-kinase (45Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The relevance of PI 3-kinase for activation of Erk has been controversial. Expression of activated forms of p110α PI 3-kinase has been reported to stimulate the MAP kinase pathway in one case (5Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T.

Another potential intermediate is the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB, which binds to and is activated by PtdIns-3,4-P2 in vitro (28Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 29Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

The serine/threonine kinase p70S6K has been shown to be downstream of PI 3-kinase (31Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Thus, a potential means for PI 3-kinase to feed into the MAP kinase pathway could be via activation of one (or more) of these targets of PI 3-kinase. We have attempted to better understand the role that PI 3-kinase plays in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. We show here that the effect of wortmannin on the activation of Erk varies not only between cell lines, but within a single cell line depending on both the kind and concentration of the growth factor used. We have found that Erk activity is sensitive to wortmannin when relatively few receptors are activated, but resistant if a large number of receptors are activated. We have also found that a down-regulatable PKC contributes to wortmannin-resistant MAP kinase activation. CHO/HIR cells are a CHO clone expressing the human insulin receptor and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Balb/c/3T3 clone A31 fibroblasts and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Quiescent cell cultures were established by changing the medium to 0.1% (A31 and NIH/3T3 cells) or 0% (CHO cells) fetal calf serum overnight. Wortmannin was diluted immediately prior to use in Me2SO from a 10 mmstock kept in Me2SO at −70 °C. Wortmannin or the Me2SO carrier control was added to the cells for 15–20 min before the addition of growth factors. Anti-Erk2 (C-14), anti-Raf-1 (C-12), and anti-PLCγ1 (530) affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p85 polyclonal antibody was raised against the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Dishes of cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and placed on ice. Cells were immediately lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) collected in an Eppendorf tube, and rocked for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was then spun at 12,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration and transferred to another tube. The immunoprecipitating antibody and 30 μl of a protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (50%) were added; the suspension was then rocked for 2–3 h. Beads were collected and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) or protein kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.0) and 5 mmMgCl2). Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer also contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmZnCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride added fresh. TNE buffer and protein kinase buffer contained the same concentrations of dithiothreitol, vanadate, NaF, and leupeptin. Immunoblots were developed either by ECL (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products) followed by exposure to film or by Vistra ECF Western blotting reagent (Amersham Corp.) followed by quantitation on a Molecular Dynamics Storm imaging system. Immunoprecipitated and washed proteins were assayed on the beads. For MAP kinase assays, 40 μl of protein kinase buffer with 20 μg/ml myelin basic protein were added to the beads, followed by 5 μl of a 200 μm ATP solution containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and stopped by adding 12.5 μl of 5 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. The mixture was then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the wet gel (after fixing) was quantitated on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager. Results obtained with the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager were linear with results obtained by cutting out radioactive bands and quantitating in a scintillation counter. For Raf kinase assays, 40 μl of protein kinase buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-K97A MEK (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; eluted from beads with 20 mmglutathione), 15 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added to the washed beads. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with intermittent agitation and stopped by the addition of 12.5 μl of 5 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. Samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager. Lipid kinase assays were performed essentially as described (32Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml sonicated crude bovine brain phosphoinositides (sonicated in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.0) and 0.1 mm EGTA) were added to immunoprecipitated enzyme (∼20-μl volume), followed by 10 μl of 5 × ATP/MgCl2 mixture (250 m ATP and 25 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0)) containing 0.5–20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction. Reactions were left at room temperature for 5 min before stopping with 60 μl of 2 m HCl. Lipids were extracted by the addition of 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and the organic phase was collected and analyzed by TLC. The TLC solvent was 65% 1-propanol and 35% acetic acid (1 m). The radioactivity on the TLC plate was imaged and quantified using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager. The effect of wortmannin on PDGF-dependent activation of MAP kinase was examined in three cell lines (Fig.1). In CHO/HIR cells, wortmannin (100 nm) almost completely blocked PDGF-dependent activation of Erk2. In A31 cells, ∼70% inhibition of MAP kinase was observed. Inhibition of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in vivo production correlated with inhibition of MAP kinase activity in A31 cells (Fig.2). In contrast, wortmannin had little effect on PDGF-dependent activation of Erk proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 1). A trivial explanation for this could be that wortmannin is more effective in inhibiting PI 3-kinase in CHO and A31 cells than in Swiss 3T3 cells. However, we find that 100 nmwortmannin is an effective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity in all three cell lines as judged by inhibition of PtdIns-3,4-P2and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production in intact cells (A31 and CHO/HIR cells) or immune complex kinase assays using 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (all cell lines) (data not shown). Consistent with this result, insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation in Swiss 3T3 cells is almost completely inhibited by wortmannin. In contrast, in CHO/HIR cells, where the insulin receptor is overexpressed, wortmannin is less effective in blocking insulin-dependent activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 1). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase is necessary for PDGF-dependent activation of the MAP kinase pathway in CHO and A31 cells, but that in Swiss 3T3 cells, other pathways are utilized for its activation.Figure 2Inhibition of MAP kinase by wortmannin correlates well with its inhibition of the in vivosynthesis of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. A shows the effect of wortmannin (Wort) on MAP kinase (MAPK) activation in A31 cells as shown in Fig. 1.B and C show the effect of wortmannin on the lipid products of PI 3-kinase. Quiescent A31 cells were labeled with inorganic [32P]phosphate for 3 h and stimulated or not with 10 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min. The cells were lysed in methanol and 1 m HCl; lipids were recovered by extraction with chloroform and deacylated; and the resulting glycerol phosphoinositides were separated by strong anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. The results are presented as a percentage of dpm in PtdIns-4-P plus PtdIns-4,5-P2 (e.g.PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 × 100/(dpm PtdIns-4-P + PtdIns-4,5-P2)). The average number of counts in PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 was 1.0 × 106 and 2.4 × 106 cpm/106cells, respectively, and these values did not change significantly with respect to growth factor or wortmannin treatment. The results are from a single experiment representative of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These surprising results might be explained by the different levels of expression of receptors for PDGF in the three cell types. CHO cells express low levels of PDGF receptors (<20,000/cell) (33Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and wortmannin is an effective inhibitor of the PDGF response in these cells. Swiss 3T3 cells express high levels of PDGF receptors (400,000/cell) (34Huang J.S. Huang S.S. Kennedy B. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8130-8136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PDGF response is resistant to wortmannin in these cells. A31 cells have intermediate levels of PDGF receptors (150,000/cell) (35Singh J.P. Chaikin M.A. Stiles C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and MAP kinase activation is partially inhibited by wortmannin. Likewise, the relative resistance of CHO/HIR cells to wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity could be explained by the high level of insulin receptor expression in these cells. An alternative explanation of the results in Fig. 1 is that the cell lines differ in their composition of PDGF α- and β-receptors, and this could account for differences in wortmannin sensitivity. On the basis of activation with PDGF-AA versus PDGF-BB and immunoprecipitation of Tyr-phosphorylated PDGF receptors with isoform-specific antibodies, CHO cells contain mainly PDGF β-receptors, and Swiss 3T3 cells contain mainly PDGF α-receptors (data not shown). To test the idea that wortmannin sensitivity of MAP kinase activation depends on the number and not the type of receptors that become stimulated, we reexamined MAP kinase activation in Swiss 3T3 cells at suboptimal concentrations of PDGF. This approach varies the number of receptors stimulated, but not the type. As shown in Fig. 3, when low concentrations of PDGF are used to stimulate the cells, MAP kinase activation is sensitive to wortmannin inhibition. These results suggest that to efficiently activate MAP kinase at low concentrations of growth factor or in cells that have few receptors, PI 3-kinase must be activated. However, PI 3-kinase becomes less important for this pathway when a large number of receptors become activated, presumably because a second pathway that requires more receptors provides a redundant signal. To test this model, we examined whether PI 3-kinase was activated in Swiss 3T3 cells at the low PDGF concentrations at which wortmannin inhibition of MAP kinase is observed. As shown in Fig. 4, recruitment of PI 3-kinase to an anti-Tyr(P)-precipitable complex occurs at very low concentrations of PDGF (half-maximal at 2–3 ng/ml), consistent with a role for PI 3-kinase in the activation of MAP kinase at low PDGF concentrations. In contrast, anti-Tyr(P) precipitation of PLCγ1 saturates at higher concentrations of PDGF (half-maximal at 10 ng/ml). It is possible that PLCγ1 is the redundant signal, parallel to PI 3-kinase, leading to wortmannin-resistant MAP kinase activation at higher PDGF concentrations. This idea is consistent with reports that some PKC family members, which are downstream of PLCγ, can feed into the MAP kinase pathway at Raf (25Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 26Troppmair J. Bruder J.T. Munoz H. Lloyd P.A. Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Avruch J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7030-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The possibility that a PKC family member contributes to PDGF-dependent activation of MAP kinase was investigated. Prolonged treatment of cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate results in degradation of PKC family members. Under the conditions used here, PKCα is down-regulated >95%, and PKCε is down-regulated 80%. PKC down-regulation alone had little effect on PDGF-dependent activation of MAP kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig.5). However, the MAP kinase activity in the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated cells was inhibited by wortmannin. These results are consistent with two redundant pathways for activation of MAP kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells at high PDGF concentrations: a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway and a PKC-dependent pathway that is likely downstream of PLCγ. To better define the contribution of PI 3-kinase to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, the effect of wortmannin on Raf activation was examined in CHO cells. Raf kinase activity peaked within 2 min of PDGF addition (Fig.6), and wortmannin almost completely inhibited the activation. The MAP kinase pathway plays a central role in the transduction of signals for growth, differentiation, and other cellular responses. This modular cascade of kinases is a link between receptor signaling events and nuclear events. One of the important links in this pathway to be established was the connection between receptor signaling and the MAP kinase cascade. This link appeared to be found when studies showed that receptor activation of Ras results in Ras-GTP binding to Raf, recruiting it to the membrane (36Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 37Koide H. Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While subsequent studies have shown that recruitment of Raf to the membrane is sufficient for its activation (40Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), other studies have shown that once recruited to the membrane, additional steps are required for full activation of Raf (4Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Thus, Ras probably contributes to the activation of Raf by recruiting it to the membrane and inducing a conformational change that facilitates activation by other factors. One of the most pressing challenges in signal transduction is to identify the other factors that contribute to the activation of Raf and the MAP kinase cascade. Many studies have used wortmannin or dominant-negative forms of PI 3-kinase to address the involvement of this enzyme in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. While several studies have found that wortmannin (10Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem.

Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) effectively inhibits activation of the MAP kinase cascade, many other studies have found that inhibition of PI 3-kinase has no effect on the activation of Erk proteins (17Nakamura K.

We show that wortmannin sensitivity is clearly dependent on the system under study. The agreement between the results with wortmannin and those with dominant-negative PI 3-kinase have firmly established that PI 3-kinase is required for MAP kinase activation by growth factors in certain cells. However, as we show here, in some cells, inhibition of PI 3-kinase does not affect activation of MAP kinase. The results that we present are consistent with a model in which PI 3-kinase is required for activation of the MAP kinase cascade under conditions in which relatively few receptors are activated, but is redundant with a parallel pathway when many receptors become activated. This model is supported by comparison of cells with different numbers of PDGF and insulin receptors (Fig. 1) and is directly addressed by varying the number of activated receptors in a single cell type (Fig.3). Wortmannin blocks acute (2 min) PDGF-dependent activation of Raf in CHO cells, indicating that, in these cells, PI 3-kinase is required for an early step in the cascade. This result is in agreement with a previous study showing that wortmannin blocks Raf kinase activation by nerve growth factor (10Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), but not Ras activation by nerve growth factor (41Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J.

The redundant signal for MAP kinase activation that emerges when a large number of receptors are activated apparently involves a PKC family member. Down-regulation of PKCs did not block PDGF-dependent activation of MAP kinase, unless PI 3-kinase was also inhibited. Thus, PI 3-kinase contributes to Raf kinase and MAP kinase activation by a pathway that does not require a down-regulatable PKC family member. At high levels of stimulated PDGF receptors, a second pathway involving PKC family members circumvents the need for PI 3-kinase. This second pathway is probably mediated by PDGF-dependent activation of PLCγ, resulting in elevated Ca2+ and diacylglycerol levels. Phorbol esters are known to activate Raf and MAP kinases in intact cells, and various PKC family members have been shown to activate Raf kinase in vitro(25Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the result in Fig. 5 indicates that PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of Raf kinase does not involve a down-regulatable PKC, they do not rule out the possibility that a nonconventional PKC or an atypical PKC that is not efficiently down-regulated is involved. Both PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 activate nonconventional PKCs in vitro (20Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase has been shown to be required for PDGF-dependent recruitment of PKCε (23Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and PKCλ (24Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) to the membrane. PKCε is partially down-regulated under the conditions of Fig. 5 (80%), but could still be contributing to the wortmannin-sensitive pathway. Alternatively, other known or unknown targets of PI 3-kinase could feed into the MAP kinase pathway. Thus, an attractive model is that stimulation of PI 3-kinase provides an efficient pathway for Raf kinase activation at low PDGF levels via stimulation of one of its effectors, whereas activation of PLCγ at higher PDGF concentration provides a redundant signal via activation of a down-regulatable PKC family member. The apparent redundancy between PI 3-kinase- and PLCγ-dependent pathways for Raf kinase activation is further complicated by evidence that a product of PI 3-kinase is required for maximal activation of PLCγ. Wortmannin has been shown to partially block inositol-3,4,5-P3 production in several cell types when the pathway stimulated involves PLCγ (43Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 44Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Hall A. Martinez A.M. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). While these results could be explained by wortmannin inhibition of targets other than PI 3-kinase, Rhee and co-workers 2Y. S. Bae, L. G. Cantley, C.-S. Chen, S.-R. Kim, K.-S. Swon, and S. G. Rhee, submitted for publication. has recently found that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 activates PLCγ in vitro by binding to the SH2 domains of this enzyme. Thus, inhibiting PI 3-kinase could prevent direct activation of PKCs by D3 phosphoinositides and also inhibit activation of conventional PKCs by reducing the magnitude of PLCγ activation. This latter effect is unlikely to explain the wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated MAP kinase since insulin does not activate PLCγ. Finally, although a requirement for PI 3-kinase in MAP kinase activation is now firmly established in several systems, our results do not imply that activation of PI 3-kinase alone is sufficient to fully activate Raf or MAP kinase. In fact, we do not find significant elevation of MAP kinase activity in chick embryo fibroblasts stably transformed with viral or cellular forms of p110α PI 3-kinase, 3B. C. Duckworth and L. C. Cantley, unpublished data. even though these cells have significantly elevated levels of PtdIns-3,4-P2and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (3Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 270: 1848-1850Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and increased Akt/PKB protein kinase activities (3Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 270: 1848-1850Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This result is in contrast to the recent report that overexpression of p110γ PI 3-kinase stimulates MAP kinase in COS-7 cells (9Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). There are several problems with interpreting these types of experiments. It is possible that acute activation of PI 3-kinase is sufficient to activate MAP kinase, but that continual elevation of D3 lipids results in a feedback pathway that inhibits MAP kinase. Conversely, it is possible that the lipid products of PI 3-kinase alone are not sufficient to activate MAP kinase, but that certain cells transformed with PI 3-kinase secrete factors that stimulate MAP kinase in an autocrine manner. Further work will be necessary to address the sufficiency of PI 3-kinase for MAP kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2169205486,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator is a serine protease responsible for proteolytic activation of HGF in response to tissue injury and thus plays an important role in the regulation of biological functions of HGF in regenerating tissue. We previously purified an inhibitor of HGF activator (HGF activator inhibitor type 1, HAI-1) from the conditioned medium of a human stomach carcinoma cell line MKN45 and cloned its cDNA. HAI-1 is a novel member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. In the present study, we purified a second type of HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-2) from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells and molecularly cloned its cDNA. The cDNA sequence revealed that HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and contains two Kunitz domains, indicating that HAI-2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. The primary translation product of HAI-2 has a hydrophobic sequence in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that, like HAI-1, HAI-2 is produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. Because HAI-2 and HAI-1 are potent inhibitors specific for HGF activator, they may be involved in regulation of proteolytic activation of HGF in injured tissues.

Inoue K. Kitamura N. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen (4Shimomura T. Kondo J. Ochiai M. Naka D. Miyazawa K. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22927-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to tissue injury, the zymogen is converted to an active serine protease. The activated HGF activator acquires strong heparin binding affinity and is localized to the injured tissue. The localized HGF activator catalyzes the activation of the inactive single chain HGF that resides in the tissue (2Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Naka D. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8966-8970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activated HGF may be involved in tissue repair after the injury because HGF is a potent mitogen for a variety of cells (6Gohda E. Tsubouchi H. Nakayama H. Hirono S. Sakiyama O. Takahashi K.

Thus, HGF activator is a specific enzyme that localizes the activity of HGF to the injured tissue. The activity of HGF activator may be regulated by one or more inhibitors. We previously purified an inhibitor of HGF activator from the conditioned medium of a human stomach carcinoma cell line MKN45 and molecularly cloned its cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed that the inhibitor has two well defined Kunitz domains, indicating that it is a new member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The sequence also showed that the primary translation product of the inhibitor has a hydrophobic sequence in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that the inhibitor is produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted by the producing cells in a proteolytically truncated form (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Because the inhibitor efficiently neutralizes the activity of HGF activator in vitro and the mRNA of the inhibitor is expressed in various tissues (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it may be responsible for suppressing the activity of HGF activator after tissue repair. In the present study, we found a second inhibitor of HGF activator in the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells. We purified it from the conditioned medium and cloned its cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed that this newly identified inhibitor is also a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. We designated this protein as HGF activator inhibitor type 2 (HAI-2). To distinguish the previously identified inhibitor from this new protein, we redesignated it as HGF activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1). Both HAI-1 and HAI-2 are potent inhibitors of HGF activator and have similar structural domains. However, there are some differences in structure and properties between these inhibitors. We compare here the structures and properties of HAI-1 and HAI-2. Cell lines and reagents were obtained as follows: human stomach carcinoma cell line MKN45 from IBL (Gunma, Japan); human lung carcinoma cell line HLC-1 from the Department of Physiology, Keio University (Tokyo, Japan); human rectal adenocarcinoma cell line RCM-1 from Dr. H. Kataoka (Department of Pathology, Miyazaki Medical College, Miyazaki, Japan); heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and ConA-Sepharose from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; phenyl-5PW column from TOSOH; PL-SAX column from Polymer Laboratories, Ltd.; HCA A-4007 column from Mitsui-touatsu Chemical; Ashahipack GS520 column from Asahi Chemical Industries, Ltd.; YMC C4 and C8 columns from YMC; dextran sulfate, CHAPS and porcine pancreas trypsin from Sigma; YM 30 membrane from Amicon; Affi-Gel 10 from Bio-Rad; N-glycosidase F from Boehringer Mannheim; octylglucopyranoside from Nacalai tesque Inc.; human urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) from Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd; and bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit from Pierce Chemical Co. Trypsin and HGF activator immobilized affinity columns were prepared by coupling 13 mg of trypsin and 1.6 mg of HGF activator with 10 and 5 ml of Affi-Gel 10, respectively, by the method described in the instruction manual. To obtain tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), the concentrated serum-free conditioned medium of HLC-1 cells was applied to a trypsin immobilized column (1 × 13 cm) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The adsorbed fractions were eluted from the column with 10 mm HCl, neutralized immediately by 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and then were subjected to a reverse-phase C4 column (0.46 × 15 cm) chromatography. TFPI was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–70% acetonitrile/isopropanol (3/7) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) was purified from the concentrated serum-free conditioned medium of RCM-1 cells (10Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Komada N. Koono M. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1989; 57: 157-165Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Murayama T. Kataoka H. Koita H. Nabeshima K. Koono M. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1991; 60: 263-270Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using the same procedure as for TFPI. Five μl of the fractions for assay were incubated with 10 μl of 900 ng/ml HGF activator in 35 μl of PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were added to 10 μl of 1.5 mg/ml single-chain HGF and further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and scanned by a Flying-Spot Scanner CS-9000 (Shimadzu). Ten liters of the serum-free conditioned medium of MKN45 cells was concentrated to about 300 ml. The concentrate was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (2.5 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with PBS. The unadsorbed fractions were collected and then applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (1 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with PBS. The unadsorbed fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1m ammonium sulfate by a YM 30 membrane. The concentrate was applied to a phenyl-5PW column (0.75 × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The unadsorbed fractions containing the inhibitory activity were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% CHAPS and then applied to an anion exchange PL-SAX column (0.46 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The HAI-2 protein was eluted at 0–150 mm NaCl. The fractions were dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.05% CHAPS. The dialysate was applied to a hydroxyapatite HCA A-4007 column (0.4 × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The unadsorbed fractions were collected and then applied to a gel-filtration Ashahipack GS520 column (0.76 × 50 cm) pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS. The HAI-2 protein was collected at 40–20 kDa fractions and then finally purified by a reverse-phase YMC C8 column (0.46 × 15 cm). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 10–50% of acetonitrile/isopropanol (3/7) containing 0.1% TFA. The fractions containing HAI-2 protein were neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and then dried under vacuum conditions. The dried samples were dissolved in PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with silver. The concentrations of proteins were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fifty μl of 20 μg/ml HAI-2 protein in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA was first denatured by heating at 100 °C in the presence of 0.2% SDS. After denaturation, 5 μl of 10% octylglucopyranoside, 0.5 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 μl of 200 units/ml N-glycosidase F were added to the mixture. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, and the deglycosylated product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To determine the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified HAI-2, the final preparation from the C8 reverse-phase chromatography was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 470A Protein Sequencer. The internal amino acid sequences of HAI-2 were determined as described (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Two μg/ml of HGF activator was mixed with various concentrations of HAI-2 (0–2.4 μg/ml) in 40 μl of PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 5 μl of 2.4 mg/ml single-chain HGF in PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS and 5 μl of 100 μg/ml dextran sulfate (molecular mass: 500 kDa) were added to the mixture and further incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and scanned by a Flying-Spot Scanner CS-9000. The inhibitory activities of HAI-2 were estimated by calculating the ratio of the single-chain to heterodimeric form of HGF. Total RNA was prepared from MKN45 cells by acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), and poly(A) RNA was purified by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography. The primers 5′-AAGGT(G/T)GT(G/T)GG(G/T)(A/C)G(G/T)TG(T/C)(A/C)G-3′ and 5′-C(G/T)CCGTA(G/T)ACGAA(G/T)A(G/A)(T/C)TG(G/A)C-3′ were chemically synthesized. Using the primers and poly(A) RNA as a template, DNA fragments were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an 85-bp fragment was generated. The DNA fragment was subcloned and sequenced. The fragment was used as a probe for screening a cDNA library. To construct the cDNA library, cDNA was synthesized from poly(A) RNA of MKN45 cells using a cDNA synthesis kit with oligo(dT) primer (Pharmacia). The cDNA with EcoRI adaptors at both ends was ligated toEcoRI-digested λZAPII vector (Stratagene) and packagedin vitro using Gigapack Gold (Stratagene). Hybridization to nylon replica membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham) was performed at 42 °C for 16 h with 32P-labeled probe in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.1% Ficoll), 0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 6 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon testis DNA. The probe was labeled using multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Life Science Inc.). The membranes were washed twice with 0.1 × SSC containing 1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min. Total RNA (10 μg) from MKN45 cells was denatured, electrophoresed (13Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar), and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne). Human adult and fetal multiple tissue Northern blot membranes were purchased from CLONTECH. The membranes were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h with the32P-labeled probe as described (14Miyazawa K. Kitamura A. Naka D. Kitamura N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed twice with 1 × SSC containing 1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min. The hybridization probe was the 648-bp NcoI fragment. The serum-free conditioned medium of MKN 45 cells was applied to a trypsin immobilized column (1 × 13 cm) equilibrated with PBS. The adsorbed proteins were eluted from the column with 10 mm HCl. The eluted fractions were neutralized immediately by 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and directly applied to an HGF activator immobilized column (1 × 6 cm) equilibrated with PBS. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with 10 mm HCl, and the eluted fractions were collected and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and then subjected to reverse-phase YMC C4 column (0.46 × 15 cm) chromatography. Elution was with a linear gradient of 10–70% acetonitrile/isopropanol (3/7) containing 0.1% TFA. The concentrations of proteins were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. HAI-1, HAI-2, APP, TFPI, or UTI was mixed with 100 ng/ml of HGF activator in 45 μl of PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were supplemented with 5 μl of 1 mg/ml single-chain HGF in PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS and further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and scanned by a Flying-Spot Scanner CS-9000. HAI-1 was previously purified from serum-free conditioned medium of MKN45 cells by a seven-step procedure (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was concentrated and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column. The unadsorbed fractions were applied to a ConA-Sepharose column, and the inhibitory activities were detected both in the unadsorbed and adsorbed fractions. The HAI-1 protein was recovered from the adsorbed fraction (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this study, we purified a protein for the activity (HAI-2) in the unadsorbed fraction by an additional five-step procedure using the columns used for the purification of HAI-1. TableI shows elution characteristics of HAI-2 and HAI-1. The elution characteristics of HAI-2 on hydrophobic, gel filtration, and reverse-phase chromatographies were distinctly different from those of HAI-1. The final preparation of HAI-2 on reverse-phase chromatography revealed a broad band of 23 to 31 kDa on SDS-PAGE (15.0% acrylamide) under reducing conditions (Fig.1, lane 1).Table IElution characteristics of HAI-2 and HAI-1ChromatographyFractions with the inhibitory activityHAI-2HAI-1Heparin-SepharoseUnadsorbedUnadsorbedConA-SepharoseUnadsorbedAdsorbedHydrophobic (phenyl-5PW)Unadsorbed100–400 mm of (NH4)2SO4Anion exchange (PL-SAX)0–150 mm of NaCl50–250 mm of NaClHydroxyapatiteUnadsorbedUnadsorbedGel filtration (GS520)20–40 kDa30–50 kDaReverse-phase (C4)20%1-aAcetonitrile/isopropanol (3/7) containing 0.1% TFA.35%1-aAcetonitrile/isopropanol (3/7) containing 0.1% TFA.1-a Acetonitrile/isopropanol (3/7) containing 0.1% TFA. Open table in a new tab The broad migration of HAI-2 on SDS-PAGE may be caused byN-glycans bound to HAI-2. We therefore deglycosylated HAI-2 using an N-glycosidase and analyzed it by SDS-PAGE. The deglycosylated HAI-2 protein migrated as two bands of 14.0 and 13.5 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 2), indicating that large N-linked sugar chains were bound to the HAI-2 protein. When the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was analyzed before deglycosylation, only one sequence was obtained (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the apparent heterogeneity of the deglycosylated protein on the gel might be caused by a difference in the COOH-terminal sequence. In addition to the NH2-terminal sequence, the two internal amino acid sequences were obtained from peptide fragments produced by digestion of the purified protein with Achromobacter protease-I (Fig.2 A). The sequence of peptide 1 showed extensive similarity (53.6% identity) to that of a part of the first Kunitz domain of HAI-1 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that HAI-2 is also a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. Fig. 3 shows the dose-response curve of the inhibitory activity of HAI-2. In these reactions, HGF activator (2 μg/ml) was mixed with various concentrations of HAI-2 and incubated for 30 min to form an enzyme-inhibitor complex. Then remaining HGF-converting activity was measured. The concentration of HAI-2 for 50% inhibition was about 300 ng/ml. Considering the molecular masses of the protein portions of HAI-2 (14 kDa) and HGF activator (34 kDa), HAI-2 forms about an equimolar complex with HGF activator. The NH2-terminal sequence, Lys-Val-Val-Gly-Arg-Cys-Arg, and the COOH-terminal sequence, Cys-Gln-Leu-Phe-Val-Tyr-Gly-Gly, in peptide 1 (Fig. 2 A) were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the sequence for peptide 1. A lysine residue preceding the NH2-terminal sequence was predicted because the peptide fragments were obtained by digestion with a lysylendopeptidase. The cysteine residues were not determined by the amino acid sequence analysis (Fig. 2 A), but they were predicted because the sequence of peptide 1 is similar to the first Kunitz domain of HAI-1. PCR amplification of MKN45 RNA resulted in a cDNA fragment with the expected size of about 85 bp. The cDNA fragment was subcloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA sequence completely matched that of peptide 1. The PCR clone was thus used as a probe to screen a cDNA library constructed from MKN45 cells. Twenty-two hybridization-positive clones were obtained from about 1.5 × 105 phage. The largest clone was sequenced to determine the primary structure of human HAI-2 (Fig. 4). The amino acid sequence of HAI-2 predicted from the cDNA sequence is shown in Fig.4. The translation initiation site was assigned to the first methionine codon because in-frame stop codons are present upstream of the methionine codon. The open reading frame that starts from the ATG codon consists of 252 amino acids, and the protein product has a calculated molecular mass of 28,169. The first methionine is followed by a hydrophobic sequence, and the NH2-terminal amino acid of the purified protein is located at the 28th residue downstream of the methionine, suggesting that the hydrophobic region represents a signal peptide sequence. Excluding the signal peptide, the mature form of the protein consists of 225 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 25,415. The apparent molecular mass of the protein portion of HAI-2 purified from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells was about 14 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Thus, the protein purified from the conditioned medium appears to be a processing product cleaved at the COOH-terminal region. A hydrophobic sequence of 24 amino acids is present in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that the primary translation product is a membrane-associated protein. There are two potential N-glycosylation sites with the canonical Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr). A comparison of the protein sequence of HAI-2 with sequences in the SwissProt and the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein data base revealed that two regions (residues 38–88 and 133–183) showed extensive similarity to the Kunitz-type sequence of serine protease inhibitors (Fig. 5). Thus, HAI-2 appears to be a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. The size and tissue distribution of HAI-2 mRNA was determined by Northern blotting with poly(A) RNAs from various human tissues (Fig.6). A transcript of 1.6 kilobases was detected in MKN45 cells from which we purified the HAI-2 protein. The transcript was detected in a variety of human adult and fetal tissues. Among them, the expression level of HAI-2 mRNA was relatively high in the adult placenta, kidney, pancreas, prostate, testis, thyroid, and trachea. Using a combination of trypsin and HGF activator immobilized affinity column chromatography, relative amounts of HAI-2 and HAI-1 in the conditioned medium of MKN45 were measured. The serum-free conditioned medium of MKN45 was directly applied to a trypsin immobilized affinity column, and the adsorbed fractions were applied to an HGF activator immobilized affinity column. The adsorbed fractions were analyzed by C4 reverse-phase chromatography. The inhibitory activity was quantitatively recovered in the adsorbed fractions in each affinity chromatography and did not remain in the unadsorbed fractions. On the C4 reverse-phase chromatograph, three peaks were detected (Fig. 7 A). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that peaks 1 (at 15.0 min) and 3 (at 24.2 min) corresponded to HAI-2 and HAI-1, respectively. When the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of peak 2 (at 22.9 min) was analyzed, two sequences (Arg-Gln-Leu-Arg and Thr-Gln-Gly-Phe) were obtained. These sequences correspond to those of residues 150–153 and 154–157 in HAI-1, indicating that the proteins in peak 2 are processing products cleaved at the NH2-terminal region of HAI-1. These truncated HAI-1 proteins exhibited inhibitory activity toward HGF activator (data not shown). No inhibitor other than HAI-2 and HAI-1 was detected by this affinity purification procedure. Thus, the inhibitory activity toward HGF activity in the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells is derived from HAI-1 and HAI-2. The proteins in each peak were fractionated and their contents were quantified by a protein assay (Fig. 7 B). The amount of HAI-2 was almost equal to that of HAI-1 in the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells. APP, TFPI, and UTI have Kunitz domains that are responsible for the inhibitory activities of these proteins against serine proteases (15Sinha S. Dovey H.F. Seubert P. Ward P.J. Blacher R.W. Blaber M.

Therefore, we examined whether these inhibitors exhibited an inhibitory effect on the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator (Fig. 8). The inhibitory activities of APP and TFPI against HGF activator were very weak even at high concentrations, and that of UTI was not detected although these proteins strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of trypsin (data not shown). We previously identified and cloned an HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-1) from MKN45 human stomach carcinoma cells (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L.

In the present study, we identified a second type of HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-2) from the same cells. The inhibitor protein was purified from the conditioned medium of the cells. The primary structure of the protein was predicted from the sequence of the cDNA for human HAI-2. The structure of human HAI-2 is schematically summarized in Fig.9 together with the structure of human HAI-1. The primary translation product of HAI-2 consists of 252 amino acid residues. The NH2-terminal 27 residues may serve as a signal peptide. HAI-2 has two Kunitz domains. A Kunitz domain is typically about 60 amino acids in length and contains three disulfide bonds. It is recognized as the functional domain of serine protease inhibitors (18Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Thus, one or both of the Kunitz domains in HAI-2 appears to be responsible for the inhibitory activity. The protein also has a hydrophobic sequence of about 20 amino acids in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that it may be membrane-associated. The protein portion of HAI-2 purified from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells has a molecular mass of about 14 kDa, which is smaller than the predicted molecular mass (25,415) of the primary translation product. Thus, HAI-2 purified from the conditioned medium appears to be a proteolytically truncated form of the membrane-associated form. HAI-1 also has two Kunitz domains and the COOH-terminal hydrophobic region, indicating that the overall structures of the characteristic domains are similar between HAI-1 and HAI-2. However, HAI-1 has additional structures that are not found in HAI-2: a long NH2-terminal region preceding the first Kunitz domain and a structure similar to the ligand binding domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor between the two Kunitz domains (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the protein portion of HAI-2 purified from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells is about 14 kDa, which corresponds to 125 amino acids, suggesting that the extracellular truncated form of HAI-2 is produced by the proteolytic cleavage that occurs within the second Kunitz domain. Similar cleavage was suggested for the generation of the extracellular truncated form of HAI-1 (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dose-dependence of the HAI-2 activity showed that HAI-2 purified from the conditioned medium forms an equimolar complex with HGF activator. Similar complex formation was observed for HAI-1 and HGF activator (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, only the first Kunitz domain in HAI-2 as well as HAI-1 may function in the inhibitory activity toward HGF activator. The first Kunitz domain of HAI-2 shows the highest similarity (54% identity) to the first Kunitz domain of HAI-1 among Kunitz domains of human serine protease inhibitors, suggesting that the conserved amino acid residues between the domains play an important role in the formation of complex between the inhibitors and HGF activator. The treatment of HAI-2 by an N-glycosidase markedly decreased its molecular mass, indicating that large N-linked sugar chains are attached to the protein portion of HAI-2. The molecular mass of HAI-1 was also decreased by N-glycosidase treatment 2T. Shimomura and T. Kawaguchi, unpublished results. although the decrease (40 to 34 kDa) was less than that for HAI-2. Thus, both HAI-2 and HAI-1 are N-glycosylated proteins. HAI-1 binds to ConA-Sepharose (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereas HAI-2 does not. ConA is a legume lectin that specifically recognizes the trimannoside core present in allN-linked glycans (19Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The N-linked sugar chains are generally classified into three main types: high mannose-, hybrid- and complex-type. In general, high mannose- and hybrid-type sugar chains are tightly bound to ConA and biantennary complex-type structures are weakly bound. In contrast, more extensively processed, highly branched or bisected forms do not bind to the lectin (20Bielinska M. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17113-17118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the N-glycans bound to HAI-2 are likely to contain the complex-type structure larger than biantennary structures. There are reports that the sugar chains of glycoproteins play roles in the regulation of folding, conformational stability, protease resistance, and intracellular trafficking (21Saito F. Tani A. Miyatake T. Yanagisawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22West C.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 72: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Dube S. Fisher J.W. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17516-17521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-glycans bound to HAI-2 might have similar roles in vivo. Both HAI-2 and HAI-1 are potent inhibitors of HGF activator, whereas the other Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors, APP, TFPI, and UTI, show little or no inhibitory activity toward HGF activator. Furthermore, serum serine protease inhibitors such as antithrombin III, C1-inhibitor, and α2-antiplasmin did not inhibit the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator (24Shimomura T. Miyazawa K. Komiyama Y. Hiraoka H. Naka D. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HAI-2 and HAI-1 function as specific inhibitors of HGF activatorin vivo. Expression levels of both HAI-2 and HAI-1 mRNA are low in some tissues such as the liver. In these tissues, the low level of the inhibitors may facilitate the action of HGF activator. Similar tissue distributions of mRNA of HAI-2 and HAI-1 were observed in various human adult and fetal tissues except adult testis, in which expression of HAI-2 mRNA is much higher than that of HAI-1 mRNA. Furthermore, about equal amounts of both inhibitors were detected in the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells. These results suggest that HAI-2 and HAI-1 simultaneously inhibit HGF activatorin vivo. However, these inhibitors have some different properties. As discussed above, different N-linked sugar chains are attached to the protein portion of HAI-2 and HAI-1. Further, HAI-2 was not adsorbed by the hydrophobic column whereas HAI-1 was, indicating that HAI-2 is more hydrophilic than HAI-1. These different properties may result in different inhibitory actions toward HGF activator. Thus, further characterization of HAI-2 and HAI-1 is needed to elucidate how these inhibitors act against HGF activatorin vivo."

In human K562 leukemia cells, PKC α is important for cellular differentiation and PKC βIIis required for proliferation. In this report, we assess the role of the atypical PKC isoform PKC ι in K562 leukemia cell physiology. K562 cells were stably transfected with expression plasmids containing the cDNA for human PKC ι in sense or antisense orientation to increase or decrease cellular PKC ι levels, respectively. Overexpression or inhibition of expression of PKC ι had no significant effect on the proliferative capacity of K562 cells nor their sensitivity to phorbol myristate acetate-induced cytostasis and megakaryocytic differentiation, suggesting that PKC ι does not play a critical role in these processes.

K562 cells, which are resistant to most apoptotic agents, undergo apoptosis when treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA).

Overexpression of the related atypical PKC ζ has no protective effect, demonstrating that the effect is isotype-specific.

Trayner I. Menaya J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PKC enzyme family can be divided into three subgroups: the calcium-dependent or cPKCs (alpha (α), beta I (βI), beta II (βII), and gamma (γ)); the novel or nPKCs (delta (δ), epsilon (ε), eta (η), theta (θ), and mu (μ)); and the atypical or aPKCs (zeta (ζ), iota (ι), and lambda (λ)) (reviewed in Ref. 2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar). These groupings are based on the presence or absence of functional domains that confer isotype-specific co-factor and activator requirements. Biochemical and immunologic studies indicate that multiple PKC isotypes are expressed in virtually all cell and tissue types (3Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A. Merchenthaler I. Rivera H. Halpern A.E. Phung H.M.

The expression of individual PKC isotypes is developmentally regulated (5Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Yoshida Y. Huang F.L. Nakabayshi H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9868-9873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is responsive to the differentiation state of many cell and tissue types (7Makowske M. Ballester R. Cayre Y. Rosen O.M. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is thought that PKC isotypes fulfill distinct, nonredundant functions within the cell. In human leukemia cells, we have provided direct evidence for PKC isotype specific function in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two conventional PKC isotypes expressed in these cells, PKC α and PKC βII play distinct roles in these cellular processes (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC α is involved in cellular differentiation and overexpression of PKC α leads to gene dose-dependent cytostasis and increased sensitivity to differentiating agents such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Michetti M. Sacco O. Cakiroglu A.G. Jackson J.F.

Protein Kinase C. R. G. Landes Press, Austin, TX1997: 97-120Google Scholar). In contrast, the levels of PKC βII correlate with the proliferative state of these cells, being lost when cells differentiate in response to PMA (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cellular proliferation is blocked when PKC βII expression is specifically inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKC βII, demonstrating that it is required for leukemia cell proliferation (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we identify and determine the function of the third major PKC isotype expressed in K562 cells, the atypical PKC ι. Using isotype-specific antibodies to atypical PKC ζ and PKC ι we demonstrate that K562 cells express PKC ι, but no detectable PKC ζ. We further demonstrate that PKC ι regulates cellular susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that PKC ι plays an important role in leukemia cell survival and suggest that PKC ι may be an attractive target for development of new chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of leukemia. Human erythroleukemia (K562) cells were maintained in suspension culture and induced to undergo cytostasis and megakaryocytic differentiation in response to PMA as described previously (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was induced in cells plated at 4 × 105 cells/ml in growth medium containing okadaic acid (OA; Alexis Biochemicals) or taxol at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the figure legends. Parental K562 cells and transfectants overexpressing PKC isotypes (see below) were monitored for proliferation rate by daily cell counting using a hemacytometer. Megakaryocytic differentiation was monitored by assessing expression of the megakaryocytic cell surface marker glycophorin IIIa/IIb (gpIIIa/IIb) by fluorescence activated cell sorting of cells stained with fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibody to gpIIIa/IIb (Dako) as described previously (11Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and was >95% in all untreated cultures. The full-length human PKC ι cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. T. Biden, Garvan Institute of Biomedical Research, Sydney, Australia) was excised from pAXNeoRX using (5′)SalI and (3′) BamHI and cloned into the (5′)XhoI and (3′) BamHI sites within the multiple cloning site of pREP4 and pREP10 to achieve sense and antisense orientations, respectively. The full-length human PKC ζ cDNA (kindly provided by Sphinx Pharmaceutical Co.) was excised from pBluescript using (5′) SpeI and (3′) KpnI and cloned into the (5′) NheI and (3′) KpnI sites of pREP10 in sense orientation. K562 cells were transfected with plasmid containing PKC ι or PKC ζ cDNA or with control plasmid and transfectants were selected and maintained as described previously (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were screened for PKC isotype expression by immunoblotting as described below. K562 cell transfectants were screened for PKC isotype expression by immunoblot analysis using isotype-specific PKC antibodies. Antibodies specific to PKC α and PKC βII were produced against peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of each isotype and were characterized previously (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody to PKC ζ/ι was produced against peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 576–592) of rat PKC ζ (12Baldassare J.J. Henderson P.A. Burns D. Loomis C. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isotype-specific antibodies to PKC ζ and PKC ι (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were generated against peptides corresponding to amino acids 2–21 within the divergent amino terminus of human PKC ζ and PKC ι, respectively. Following drug treatments, cells were harvested and DNA isolated as described previously (13Ray S. Ponnathpur V. Huang Y. Tang C. Mahoney M.E. Ibrado A.M. Bullock G. Bhalla K. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1994; 34: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed at 1 × 106 cells/100 μl in lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 50 °C for 3 h. RNase A was added to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cell lysates were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and precipitated with ethanol. The dried pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and DNA concentration determined spectrophotometrically. 2 μg of DNA/lane was subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Cellular DNA morphology was assessed by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and observation under phase-fluorescence optics as described previously (14Thompson L.T. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Images were captured using a Hamamatsu video camera and processed using Photoshop 5.0. In previous studies, we determined that the two calcium-dependent PKC isotypes expressed in human K562 leukemia cells, PKC α and PKC βII, play distinct functional roles in K562 cell physiology (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC α is involved in induction of cytostasis and differentiation, while PKC βII is required for cellular proliferation (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these two classical PKC isotypes, we detected expression of an atypical PKC, which we identified as PKC ζ based on immunoreactivity with an antipeptide antibody against the carboxyl terminus of rat PKC ζ (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent to our report, a second atypical PKC isotype was identified and cloned, termed PKC λ in mouse and PKC ι in human, that has high sequence homology to PKC ζ (15Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the carboxyl-terminal regions of human PKC ζ and PKC ι reveals extensive homology in the peptide region used to generate the PKC ζ antibody, raising the possibility that this antibody may cross-react with PKC ι. These findings led us to test the specificity of this antibody and to reexamine the expression of atypical PKC isotypes in K562 cells using isotype-specific antibodies to PKC ζ and PKC ι, generated against the divergent amino-terminal regions of these isotypes (Fig. 1). As observed previously (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the COOH-terminal anti-rat PKC ζ antibody recognizes a single band of molecular mass 74 kDa in K562 cell lysates (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). In addition, this antibody recognizes human PKC ζ when overexpressed in K562 cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) and purified recombinant baculovirus-expressed human PKC ζ (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). However this antibody also recognized a 74-kDa band of increased intensity in lysates from K562 cells transfected with the human PKC ι cDNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), indicating that it also recognizes PKC ι. In contrast, an isotype-specific PKC ζ antibody recognizes PKC ζ overexpressed in K562 cells and recombinant purified PKC ζ (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4) but fails to recognize a band in either parental K562 cells or cell transfectants overexpressing PKC ι (Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2). Conversely, a PKC ι-specific antibody recognizes a 74-kDa band in K562 cells (Fig.1 C, lane 1) whose intensity is increased in PKC ι-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). This PKC ι antibody does not recognize PKC ζ when expressed in K562 cells or recombinant baculovirus-expressed human PKC ζ (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 4), demonstrating its specificity for PKC ι. From these results we conclude that the carboxyl-terminal rat PKC ζ antibody used in our previous studies (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recognizes both human PKC ζ and PKC ι, whereas the amino-terminal PKC ζ and PKC ι antibodies recognize their respective antigens specifically. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that K562 cells express PKC ι, but no detectable PKC ζ. Having identified the atypical PKC isotype expressed in K562 cells as PKC ι, we wished to evaluate its functional role. For this purpose, we stably transfected K562 cells with expression plasmids containing the full-length cDNA for human PKC ι in either sense or antisense orientation or with cDNA for human PKC ζ. Immunoblot analysis with the PKC ι-specific antibody demonstrated that these cell lines express either enhanced (Fig.2 A, lane 2) or reduced (Fig.2 A, lane 3) levels of PKC ι, respectively, when compared with control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) or those expressing PKC ζ (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Importantly, the changes in the expression level of PKC ι or PKC ζ seen in these transfectants had no effect on the level of expression of PKC α and PKC βII (Fig. 2, B and C). Therefore, the changes in PKC ι and PKC ζ expression do not lead to compensatory changes in the levels of other PKC isotypes. Having established cell lines selectively overexpressing or inhibited from expressing PKC ι, we next investigated the role of PKC ι in K562 cell physiology. First, we assessed whether, like PKC βII (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKC ι was involved in K562 cell proliferation (Fig.3 A). Neither overexpression or antisense inhibition of expression of PKC ι had a significant effect on the proliferation rate of K562 cells, suggesting that PKC ι functions in signaling pathways that are not rate-limiting for normal K562 cell proliferation. It is possible that the very low level of PKC ι expressed in antisense PKC ι cells is sufficient to support cellular proliferation; however, these results are clearly distinct from our previous findings with PKC βII, in which antisense inhibition of PKC βII expression led to dramatic inhibition of K562 cell proliferation (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next determined whether PKC ι is important for K562 cell differentiation. Treatment of K562 cells with PMA induces cytostasis and megakaryocytic differentiation (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that PMA-induced cytostasis is mediated, at least in part, by PKC α (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PMA induces increased expression of PKC α, and overexpression of PKC α confers a gene dose-dependent reduction in proliferative capacity and increased susceptibility to PMA-induced cytostasis (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Murray N.R. Thompson L.T. Fields A.P. Parker P.J. Dekker L.V. Protein Kinase C. R. G. Landes Press, Austin, TX1997: 97-120Google Scholar). The expression of PKC ι is also induced by PMA treatment (8Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC ι may also participate in PMA-induced cytostasis and differentiation. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of overexpression and antisense inhibition of expression of PKC ι on PMA-induced cytostasis and megakaryocytic differentiation (Fig.3 B). Cells expressing increased or decreased levels of PKC ι showed the same susceptibility to PMA-induced cytostasis as cells carrying control vector. Furthermore, expression of the megakaryocytic marker gpIIIa/IIb was unaffected by changes in PKC ι expression (Fig.3 C). These results indicate that PKC ι does not play a determinant role in PMA-induced cytostasis or megakaryocytic differentiation. We next determined whether PKC ι plays a role in K562 cell survival and drug-induced apoptosis. K562 cells are resistant to many apoptotic agents (17Ritke M.K. Rusnak J.M. Lazo J.S. Allan W.P. Dive C. Heer S. Yalowich J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 605-611PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ray S. Bullock G. Nunez G. Tang C. Ibrado A.M. Huang Y. Bhalla K. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 1617-1623PubMed Google Scholar) but can be induced to undergo apoptosis in response to the protein phosphatase inhibitor OA (19Zheng B. Chambers T.C. Raynor R.L. Markham P.N. Gebel H.M. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12332-12338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether K562 cells overexpressing or inhibited from expressing PKC ι differ in their sensitivity to OA-induced apoptosis. First, parental K562 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of OA to establish conditions that induce apoptosis as measured by a standard interchromosomal DNA fragmentation assay (Fig.4 A). OA induces dose-dependent apoptosis when cells are treated for 24 h, with a maximal effective dose of about 45 nm. These results are consistent with the reported IC50 of 10 nm for OA-induced cytotoxicity in K562 cells (19Zheng B. Chambers T.C. Raynor R.L. Markham P.N. Gebel H.M. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12332-12338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these data, we chose to use 30 nm OA, a dose that gave demonstrable, but submaximal, DNA fragmentation, to assess the effect of selective overexpression and antisense inhibition of expression of PKC ι on OA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). Overexpression of PKC ι leads to enhanced resistance to OA-induced DNA fragmentation when compared with control cells (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 4 and 2). In contrast, antisense inhibition of PKC ι leads to increased sensitivity to OA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 8 and2). The protective effect of PKC ι is isotype-selective, since overexpression of the related atypical PKC isotype, PKC ζ to similar levels gave no demonstrable protection from OA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 6 and2). Interestingly, overexpression of PKC ι also protects K562 cells from apoptosis induced by taxol (Fig. 4 C, lane 4), whereas inhibition of expression of PKC ι enhances taxol-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 C, lane 6). These results demonstrate that the protective effects of PKC ι are not specific for OA-induced apoptosis. As an independent measure of apoptosis, we next examined nuclear DNA morphology of control and OA-treated cells. Cells undergoing apoptosis exhibit apoptotic nuclear DNA morphology characterized by highly condensed chromosomal masses, nuclear swelling, and formation of apoptotic bodies (20Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). Therefore, control cells and those expressing increased or decreased levels of PKC ι were treated with 30 nm OA and nuclear morphology was visualized using the fluorescent DNA dye DAPI (Fig. 4 D). The nuclear morphology of cells expressing enhanced or reduced levels of PKC ι was identical to control cells in the absence of OA, indicating that changes in PKC ι expression have no direct effect on DNA morphology (data not shown). However, control and PKC ι-overexpressing cells treated with 30 nm OA (Fig. 4 D, panels 2 and 3, respectively) displayed mitotic chromosomal condensation, consistent with the known mitotic arrest induced by OA in K562 cells (22Zheng B. Woo C.F. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10031-10034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing reduced levels of PKC ι exhibit a more pronounced apoptotic effect on DNA morphology, including the presence of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 4 D, panel 4, arrowhead). These results are consistent with the DNA fragmentation data (Fig. 3), and support the conclusion that the level of expression of PKC ι is a key determinant of cellular susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis. PKC ι is a member of the atypical PKC subfamily. These enzymes lack a calcium-binding domain and contain only one cysteine-rich zinc finger (15Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, as such, are not calcium-dependent and are not activated by phorbol esters or diacylglycerol (15Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the in vivo activators and cofactor requirements of the atypical PKCs. Recent studies indicate that the atypical PKCs can be activated by phosphatidylinositol phosphates, specifically those phosphorylated in the 3 position by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (23Nakanishi H. Breuer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by ceramide generated by sphingomyelinase (24Mueller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These second messengers have been linked to a number of cellular functions including mitogenesis and cell survival. Early reports suggested that PKC λ/ι is critical forXenopus maturation and cellular proliferation in mouse fibroblasts (25Dominguez I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Muncio M.M. Berra E. Garcia de Herreros A.

Other studies have placed PKC λ/ι downstream of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor in the activation of AP-1 (27Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Our present data demonstrate that PKC ι plays a critical role in human leukemia cell survival, particularly in the presence of apoptotic stimuli, and indicate that the atypical PKC isotypes may be involved in cell survival in response to many types of cellular stress. Further studies will be required to elucidate the specific pathways in which PKC ι participates to mediate its anti-apoptotic effects. Future studies will focus on the role of cellular phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol phosphates and ceramides, and of the recently identified atypical PKC binding proteins (30Diaz-Meco M.T.

The wild-type VHL (wt-VHL) gene product acts to suppress VPF/VEGF expression, which is overexpressed when wt-VHL is inactive. The present study investigated the pathways by which VHL regulates VPF/VEGF expression. We found that inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) represses VPF/VEGF expression in RCC cells that regularly overexpress VPF/VEGF. The wt-VHL expressed by stably transfected RCC cells forms cytoplasmic complexes with two specific PKC isoforms, ζ and δ, and prevents their translocation to the cell membrane where they otherwise would engage in signaling steps that lead to VPF/VEGF overexpression. Other experiments implicated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation as a downstream step in PKC regulation of VPF/VEGF expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that wt-VHL, by neutralizing PKC isoforms ζ and δ and thereby inhibiting MAPK activation, plays an important role in preventing aberrant VPF/VEGF overexpression and the angiogenesis that results from such overexpression.

Sporadic RCC as well as the RCC and other tumors that arise in patients with the VHL syndrome are characteristically well vascularized, a property that has been attributed to their consistent overexpression of the potent angiogenic factor, vascular permeability factor, also known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) (12Leung D.W.

Several different mechanisms have been shown to up-regulate VPF/VEGF expression in different tumors and also in non-tumorigenic cells; these include hypoxia, cytokines such as transforming growth factor-α and platelet-derived growth factor, hormones, and more recently, certain oncogenes including activated forms of Src and Ras (17Shweiki D.

Recent reports have shown that the VHL tumor suppressor gene down-regulates VPF/VEGF gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B.

A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In addition, the wild-type VHL (wt-VHL) gene product represses VPF/VEGF expression by inhibiting Sp1/transcriptional (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that steps in the Ras pathway may also play an important role in up-regulating VPF/VEGF expression in RCC (26Uchida T. Wada C. Wang C. Egawa S. Ohtani H. Koshiba K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3682-3685PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fujita J. Kraus M.H. Onoue H. Srivastava S.K. Ebi Y. Kitamura Y. Rhim J.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5251-5255PubMed Google Scholar). The present experiments were undertaken to elucidate more fully the role of VHL in regulating VPF/VEGF expression in RCC. We hypothesized that the wt-VHL gene product acts to inhibit steps in a signaling cascade that involves several protein kinases, including PKC. Here we present evidence in favor of this hypothesis, demonstrating that 1) PKC inhibitors repress the overexpression of VPF/VEGF characteristic of RCC cells, 2) wt-VHL protein complexes selectively with PKC ζ and δ, preventing the translocation of these PKC isoforms to the cell membrane and thereby interrupting a signaling cascade that involves MAP kinase, and 3) PKC δ, but not PKC ζ, complexes directly with wt-VHL protein. A human renal carcinoma cell line (786-O) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). 786-O clonal cell lines stably transfected with either pRC (Neo cells; cells contain empty vector withneo cassette), pRC-HAVHL (VHL cells; cells expressing wt-VHL), or pRC-HAVHL-(1–115) (VHL-(1–115) or ΔVHL cells; cells expressing deletion mutation of VHL) were gifts from W. G. Kaelin and were grown in complete media supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml) (28Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated and Northern blots were performed as described previously (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Bolts were washed at high stringency and quantitated by laser densitometry. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitations were carried out in antibody excess, using 0.5 mg of total protein with either affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (1 μg of IgG) against PKC isoforms (Chemicon International Inc., CA) or with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μg) directed against VHL (gift from O. Iliopoulos and W. G. Kaelin). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Western blot analysis was carried out as described earlier (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cell samples were prepared and insoluble and soluble components were isolated as manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Afterward, extracts were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies to PKC ζ and δ, and kinase assays were performed using the Pierce colorimetric PKC assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. We used two different synthetic peptides (glycogen synthase, product 29510, and neurogranin peptide, product 29580) as PKC substrates. A standard curve was generated for each experiment using an appropriate PKC standard with known activity (supplied by Pierce), and PKC activity of each sample was measured using that standard curve. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, the glutathione-Sepharose beads bound with GST-fused VHL proteins were incubated with purified PKC isoforms (50 ng, PanVera Corp., WI). The beads were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed four times with cold binding buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and blots were performed with antibodies to specific PKC isoforms. Earlier work had shown that the wt-VHL gene suppresses VPF/VEGF expression in RCC and that genistein, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, inhibits hypoxia-induced VPF/VEGF overexpression (19Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). We had also shown that genistein at a level of 100 μm suppressed completely the high base-line VPF/VEGF expression characteristic of RCC cells (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggested that wt-VHL regulated VPF/VEGF expression by interacting with a signaling pathway that involved protein tyrosine kinases. To test this hypothesis further, we studied the effects of several more specific kinase inhibitors on the expression of VPF/VEGF mRNA in a renal carcinoma cell line, 786-0, which constitutively overexpresses VPF/VEGF. Staurosporine, a potent and specific PKC inhibitor, suppressed basal VPF/VEGF expression by 90% at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig.1). However, VPF/VEGF mRNA levels were not significantly altered by H89, a PKA inhibitor, or by GO6976, a selective inhibitor of the α and β PKC isoforms (Fig. 1). These data indicate that activation of VPF/VEGF mRNA in RCC is mediated through PKC but not through its α or β isoforms or by PKA. To investigate further the interaction between VHL and PKC in regulating VPF/VEGF expression, we looked for a possible physical interaction between the VHL gene product and various PKC isoforms. To that end, we prepared lysates of wt-VHL cells (VHL) and immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified antibodies specific for various PKC isoforms, followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against wt-VHL protein. In the case of immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to PKC ζ and PKC δ, Western blots revealed intense bands (ζ > δ). Very weak VHL-positive bands were also detected when immunoprecipitates were prepared with antibodies against the α or ε isoforms of PKC (Fig. 2,a–d). However, no detectable band was found against the β, γ, and μ PKC isoforms (data not shown). In contrast, anti-VHL reactive protein bands were not detected in Western blots of immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to PKC isoforms on cell extracts of either RCC cells transfected with an emptyneo cassette (neo-786-O cells, Neo) or stably transfected with a deletion mutation of VHL (VHL-(1–115), ΔVHL) (Fig. 2, a–d). In the case of VHL-(1–115) cells, these findings could not be attributed to a failure of protein expression because VHL-(1–115) cells contained mutant VHL protein in amounts comparable with those of wt-VHL protein present in VHL cells (Fig.2 e). Also, making use of split samples, we determined that the levels of PKC isoforms were similar in all three cell lines (Fig.2, a–d). We also performed reciprocal experiments. Extracts were prepared from the same three cell lines and were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against VHL, followed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for PKC isoforms α, β, δ, ε, γ, ζ, and μ. Only extracts of wt-VHL-expressing cell lines formed complexes that reacted with anti-PKC ζ (Fig. 2 f). Surprisingly, we were unable to detect a band that reacted with anti-PKC δ, in wt-VHL extracts, perhaps because of the low blotting sensitivity of the anti-PKC δ antibody. As expected, no bands were detected with antibodies to PKC isoforms α, β, ε, γ, and μ. We next determined the subcellular localization of wt-VHL protein and of its complexes with PKC isoforms ζ and δ. Cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared from extracts of Neo and VHL cells. Western blots with antibodies to VHL revealed that the great bulk of VHL was found in the cytoplasmic fraction of VHL cells; as expected, VHL protein was not detected in cytoplasmic or membrane fractions of the Neo cells (Fig.3 a). We next immunoprecipitated these cytoplasmic extracts with antisera against PKC ζ and δ. We found VHL-reactive bands in cytoplasmic fractions (Fig.3, b and c) but not in membrane fractions (data not shown) of VHL cells. Thus, PKC ζ and δ complexes were localized primarily to the cytoplasm. We immunoprecipitated cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of the RCC cell lines with antibodies to PKC ζ and blotted these with the same antibody. Fig.3 d shows that the amount of PKC ζ present in the membrane fraction of the wt-VHL-expressing cell line is significantly lower than that present in its cytoplasmic fraction. In contrast, relatively more PKC ζ was found in the membrane fractions (as compared with the cytoplasmic fractions) of Neo and VHL-(1–115) (ΔVHL) cells. We measured PKC activity in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of these same immunocomplexes using a colorimetric assay. Levels of PKC ζ activity in the cytoplasmic fraction of wt-VHL-expressing cells were higher than those in cytoplasmic fractions of either Neo or VHL-(1–115) cells but did not quite achieve statistical significance (analysis of variance, p = 0.06, Fig. 3 e). However, PKC ζ activity was significantly reduced in membrane preparations of VHL cells compared with membrane preparations of Neo or VHL-(1–115) cells (p < 0.005). Also, the amount of PKC activity found in VHL cell cytoplasmic fractions was significantly greater than that found in membrane preparations of these same cells (p < 0.005, Student's t test), whereas no significant differences in activity were found in cytoplasmicversus membrane fractions of Neo or VHL-(1–115) cells. We obtained similar results with anti-PKC δ antibody. Also similar results were obtained when we used neurogranin peptide as PKC substrate (data not shown). Together these data are consistent with the hypothesis that wt-VHL binds PKC ζ and δ in the cytoplasm, preventing their translocation to the cell membrane. The experiments just described did not determine whether the cytoplasmic complexes of wt-VHL with PKC ζ or δ resulted from a direct interaction between these proteins or required the presence of additional components. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed in vitro association experiments using GST-VHL fusion proteins and recombinant PKC ζ and δ isoforms. Bacterially expressed GST protein alone or GST protein fused to full-length wt-VHL or VHL-(1–115) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and these were mixed with purified recombinant PKC ζ or δ in a buffer designed to approximate intracellular ionic concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). After suitable incubation and extensive washing with the same buffer, the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with antibodies to PKC ζ and δ. We observed a strong association of PKC δ, but not PKC ζ, with immobilized wt-VHL (Fig. 3 f). These results indicate that PKC δ interacted directly with wt-VHL protein; in contrast, wt-VHL did not interact directly with PKC ζ, and therefore the wt-VHL-PKC ζ complex that forms in living cells must involve additional as yet unidentified component(s). MAPK is a downstream target of both PKC ζ and PKC δ (30Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To determine whether wt-VHL interferes with downstream signaling of these PKC isoforms, we examined the status of the activated form of MAPK (phospho-MAPK) in VHL cells as well as in the Neo and VHL-(1–115) cells. Total levels of MAP kinase were similar in all three cell lines. However, we found significantly lower levels of phospho-MAPK in VHL cells than in the two, non-wt-VHL-expressing cell lines (Fig.4 a). These results provide further evidence that formation of wt-VHL-PKC complexes in VHL cells prevents PKC translocation to the cell membrane and thus subsequent activation of MAPK. To determine whether phosphorylation of MAPK has an effect on VPF/VEGF expression, we treated RCC cells with a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK), PD098059, and examined VPF/VEGF mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis (33Watts S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1541-1550PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 bshows that PD098059 reduced VPF/VEGF mRNA levels by 80% as compared with the untreated control. These data suggest that MEK activation and MAPK phosphorylation have a role in the overexpression of VPF/VEGF found in RCC. The data presented here investigated the mechanisms by which VHL regulates VPF/VEGF expression in RCC. In accord with earlier work, we found that a PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, repressed VPF/VEGF expression in RCC cells whereas inhibitors of PKC α or β or of PKA did not. Also, the wt-VHL tumor suppressor gene product formed selective complexes with two specific PKC isoforms (ζ > δ) in wt-VHL-expressing cells. The interaction of wt-VHL protein with recombinant PKC δ was replicated in vitro; however, wt-VHL did not complex directly with PKC ζ, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified, components are required for wt-VHL-PKC ζ complex formation. The complexes that formed in cells between wt-VHL and PKC ζ and δ were localized primarily in cell cytoplasm. Also, more PKC ζ and δ activity was found in the cytoplasm of wt-VHL cells than in either Neo or VHL-(1–115) cells that lacked wt-VHL; conversely, more PKC ζ and δ activity was found in cell membrane fractions of Neo and VHL-(1–115) cells than in wt-VHL-expressing RCC. In addition, although total amounts of MAPK were roughly equivalent in cells that lacked or expressed wt-VHL, significantly less activated (phosphorylated) MAPK was found in cells expressing wt-VHL than in cells that did not express the VHL protein. Finally, an inhibitor of MEK led to reduced expression of VPF/VEGF mRNA in RCC cells. Taken together, we propose that wt-VHL, as expressed in VHL cells, forms complexes with PKC ζ and δ, thereby retaining these PKC isoforms in the cytoplasm and preventing them from translocating to the cell membrane where they could engage in downstream signaling. In contrast, when wt-VHL protein was not available, as in Neo or VHL-(1–115) cells, PKC ζ and δ were free to translocate to the cell membrane where they engaged in downstream signaling that led to the VPF/VEGF overexpression characteristic of cell lines lacking wt-VHL. PKC ζ is known to be critically important for regulating a number of cell functions, including proliferation and activation of nuclear factor NF-κB (34Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Israel N. Bachelerie F.

Previous studies indicated that PKC ζ acts downstream of Ras in the kinase cascade leading to mitogenesis (30Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,32Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Ras initiates a kinase cascade that culminates in the activation of MAP kinase, which is required for cell growth and other cellular responses. We also identified activation of MAPK as a downstream signaling step in the VHL cascade leading to the regulation of VPF/VEGF expression. Thus, although total levels of MAPK were similar in all three cell lines, levels of phospho-MAPK were significantly higher in Neo and VHL-(1–115) cells which lacked wt-VHL than in VHL cells which expressed wt-VHL. Further, selective inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation significantly inhibited VPF/VEGF expression. All of these data, therefore, support a model in which wt-VHL, by forming a cytoplasmic complex with PKC ζ and δ, prevents their translocation to the cell membrane and where they would otherwise initiate signaling steps leading to MAPK phosphorylation and subsequently VPF/VEGF overexpression. Of relevance, Oka et al. (38Oka H. Chatani Y. Hoshino R. Ogawa O. Kakehi Y. Terachi T. Okada Y. Kawaichi M. Kohno M. Yoshida O. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4182-4187PubMed Google Scholar) also demonstrated that constitutive activation of MAPKs may be associated with the carcinogenesis of human RCCs. Earlier studies suggested that VHL inhibits VPF/VEGF expression in RCC by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (23Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P.

The present studies have identified additional, PKC-mediated mechanisms whereby VHL controls VPF/VEGF expression. Current experiments seek to determine whether these mechanisms affect transcription or act to decrease the stability of VPF/VEGF mRNA."

Activation of δ (DOR), μ (MOR) opioid, or β2-adrenergic receptors increased K+ conductance in oocytes coexpressing the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits GIRK1 and GIRK4, and the intrinsic rate of desensitization was small. Coexpression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 (β-ARK2) and β-arrestin 2 (β-arr2) synergistically produced a rapid desensitization of both DOR and β2-adrenergic receptor signaling with a t½ < 4 min. β-ARK2 and β-arr2 more slowly desensitized MOR responses; a similar synergistic effect on MOR required 2–3 h of agonist treatment. DOR mutants lacking serine and threonine residues at the end of the cytoplasmic tail coupled effectively to GIRK channels but were insensitive to β-ARK2 and β-arr2. However, a DOR mutant having serine residues mutated to alanine in the third cytoplasmic loop was indistinguishable in coupling and desensitization from the wild type DOR. These studies establish that opioid receptors can be regulated by β-ARK2 and β-arr2 and that a portion of the COOH terminus of DOR enhances sensitivity to this modulation.

Opioid agonists are the drugs of choice in the management of severe and chronic pain; however, continuous use of opioids can cause undesirable side effects including drug tolerance and addiction. The processes underlying tolerance are complex and involve learning mechanisms, compensatory changes in neuronal circuits, and desensitization of signal transduction mechanisms (1Nestler E.J. Hope B.T. Widnell K.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 995-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Three classes of opioid receptors: μ, δ, and κ, have been defined pharmacologically, shown to couple to G proteins of the Gi/Go family, and cloned (2Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol.

Chronic treatment of animals with opiates has not revealed a functionally significant change in opioid receptor number (4Hollt V. Dum J. Blasig J. Schubert P. Herz A.

However, opioid receptor desensitization has been consistently implicated as one of the molecular events accompanying tolerance (9Trujillo K.A. Akil H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 915-923PubMed Google Scholar). Continuous infusion of guinea pigs or rats with morphine results in an uncoupling of μ opioid receptors from associated G proteins as measured biochemically (10Werling L.L. McMahon P.N. Cox B.M.

Recordings from single rat brain neurons of the locus coeruleus show a homologous desensitization to opioid-induced increases in potassium conductance after chronic morphine treatment (12Christie M.J.

Selley D.E. Dworkin S.I. Childers S.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2684-2692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic morphine treatment of rats also led to a homologous (e.g. receptor-specific) desensitization of either δ or μ opioid receptor activity as measured by the ability of specific agonists to inhibit adenylyl cyclase in several brain structures (14Noble F. Cox B.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Termination of signaling of other G protein-coupled receptors results from agonist-dependent phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and subsequent binding of arrestins (15Sterne M.R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol.

Data implicating similar mechanisms in opioid receptor desensitization have emerged. G protein-coupled receptor kinase levels are increased in rat locus coeruleus after morphine administration (18Terwilliger R.Z. Ortiz J. Guitart X. Nestler E.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1983-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (β-ARK1), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, blocks κ opioid desensitization in COS-7 cells (19Raynor K. Kong H. Hines J. Kong G. Benovic J. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1381-1386PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, agonist-dependent phosphorylation of opioid receptors accompanies desensitization (20Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Arden J. Sad'ee W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Agonist-dependent desensitization and phosphorylation of the δ opioid receptor was enhanced by overexpression of β-ARK1 (20Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar); however, the effect of other G protein-coupled receptor kinases on δ opioid receptor desensitization, the contribution of arrestins, and the regions of the δ opioid receptor involved in receptor uncoupling remains to be elucidated. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying opioid receptor desensitization, we studied the regulation of the coupling between opioid receptors and potassium channels coexpressed inXenopus oocytes. In many neuronal types, stimulation of opioid receptors activates G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK channel) conductance (23Grudt T.J. Williams J.T. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the δ, μ, and κ opioid receptors functionally couple to a GIRK conductance in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA for the receptor and the GIRK1 channel subunit (24Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). We found that sustained agonist exposure caused the channel response to desensitize. Attenuation of the response was heterologous, since it resulted from changes in coupling downstream of the receptor (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which hindered our studies investigating homologous receptor desensitization mechanisms. We now report that in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing the GIRK4 subunit in addition to GIRK1, little desensitization of opioid receptor-activated GIRK conductance was observed. Mammalian cell lines endogenously express many proteins involved in receptor desensitization and down-regulation including members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, arrestins, clathrin, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. Reconstitution experiments in cell lines performed while investigating opioid receptor desensitization are complicated by rapid receptor sequestration and down-regulation (26Henry D.J. Grandy D.K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we exploit the absence of endogenous opioid receptor desensitization in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing the GIRK1 and GIRK4 channel subunits to examine the effect of exogenously expressed β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 (β-ARK2) and β-arrestin 2 (β-arr2) on μ and δ opioid receptor activity. DPDPE and DAMGO were from Peninsula Laboratories. Naloxone was from Research Biochemicals International. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The mouse DOR cDNA (28Kieffer B.L. Befort K.

Construction of DOR LS (S242A, S247A, S249A, S255A) and DOR TS (T352A, T353A, T358A, T361A, S363A) mutants was performed as described previously for the construction of a different mutant DOR (29Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar), except that mixtures of oligonucleotides were annealed to single-stranded templates to generate multiple mutations. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were as follows: GCCTGCGCGCCGTGCGTC (S242A), CTGCTGGCCGGTGCCAAGG (S247A,S249A), AGGACCGCGCCCTGCGGC (S255A), CCAGGCCGCCGCGCGTGA (T352A,T353A), GAGCGTGTCGCTGCCCTGC (T358A), and GCCTGCGCCCCCGCCGACG (T361A,S363A). The δ tail truncation mutant DOR TT encodes the mouse DOR receptor with a 33-amino acid COOH-terminal deletion and was constructed by excision of a NotI fragment encompassing part of the 3′-coding sequence as well as the entire 3′-noncoding region. The rat μ opioid receptor clone obtained from Dr. Lei Yu (GenBankTMaccession number L13069) was put into the pCS2+ vector such that the SP6 promoter directed sense transcripts. Mu opioid receptor cDNA template was also generated using polymerase chain reaction as described previously (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Gαs cDNA was that described by Graziano et al. (30Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). cDNA for the β2-adrenergic receptor and GIRK1 channel were as described (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). GIRK4 (clone provided by Dr. John Adelman, GenBankTM accession number X83584) and β-arr2 cDNA (clone provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, GenBankTMaccession number M91590) was first amplified by the utilization of Amplitaq DNA Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a standard polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides designed to add a T7 promoter region and a 45-base poly(A) tail. The rat β-ARK2 cDNA was provided by Dr. Shaun Coughlin (31Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid templates for all constructs including DOR and DOR mutants were linearized prior to cRNA synthesis, and mMESSAGE MACHINE kits (Ambion Corp.) were used to generate capped cRNA. Oocytes were prepared as described (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and were incubated for 3–7 days after injection of the cRNA in normal oocyte saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) solution supplemented with sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm) and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). See below for the composition of the recording buffer. cRNA was injected (50 nl/oocyte) with a Drummond microinjector. Oocytes were clamped at −80 mV with two electrodes filled with 3 m KCl having resistances of 0.5–1.5 megaohms, using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier and pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments). All data were digitally recorded (Digidata, Axon Instruments, and Intel 386PC) and filtered. Membrane current traces were also recorded using a chart recorder. To enable inward K+ currents to flow through the GIRK channels, the normal oocyte saline buffer was modified to increase KCl concentration to the K+ concentration values described under “Results.” The concentration of NaCl was correspondingly decreased to maintain isoosmolarity. We used Student's t test for comparison of the independent means. Values given are two-tailedp values. Data from the dose response experiments were fitted to a simple Emax model using the nonlinear regression analysis package PCNONLIN version 4.2 (SCI Software) to determine the EC50 and 95% confidence intervals. Previously we reported that DAMGO, a selective μ opioid agonist, elicited a GIRK conductance in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA for the μ opioid receptor (MOR) and the GIRK channel subunit GIRK1 (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In those studies, the expression of functional GIRK channels was dependent upon the formation of heteromultimers between the exogenously expressed GIRK1 subunit and the endogenously expressedXenopus GIRK4 homologue, GIRK5 (32Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As shown previously, the total potassium current flowing through the GIRK channels in those oocytes was relatively small (Fig.1 A, Ref. 25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) since the endogenously expressed levels of GIRK5 limited the expression of functional GIRK channels. The modest expression of GIRK channels required that the conductance of the channel and the electrochemical driving force be enhanced by perfusing the cell with a high K+ saline buffer containing 96 mmK+ (Fig. 1 A, Ref. 25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to measure MOR-GIRK coupling reliably, it was necessary to inject oocytes with high levels of cRNA for MOR (1 ng) and the GIRK1 channel subunit (1–2 ng) (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Sustained agonist exposure led to a slow reduction in the evoked current (Fig. 1 A) that was previously shown to be a result of changes occurring downstream of the receptor (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This heterologous desensitization limited the utility of this system in investigating homologous receptor desensitization mechanisms. The expression of functional GIRK channels was greatly enhanced by the coexpression of both GIRK1 and GIRK4 channel subunits that have been shown to assemble as heteromultimers (33Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovi'c B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In Xenopusoocytes coinjected with cRNA for both GIRK1 and GIRK4 channel subunits (0.02 ng each), large inward currents were observed even in lower K+-containing solutions (Fig. 1 B). The μ opioid agonist, DAMGO, elicited a substantial activation of GIRK conductance in oocytes injected with as little as 0.02 ng of MOR cRNA. Under these conditions, prolonged MOR activation by DAMGO produced no desensitization of the inward current (Fig. 1 B). The amplitudes of the MOR-activated inward currents could be varied over a large range (50–1500 nA in 16 mm K+ recording buffer) by injecting oocytes with various amounts of MOR cRNA (0.005–0.2 ng). No significant acute desensitization of the receptor-elicited GIRK current was observed across this large range of MOR functional expression (data not shown). The absence of desensitization of the receptor-elicited GIRK responses allowed us to characterize the effect of exogenously expressed β-ARK2 and β-arr2 on receptor activity. In our investigation of the modulation of opioid receptor signaling by β-ARK2 and β-arr2, we tested for the functional expression of the β-ARK2 and β-arr2 combination by coexpressing the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) in the same cells. In addition to activation by Gi/Go-coupled receptors, GIRK channels inXenopus oocytes can also be activated by the Gs-coupled β2-AR but only in those cells coinjected with cRNA for Gαs (34Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, control oocytes were injected with a mixture of cRNA for β2-AR, Gαs, δ opioid receptor (DOR), MOR, GIRK1, and GIRK4. In the control oocytes, application of 1 μm isoproterenol evoked a GIRK current that decayed at a rate of about 8% of the peak response/min (Fig.2). Since phosphorylation of the β2-AR by protein kinase A inhibits coupling to Gαs and causes desensitization of the receptor (35Roth N.S. Campbell P.T. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6201-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the slow desensitization of the response to isoproterenol possibly reflects an effect of the activation of the endogenous oocyte cAMP system by the activated β2-AR. The coexpression of either β-arr2 or β-ARK2 alone did not significantly increase the rate of response desensitization compared with control. As predicted (see Refs. 15Sterne M.R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar), coexpression of both β-ARK2 and β-arr2 increased the rate of β2-AR desensitization by more than 2-fold and suggested functional expression of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 following the injection of their cRNA transcripts. DOR signaling was desensitized in an even more dramatic manner by the combination of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 (Fig.2). Injection of cRNA for either β-ARK2 or β-arr2 alone (along with receptor and channel) did not produce this rapid desensitization. The increased rate of desensitization of β2-AR and DOR signaling caused by the coexpression of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 was not produced by any changes in functional receptor expression. In the example shown (Fig. 2), the mean peak isoproterenol-induced inward current was 195 ± 13 nA (± S.E.) in the control oocytes and 225 ± 22 nA in cells injected with β-ARK2 and β-arr2 cRNA. The peak response of control oocytes to δ receptor activation could be varied by changing the amount of DOR cRNA injected and also differed from oocyte batch to batch (50–1500 nA). However, the normalized DOR desensitization rate of control oocytes never exceeded 8%/min. The normalized desensitization rate of DOR in oocytes containing functional β-ARK2 and β-arr2 was always significantly greater than 8%/min (p < 0.001). Strikingly, this combination of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 was much less effective in desensitizing MOR signaling acutely (Fig. 2). After 5 min of DAMGO application (40 nm, the EC90 value), MOR desensitization in oocytes expressing β-ARK2 and β-arr2 was not significantly different from control (Fig. 2 B). The differing sensitivities of MOR and DOR to β-ARK2 and β-arr2 modulation was not explained by differences in receptor expression. We examined the desensitization rate of the DAMGO response in β-ARK2- and β-arr2-expressing oocytes that had been injected with different amounts of MOR cRNA (0.02–0.64 ng/oocyte). Using the gene expression conditions described, the peak amplitude of the agonist-induced response was limited by the levels of receptor, not channel, expression. Over a wide range of MOR expression (peak DAMGO elicited currents ranging from 50 to 2000 nA), the normalized desensitization rate calculated after 5–10 min of DAMGO perfusion in β-ARK2- and β-arr2-expressing oocytes was never significantly different from control (data not shown). The amount of desensitization evident after 5–10 min of treatment with a higher DAMGO concentration (1 μm) was also not significantly different from control (data not shown). These results indicate that the intrinsic molecular properties of DOR confer a greater sensitivity than MOR to modulation by β-ARK2 and β-arr2. The putative first, second, and third intracellular loops of MOR and DOR are nearly identical in their primary structure (Fig.3). However, the amino acid sequences diverge considerably in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail. Agonist-dependent desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors mediated by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases follows from the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in either the third cytoplasmic loop or the carboxyl-terminal tail (15Sterne M.R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol.

Consequently, we tested a truncated DOR construct in which all residues beyond Arg339 in the carboxyl-terminal tail were deleted (DOR TT). Similar to the wild type DOR, this construct coupled efficiently to GIRK. However, agonist-dependent desensitization upon coexpression of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 was significantly less than wild type DOR and was similar to the desensitization rate of MOR (Fig. 4). To confirm that the rapid desensitization of DOR followed from phosphorylation of specific threonine and serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail, a mutant DOR was constructed in which the five serine and threonine phosphorylation sites at the end of the tail were substituted with alanines (DOR TS) (Fig. 3 B). The desensitization rate for DOR TS in the presence of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 was also markedly reduced (Fig. 4).Figure 4Effect of DOR mutations on β-ARK2- and β-arr2-facilitated desensitization. Control oocytes were injected with 0.1 ng of wild type DOR, DOR LS, DOR TT, or DOR TS and with 0.02 ng each of GIRK1 and GIRK4. Some of the control oocytes were also injected with 0.5 ng of β-ARK2 and 1 ng of β-arr2.A, representative traces depicting base line-subtracted responses to 40 nm DPDPE (horizontal line) were followed for at least 4 min. To quantify the amount of response desensitization, DPDPE treatment was followed with 1 μm naloxone. The short vertical bars through the current traces indicate the time agonist treatment was discontinued and antagonist perfusion began. All responses were measured in 24 mm K+ buffer. Calibration scales are the same for each trace: 100 nA, 2 min. B, comparison of the desensitization rates of the different DOR mutants.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11946-11953Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The desensitization rate of the DOR LS mutant, however, in which all of the serines in the third cytoplasmic loop were mutated to alanines was not measurably different from that of wild type DOR (Fig. 4). The DOR mutants tested were not different from wild type DOR in their ability to activate GIRK. DPDPE dose response curves were generated for each of the δ receptor mutants expressed as described in Fig. 4. Control oocytes (injected with 0.1 ng of receptor mRNA but lacking β-ARK2 and β-arr2) were exposed to cumulatively increasing doses of DPDPE in 16 mm K+ recording buffer. The EC50 of DPDPE for the wild type receptor was 4.2 nm (3.4–4.9 nm), and the EC50 was 1.6 nm (1.2–2.0 nm) for DOR LS, 3.3 nm (2.8–3.9 nm) for DOR TT, and 2.7 nm (2.0–3.4 nm) for the DOR TS mutant. Numbers in parentheses indicate the 95% confidence intervals (n = 3 independent measures). The mean (± S.E.) peak responses measured at 32 nm DPDPE for wild type DOR, DOR LS, DOR TT, and DOR TS were 863 ± 51, 813 ± 81, 700 ± 185, and 986 ± 86 nA, respectively. Whereas the desensitization of MOR-GIRK coupling produced by coexpression of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 after treatment with DAMGO for 4 min was small (Fig. 2), prolonged agonist treatment revealed a more dramatic effect of these modulatory proteins on MOR coupling (Fig.5). After 2–3 h of exposure to 40 nm DAMGO, the agonist was washed off by perfusion with normal oocyte saline for 5 min, and the response to DAMGO was tested. In control oocytes, expressing neither β-ARK2 nor β-arr2, pretreatment with 40 nm DAMGO did not affect the subsequent MOR response as compared with untreated oocytes (Fig. 5, Band C). However, in cells coexpressing both β-ARK2 and β-arr2, DAMGO pretreatment almost completely abolished the subsequent response to MOR activation. Again, cells expressing either β-ARK2 or β-arr2 alone did not demonstrate a significant agonist-dependent MOR desensitization (Fig. 5 B). The desensitization of the response to MOR activation by DAMGO was homologous in β-ARK2- and β-arr2-coexpressing cells; in experiments in which oocytes were coinjected with DOR cRNA, subsequent DPDPE activation of DOR was not altered by prolonged DAMGO exposure (Fig. 5,A and C). The principal findings of this study are 3-fold. First, we have directly demonstrated that β-ARK and β-arr were both required to produce homologous desensitization of the opioid receptors. Second, δ receptors may be more sensitive than μ receptors to β-ARK2 and β-arr2 modulation. Third, we have identified particular residues in the COOH terminus of the δ receptor that confer increased sensitivity to phosphorylation by β-ARK2. The coexpression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 improved the sensitivity of the system and allowed us to observe receptor-GIRK coupling without heterologous desensitization. We exploited the lack of desensitization to demonstrate that exogenous β-ARK and β-arr act synergistically to desensitize δ and μ opioid receptors differentially. Previously, we reported that for cells in which GIRK channel expression is greatly limiting, as in oocytes injected with cRNA for only the GIRK1 channel subunit, opioid receptor-elicited GIRK currents desensitize heterologously (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a mechanism for the observed heterologous desensitization was proposed by Schreibmayer and co-workers, who demonstrated that activated Gαi 1, but not Gαi 2 or Gαi 3, potently inhibited Gβγ-induced GIRK activity in excised membrane patches of Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK1 (39Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Vorobiov D. Gilman A.G. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dascal N. Nature. 1996; 380: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, antisense to Xenopus Gαi 1 injected into oocytes attenuated the heterologous desensitization of muscarinic receptor (39Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Vorobiov D. Gilman A.G. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dascal N. Nature. 1996; 380: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and opioid receptor-GIRK coupling. 2A. Kovoor and C. Chavkin, unpublished data. These results may suggest that in neurons expressing sufficient quantities of Gαi 1 the activation of this G protein isoform by opioid receptors could lead to a heterologous desensitization of the GIRK response. Similar mechanisms may be responsible for the heterologous desensitization of opioid receptors observed in vivo (14Noble F. Cox B.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,40Nomura K. Reuveny E. Narahashi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 466-474PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for abolition of the heterologous desensitization of receptor-GIRK coupling by coexpression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits in the oocyte have not been established. It may be due to an inability of Gαi 1 to inhibit the GIRK1-GIRK4 channel complex. Alternatively, the levels of endogenously expressed Gαi 1 may be unable to significantly affect the greatly enhanced expression of functional GIRK channel complexes. Additionally, when GIRK expression is low, as in oocytes injected with only the GIRK1 channel subunit, the high external K+ concentration required for reliably measuring GIRK activity itself strongly inhibited GIRK channels (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the elevated GIRK expression in GIRK1- and GIRK4-injected oocytes allowed opioid receptor activity to be reliably measured in low K+-containing external buffer and monitored for an extensive period without a large rundown. The membrane-delimited activation of GIRK channels by G protein-coupled receptors is thought to be mediated by Gβγ dimers, probably by direct binding to the channel protein (41Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez L.J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 42Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). β-ARK1 and β-ARK2 interact with Gβγ, and a fusion protein constructed with a portion of β-ARK1 was shown to inhibit basal GIRK activity when applied to membrane patches (41Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez L.J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Therefore, β-ARK2 could potentially desensitize receptor-elicited GIRK responses by sequestering Gβγ. However, the β-ARK2- and β-arr2-mediated receptor uncoupling reported here is likely to be a result of catalytic phosphorylation of the receptor by β-ARK2 rather than a sequestration of Gβγ subunits. First, desensitization of the receptor response required the concomitant expression of β-arrestin. Second, the expressed levels of β-ARK2 did not significantly inhibit the basal GIRK activity. The observed homologous desensitization observed with coinjected MOR and DOR indicated that the desensitization was the result of actions localized to the receptor rather than through a common postreceptor event such as Gβγ sequestration. Finally, the β-ARK2- and β-arr2-mediated desensitization of DOR was abolished by specific point mutations of serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in the COOH-terminal tail. For other Gi/Go-coupled receptors such as the m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and the α2-adrenergic receptor, agonist-dependent desensitization by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases has been shown to follow from the phosphorylation of serine and threonine amino acids in the third cytoplasmic loop (36Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11946-11953Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data mapping the β-ARK2- and β-arr2-mediated desensitization of the Gi/Go-coupled δ opioid receptor to the last five serines and threonines in the COOH-terminal tail provides an example of a Gi/Go-coupled receptor that is regulated differently. The importance of the COOH terminus in μ opioid receptor modulation is also suggested by Zimprich and co-workers (43Zimprich A. Simon T. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), who report that an alternatively spliced variant of the μ opioid receptor that differs from MOR only in the amino acid composition of the very COOH-terminal tail is much more resistant to agonist-induced desensitization. It is not clear why the COOH-terminal tail of the of DOR should confer greater sensitivity to modulation by β-ARK2 and β-arr2. Two possibilities are that either the COOH-terminal tail of DOR is a better substrate for β-ARK2 or that β-arr2 has a higher affinity for the phosphorylated DOR. Recent experiments suggest that in addition to uncoupling the β2-AR from G proteins, phosphorylation of the β2-AR by receptor kinases followed by β-arrestin binding is also important for receptor internalization (44Ferguson S.S.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) report that the serine and threonine residues in the COOH-terminal tail of the δ opioid receptor are important for agonist-mediated internalization when transfected into CHO cells. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that phosphorylation by β-ARK and binding of β-arr may be important for the internalization of δ opioid receptors. The concept that μ and δ opioid receptors may be regulated differently has precedence in vivo. Noble and Cox (14Noble F. Cox B.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) report that in the rat nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen, chronic morphine treatment resulted in a desensitization of δ but not μ opioid receptors as measured by the ability of specific agonists to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. Our data demonstrate that δ opioid receptors are much more sensitive to regulation by β-ARK2 and β-arr2. Therefore, one hypothesis is that neurons in the above regions express low levels of β-ARK2 and β-arr2 or related proteins and may explain the selective desensitization of δ responses in these regions. The μ opioid receptor-activated potassium conductance in the locus coeruleus desensitizes homologously such that 70% of the response decayed after 5 min of treatment with high concentrations of agonist (47Harris G.C. Williams J.T. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid homologous desensitization of the μ opioid receptor response in these cells may reflect an expression of a G protein-coupled receptor kinase specific for the μ opioid receptor. Thus, Xenopus oocytes provide an accessible system to characterize the molecular mechanisms of homologous opioid receptor desensitization following prolonged agonist exposure, which may be used to elucidate the role of receptor desensitization in tolerance phenomenon in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2000549627,"Molecular mechanisms determining methylation patterns in eukaryotic genomes still remain unresolved. We have characterized, in Ascobolus, a gene for de novo methylation. This novel eukaryotic gene, masc1, encodes a protein that has all motifs of the catalytic domain of eukaryotic C5-DNA-methyltransferases but is unique in that it lacks a regulatory N-terminal domain. The disruption of masc1 has no effect on viability or methylation maintenance but prevents the de novo methylation of DNA repeats, which takes place after fertilization, through the methylation induced premeiotically (MIP) process. Crosses between parents harboring the masc1 disruption are arrested at an early stage of sexual reproduction, indicating that the activity of Masc1, the product of the gene, is crucial in this developmental process."

These compounds have rate constants small enough to be measured by dynamic electron spin resonance spectroscopy and show charge transfer bands corresponding to vertical excitation from the energy well for the charge occurring upon one hydrazine unit to that for the electron-transferred species. Analysis of the data for all six compounds studied indicates that the shape of the adiabatic surface on which electron transfer occurs can be obtained from the charge transfer band accurately enough to successfully predict the electron transfer rate constant and that explicit tunneling corrections are not required for these compounds.

Neither molecule is likely at physiological concentrations to kill cells. However, two of their reaction products, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, are strong oxidants, cell-permeant, and toxic. Hydrogen peroxide generates oxidative DNA damage, while the primary mechanism of toxicity of peroxynitrite has not yet been determined. Recent in vitro studies indicated that peroxynitrite is capable of oxidizing the [4Fe-4S] clusters of a family of dehydratases (Hausladen, A., and Fridovich, I. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29405–29408; Castro, L., Rodriguez, M., and Radi, R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29409–29415). We demonstrate here that peroxynitrite at 1% of its lethal dose almost fully inactivated the labile dehydratases in Escherichia coli. The rate at which peroxynitrite inactivated the clusters substantially exceeded the rate at which it oxidized thiols or spontaneously decomposed. These results suggest that these dehydratases may be primary targets of peroxynitrite in vivo. Another consequence of the cluster damage was the release of 100 μm iron into the cytosol. During phagocytosis, this intracellular free iron could increase lethal DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide or protein modification by additional peroxynitrite. In response to peroxynitrite challenges, E. coli rapidly sequestered the intracellular free iron using an undefined scavenging system. The iron-sulfur clusters were more gradually repaired by a process that drew iron from its iron-storage proteins. These are likely to be critical events in the struggle between phagocyte and pathogen. Phagocytes produce both nitric oxide and superoxide as components of the oxidative defense against pathogens.

These are likely to be critical events in the struggle between phagocyte and pathogen. When phagocytic cells attempt to kill captured pathogens, they utilize specialized enzymes on the interior aspect of the phagosomal membrane to bombard the target cell with superoxide (O·̄2) and nitric oxide (NO⋅). The mechanisms by which these chemicals damage the invader are unclear. Superoxide cannot penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane of the target cell because of its anionic charge (1Lynch R.E. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1838-1845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide can cross membranes, but its known direct effects are limited to the reversible inhibition of heme enzymes (2Liu R.H. Hotchkiss J.H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 339: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It therefore appears possible that the toxic effects of these species are mediated by their chemical by-products. Superoxide dismutes both spontaneously and enzymatically to form hydrogen peroxide, which is both cell-permeant and a sufficiently strong oxidant to generate lethal DNA damage (for review, see Ref. 3Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). And nitric oxide reacts with superoxide in the close spaces of the phagosome at a diffusion-limited rate, forming peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (4Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); and, assisted by transition-metal catalysts, nitrate phenolics such as tyrosine (12Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L.

Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peroxynitrite can form an undefined activated species (commonly denoted HOONO*) that decomposes to nitrite or, alternatively, abstracts elecrons from even poor donors, such as deoxyribose (14Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 15Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J.

This oxidant would be expected to have a broad spectrum of potential biological targets. However, reactions between ground-state peroxynitrite and nucleophiles may preclude substantial formation of HOONO* in the cell. Because they are both capable univalent oxidants, peroxynitrite might to some extent be expected to resemble superoxide as a toxin. Much of the potency of superoxide arises from its ability to oxidize the [4Fe-4S] clusters of a family of dehydratases that are distributed among both bacterial and mammalian cells (17Gardner P.R.

These cationic clusters serve as Lewis acids during substrate dehydration. However, the transfer of a single electron from the exposed cluster to superoxide destabilizes the cluster, provoking iron loss and inactivation of the enzyme. The primary consequence is that the pathways in which these enzymes function become inoperative, and a secondary effect is that the liberated iron can deposit along the DNA, promoting the generation of mutagenic or lethal DNA damage (23Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 24Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Hausladen and Fridovich (25Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined that peroxynitrite, as well, efficiently inactivates these enzymes in vitro. In those experiments, the damaged enzymes could be reactivated by incubation with ferrous iron and thiols, indicating that peroxynitrite inactivated the enzymes specifically by damaging the [4Fe-4S] clusters (26Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Reaction 1). [4Fe−4S]2++ONOO−+H+→[3Fe−4S]1++HO−+NO2·+Fe2+ REACTION1The second-order rate constants of the damaging reactions were sufficiently high (1.4 × 105m−1 s−1) that it is plausible that these enzymes would be primary targets of peroxynitritein vivo. The work reported here demonstrates that moderate doses of peroxynitrite do indeed preferentially attack these [4Fe-4S]-containing dehydratases in vivo.Escherichia coli responds to this crisis by rapidly sequestering the free iron and more gradually reactivating the damaged enzymes. Sodium nitrite, manganese dioxide, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, and manganese chloride were purchased from Aldrich. 1,2,3-Oxadiazolium-5-amino-3-(4-morpholino)-chloride (SIN-1) was from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI.

Coomassie protein reagent was from Pierce. β-Mercaptoethanol and sodium citrate were from Fisher Scientific. Water was purified from a Labconco Water Pro PS system using house deionized water as feedstock. Peroxynitrite (HONOO) was synthesized by a procedure suggested by Chris Privalle, modified from the original quenched-flow method of Beckman (27Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). 0.6 m NaNO2 and 0.6 mH2O2 in 0.7 m HCl were rapidly mixed in a glass T-junction with outflow into a beaker containing 1.3m NaOH and manganese dioxide to remove residual hydrogen peroxide. The peroxynitrite was then filtered, frozen immediately in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and stored at −80 °C. To determine the yield and purity of peroxynitrite, 10 μl of newly synthesized ONOO− was diluted into 1 n NaOH and scanned spectrophotometrically from 200 to 600 nm. Peroxynitrite concentrations were quantitated by the absorbance at 302 nm (ε = 1.67 mm−1 cm−1). Peroxynitrite concentrations were redetermined before each experiment and were sometimes further diluted into 1 n NaOH prior to use. The strains of E. coliused in these experiments were the K-12 derivatives AB1157 (thr-1 leuB6 proA2 his-4 thi-1 argE2 lacY1 galK2 rpsL supE44 ara-14 xyl-15 mtl-1 tsx-33) (28Imlay J.A. Linn S. J.

Neilands J.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5471-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) was used to monitor the possible induction of the Fur regulon after peroxynitrite treatment. All defined media contained minimal A salts (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Carbon sources were routinely gluconate (0.8%) for studies of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase damage and reactivation, glucose (0.2%) for studies of succinate dehydrogenase and sulfite reductase, and acetate (100 mm) for studies of aconitase. LB with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used for studies of inactivation of β-galactosidase and LB for studies of alkaline phophatase. For all other enzymes assayed, cultures were grown in minimal A media with 0.8% gluconate as the carbon source. Control experiments demonstrated that aconitase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase were also rapidly inactivated in cells that were grown on glucose. The 20 amino acids were supplemented to all media except acetate medium, which included only the five amino acids necessary to compensate for the genetic deficiencies of AB1157-derived strains. In experiments probing the sensitivity of sulfite reductase to peroxynitrite, adequate enzyme synthesis was ensured by substituting djenkolic acid (1 mm) and ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) for cysteine, methionine, and ammonium sulfate. One- to three-liter cultures were grown at 37 °C to log phase (∼0.2A 600 after at least four generations) in well shaken medium. Cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in 100–200 ml of saline, and centrifuged again to pellet. All centrifugation steps were performed for 3 min at 9000 rpm unless otherwise indicated. The pellet was then resuspended in one-fourth to one-sixth of the original culture volume in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (potassium Pi) (pH 7.4). An aliquot was removed as an unchallenged control, while the remainder was challenged with peroxynitrite. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of the appropriate buffer, as indicated under Biochemical Assays, and immediately lysed by French press. The lysate was then briefly centrifuged in a microcentrifuge to remove debris, and the supernatant was collected, frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until being thawed for assay. To test whether peroxynitrite could inactivate enzymes in the absence of oxygen, cells were grown as above. The cell pellet, peroxynitrite, and 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.4) that had been degassed with nitrogen for 20 min through a glass frit were moved into a Coy anaerobic chamber containing an atmosphere of 85% nitrogen, 10% hydrogen, and 5% CO2. The cell pellet was then resuspended in the potassium Pi, and half of the suspension was challenged with 100 μm peroxynitrite. The challenged and unchallenged cell suspensions were then removed from the chamber and processed for the preparation of extracts as indicated above. Reactivation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase was monitored after cells were challenged for 15 s with 100 μmperoxynitrite. Immediately after the challenge, 150 μg/ml chloramphenicol was added to prevent new protein synthesis, and gluconate and amino acids were added back to the suspension. The culture was then allowed to incubate at 37 °C with aliquots removed at intervals for assay of enzyme activity. These aliquots were immediately centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of cold 50 mmTris (pH 7.65), and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell. The lysate was then centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant was frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C until assayed. The recovery of growth after peroxynitrite exposure was monitored in cells grown in gluconate medium. Log-phase cells were centrifuged, washed with saline, and resuspended in one-fifth the total original volume of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.4) (8Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Aliquots (1 ml) were then challenged with the indicated amount of peroxynitrite and immediately diluted into gluconate medium. Aerobic growth at 37 °C was then monitored at 600 nm. To determine cell survival, strains were diluted after challenge 10- to 10,000-fold into LB medium and plated in LB top agar onto LB plates supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Killing was assessed by colony-forming units of challenged cells compared with unchallenged controls. In some instances, immediately after the challenge with peroxynitrite, cells were diluted 1:2 into LB medium and subsequently challenged for 10 min with 2.5 mm H2O2 (33Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Aliquots were removed at intervals and diluted and plated as above. Expression of the Fur regulon was monitored by assay of β-galactosidase during the 2-h period after peroxynitrite-treated BN407 was returned to aerobic glucose medium. Control experiments confirmed that equal-volume aliquots of 1n NaOH and freshly neutralized (decomposed) peroxynitrite had no adverse effects upon the dehydratase activities, growth rates, or survival of cells. Error from inactivation and reactivation studies did not exceed 5–10% from triplicate runs of an independent experiment. Experiments were repeated at least three times, with results indicating the same general inactivation and reactivation profiles. For studies of aconitase activity, peroxynitrite-treated cells were suspended and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.6 mmMnCl2, and 20 μm fluorocitrate. Fluorocitrate helps block damage to the intact aconitase clusters subsequent to lysis. Extracts were then diluted and assayed (17Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared for assay of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.65). The two-step method of Fraenkel was used to determine enzyme activity (34Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2765-2771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extract, 8 mm, 6-phosphogluconate, and 10 mm MgCl2 were mixed in a 0.1-ml reaction and allowed to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then diluted into 2 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.65) and boiled for 2 min. Particulates were removed by centrifugation, and 1 ml of the supernatant was assayed with 0.3 mm NADH and lactic dehydrogenase. Extracts were prepared for the assay of fumarase in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). Extacts were assayed in sodium phophate buffer by the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.5 ml-malate. Absorbance was monitored at 250 nm, with εfumarate = 1.62 mm−1cm−1. For assay of NADH dehydrogenase I, extracts were prepared in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.8). Extracts were immediately assayed after lysis in a 1-ml reaction containing extract, 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.8), 3.3 mmKCN, 0.4 mm plumbagin, and 0.25 mmdeamino-NADH. NADH dehydrogenase I, but not NADH dehydrogenase II, can use deamino-NADH as a reductive substrate. Absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. For assay of NADH dehydrogenase II, lysates were incubated on ice overnight to eliminate NADH dehydrogenase I activity and then assayed for NADH oxidation at 340 nm by the addition of 0.25 mm NADH. For assay of sulfite reductase, treated cells were resuspended in 0.1m potassium Pi (pH 7.7) and 0.1 mmEDTA, lysed, and assayed with 0.5 mm sodium sulfite as an electron acceptor. The oxidation of 0.2 mm NADPH was monitored (35Wu J.-Y. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity (32Miller J.H.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were determined by standard procedures. Protein content was determined by a Coomassie dye-based protein assay by Pierce. The succinate oxidase activity of inverted vesicles prepared from peroxynitrite-treated cells was measured by monitoring aerobic respiration with a Clark oxygen electrode. Inverted vesicles were produced by French press (47Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vesicles, suspended in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, were added to an electrode chamber that had been pre-equilibrated to 37 °C, and oxygen consumption was monitored in the presence of 20 mmsuccinate. The measured activity requires the function of both succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome o oxidase, with the former enzyme being rate-limiting in the vesicles prepared from these cells. EPR measurements were generally performed as described previously (24Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). One- to three-liter cultures were grown aerobically in gluconate medium and treated as detailed above. Cells were resuspended in one-fourth to one-sixth the original volume of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.4) and then challenged with peroxynitrite for 15 s. Desferrioxamine was immediately added after the challenge to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then centrifuged, washed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and centrifuged again to pellet. Cell pellets were resuspended in a final volume of 200 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol. 200 μl were then transferred to a 3-mm quartz EPR tube, frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until assayed. The EPR signals were measured with a Varian Century series E-112 X-band spectrometer equipped with a Varian TE102 cavity. A liquid nitrogen finger Dewar in which samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen was used to ensure constant temperature from sample to sample. Parameters remained constant between experiments and were as follows: temperature = −125 °C, field center = 1520 G, field sweep = 500 G, modulation amplitude = 12.5 G, receiver gain = 25,000, frequency = 9.27 GHz, and power = 30 milliwatts. One thousand data points were collected per scan, and four scans were averaged per sample. Data were analyzed using software from Scientific Software Services, Bloomington, IL. Iron levels were quantitated by normalizing the amplitude of the iron signal to an iron standard sample assayed on the same day. Internal iron concentrations were calculated using the intracellular volume (47Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times, with error not exceeding 15% between independent experiments and scan profiles exhibiting the same trends. Experiments that measure the rate of free-iron clearance from a treated cell require that desferrioxamine penetrate the cell and capture free iron quickly. Parallel experiments demonstrated that the addition of 2 mm desferrioxamine protects exonuclease III-defectiveE. coli from an external bolus of 2.5 mmH2O2 in less than 1 min of application. Since desferrioxamine prevents oxidative DNA damage by chelating intracellular free iron (48Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), we conclude that the addition of 2 mm desferrioxamine penetrates the cell sufficiently rapidly to capture the great majority of free iron within the interval of the EPR measurements reported in this study. The dilution of alkaline peroxynitrite into neutral medium results in its rapid decomposition, with a half-life of approximately 2 s (14Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar). Thus, the addition of peroxynitrite to suspended cells comprises a bolus of short duration. Pilot experiments demonstrated that while components of growth medium protected growing cultures of E. coli from the toxic effects of peroxynitrite, presumably by reacting with and detoxifying the peroxynitrite, cells suspended in buffer were rapidly damaged. Concentrations of peroxynitrite in excess of 1 mm were lethal to >99% of the cell population, but virtually all cells (>90%) survived exposure to boluses of less than 500 μm. When nutrients were restored to the cells immediately after peroxynitrite exposure, it was observed that, whereas sham-treated cells resumed growth immediately, those that had been exposed to doses of 100 μmperoxynitrite exhibited a 10-min growth lag (Fig.1). No lag occurred when the peroxynitrite was neutralized prior to its addition to the cells, confirming that the growth inhibition was a consequence of damage done by peroxynitrite per se rather than by its decomposition products. We were interested in defining the molecular damage produced by these moderate doses of peroxynitrite. Aconitase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, and fumarase A are members of the small family of hydrolyases in E. coli that employ [4Fe-4S] clusters to catalyze the dehydration of their substrates. These enzymes were extensively inactivated when cells were exposed to a pulse of even 10 μm peroxynitrite (Table I, Fig.2). This inactivation did not involve partially reduced oxygen species, since the enzymes were also inactivated when cells were exposed to peroxynitrite anaerobically (not shown). In contrast, all but 1 of the 16 other enzymes that were sampled were unaffected by even 100 μm doses, including several that utilize iron-sulfur clusters and hemes as redox moieties. These include sulfite reductase, which has a single [4Fe-4S] cluster and a siroheme; succinate dehydrogenase, which contains essential [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters, and ab-type cytochrome; NADH dehydrogenase I, which has at least two [2Fe-2S] and three [4Fe-4S] clusters; and cytochromeo oxidase, which contains b- ando-type cytochromes. Although E. coli superoxide dismutases can be inactivated by"
https://openalex.org/W2092509098,"Neurons require specific patterns of K+ channel subunit expression as well as the precise coassembly of channel subunits into heterotetrameric structures for proper integration and transmission of electrical signals. In vivo subunit coassembly was investigated by studying the pharmacological profile, distribution, and subunit composition of voltage-gated Shaker family K+(Kv1) channels in rat cerebellum that are labeled by125I-margatoxin (125I-MgTX;K d, 0.08 pm). High-resolution receptor autoradiography showed spatial receptor expression mainly in basket cell terminals (52% of all cerebellar sites) and the molecular layer (39% of sites). Sequence-directed antibodies indicated overlapping expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in basket cell terminals, whereas the molecular layer expressed Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv1.6 proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that all 125I-MgTX receptors contain at least one Kv1.2 subunit and that 83% of these receptors are heterotetramers of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits. Moreover, 33% of these Kv1.1/Kv1.2-containing receptors possess either an additional Kv1.3 or Kv1.6 subunit. Only a minority of the 125I-MgTX receptors (<20%) seem to be homotetrameric Kv1.2 channels. Heterologous coexpression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits in COS-1 cells leads to the formation of a complex that combines the pharmacological profile of both parent subunits, reconstituting the native MgTX receptor phenotype. Subunit assembly provides the structural basis for toxin binding pharmacology and can lead to the association of as many as three distinct channel subunits to form functional K+channels in vivo. Neurons require specific patterns of K+ channel subunit expression as well as the precise coassembly of channel subunits into heterotetrameric structures for proper integration and transmission of electrical signals. In vivo subunit coassembly was investigated by studying the pharmacological profile, distribution, and subunit composition of voltage-gated Shaker family K+(Kv1) channels in rat cerebellum that are labeled by125I-margatoxin (125I-MgTX;K d, 0.08 pm). High-resolution receptor autoradiography showed spatial receptor expression mainly in basket cell terminals (52% of all cerebellar sites) and the molecular layer (39% of sites). Sequence-directed antibodies indicated overlapping expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in basket cell terminals, whereas the molecular layer expressed Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv1.6 proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that all 125I-MgTX receptors contain at least one Kv1.2 subunit and that 83% of these receptors are heterotetramers of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits. Moreover, 33% of these Kv1.1/Kv1.2-containing receptors possess either an additional Kv1.3 or Kv1.6 subunit. Only a minority of the 125I-MgTX receptors (<20%) seem to be homotetrameric Kv1.2 channels. Heterologous coexpression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits in COS-1 cells leads to the formation of a complex that combines the pharmacological profile of both parent subunits, reconstituting the native MgTX receptor phenotype. Subunit assembly provides the structural basis for toxin binding pharmacology and can lead to the association of as many as three distinct channel subunits to form functional K+channels in vivo. Voltage-gated K+(Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated K+; MgTX, margatoxin; DTX, α-dendrotoxin; kb, kilobase. 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated K+; MgTX, margatoxin; DTX, α-dendrotoxin; kb, kilobase. channels serve an important function in regulating the degree of neuronal excitability. This class of channels is involved in controlling both the length of action potentials and the frequency of repetitive firing. The diversity of firing patterns displayed by individual neurons in the central nervous system is reflected by the expression of a wide variety of voltage-gated K+ channels that differ in their gating, pharmacology, and single-channel properties (1Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar, 2Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of voltage-gated K+ channels has revealed the existence of multiple members of at least eight families (2Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Pongs O. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S69-S88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of all the Kv channel families, the Kv1 (Shaker) class (Kv1.1–1.6) has been the most studied, due to the discovery of high-affinity blockers of these channels in the venom of snakes, scorpions, and marine organisms (4Garcia M.L.

Menez A. Martin Eauclaire M.F. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Some of these K+ channel subunits have been reported to assemble into heterotetrameric channels with distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties when expressed in vitro (6Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Sewing S. Pongs O. Nature. 1990; 345: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Neuron. 1990; 4: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In native tissue, with the combination of in situhybridization and immunocytochemical techniques, it has been possible to show that individual voltage-gated K+ channels are expressed in specific cells, occasionally even within a single neuron. In addition, these channels can be targeted to distinct subcellular compartments (9Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Martin T.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 10Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Kunkel D.D.

Moreover, the assembly of distinct Kvchannel subunits (e.g. Kv1.1/Kv1.2 (9Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Martin T.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. J.

Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) into functional channel complexes in native brain tissue has been implied. An alternative approach to demonstrate the existence of heterotetrameric K+ channels is to use specific K+ channel ligands and define the subunit composition of the receptor. For instance, Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, but not Kv1.3 and Kv1.4, are highly sensitive to DTX (13Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, MgTX binds with high affinity to both Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 but displays much lower affinity for all other Kv channels (14Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Knaus H.G. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13627-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using125I-DTX as a marker, it has been shown that in bovine brain cortex, Kv1.2 is present in all DTX-sensitive K+ channels, whereas Kv1.1 is only present in about half of these, and that Kv1.4 and Kv1.6 subunits have a minor contribution (16Parcej D.N. Scott V.E. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Scott V.E. Muniz Z.M. Sewing S. Lichtinghagen R. Parcej D.N. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These results have been confirmed and extended after immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using specific antibodies for Kv1 channels (18Shamotienka O.G. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8195-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, we have quantitatively defined the subunit composition of the MgTX receptor in rat cerebellum using a combination of high-resolution autoradiography, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicate that all MgTX receptors contain at least one Kv1.2 subunit, but that less than 20% are homotetrameric channels, with the remaining composed mostly of heterotetramers of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits. Moreover, coexpression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits in vitro reproduced the pharmacological phenotype of the cerebellum MgTX receptor. MgTX was expressed in Escherichia colias part of a fusion protein, purified (19Garcia Calvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13627-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DTX was obtained from Calbiochem. Polyethylenimine, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin were from Sigma, and goat serum was from Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beth Haemek, Israel). Recombinant N-glycosidase F was obtained from Genzyme. LipofectAMINE® was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. FMOC (9-fluoroenylmethoxycarbonyl) lysine core solid-phase peptide support was from NovaBiochem (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Hyperfilm®-βmax was from Amersham Corp., and the photo dip emulsion (NTB2®) was from Kodak. Kv1 fusion proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Olaf Pongs (Hamburg, Germany). Rat cerebellar synaptic plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (20Vazquez J. Feigenbaum P. King V.F. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

Cerebellar MgTX receptors were solubilized for 30 min on ice with 2% digitonin in the presence of 500 mm KCl, and solubilized receptors were separated from particulate material as described previously (15Knaus H.G.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their brains were rapidly removed and placed for 90 s in isopentane chilled to −40 °C. Thereafter, the brains were transferred for 30 min at −30 °C and stored in a sealed vial. 20-μm sections were cut on a cryostat microtome (Leitz, Germany) and thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated slides. Slides were stored at −30 °C for up to 1 month. Sections were labeled in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at 22 °C at a saturating125I-MgTX concentration (5–12 pm). Nonspecific binding was determined in a series of adjacent sections by inclusion of 2 nm MgTX. Sections were then rinsed twice for 30 min in ice-cold 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mmNaCl, dipped in chilled distilled water, and dried rapidly in a cold stream of air. Thereafter, the sections were dipped (right after a wash with ice-cold double distilled water) in photo emulsion and stored for 3–7 days at 4 °C. Quantification of staining was done using a RGB camera system (DEI-470; Optotronics Engineering, Goleta, CA) and the MetaMorph software package (Visitron, Munich, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal sera were raised against unique carboxyl-terminal regions of the Shaker type K+ channels Kv1.1–Kv1.6 found in rat brain. Peptides were synthesized on a lysine core linked to a solid-phase peptide synthesis support. The sequences of the synthetic peptides used and their locations within the primary amino acid sequences are EEDMNNSIAHYRQANIRT (antiKv1.1(458–475)), QEGVNNSNEDFREENLKTAN (anti-Kv1.2(461–480)), QHLSSSAEELRKARSNSTL (anti-Kv1.3(456–474)), SSLGDKSEYLEMEEGVKESL (anti-Kv1.4(605–624)), KAKSNVDLRRSLYALCLDTSR (anti-Kv1.5(578–598)), and RRSSYLPTPHRAYAEKRM (anti-Kv1.6(509–526)). For the anti-Kv1.1–Kv1.4 antibodies, the amino acid numbering refers to Ref. 21Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO.

All sequence-directed antibodies were diluted in nonimmune serum to keep the overall amount of IgG/tube approximately constant. The fusion proteins glutathioneS-transferase-Kv1.1 and β-galactosidase-Kv1.2, -Kv1.3, -Kv1.4, and -Kv1.6 (24Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, dialyzed against 50 mm NaHCO3 for 24 h, and reacted with 30 μCi of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent. The respective Western blotting and immunoprecipitation protocols have been published previously (25Knaus H.G. Schwarzer C. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Glossmann H. Wunder F. Pongs O. Garcia M.L. Sperk G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 955-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of tissue sections has been described previously (25Knaus H.G. Schwarzer C. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Glossmann H. Wunder F. Pongs O. Garcia M.L. Sperk G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 955-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were incubated for 48–96 h at the indicated dilutions with either crude serum (anti-Kv1.1, 1:5000; anti-Kv1.2, 1:2000) or affinity-purified anti-Kv1.3 (1:1500), anti-Kv1.4 (1:1000), or anti-Kv1.6 (1:1000). Immunoreaction products were visualized after coupling with rabbit peroxidase-antiperoxidase via goat anti-rabbit IgG and color reaction with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. In control sections, nonspecific immunoreactivity was assessed either by preadsorbing the antibodies with 10 μm of the respective peptide or by incubation without the primary antibody. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Promega. The Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 genes were obtained from Dr. Olaf Pongs. The 2.2-kbHindIII/XbaI fragment containing the open reading frame of the Kv1.2 gene was excised, and after generating blunt ends, it was subcloned into the SmaI site of the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). The orientation of the insert was checked by restriction analysis. The open reading frame of the Kv1.1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a forward (5′-AAGAATTCCGCCACCATGACGGTGATGTCTGGGGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTATTCTAGATTTAAACATCGGTCAGTAGCTTGCTC-3′) primer that introduced an EcoRI and XbaI site in the flanking region. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into the corresponding sides of the pCI-neo vector. The integrity of the entire amplified Kv1.1 cDNA was verified by nucleotide sequencing. COS-1 cells were grown and maintained as described previously (26Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Munujos P. Knaus H.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were allowed to incubate with the transfection medium for 5 h under 10% CO2, 100% humidity, at 37 °C. After removal of transfection medium, cells were grown for 72 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm EGTA/NH4OH, pH 10.6, 150 mm KCl, and 2 mmMgCl2), and plasma membranes were isolated as described previously (26Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Munujos P. Knaus H.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Membranes were resuspended in 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4), quickly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. In purified rat cerebellar synaptic plasma membrane vesicles, 125I-MgTX labels a single class of receptor sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.08 pm and a maximum density of 0.9 pmol/mg protein (Fig.1). Given the very high affinity of125I-MgTX, which is due to a very slow and monophasic radioligand dissociation (t ½ = 126 min at 22 °C) (15Knaus H.G. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13627-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we performed receptor autoradiography to investigate the distribution of 125I-MgTX receptors in rat cerebellum. At the macroscopic level, toxin binding is spatially restricted to two individual compartments: (a) the highest site density is detected in a single sheet of receptors located between the molecular and granule cell layer (Fig.2 A); and (b) strong autoradiographic staining is found throughout the entire thickness of the molecular layer. Higher magnification (after dye counterstaining to identify cell bodies) revealed that only basket cell terminals, but not Purkinje cell bodies, are heavily labeled by 125I-MgTX, whereas an intermediate density of autoradiographic staining is found throughout the entire molecular layer (Fig. 2 B). Counting of silver grains indicated that 52% of toxin binding sites are clustered in basket cell terminals, whereas 39% of sites are found in the molecular layer, and less than 10% of MgTX receptors are located in the granule cell layer and the folial white matter.Figure 2Autoradiographic localization of125I-MgTX binding sites in rat cerebellum.

The specificity and reactivity of these antibodies were confirmed in Western blots against glutathioneS-transferase or β-galactosidase fusion proteins containing the carboxyl terminus of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, and Kv1.6 (Fig. 3,A–D). In all cases, each antibody exclusively recognized its unique antigen, and the immunostaining signal was blocked by inclusion of 1 μm antigenic peptide. In addition,125I-labeled fusion proteins could be immunoprecipitated by the respective Kv1 antibodies, whereas the presence of the antigenic peptide blocked the reaction (data not shown). To investigate the properties of the antibodies in native tissue, we carried out Western blots with cerebellar membranes (Fig. 3 E). Anti-Kv1.1 specifically labeled a polypeptide ofM r 78,000, whereas anti-Kv1.2 yielded very diffuse staining of a polypeptide of aboutM r 80,000, and anti-Kv1.3 faintly and diffusely stained a polypeptide with an apparentM r of 85,000, all in agreement with previously published data (12Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shamotienka O.G. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8195-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Veh R.W. Lichtinghagen R. Sewing S. Wunder F. Grumbach I.M. Pongs O. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2189-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Anti-Kv1.6 stained a protein of M r 56,000, whereas anti-Kv1.4 failed to react specifically with a polypeptide in cerebellar membranes, although this antibody clearly recognized a polypeptide ofM r 95,000 in whole brain membranes (data not shown). Anti-Kv1.5 failed to give any signal in cerebellar membranes, despite the fact that this antiserum was clearly capable of immunostaining Kv1.5 expressed in HEK-293 cells (data not shown). Given the specificity of these antibodies for their respective Kv1 subunits, we determined the distribution of these subunits in cerebellum and compared the data to those obtained in autoradiographies. Particularly important to us was the distribution of Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 subunits, because these two channels exhibit a high affinity for 125I-MgTX (14Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Knaus H.G. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13627-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that makes them likely candidates to match the observed autoradiographic distribution of 125I-MgTX binding. First, we inspected the region with the highest density of125I-MgTX receptors, the Purkinje cell layer, with respect to Kv1 channel expression (Fig.4, A and B). Only Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 proteins were found to reside in the terminal field of basket cell axons that wrap around the base and initial axon segments of Purkinje cells; Purkinje cell somata did not express any immunoreactivity for Kv1.1 or were only very faintly and irregularly stained with anti-Kv1.2. As mentioned above, significant levels of 125I-MgTX binding are also observed in the cerebellar molecular layer (Fig. 2,A and B). This region was intensely immunostained by anti-Kv1.1, whereas moderate staining levels were observed for anti-Kv1.2 and anti-Kv1.6, respectively (Fig. 4, A, B, E, and F). In addition, reasonably high levels of Kv1.3 immunoreactivity were also detected in this region (Fig. 4, C andD). All antibodies gave only faint immunostaining signals in the cerebellar granule cell layer. Consistent with the Western blotting data, the anti-Kv1.4 antibody revealed only very low expression levels; in contrast, this antiserum yielded strong staining in other parts of the brain such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata or the ventral pallidum (data not shown), in agreement with previously published data (10Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 27Veh R.W. Lichtinghagen R. Sewing S. Wunder F. Grumbach I.M. Pongs O. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2189-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Kv1.5 immunoreactivity was not detected in the rat cerebellum, in agreement with Western blot data.Figure 4Distribution of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv1.6 immunoreactivity in rat cerebellum. 40-μm sagittal cryostat sections were stained with antibodies against Kv1.1 (A), Kv1.2 (B), Kv1.3 (C, D), and Kv1.6 (E andF).

For this purpose, we subjected125I-MgTX prelabeled cerebellar receptors to immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against the individual Kv1 subunits (Fig.5 A). All antibodies yielded saturable levels of precipitation. Moreover, inclusion of the competing peptide always decreased the level of precipitation by >90% (data not shown). Anti-Kv1.2 antibody precipitated >95% of125I-MgTX receptors (n = 48), and the combination of any other anti-Kv1 antibody with anti-Kv1.2 did not increase the amount of immunoprecipitated material. These results indicate that in virtually all cerebellar MgTX receptors, Kv1.2 is an essential component. Using solely anti-Kv1.1, 83 ± 5% of receptors (n = 32) could be precipitated, whereas anti-Kv1.3 and anti-Kv1.6 recognized 21 ± 5 (n = 16) and 16 ± 4% (n = 11) of the sites, respectively. By using saturating concentrations of both anti-Kv1.3 and anti-Kv1.6, additive precipitation levels (33 ± 7%; n = 13) could be achieved, indicating that these two proteins are segregated into distinct MgTX-sensitive channel complexes (see “Discussion”). To determine whether Kv1.3 and/or Kv1.6 subunits are coassembled with Kv1.1, we investigated the extent of precipitation of 125I-MgTX receptors by either anti-Kv1.3 or anti-Kv1.6 in the presence of anti-Kv1.1. Neither antibody significantly increased the levels achieved by anti-Kv1.1 alone (83 ± 5%, see above). Thus, a saturating amount of anti-Kv1.1 together with anti-Kv1.3 precipitated 87 ± 4% (n = 20) of the receptors, whereas the anti-Kv1.1/anti-Kv1.6 combination yielded 86 ± 5% (n = 20) precipitation. In addition, a combination of anti-Kv1.1, anti-Kv1.3, and anti-Kv1.6 did not further increase the amount of precipitation. Taken together, these data indicate that Kv1.2 is the dominant subunit of all MgTX-sensitive K+ channels in rat cerebellum. In 80% of the receptors, Kv1.2 is assembled with Kv1.1, whereas in one-third of these receptors, either Kv1.3 or Kv1.6 seems to be an additional integral component of the complex. The remaining 20% of cerebellar MgTX receptors seem to be composed of homotetrameric Kv1.2 channels. To confirm the composition of the cerebellar MgTX receptor by independent means, we heterologously expressed Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and a combination of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 subunits transiently in COS-1 cells, and binding of 125I-MgTX or 125I-DTX was used to determine the pharmacological properties of the resulting complex. 125I-MgTX binds to Kv1.2 and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 membranes with aK d value of 0.08 pm (data not shown), a value identical to that determined with cerebellar membranes (see Fig.1). In contrast, no specific 125I-MgTX binding signal was observed for homotetrameric Kv1.1 channels. Due to this fact, 125I-DTX was used instead, because this ligand has equal affinity for both Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels (13Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-DTX binds to Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 COS-1 membranes with a dissociation constant of 0.2 pm (data not shown). The pharmacology of 125I-DTX binding to Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.1/Kv1.2, and cerebellar membranes was investigated next (Fig. 5 C). Charybdotoxin inhibits125I-DTX binding to homotetrameric Kv1.1 channels with a K i value of ∼4000 pm, whereas it displays higher affinity for homotetrameric Kv1.2 channels (K i, ∼3 pm). However, in Kv1.1/Kv1.2 membranes, charybdotoxin displays a K i of 21 pm, in close agreement with the K i value determined with cerebellar membranes (18 pm). These data suggest that the observed pharmacological profile of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 membranes is due to the association of both subunits in a receptor complex and that this pharmacology is similar to that found with cerebellar membranes. To further validate the idea that Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits are in fact associated in a complex after transient expression in COS-1 cells, immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Kv1.1 and anti-Kv1.2 were performed (Fig. 5 B). For homomultimeric Kv1.2 channels,125I-MgTX or 125I-DTX receptors can be fully precipitated with anti-Kv1.2 but not anti-Kv1.1, whereas the opposite profile is observed when125I-DTX receptors from homomultimeric Kv1.1 channels are subjected to immunoprecipitation with these antibodies. However, both anti-Kv1.1 and anti-Kv1.2 are able to immunoprecipitate either 125I-MgTX or125I-DTX receptors from Kv1.1/Kv1.2 membranes (Fig. 5 B). In these experiments, anti-Kv1.2 precipitated close to 100% of125I-MgTX receptors, whereas anti-Kv1.1 precipitated ∼80%. These data imply that Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits are indeed functionally associated in a receptor complex that very closely resembles the major constituent of the 125I-MgTX cerebellar receptor. The multiplicity of Kv channel genes in rat brain and their ability to form functional heterotetrameric channel complexes are two potential mechanisms for generating the enormous diversity of K+ channel currents observed in native neurons. Several lines of evidence suggest that Kv1 channel subunits form heterotetramers in vitro and in vivo. Coexpression of Kv1 subunits in Xenopus oocytes leads to the formation of heterotetrameric Kv channels with distinct properties when compared with those of the corresponding homomultimeric channels (9Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Martin T.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 10Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Moreover, in situhybridization and immunocytochemical experiments have provided evidence concerning the existence of overlapping Kv channel expression, but the resolution of these techniques is too low to directly detect coassembly of different subunits into tetrameric structures. To address this issue, some studies have investigated the occurrence of heterotetrameric K+ channels in vivo by immunoprecipitation of Kv1 channel complexes, followed by cross-blotting with subtype-selective anti-Kv1 antibodies (9Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Martin T.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 10Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Using this approach, heterotetrameric channel assembly of Kv1.2/Kv1.4 subunits in hippocampus (10Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 subunits in basket cell terminals and juxtaparanodal regions (9Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Martin T.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4588-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been demonstrated (28Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). More recent studies have extended these findings and led to the identification of several subpopulations of defined Kv1 oligomers in bovine cerebral cortex (18Shamotienka O.G. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8195-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An alternative way to address the issue of channel composition is to label native channels with a high-affinity ligand and establish their composition by quantitative immunoprecipitation. In the present study, we focused exclusively on the composition of MgTX-sensitive K+ channels in rat cerebellum. In cerebellar membranes 125I-MgTX binds to a single class of receptors with very high affinity (K d < 0.1 pm), slow ligand dissociation kinetics, and pharmacological characteristics that are not consistent with binding to a single homomultimeric Kv1 channel. Moreover, the pattern of Kv1 protein distribution in cerebellum is understood in some detail (Refs.27Veh R.W. Lichtinghagen R. Sewing S. Wunder F. Grumbach I.M. Pongs O. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2189-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar and 29McNamara N.M. Muniz Z.M. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; this report). Several Kv1 subunits are expressed in this brain region at significant levels, such as Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv1.6. Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 are particularly interesting subunits, because these homotetrameric channels represent very high-affinity receptors for 125I-MgTX (30Helms L.M.H. Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Garcia M.L. Stevens F. Leonard R.J. Knaus H.-G. Koch R. Wanner S.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By a combination of autoradiography, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation studies, it has been possible to determine the composition of the 125I-MgTX receptor in cerebellum. These studies indicate that all receptors contain at least one Kv1.2 subunit and that ∼80% are heterotetramers of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2. In addition, some of these Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channels also contain an additional Kv1.3 or Kv1.6 subunit. It is most likely that all receptors found in basket cell terminals are Kv1.1/Kv1.2, because no other Kv1 subunit can be mapped to the compartment. However, at the molecular layer, homomultimeric Kv1.2, Kv1.1/Kv1.2, and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 with either Kv1.3 or Kv1.6 seem to be present. The unique pharmacological properties of the MgTX receptor should be mostly determined by the Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channels, because these are the major constituents in cerebellum. This idea has been confirmed in coexpression experiments in which Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Interestingly, these two subunits coassemble to yield a unique MgTX receptor phenotype that is very similar to that found in cerebellar membranes. Thus, heterotetrameric channel formation can occur in vitro and in vivo to the same extent and contributes to the diversity of K+ channels in the central nervous system. Those mechanisms controlling subunit assembly must play a very important role in determining the overall electrical activity in any given neuron. However, these processes remain to be characterized.

In this paper, the conformational state of a protein when it forms a high molecular weight complex with α-crystallin is investigated by examining, using NMR spectroscopy and size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, the interaction of α-crystallin with α-lactalbumin and its various intermediately folded (molten globule) states.

It is proposed that α-crystallin distinguishes between the various molten globule states of α-lactalbumin on the basis of the lifetimes of these states, i.e. the protein must be in a disordered molten globule state for a significant length of time and on the pathway to aggregation and precipitation for interaction to occur.

It has become apparent over the last few years that the folding of proteins in vivo involves the interaction of nascent polypeptides with a diversity of unrelated proteins known as chaperones (reviewed by Buchner (1Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar)). Unfolded polypeptide chains expose to solution hydrophobic surfaces that are potentially available for interaction with each other. As a result, undesirable products,i.e. incorrectly folded and/or aggregated proteins, may result. By sequestering or isolating these juvenile proteins from the surrounding milieu, chaperone proteins encourage the correct folding of proteins. Chaperone proteins are often also known as heat shock proteins (Hsps) because of their increased expression when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures. Thus, proteins such as Hsp90, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp25 are expressed at higher levels under such conditions, and in doing so, they have a stabilizing effect on other proteins in the cell. Hsp70 has a crucial role in protein synthesis whereby it interacts with proteins soon after their synthesis on the ribosome and then passes on the protein to Hsp60 (GroEL) complexes where further folding of the molecule occurs. The role of Hsp90 is more enigmatic, but it seems to be involved in a diversity of tasks such as regulating receptors, interacting with kinases and general protein stabilization (2Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The small heat shock family of chaperones (e.g. Hsp25) is also involved in protein stabilization but only at the crudest level whereby these chaperones stabilize their “substrate” proteins against stress (e.g. heat, heavy metals, oxidation, etc.) via formation of a high molecular weight (HMW) 1The abbreviations used are: HMW, high molecular weight; 3SS-α-lactalbumin, α-lactalbumin with Cys6-Cys120 selectively reduced and carboxymethylated; DTT, dithiothreitol; GuCl, guanidinium chloride; R-cam-α-lactalbumin, α-lactalbumin with its four disulfide bonds reduced and carboxyamidated; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: HMW, high molecular weight; 3SS-α-lactalbumin, α-lactalbumin with Cys6-Cys120 selectively reduced and carboxymethylated; DTT, dithiothreitol; GuCl, guanidinium chloride; R-cam-α-lactalbumin, α-lactalbumin with its four disulfide bonds reduced and carboxyamidated; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. complex with the chaperone protein (3Horwitz J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 4Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins are not involved directly in protein folding. On their own, Hsp25 chaperone proteins do not have a significant ability to release their substrate proteins, although recent evidence suggests that they may be able to do soin vitro, at least partially, via secondary interaction of the HMW complex with Hsp70 (5Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Small Hsps have been therefore classified as “junior chaperones” because of their inability, individually, to release proteins once complexed (6Creighton T.E. Jaenicke R. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 234-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The major eye lens protein, α-crystallin, is a member of the small heat shock family and shares many properties with Hsp25, e.g. they have extensive amino acid sequence similarity in their C-terminal regions and are both found as large, aggregated complexes of average mass around 800 kDa (7Boelens W.C. de Jong W.W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The lens is composed almost entirely of proteins known as crystallins. There is very little protein turnover in the lens, e.g. the crystallin proteins in the center of the lens are as old as the individual. Therefore, probably one of the major roles of α-crystallin in the lens is to act as a stabilizer of the other crystallins to prevent their precipitation from solution and hence their contribution to cataract formation. Furthermore, α-crystallin is not lens-specific and is found in many other organs (e.g.heart, lung, brain, kidney, etc.), where it has a similar stabilizing role to that of Hsp25 (7Boelens W.C. de Jong W.W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the interaction of α-crystallin with its substrate protein is not known. In particular, it would be of great interest to ascertain the conformation of the substrate protein when bound to α-crystallin because, in a general sense, this information may provide insights into how different chaperone proteins interact and differentiate between the various unfolded states of proteins. In this study, we have used NMR spectroscopy to investigate the conformational state of the substrate protein during its interaction with α-crystallin. For these studies we have chosen α-lactalbumin as the substrate protein. α-Lactalbumin is ideally suited for such an investigation because its various folded and semi-folded states have been extensively studied (reviewed by Kuwajima (8Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar)). α-Lactalbumin binds a calcium ion that enhances the stability of the protein. Under a variety of conditions, α-lactalbumin exists as a molten globule in a semi-structured state that retains elements of secondary structure but loses tertiary structural features. For example, in the absence of calcium at neutral pH, α-lactalbumin will form a stable folded species at high ionic strength and a molten globule at low ionic strength. It is believed that this molten globule state shares structural features of an intermediate along the folding pathway of α-lactalbumin. All work described in this paper involved the use of bovine α-lactalbumin without its calcium ion (apo-α-lactalbumin). Bovine apo-α-lactalbumin was obtained from Sigma. The intermediately folded forms of α-lactalbumin (R-cam-α-lactalbumin with its four disulfide bonds reduced and carboxyamidated, and 3SS-α-lactalbumin with Cys6-Cys120 selectively reduced and carboxymethylated) were prepared by literature methods (9Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3694-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Kuwajima K. Ikeguchi M. Sugawara T. Hiraoka Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Deuterated dithiothreitol (DTT) was from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory. Bovine α-crystallin was prepared by standard methods via size exclusion chromatography from lenses of animals less than one year in age (11Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Samples were checked for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 400 MHz on a Varian Unity-400 spectrometer. All parameters were as described previously (4Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra used a spin lock period of 30 ms. The chaperone activity of α-crystallin upon reduction of α-lactalbumin with DTT was assessed with a method based on that of Farahbakhsh et al. (12Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 509-516Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). α-Lactalbumin (2 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of varying amounts of α-crystallin from 0 to 14 mg/ml. Reduction and precipitation of α-lactalbumin was induced by the addition of 20 mm DTT. Light scattering at 360 nm and 37 °C was monitored over time using a Spectramax spectrophotometer. Size exclusion HPLC was performed using a TSK 4000SW column (7.5 mm inner diameter × 30 cm) attached to an ICI Kortec K350 pump delivery system, a Knauer variable wavelength monitor, and a Shimadzu C-R6A Chromatopac Integrator. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h prior to analysis by HPLC. α-Lactalbumin (0.05 mg) plus the corresponding amount of α-crystallin from the incubated samples in a volume of up to 40 μl was loaded onto the column and eluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and a range of salt conditions depending on the experiment. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Spectra were acquired on a VG Quattro mass spectrometer with the methods outlined in Kilby et al. (13Kilby G.W. Carver J.A. Zhu J.L. Sheil M.M. Truscott R.J.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). α-Lactalbumin has four disulfide bonds that upon reduction (e.g. with DTT) lead to unfolding, aggregation, and precipitation of the protein (10Kuwajima K. Ikeguchi M. Sugawara T. Hiraoka Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is easy to follow this process using visible absorption spectroscopy via the increase in light scattering associated with precipitation of the protein. Similar behavior is observed with other proteins upon reduction of disulfide bonds, e.g. the B chain of insulin precipitates from solution when the disulfide bonds joining it to the A chain are reduced. In the case of the insulin B chain, addition of an approximately stoichiometric amount (on a subunit basis) of α-crystallin leads to prevention of this precipitation (12Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 509-516Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Importantly, DTT does not affect bovine α-crystallin because it contains no disulfide bonds. Under similar conditions to those for insulin, α-crystallin also prevents the precipitation of apo-α-lactalbumin from solution (Fig.1). Under these conditions (pH 7.2, 0.1m NaCl, 37 °C), a w/w ratio of α-crystallin:α-lactalbumin of around 3:1 provided complete protection against aggregation. To investigate this interaction at the molecular level, the reaction of apo-α-lactalbumin with DTT in the absence and the presence of α-crystallin was followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Being a small and monomeric protein of ∼14 kDa in mass, bovine α-lactalbumin has a well defined 1H NMR spectrum whose aromatic resonances have been mostly assigned (14Alexandrescu A.T. Broadhurst R.W. Wormald C. Chyan C.-L. Baum J. Dobson C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows the aromatic region of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of apo-α-lactalbumin at pH 7.4 and the same region at various times after addition of deuterated DTT. As is apparent from these spectra, the addition of DTT leads to a rapid alteration in the NMR spectrum. Thus, within the time it took to add the DTT, place the sample in the NMR spectrometer, and commence acquisition (46 s), the spectrum broadened significantly. There was still some dispersion in the spectrum, however, which was mostly lost (spectra acquired at 79, 114, and 149 s are not shown) because these resonances broadened further and eventually disappeared due to the protein aggregating and precipitating from solution. Indeed, upon removal from the spectrometer after the experiment, a substantial protein precipitate was present in the NMR tube. Kuwajima et al. (10Kuwajima K. Ikeguchi M. Sugawara T. Hiraoka Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have examined this reaction in detail and concluded that the Cys6-Cys120 disulfide bond of α-lactalbumin is hyper-reactive and its rapid reduction (the fast phase) leads to the formation of an intermediately folded, or molten globule, protein that has the major elements of secondary structure and some elements of tertiary structure present. It is possible to isolate this three-disulfide-bonded species (10Kuwajima K. Ikeguchi M. Sugawara T. Hiraoka Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it has been extensively examined, e.g. in its interactions with GroEL (15Hayer-Hartl M.K. Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0 and 25 °C in the absence of calcium, further complete reduction with excess DTT of this species over a period of approximately 10 min (the slow phase) leads to greater unfolding, loss of tertiary structure and eventual aggregation and precipitation of α-lactalbumin (10Kuwajima K. Ikeguchi M. Sugawara T. Hiraoka Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Dobson and co-workers have proposed that there are disordered and highly ordered molten globules that represent intermediate states early and late, respectively, along the folding pathway (16Dobson C.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 6-12Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Redfield C. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is concluded that the two forms of intermediately folded α-lactalbumin observed in Fig. 2 A (represented by spectra at 46 and 183 s) correspond respectively to three-disulfide-bonded α-lactalbumin (the highly ordered molten globule) and a less-structured intermediate containing a mixture of zero, one, and two disulfide bonds (the disordered molten globule). The same reaction was monitored by 1H NMR in the presence of a slight subunit molar excess of α-crystallin (2:1 w/w α-crystallin:α-lactalbumin), i.e. conditions corresponding to α-lactalbumin being protected approximately 50% from precipitation relative to a control in the absence of α-crystallin (Fig. 1). α-Crystallin has two homologous subunits, A and B, and exhibits a well resolved 1H NMR spectrum due to short, flexible, and unstructured C-terminal extensions arising from the A and B subunits, respectively (11Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fortunately, there are no aromatic amino acids in these regions. The aromatic region of the1H NMR spectrum of α-crystallin contains only weak and broad resonances from histidine H-2 and phenylalanine aromatic groups that do not complicate the interpretation of effects on the aromatic resonances of α-lactalbumin when it is reduced with DTT in the presence of α-crystallin. The spectra of α-lactalbumin upon reduction in the presence and absence of α-crystallin were not identical (Fig. 2), i.e.in comparing Fig. 2 (A and B), the highly ordered molten globule intermediate was not observed, with only the disordered molten globule being present. Thus, it would seem that α-crystallin promoted the formation of this species, i.e. it sped up the slow phase step in the reduction of α-lactalbumin. Furthermore, α-crystallin had a significant stabilizing effect on α-lactalbumin when it was reduced, i.e. the broadened resonances from α-lactalbumin remain in solution longer when compared with the spectra of α-lactalbumin reduced in the absence of α-crystallin (Fig. 2). Thus, it took approximately 1000 and 1500 s, respectively, for the upfield resonance at 6.8 ppm from the tyrosine (3Horwitz J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 5Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) protons of α-lactalbumin to be lost in the absence and the presence of α-crystallin. Very similar stabilizing rates are observed for the other aromatic resonances of α-lactalbumin. The same NMR experiment was undertaken at a ratio of 4:1 or 6:1 w/w α-crystallin:α-lactalbumin. Under both of these conditions, α-crystallin completely stabilizes α-lactalbumin from precipitation (Fig. 1). For these mixtures, a time course of spectra was observed very similar to that in Fig. 2 B, i.e. only the disordered molten globule form of α-lactalbumin was observed (not shown). As is apparent from Fig. 2, resonances of α-lactalbumin after reduction are broad and poorly resolved and do not correspond in chemical shift to those expected for apo-α-lactalbumin in a completely unfolded state in 6 m guanidinium chloride at pH 7.2 (18Balbach J. Forge V. van Nuland N.A.J. Winder S.L. Hore P.J. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the resonances are sharper and exhibit greater dispersion. In fact, the spectra observed for the disordered molten globule of α-lactalbumin, i.e. 183 s after reduction (Fig. 2 A) and α-lactalbumin after reduction in the presence of α-crystallin (Fig. 2 B), are identical to the spectrum observed for apo-α-lactalbumin almost immediately (4.85 s) after initiation of refolding from denaturing agent (18Balbach J.

In this case, the spectrum arises from α-lactalbumin that is early along its folding pathway in which the kinetically formed molten globule state has elements of secondary structure but little tertiary structure (18Balbach J. Forge V. van Nuland N.A.J. Winder S.L. Hore P.J. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the1H NMR spectrum of α-lactalbumin at pH 1.9 under which conditions the protein adopts a molten globule conformation, the so-called A state (8Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 18Balbach J. Forge V. van Nuland N.A.J. Winder S.L. Hore P.J. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Allowing for pH-induced differences in chemical shifts for the downfield histidine H-2 resonances, the A state spectrum in Fig. 3 is equivalent to that for α-lactalbumin early along its folding pathway (18Balbach J. Forge V. van Nuland N.A.J. Winder S.L. Hore P.J. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and late along its unfolding pathway (Fig. 2). Thus, α-lactalbumin adopts the A state conformation prior to its precipitation from solution after addition of DTT (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, from the results presented in Fig.2 B, α-crystallin stabilizes α-lactalbumin in the A state, and because no further changes are observed with time in the NMR spectrum of α-lactalbumin in the presence of α-crystallin (apart from a decrease in intensity of these broadened α-lactalbumin resonances), this disordered molten globule state interacts with α-crystallin. In previous studies of the heat-induced chaperone interaction of α-crystallin with unfolding proteins, a HMW complex is formed between the two proteins (3Horwitz J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 4Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, a size exclusion HPLC profile of the 2:1 w/w α-crystallin:α-lactalbumin sample following completion of the NMR experiment exhibited a peak associated with a HMW complex and a much smaller peak arising from the monomeric α-lactalbumin (not shown). Thus, the profile was very similar to those of the heat (4Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and denaturant-induced (19Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) HMW complexes between α-crystallin and unfolded proteins. For the HMW complex between α-crystallin and α-lactalbumin, there was no further change in the one-dimensional1H NMR spectrum 30 min after addition of the DTT, implying that the reaction had gone to completion. Approximately 2 h after addition of the DTT, therefore, a TOCSY spectrum was acquired on the sample. The spectrum was very similar to that observed in previous studies on the HMW complex between α-crystallin and γ-crystallin (19Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the naturally occurring HMW complex obtained from older lenses (20Carver J.A. Nicholls K.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, it contained cross-peaks from the C-terminal extensions of α-crystallin with no cross-peaks that could be identified from α-lactalbumin, i.e. α-lactalbumin loses its flexibility upon interaction with α-crystallin, which is consistent with its incorporation into a HMW complex . Comparison of the NMR spectra of α-lactalbumin in the presence and the absence of α-crystallin (Fig. 2) prior to addition of DTT shows that the spectra of α-lactalbumin are noticeably broader in the former, suggesting that there is some association between the two proteins under nonreducing conditions that leads to exchange broadening. Similar effects are observed upon mixing α-crystallin with other proteins, e.g. β- and γ-crystallins (4Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), reduced and carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin and ovalbumin (19Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), insulin, and ovotransferrin, 2R. A. Lindner, A. Kapur, and J. A. Carver, unpublished results. which implies that α-crystallin has a weak, nonspecific association with a variety of stable proteins. The interaction between α- and the β- and γ-crystallins is selective, at least in part, for the C-terminal region of these crystallins (4Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this weak interaction of α-crystallin with stable proteins may be a prelude to interactions involved in the chaperone action of α-crystallin. From the above results on the reduction of α-lactalbumin with DTT, it seems that during its chaperone action, α-crystallin interacts with the disordered molten globule (A state) of α-lactalbumin to form a HMW complex. The various intermediately folded states of α-lactalbumin have been extensively investigated by a variety of different techniques (summarized by Kuwajima (8Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar)). Importantly, various partially folded states of α-lactalbumin can be prepared as stable entities that can then be used as probes to investigate the interaction of α-crystallin with unfolded proteins. Initial studies were undertaken on mixtures of α-crystallin, and the well characterized molten globule state of apo-α-lactalbumin that is observed at neutral pH and low salt in the absence of calcium. Fig.4 shows the aromatic region of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of apo-α-lactalbumin at pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA (to complex any calcium ions) and 45 °C in the absence and the presence of a 2-fold mass excess of α-crystallin. The spectrum of α-lactalbumin on its own under these conditions (Fig. 4 A) exhibits little chemical shift distribution and is relatively broad, which is indicative of a molten globule state. In the presence of α-crystallin (Fig. 4 B), there is some small alteration in the chemical shifts of resonances, but none are lost. This suggests that there is some weak association between the two proteins but no formation of a HMW complex,i.e. similar to the situation observed with native α-lactalbumin in the presence of α-crystallin (compare the spectrum of α-lactalbumin prior to the addition of DTT in Fig. 2 Awith the corresponding one in Fig. 2 B). The chaperone ability of α-crystallin is enhanced at elevated temperatures (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar,22Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), so the absence of any specific interaction between the two proteins does not arise from a decrease in chaperone action of α-crystallin at 45 °C. A comparison of the 1H NMR spectrum of apo-α-lactalbumin in the molten globule A state at pH 1.9 and 20 °C (Fig. 3) with that at pH 7.3 and 45 °C (Fig. 4 A) reveals that better resolved resonances are observed in the spectrum at neutral pH,i.e. the molten globule states of α-lactalbumin at these two pH values are not identical, with the state at neutral pH being more structured. Indeed, a one-dimensional spectrum of α-lactalbumin at 20 °C and pH 7.3 was much more structured than that at 45 °C (Fig. 4 A) with broadened α-CH resonances immediately downfield of the residual water peak and broadened methyl resonances upfield of 0.8 ppm (not shown), i.e. in regions indicative of tertiary structure. These resonances were only very weakly present in the spectrum at 45 °C, implying that higher temperatures at neutral pH favor a more molten globule-like state for α-lactalbumin. It seems, therefore, that there are a variety of molten globule states of α-lactalbumin that are associated with relative degrees of unfolding. In the case of α-lactalbumin, the partially folded states observed at pH 7.3 and 1.9 correspond respectively to the highly ordered and disordered molten globule states. The spectrum in Fig.4 A is similar, therefore, to that observed for α-lactalbumin 46 s after its reduction with DTT (Fig.2 A). From the data presented in Fig. 4, it is apparent that the weak association of α-crystallin with the highly ordered molten globule state of α-lactalbumin does not lead to the formation of a HMW complex. On the other hand, upon reduction with DTT, the disordered molten globule A state of α-lactalbumin interacts with α-crystallin to form a HMW complex (Fig. 2 B). Finally, it should be noted that α-crystallin dissociates at pH values below 4 (23Augusteyn R.C. Ellerton H.D. Putilina T. Stevens A. Biochim. Biophys.

We have been investigating the regulation and function of RPTPμ, a receptor-like PTP related to the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. Recently, the crystal structure of a dimer of the membrane proximal domain of RPTPα (RPTPα D1) was described (Bilwes, A. M., den Hertog, J., Hunter, T., and Noel J. P. (1996)Nature 382, 555–559). Within this crystal structure, the catalytic site of each subunit of the dimer is sterically blocked by the insertion of the N-terminal helix-turn-helix segment of the dyad-related monomer. It was proposed that dimerization would lead to inhibition of catalytic activity and may provide a paradigm for the regulation of the RPTP family. We have determined the crystal structure, to 2.3 Å resolution, of RPTPμ D1, which shares 46% sequence identity with that of RPTPα D1. Although the tertiary structures of RPTPα D1 and RPTPμ D1 are very similar, with a root mean square deviation between equivalent Cα atoms of 1.1 Å, the quaternary structures of these two proteins are different. Neither the catalytic site nor the N-terminal helix-turn-helix segment of RPTPμ D1 participates in protein-protein interactions. The catalytic site of RPTPμ D1 is unhindered and adopts an open conformation similar to that of the cytosolic PTP, PTP1B (Barford, D., Flint, A. J., and Tonks, N. K. (1994) Science 263, 1397–1404). We propose that dimerization-induced modulation of RPTP activity may not be a general feature of this family of enzymes.

We propose that dimerization-induced modulation of RPTP activity may not be a general feature of this family of enzymes. Numerous cellular events are regulated by reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, including growth, differentiation, the cell cycle, cell-cell adhesion, and cell-matrix contacts (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine levels are controlled by the coordinated and competing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; RPTP, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase; D1, domain 1 (membrane proximal domain) of RPTPs; DTT, dithiothreitol; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry. The PTPs comprise a diverse family of transmembrane receptor-like and nontransmembrane, cytosolic enzymes (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Receptor-like PTPs are likely to play crucial roles in transducing transmembrane signals and evidence is accumulating to link these enzymes to the control of phenomena mediated by cell adhesion (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). By interacting with ligands through their extracellular domains, the intracellular catalytic activity of RPTPs may be regulated, hence controlling the levels of cellular phosphotyrosine. The receptor-like PTPs RPTPμ, RPTPκ, and RPTPλ, which have extracellular segments sharing structural similarities with Ig superfamily cell adhesion molecules, have been shown to mediate cell aggregation via homophilic interactions (2Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 3Sap J.Y Jiang Y.P. Friedlander D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7264-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For RPTPμ, the homophilic binding site(s) reside on the immunoglobulin domain, whereas the intracellular segment consists of a juxtamembrane, cadherin-like domain, and two PTP domains (5Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A role for RPTPμ in regulating cell junctions and cytoskeletal organization is suggested by the finding that the RPTPμ is associated with cadherin-catenin complexes at adherens junctions (6Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Similar results have been demonstrated for RPTPκ (7Fuchs M. Muller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and RPTPλ (4Cheng J. Wu K. Armanini M.O. Rourke N. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7264-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PTP1B in a complex with a phosphotyrosyl peptide substrate (8Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), together with the results of a number of kinetic studies (9Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), have revealed important insights into the catalytic mechanism of members of the PTP family. The signature motif, (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G, which defines this family of enzymes, contains the catalytically essential Cys and Arg residues. It forms a rigid cradle structure that coordinates binding of the phosphate moiety of the substrate and positions the cysteine residue to act as a nucleophile. This motif lies at the base of a cleft on the surface of the enzyme, which is defined at one end by the invariant residue Tyr46 and at the other by Phe182, which is in a loop containing the invariant general acid Asp181within the highly conserved motif WPD. It is the depth of the cleft, equivalent to the length of a phosphotyrosine side chain, that is a major determinant of the specificity of these enzymes for Tyr(P) substrates, since the side chains of Ser(P) and Thr(P) are too short to permit access of the phosphate to the catalytic cysteine. Binding of substrate induces a profound conformational change in the enzyme such that on engagement of Tyr(P) the WPD loop flips down onto the Tyr(P) side chain (8Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This creates a predominantly hydrophobic recognition pocket that surrounds and interacts with the phenyl ring of the Tyr(P) side chain and allows Asp181 to act as a catalytic acid. Catalysis proceeds via nucleophilic attack by the invariant Cys (Cys215) on the substrate phosphorous atom and protonation of the tyrosyl-leaving group of the substrate by Asp181resulting in formation of a cysteinyl-phosphate covalent intermediate. The reaction is then completed by hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate by a water molecule, possibly activated by Asp181 (10Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recently, a model for the regulation of RPTP activity was proposed by Bilwes et al. (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) on the basis of their crystal structure of domain 1 of RPTPα. In contrast to the cytosolic PTPs, PTP1B andYersinia PTP, which are monomeric (12Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 13Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of domain 1 (D1) of RPTPα revealed a homodimeric organization that would result in an inhibited PTP (8Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The dimer results from a structural segment at the N terminus of the RPTPα D1 catalytic domain, consisting of a turn connecting helices α1′ and α2′ that wedges into the dyad-related catalytic site. The insertion of residues of the helix-turn-helix segment of one subunit into the catalytic site of the dyad-related subunit would be predicted to inhibit catalytic activity. This occurs first, as a result of sterically blocking substrate access to the catalytic site, and second, by constraining the WPD loop in an open conformation that is unable to adopt the closed conformation necessary for catalysis (8Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Distinct features of tertiary structure of RPTPα D1 that are absent from PTP1B are thought to facilitate this dimeric interaction. These include first, a two-residue insertion in the loop connecting α1′ and α2′, that inserts into the dyad-related catalytic site, and second, a β-strand (βx), immediately N-terminal to α1′ that forms a distinctive two-strand β-sheet with βy. The β-sheet between βx and βy, together with conserved residues within α1′ and α2′, contribute to defining the conformation of the helix-turn-helix segment of RPTPα D1 (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a sequence analysis of the PTP family suggested, on the basis of residue conservations, that the tertiary structural features of RPTPα D1 would be shared with D1s of other RPTPs but not cytosolic PTPs, such as PTP1B, or D2 of RPTPs (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RPTPα D1 lead Bilwes et al. (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) to propose a dimerization model for the regulation of RPTPα and, as a result of the sequence similarity with other RPTP D1s, it was suggested that this model could provide a paradigm for the regulation of RPTPs generally (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The model proposes that ligand binding to the extracellular segment would modulate dimerization and hence the catalytic activity of the PTP domain. We have been pursuing an investigation of the function of the Ig superfamily cell adhesion molecule related-phosphatase RPTPμ. At present little is known about the regulation of RPTPμ activity. Although it associates through its intracellular segment with the cadherin-catenin complex (6Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the effects on PTP activity remain unclear. We have initiated a structural analysis of RPTPμ to provide further insights into the mechanisms for control of its enzymatic activity. In this regard, the possibility that the structure of RPTPα is indicative of a general mechanism for ligand-induced inhibition of RPTP activity is exciting. Here, we describe the crystal structure of domain 1 of human RPTPμ and show that although it is present in the crystal as a dimer, unlike RPTPα D1, the active site of RPTPμ is in an open, uninhibited conformation. Therefore our data indicate that regulation of RPTP activity by dimerization is not a general feature of these enzymes. Residues 874–1168 of human RPTPμ D1 were cloned into a modified version of the pET28a vector (Novagen Inc.) 2D. Barford and N. Hanlon, unpublished data. that incorporates an N-terminal hexa-His tag immediately preceding Gly874. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli (strain B834) grown at 18 °C for 16 h. Protein purification was achieved with the following steps. Bacterial cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mmNaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml DNase, 5 μg/ml lysozyme and the cleared lysate loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Novagen Inc.) equilibrated in 50 mmTris·HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 20 mm imidazole. RPTPμ D1 was eluted using 50 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were dialyzed against a buffer of 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmbenzamidine. Precipitated impurities where removed by centrifugation and the filtered solution loaded onto a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in dialysis buffer. RPTPμ D1 was collected in the flow-through, brought to 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, and applied to a phenyl TSK column (TosoH Corp.) equilibrated in 1.0m ammonium sulfate, 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm benzamidine. The enzyme was eluted by applying a linear gradient of 300 ml to a buffer of 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT, 2 mm benzamidine. Peak fractions were loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein, at greater that 99% purity, was concentrated to 7.5 mg/ml and crystallized at 4 °C in conditions of 750 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA. 100 μl of RPTPμ D1 at 7.5 mg/ml was loaded onto a Superdex 75 prep gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. X-ray crystallographic data were collected to 2.3-Å resolution and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing.

The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 integrated version of AMoRe (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Crystallographic refinement was performed using X-PLOR (17Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), applying strict noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. Calculated phases using the model were improved by several cycles of combined solvent flattening (solvent content 0.50) and NCS averaging using the PHASES package (18Furey W. Swaminathan S. Am. Crystallogr. Assoc. Meet. Summ. 1990; 18: 73Google Scholar). Iterative rounds of simulated annealing refinement, combined with NCS averaging and solvent flattening, were applied to improve the quality of the maps and the protein model. During the final stages of refinement, the NCS restraints were removed. Analysis of the coordinates and electron density maps was performed with O (19Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The final model consists of residues 879–1156 of RPTPμ D1 that are visible within the electron density and 340 water molecules (TableI). The structure of RPTPα D1 consists of residues 877–1156 (RPTPμ numbering (20Gebbink M. Van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R. Van Kessel A. Moolenar W.

Open table in a new tab In the crystal structure of RPTPμ D1, the subunits associate to form a dimer with 2-fold symmetry (Fig.1). It is most likely that the dimerization of RPTPμ D1 is a consequence of crystallization, since size exclusion chromatography studies revealed that the protein was monomeric with an apparent molecular mass of ∼28 kDa in concentrated solutions of ∼7.5 mg/ml (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to RPTPα D1, which forms monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers in solution at protein concentrations of 0.1–5.0 mg/ml (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of RPTPμ D1 is entirely different from that of RPTPα D1, since the dimer interface of RPTPμ D1 does not include the N-terminal helix-turn-helix segment or the catalytic site (Fig. 1). Crystal packing analysis also shows no obstruction of the catalytic site of RPTPμ D1. The interactions between the two dimeric subunits of RPTPμ are hydrophobic in nature and mediated by residues Thr1025 and Ile1027 from one subunit and residue Ile1050 and the aliphatic moeity of Glu1052 from the other. These residues are not conserved within other RPTPs (Fig. 3). Within RPTPμ D1, the catalytic site is unhindered and adopts an open conformation similar to that of the apo form of PTP1B (12Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Residues of RPTPμ, equivalent to those of the RPTPα helix-turn-helix that inserts into the dyad related catalytic site, are exposed to solvent (Fig. 1).Figure 2Size-exclusion chromatography indicating that RPTPμ D1 elutes as a monomeric species with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa.

The major differences in tertiary structure are present within more mobile surface loops. Of particular note, the tertiary arrangements of the N-terminal helix-turn-helix segment and N-terminal β-strand, βx, and associated β-sheet with βy, of RPTPμ are essentially identical to that of the equivalent structural elements of RPTPα. These features distinguish RPTP D1s from the catalytic domains and N-terminal flanking sequences of cytosolic PTPs and are important in promoting the dimeric organization of RPTPα D1. Interestingly, Asp227 and Asp228of RPTPα D1, which are present within the helix-turn-helix segment that inserts into the dyad-related catalytic site, superimpose less well with equivalent residues of RPTPμ D1 (Ala895 and Glu896, respectively). The Cα atoms of these residues differ by 1.8 Å after global superimposition (Fig. 4), although this region of the polypeptide chain is well ordered. Among RPTPs, conservation of amino acids within the N-terminal helix-turn-helix that contribute to the dimer interface of RPTPα D1 is low (Fig. 3). Of the five residues implicated in this dimeric interface, only Glu234 is conserved between RPTPμ D1 and RPTPα D1. However, catalytic site residues that form the dimer interface of RPTPα D1 are either invariant or highly conserved between different RPTPs (Fig. 3). Thus, it is unlikely that invariant catalytic site residues would have the potential to interact with all of the structurally diverse N-terminal helix-turn-helix segments within the RPTP family. Moreover, if this were possible, it would imply that RPTP heterodimers may form as the catalytic sites of any given RPTP would not distinguish between the helix-turn-helix segments of other RPTPs. The structure of D1 of RPTPα determined by Bilwes et al.(11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) indicated the existence of a dimer in which a helix-turn-helix segment on the N-terminal side of one catalytic domain occupied the catalytic site of the opposing PTP domain in the dimer. This observation led the authors to propose the exciting possibility that ligand-induced dimerization of RPTPs in general may lead to inhibition of activity. They used this structural model to interpret previous observations regarding the signaling properties of an EGF receptor-CD45 chimera (21Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ablation of expression of CD45, the prototypic RPTP, from T or B cells disrupts normal signaling responses to engagement of antigen receptor. However, in some T cell lines, signaling can be restored by expression of membrane-targeted constructs containing the catalytic domain of CD45. In the instance of the chimeric molecule in which the extracellular and transmembrane segments of CD45 were replaced with those of the EGF receptor, signaling was restored only in the absence of EGF. It was proposed that in the presence of growth factor, dimerization of the chimera is induced with resulting inhibition of PTP activity. However, a direct effect of ligand binding on the catalytic activity of the EGFR-CD45 chimera has not been reported. Our results suggest caution in extrapolating beyond the structure of RPTPα to other RPTPs. We show that the N-terminal helix-turn-helix of RPTPμ D1 does not cause formation of an inhibited dimeric state, similar to that of RPTPα D1 (11Bilwes M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and therefore the dimeric structure of RPTPα D1 may not represent the situation for all members of the RPTP family. Dimerization may be a feature of only a subfamily of RPTPs, such as RPTPα and its close relatives, for example CD45, which share sequence similarity in those residues participating at the N-terminal helix-turn-helix dimer interface (Fig.3). Our results do not exclude the possibility that in the context of the plasma membrane the full-length form of RPTPμ may form an inhibited dimer. However, the fact we do not observe dimers of RPTPμ D1 in solution, unlike that for RPTPα D1, and that within the RPTPμ D1 crystal, which would mimic the restricted diffusion of RPTPμ in the plasma membrane, inhibition of catalytic sites is not observed, suggests that the N-terminal helix-turn-helix of RPTPμ D1 does not play a role in regulating the activity of this phosphatase."

To better characterize the mechanisms governing rat pol β activity, we examined polymerization on synthetic primer-templates of different structure. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that the catalytic efficiency of pol β (k cat/K m,dNTPapp) is strongly influenced by gap size and the presence of a phosphate group at the 5′-margin of the gap. pol β exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency on 5′-phosphorylated 1-nucleotide gapped DNA. This efficiency was ≥500 times higher than on non-phosphorylated 1-nucleotide and 6-nucleotide (with or without PO4) gapped DNAs and 2,500 times higher than on primer-template with no gaps. The nucleotide insertion fidelity of pol β, as judged by its ability to form G-N mispairs, was also higher (10–100 times) on 5′-phosphorylated single-nucleotide gapped DNA compared with the other DNA substrates studied.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The presence of both polymerase and lyase activities suggests that pol β catalyzes two steps in the “short-patch” BER pathway: removal of a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate intermediate and subsequent filling of the resultant 1-nt gap (4Klungland A.

Early studies showed that pol β is non-processive on single-stranded DNA templates, prefers short-gapped DNA substrates, and is capable of filling gaps to completion (11Chang L.M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 93: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Bambara R.A. Uyemura D. Choi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Matsukage A.

More recently, Wilson and colleagues (17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that pol β fills short gaps (2–6 nt) by a processive mechanism that requires a PO4 group at the 5′-margin of the gap. Binding of pol β to these short-gapped substrates is also strongly enhanced by the presence of a 5′-PO4 (18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments, together with recent structural data, suggest a model in which pol β binding to gapped DNA is mediated by interactions between the 8-kDa domain of pol β and the 5′-PO4 at the downstream margin of the gap (7Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Although DNA polymerization by pol β on single-stranded and short-gapped DNAs is understood in some detail, much less is known about pol β activity on its short-patch BER substrate, 1-nt gapped DNA. The model of pol β binding through its 8-kDa domain to the 5′-PO4 in short-gapped DNA does not appear to apply to 1-nt gaps; reducing the gap size from 5 to 1 nt decreases binding slightly, and the 5′-phosphorylation requirement is lost (18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that pol β may interact with 1-nt gapped DNA by a distinct mechanism. To better characterize the parameters governing pol β activity on 1-nt gapped DNA, we examined the steady-state kinetics of DNA polymerization on synthetic primer-templates of different structure. We show that the catalytic efficiency (k cat/ K m,dNTPapp) and nucleotide insertion fidelity of pol β are strongly influenced by gap size and that the 5′-phosphorylation requirement is retained for these activities even on 1-nt gapped DNA. These data have important implications for models of pol β DNA binding and provide biochemical evidence that 5′-phosphorylated 1-nt gapped DNA is the preferred substrate for pol β. Recombinant rat DNA polymerase β was purified as described previously (19Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M. Li S.X. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Operon Technologies. 5′-32P Labeling of the primers was performed with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled primers were separated from excess [γ-32P]ATP after labeling by gel filtration through 0.5-ml Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., DNA grade) spin columns. 2′-Deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs) were from Calbiochem or Pharmacia. Concentrations of individual dNTPs were determined by UV spectroscopy (Beckman DU65). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All other reagents were of the highest grade available from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. Primer-templates of different structure were constructed from synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (see Fig. 1). Hybridizations were done by mixing equimolar amounts of the required oligonucleotides in 250 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (22 °C) and incubating sequentially at 65 °C (10 min), 37 °C (10 min), 22 °C (10 min), and 0 °C (10 min). Annealing efficiencies were >95%, as evidenced by mobility shifts on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by the proportion of 5′-32P-primers extended in prolonged incubations with excess pol β and saturating concentrations of dNTPs (data not shown). The kinetics of dNMP incorporation opposite template positions G21 (see Fig. 1) were determined in polymerization reactions (10 or 20 μl) containing 0.1–20 nm pol β, 20 nm primer-template, and 0–5,000 μm of a single dNTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (22 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2.5% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Primer-templates were first incubated with pol β for 5 min at 37 °C in the absence of dNTPs, and then polymerizations were initiated by the addition of a single dNTP. After continued incubation for 3–15 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 0.1 volume of 0.5 m EDTA. 1–2-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 5 μl of formamide loading dye (20Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and immediately transferred into an ice slurry for 5 min. Products were resolved by PAGE (7 m urea, 16% acrylamide) and then visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager and Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). Reaction times and enzyme concentrations were adjusted for each substrate to optimize product detection while ensuring that all reactions were conducted in the steady state. Only those reactions that fell within the linear range of substrate utilization (≤20% primer extension) were used for kinetic analyses. Steady-state kinetic analyses were based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. For correct dCMP incorporation, k catand K m,dNTPapp values were determined using a non-linear curve fitting program (SigmaPlot). For mispairs,k cat/ K m,dNTPappvalues were determined from the initial slopes of Michaelis-Menten plots (20Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 21Boosalis M.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Hamatake R. Sugino A. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11360-11366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the frequencies of misincorporation were calculated as described (22Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To detect extension products resulting from dNMP misincorporation, it was often necessary to increase pol β concentrations and/or incubation times. As expected in steady state (22Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), V max values were directly proportional to enzyme concentration (data not shown). The processivity of pol β was determined on the same substrates used in the kinetic assays (see Fig. 1) and under similar conditions, except the reactions were started by adding all four dNTPs at saturating concentrations (1.25 mm each). Linear regions of product yield versus pol β concentration curves were used to quantify average (statistically weighted) processivities. Statistical weighting was performed by multiplying the lengths of the products by the relative intensities of corresponding bands on the gel. To examine pol β activity on DNA substrates of different structure, a series of primer-templates was constructed (Fig.1). These DNAs all contained the same 46-mer template sequence based on a region of bacteriophage φX174 DNA used in previous fidelity studies (Refs. 20Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar and 23Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 217-247Google Scholar, and references therein). All of the substrates also contained the same [5′-32P]20-mer primer hybridized to template residues 22–41. This places the primer 3′-OH terminus such that polymerization of the first dNTP occurs opposite template G21 (which corresponds to residue 587 in φX174 DNA). The simplest DNA substrate, comprised of [5′-32P]20-mer primer hybridized to 46-mer template, had a “recessed” primer with 21 nt of downstream single-stranded DNA template (Fig. 1 A). Two gapped substrates were also constructed (Fig. 1, B andC). The substrate designated gap-6 contained a second oligonucleotide (15-mer) hybridized to template residues 1–15, thereby creating a primer-template with a 6-nt gap immediately downstream from the 5′-32P-primer 3′-OH (Fig.1 B). A similar substrate with a 1-nt gap (designatedgap-1) was constructed by hybridizing a 20-mer oligonucleotide to template residues 1–20 (Fig. 1 C). Variants of gap-6 and gap-1 containing PO4 moieties at the 5′ margins of the gaps (designated P-gap-6 andP-gap-1, respectively) were also made by starting with 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides. Proper assembly of these oligonucleotides into the desired structures was confirmed in two ways. First, native PAGE showed that hybridization efficiencies were >95% as evidenced by different mobilities of the [5′-32P]20-mer primer before and after hybridization to the 46-mer template alone and in combination with the downstream oligonucleotides (data not shown). As a second indirect way of confirming structure, we examined the processivity of pol β on these DNA substrates. This approach is based on the observation of Singhal and Wilson (17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that pol β is distributive on recessed primer-templates and short non-phosphorylated gapped DNAs but processive on short gaps containing 5′-phosphates. We observed the same trend on our substrates (Fig. 2). Average processivities on the recessed, gap-6, and P-gap-6 DNAs were 1.3, 1.1, and 3.5, respectively. Thus, our data confirm the results of Singhal and Wilson (17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although synthesis on our phosphorylated 6-nt gapped substrate was not strictly processive (Fig. 2, right). We performed steady-state kinetic analyses of single-nucleotide addition (dCMP) opposite template G21 on the different DNA substrates (Fig. 3, dCTP reactions, and Table I). The K m,dCTPapp andk cat values of 170 μm and 0.6 s−1 observed on the recessed primer-template are comparable with those reported by others for pol β (21Boosalis M.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Hamatake R.

Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7041-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We noted, however, that theK m,dNTPapp values for pol β (40-170 μm; Table I and Ref. 21Boosalis M.S.

The unusually highK m,dCTPapp values observed on the recessed and gap-6 primer-templates suggested that these DNAs were relatively poor substrates for pol β.Table IEffect of DNA substrate structure on pol β catalytic efficiencyView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)1-a Sequences and structures of the DNA substrates are shown in Fig. 1.1-b Calculated using total pol β protein concentration.1-c Values in parentheses indicate the number of independent experiments used for each analysis.

In a manner reminiscent of its effect on processivity (Fig. 2 and Ref.17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA binding (18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-phosphorylation of gap-6 resulted in a modest reduction in K m,dCTPapp and concomitant increase in overall catalytic efficiency (k cat/ K m,dCTPapp). A similar decrease in K m,dCTPapp and increase in catalytic efficiency occurred when the gap size was reduced from 6 to 1 nt in the absence of a 5′-PO4 (Table I; compare gap-6 with gap-1). Most striking, however, was the dramatic effect of 5′-phosphorylation on the 1-nt gapped substrate, where addition of a 5′-PO4 resulted in a 500-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (compare gap-1 to P-gap-1). Thus, the relative catalytic efficiencies of pol β on the different DNA substrates were P-gap-1 ≫ gap-1 ≈ P-gap-6 > gap-6 ≈ recessed. pol β was some 10,000 and 2,500 times more efficient on P-gap-1 than on the gap-6 and recessed DNA substrates, respectively. As noted above, this increase in catalytic efficiency resulted primarily from a decrease in K m,dCTPapp, although k cat values were also slightly higher on P-gap-1. The k cat value of 0.6 s−1 observed on the recessed DNA substrate is very similar to the value of 0.3 s−1 reported for a different pol β preparation on a different recessed primer-template (24Werneburg B.G. Ahn J. Zhong X. Hondal R.J. Kraynov V.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7041-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The nucleotide insertion fidelity of pol β was determined on the same series of DNA substrates using a “standing start” (22Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) kinetic fidelity assay (Fig. 3 and Table II). The frequencies of nucleotide misinsertions opposite the template G21 residue were similar for all substrates except P-gap-1. The fidelity of pol β on P-gap-1 was 100, 50, and 30 times higher for G-T, G-G, and G-A mispair formation, respectively, compared with the recessed substrate. G-T and G-A mispairs were formed ∼10-fold more readily than G-G mispairs on all of the DNA substrates studied.Table IIEffect of DNA substrate structure on pol β fidelity2-a Sequences and structures of the DNA substrates are shown in Fig. 1.2-b Values in parentheses indicate the number of independent experiments used for each analysis.

This suggests that a preferred substrate for pol β might be 5′-phosphorylated 1-nt gapped DNA. We examined the DNA substrate preferences of purified rat pol β in steady-state kinetic assays using synthetic DNAs of different structure. We show that pol β prefers 5′-phosphorylated 1-nt gapped DNA as substrate with relative catalytic efficiencies on P-gap-1 ≫ gap-1 ≈ P-gap-6 > gap-6 ≈ recessed (Table I). The efficiency of pol β on P-gap-1 DNA was 500–10,000 times higher than on the other DNA substrates examined. We also observed that the frequency of nucleotide misinsertion by pol β was 10–100-fold lower on P-gap-1 compared with the other DNA substrates (Table II). Singhal and Wilson (17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that pol β switches from a distributive to a processive mode of DNA polymerization on short-gapped (2–6 nt) DNA substrates but only if the 5′-margin of the gap is phosphorylated. The very similar effects observed in our processivity experiments using different oligonucleotides (Fig. 2) indicate that this is an intrinsic property of pol β that has no obvious requirement for specific template sequences. Our steady-state kinetic analyses show that the catalytic efficiency and nucleotide insertion fidelity of pol β are also influenced by gap size and 5′-phosphorylation. Moreover, in contrast to what is obserbed for pol β binding to DNA (18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-phosphorylation is required for both high catalytic efficiency and increased fidelity on 1-nt gapped DNA (TablesI and II). These data extend the model of Prasad et al. (18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by showing that 5′-PO4 residues must mediate a productive catalytic interaction between pol β and DNA even in 1-nt gaps. The relative low fidelity of pol β observed on the recessed primer-template (f ins = 10−3–10−4; Table II) is comparable with that reported by others on recessed DNA substrates (21Boosalis M.S.

Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7041-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, our observation of similar fidelities on recessed and P-gap-6 DNAs appears to conflict with recent reports suggesting that pol β is less faithful during 5- and 6-nt gap-filling synthesis (17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy may relate to the overall higher catalytic efficiency of pol β on phosphorylated short-gapped DNA (Table I), to template sequence effects, and/or to differences in the assays used to measure fidelity. Additional experiments are required to resolve this. Regardless, our data showing increased fidelity on P-gap-1 DNA indicate that pol β, and by inference BER, may be less error prone than once thought. Several mechanisms may contribute to the observed effects of gap structure on catalytic efficiency and fidelity. Based on the binding studies of Prasad et al. (18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that the differences in catalytic efficiency on P-gap-1 and gap-1 are not due to differences in the levels of stable DNA binding (at least for pol β-DNA binary complexes detected by cross-linking and competition assays). An attractive general hypothesis is that the 5′-PO4 in a 1-nt gap somehow facilitates formation of a catalytically optimal pol β-DNA complex without affecting overall binding affinity. Amino acid changes at residues distant from the polymerase active site of pol β were recently shown to affect the fidelity of DNA synthesis (19Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M. Li S.X. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This indicates that molecular events at the active site respond to long range changes in the pol β protein. Thus, interactions between the DNA 5′-PO4 and the 8-kDa domain of pol β, which also occur at some distance from the active site (7Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), may remotely alter dNTP binding and/or protein conformational changes required for chemical catalysis (24Werneburg B.G. Ahn J. Zhong X. Hondal R.J. Kraynov V.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7041-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Additional kinetic and structural studies will be required to delineate the contribution of these and other mechanisms to pol β substrate recognition and catalytic efficiency. It is particularly germane to examine the role of the 8-kDa domain in directing the interaction of pol β with P-gap-1 DNAs (7Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we show that purified pol β exhibits relative high catalytic efficiency and fidelity on 5′-phosphorylated 1-nt gapped DNAin vitro. This suggests that a primary biochemical function of pol β in the mammalian cell is to fill 5′-phosphorylated 1-nt gaps. Gaps with this structure appear to be requisite intermediates in short-patch BER (1Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

The proinsulin sorting mechanism is unknown. Recently, carboxypeptidase E (CPE) was proposed as a sorting receptor for prohormones. To know whether CPE is implicated in proinsulin sorting, pancreatic islets were isolated from CPE-deficient Cpe fat /Cpe fat mice and Cpe fat /+ controls, pulse-labeled ([3H]leucine), and then chased in basal medium (90 min) to examine constitutive secretion followed by medium with secretagogues (60 min) to stimulate regulated secretion. Secretion of labeled proinsulin via the constitutive pathway was <2% even inCpe fat /Cpe fat islets. After a 150-min chase, only 13% of radioactivity remained as proinsulin inCpe fat /+ islets compared with 46% inCpe fat /Cpe fat islets, reflecting slower conversion. Regulated secretion was stimulated to an equal extent from Cpe fat /+ andCpe fat /Cpe fat mice with 20% of the total content of labeled (pro)insulin released during the 60-min stimulatory period. It is concluded that in CPE-deficientCpe fat /Cpe fat mice, proinsulin is efficiently routed to the regulated pathway and its release can be effectively stimulated by secretagogues.

CPE is thus not essential for sorting proinsulin to granules. Proinsulin is directed to the regulated secretory pathway of the pancreatic β-cell and is converted to bioactive insulin in immature secretory granules (1Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Vassalli J.D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1985; 42: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At least three enzymes are needed for generating native insulin, namely the conversion endoproteases PC1 (also known as PC3) and PC2 (2Davidson H.W. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C.

Arden S.D. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Correct targeting to secretory granules is essential for the cell to produce and store bioactive insulin, which can then be released upon stimulation of the β-cell by glucose or other secretagogues. One of the crucial steps in targeting takes place in the TGN (trans-Golgi network) (7Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Powell S.K. Quinn D.L. Moore H.P.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The proprotein must somehow be recognized selectively in the TGN and then be transferred to the immature secretory granules, instead of being released through the constitutive or default pathway (3Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). One hypothesis (reviewed in Ref. 3Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) accounting for targeting within the TGN implicates a sorting receptor with a broad specificity in the TGN membrane, which recognizes a sorting domain and thereby binds proteins to be routed to the regulated pathway. Sorting domains have been reported for several prohormones including prosomatostatin (8Sevarino K.A. Stork P. Ventimiglia R. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

Boileau G. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A putative C-terminal sorting domain has also recently been proposed for the prohormone convertase PC2 (15Creemers J.W. Usac E.F. Bright N.A. Van de Loo J.W. Jansen E. Van de Ven W.J.M. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25284-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There is not as yet any direct experimental evidence for a sorting domain for proinsulin, although the comparison of structural features of many prohormones suggests that a region within the insulin B-chain may play such a role (16Kizer J.S. Tropsha L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Gorr S.U. Darling D.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Very recently, CPE has been proposed as the targeting receptor for POMC (18Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) with evidence that it interacts with the N-terminal sorting domain on this prohormone. Further, proinsulin and other proproteins, which are normally secreted through the regulated pathway but not proteins which are released through the constitutive pathway, were shown to displace POMC (or a peptide encompassing its sorting domain) from this putative sorting receptor (18Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown thatCpe fat /Cpe fat mice appear to misroute POMC, resulting in its abnormal conversion and secretion (19Shen F.S. Loh Y.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5314-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Obese Cpe fat /Cpe fat mice suffer from hyperproinsulinemia associated with expression of a mutated CPE, which results in destruction of the CPE protein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (20Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouillé Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 21Fricker L.D. Berman Y.L. Leiter E.H. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30619-30624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The pancreatic β-cells of these mice are clearly granulated but the content of the granules appears to be less dense (20Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouillé Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), suggesting storage of proinsulin instead of mature insulin. Despite this observation, it has been suggested that proinsulin fails to be targeted to the regulated pathway in β-cells of these mice and that CPE is the sorting receptor not only for POMC but for other prohormones including proinsulin itself (18Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 19Shen F.S. Loh Y.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5314-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Confronted by this discrepancy, we wanted to know whether CPE is indeed implicated in proinsulin sorting. To this end, we have examined whether proinsulin is efficiently targeted to the regulated secretory pathway or released in major part through the constitutive pathway in primary β-cells in islets isolated from CPE-deficientCpe fat mice. C57BLKS-Cpe fat /J male mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME. Chemicals were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). [3H]Leucine (120 Ci/mmol) was from ARC (St. Louis, MO). Collagenase A (catalog no. 17449) was purchased from Serva (Buchs, Switzerland). The pancreas was removed from mice at 8 to 11 weeks of age and digested in collagenase (1 mg/ml) for 18–20 min, and the islets were hand-picked under a dissecting microscope after coloration by dithizone. For each experiment, islets from 6 mice were pooled and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (8.3 mm glucose), 10% fetal calf serum before use to recover from the isolation procedure. The islets were incubated for 15 min in KRB (16.7 mm glucose) then labeled with 2 mCi/ml [3H]leucine for 20 min in KRB (16.7 mmglucose), washed three times, and chased in KRB (+ 1 mmunlabeled leucine) containing 1.7 mm glucose (“basal”) for 30-min intervals up to 90 min. After each interval, the medium was collected, and fresh medium was added. From 90 to 150 min of chase, the islets were incubated in KRB containing a secretagogue mixture consisting of 16.7 mm glucose, 10 mm Leu and Arg, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 μmforskolin, and 0.1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to stimulate release of granules from the regulated pathway. At 150 min, the medium was collected, and the cells were extracted in 1m acetic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The medium and the cell extracts were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC to separate and quantify radiolabeled insulin-related peptides as described in detail previously (22Sizonenko S.V. Halban P.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Irminger J.C. Vollenweider F.M. Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1756-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact mouse islets were isolated fromCpe fat /Cpe fat orCpe fat /+ control mice and cultured for 24 h before use. The islets were pulse-labeled (20 min, [3H]Leu) and chased for 30-min intervals up to 90 min in basal medium containing 1.67 mm glucose. During these initial 90 min of chase, it was reasoned that under nonstimulatory conditions any newly synthesized (labeled) proinsulin in the medium would have been secreted predominantly by the constitutive pathway. At 90 min, medium containing the secretagogue mixture (see “Experimental Procedures”) was added, and the islets were incubated for an additional 60 min. Secretion of labeled proinsulin or insulin during this period reflects in major part that released via the regulated pathway. At the end of the total chase period of 150 min, the islets were extracted in acid. At this time, the majority of labeled proinsulin/insulin can be assumed to be stored in granules of the regulated secretory pathway; any proinsulin diverted to the constitutive pathway would thus have been secreted within this 150-min period. The major products observed in the islet cell extracts of control (Cpe fat /+) mice were insulin I and II. There was thus only a small amount (13% of total) of labeled proinsulin left in these cells after 150 min of chase (Fig.1 C). This is quite in keeping with proinsulin having been directed to secretory granules in which it had been converted to insulin and stored. InCpe fat /Cpe fat islets, by contrast, the major radioactive peak was proinsulin (Fig.2 C), accounting for 46.3 ± 2.4% of total proinsulin- and insulin-related radioactivity. The presence of such a secretory product in cells after 150 min is suggestive of its being stored in granules of the regulated pathway, given that no such storage compartment exists for the constitutive pathway but indicates unusually slow proinsulin conversion in keeping with published data (20Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouillé Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The other minor radioactive peaks could correspond to arginine-extended forms of insulin or other proinsulin conversion intermediates. Given that these minor peaks each accounted for no more than 10% of the total labeled products and that the present study addressed proinsulin sorting rather than processing, they were not analyzed further. The reason for slow proinsulin conversion inCpe fat /Cpe fat mouse islets is unknown. Although missorting to the constitutive pathway could account for poor proinsulin conversion, our data do not support this model. It therefore appears as though lack of CPE activity in granules in some way inhibits activity of the conversion endoproteases per se. Most recently, a study in β-cell lines derived from theCpe fat /Cpe fat mice (NIT-2 and NIT-3 cells) confirmed that this CPE mutation leads to inhibition of proinsulin conversion while suggesting that at least some proinsulin was directed to granules. 2O.

This can only be addressed by following the kinetics of secretion of newly synthesized (labeled) proinsulin/insulin. Very little proinsulin could be detected in the basal medium of either control (Cpe fat /+) orCpe fat /Cpe fat islets, indicating that constitutive release was minimal in both cases. Essentially no detectable proinsulin was released during the initial 30 min of chase. Thereafter, from 30–90 min of chase under basal conditions, there was 1% proinsulin (of total content) released from theCpe fat /+ islets and 1.5% from theCpe fat /Cpe fat islets (Figs.1 A and 2 A, TableI). A value of 1% is close to that reported by us previously from rat islets (24Rhodes C.J. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and reflects remarkably efficient proinsulin sorting, notably even inCpe fat /Cpe fat mice.Table IPercentage of total (pro)insulin-related productsChase medium 30–90 min basalChase medium 90–150-min stimulatedCell extract at 150 min%%%Cpe fat /+121.477.6Cpe fat /Cpe fat1.5 ± 0.420.4 ± 5.178.1 ± 5.5The medium and the cell extracts were analyzed on HPLC as described in Fig. 1.

Data are mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments for Cpe fat /Cpe fat islets and one of two independent experiments for controls. The hallmark of the regulated pathway is its sensitivity toward secretagogues. Release of proinsulin/insulin was stimulated to a comparable extent from control (Cpe fat /+) andCpe fat /Cpe fat islets. After 60 min of stimulation, 20% of total (cellular) (pro)insulin had been released from the islets of both groups (Table I). Furthermore, the HPLC profile for labeled products released following stimulation was essentially identical to that of stored cellular products (Fig. 1,B versus C, and Fig. 2, B versus C). Taken together with the values for constitutive release described above, these data indicate clearly that the overwhelming majority of proinsulin, even in Cpe fat /Cpe fat islets, had been correctly sorted to granules. We conclude that even if proinsulin is not processed rapidly or extensively in the CPE-deficientCpe fat /Cpe fat mice, it is efficiently targeted to the regulated pathway and stored in secretory granules. The lack of CPE does not have any apparent influence on proinsulin routing and therefore it is most unlikely that CPE is the regulated secretory pathway sorting receptor for proinsulin, at least in the Cpe fat /Cpe fat mouse model. In a very recent report, the putative role of CPE as a sorting receptor has been questioned on theoretical grounds (25Thiele C. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded at this point that different classes of sorting receptors or even different sorting mechanisms can co-exist, responsible for targeting of different subsets of prohormones. Although it remains to be explained why proinsulin is so efficient in displacing POMC from CPE (18Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the physiological relevance of this finding must be revisited in the light of the present study, which demonstrates unequivocally that CPE is not indispensable for proinsulin sorting to the regulated pathway.

Correct targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins within the eukaryotic cell is essential for its function and for the biogenesis of the various organelles. The majority of proteins destined for the mitochondria or chloroplasts are synthesized initially as precursors with N-terminal extensions. These serve as transit peptides to direct the protein to receptors on the surface of the organelle and are generally removed during or after import by specific processing proteases. Analysis of each class of transit peptide has revealed that there is little conservation at the primary sequence level either in composition or in length, although some general features have been identified, such as the fact that mitochondrial presequences frequently form amphiphilic α-helices (1Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). It is generally considered that they are very specific and that the receptor machinery on the outer membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria is able to discriminate between bona fide precursors and those which reside in another organelle. For example, the Nicotiana plumbaginifoliatransit peptide from the β subunit of F1-ATPase will direct proteins to plant mitochondria in vitro (2Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Whelan J. Knorpp C. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) orin vivo (4Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1987; 328: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but not to chloroplasts. Similarly, chloroplast precursors such as the 33-kDa subunit of the photosynthetic water-splitting complex (OEC33) (3Whelan J. Knorpp C. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or the chlorophylla/b-binding protein (2Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not targeted to plant mitochondria.Conversely, there is evidence that some “mis-sorting” can occur with chloroplast transit peptides into fungal mitochondria and vice versa. For example, the transit peptide of the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (SSU) 1The abbreviations used are: SSU, small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; COX, cytochrome oxidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NAD-ME, NAD-malic enzyme; LHCP, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein; Tes,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SSU, small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; COX, cytochrome oxidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NAD-ME, NAD-malic enzyme; LHCP, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein; Tes,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. fromChlamydomonas directed the import of passenger proteins into yeast mitochondria both in vivo and in vitro (5Hurt E.C. Soltanifar N. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a reciprocal experiment, Huang et al. (6Huang J. Hack E. Thornburg R.W. Myers A.M. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit Va (COXVa) transit peptide directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to both chloroplasts and mitochondria in transgenic tobacco. However, both systems used artificial fusion proteins in heterologous systems, and both presequences used were atypical: that of the ChlamydomonasSSU has the potential to form an amphiphilic α-helix more typical of mitochondrial transit peptides (7Franzen L.-G. Rochaix J.-D. Von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas the yeast COXVa presequence was predicted to form an antiparallel β-sheet (8Cumsky M.G. Trueblood C.E. Ko C. Poynton R.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, since fungi do not possess chloroplasts, there is no need for their mitochondria to have mechanisms to discriminate between precursor proteins, so these data do not necessarily prove mistargeting of proteins between chloroplasts and mitochondria in vivo.In contrast, Creissen et al. (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have reported that expression of the cDNA for pea glutathione reductase in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in the targeting of the enzyme both to chloroplasts and to mitochondria. They were also able to show that this targeting was due to the transit peptide, since alone it was able to target a bacterial phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein to both organelles in vivo. This is not mistargeting, however. Glutathione reductase is found in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the cytosol (10Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), but it is encoded by a single nuclear gene in peas, so the translated protein must contain all the information needed for targeting to these three subcellular locations.Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) is the last enzyme of heme biosynthesis, and its activity has been detected in both mitochondria and plastids (11Little H.N. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using functional complementation of a yeast mutant defective in the enzyme, we isolated a single cDNA clone (AF3) for ferrochelatase from Arabidopsis thaliana (12Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor protein encoded by the AF3 cDNA was shown to be targeted to chloroplasts in vitro and processed to the mature size. Furthermore, it was processed by pea stromal extract, but not by maize mitochondrial extract nor by purified mitochondrial processing peptidase from Neurospora. We therefore assumed that this was the chloroplast isoform of the enzyme. Subsequently, we isolated an additional 27 cDNA clones by the same method, which fell into two groups on the basis of restriction maps and Southern hybridization. 2K. S. Chow and A. G. Smith, manuscript in preparation. 2K. S. Chow and A. G. Smith, manuscript in preparation. The larger group, comprising some 22 clones, was essentially the same as the original AF3 clone and subsequently was found to be encoded by the same gene, designated ferrochelatase-I. The other group of 5 cDNAs encoded a ferrochelatase (ferrochelatase-II) with 70% amino acid similarity to the ferrochelatase-I protein. Since we had demonstrated that ferrochelatase-I was targeted to chloroplasts, we expected that ferrochelatase-II was the mitochondrial isoform. However, all attempts to import the precursor protein into isolated mitochondria were unsuccessful. Instead, the protein was imported into chloroplasts and processed to the mature size, with an efficiency similar to that of the ferrochelatase-I precursor (13Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since we had screened over 106 clones in our functional complementation experiment and found a total of 27 independent ferrochelatase cDNAs, it was unlikely that there would be a third isoform of the enzyme. This prompted us to investigate further the targeting of ferrochelatase-I. In this paper we describe experiments which demonstrate that the ferrochelatase-I protein is dual-targeted to both plant mitochondria and chloroplasts in vitro.DISCUSSIONWe have clearly demonstrated that the precursor for ferrochelatase-I from Arabidopsis is imported into both mitochondria and chloroplasts from peas in vitro and processed to the mature size of about 42 kDa. The import into mitochondria is not due to contamination of the mitochondrial preparations with chloroplasts, since it was abolished by valinomycin (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), which destroys the membrane potential necessary for protein import (29Schleyer M. Schmidt B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It also is not due to lack of discrimination by our mitochondrial preparation since there was no equivalent import of the exclusively chloroplast proteins LHCP (Fig.1 C) or porphobilinogen deaminase (Fig. 5). Similarly, the pea chloroplasts do not take up proteins that are found exclusively in mitochondria such as COXIV or adenine-nucleotide transporter (data not shown), and valinomycin also does not inhibit ferrochelatase-I import into chloroplasts (Fig. 3 B, lane 4).In addition, although previously the precursor to ferrochelatase-I was not processed in vitro with mitochondrial extract from maize (12Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have been able to demonstrate cleavage with mitochondrial extract from pea (Fig. 2 B, lane 8). The reason for this discrepancy is probably due to the amount of extract used in the two experiments: although some evidence of processing was seen with lower concentrations, we only observed convincing processing with 500 μg of pea mitochondrial protein, 5 times more than was used for the maize extract, even though this lower amount was able to process efficiently the precursor to yeast COXIV (12Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it may also reflect the fact that the ferrochelatase-I precursor is from a dicotyledonous plant, as is pea, while maize is a monocot. Indeed the maize NAD-ME precursor was still rather poorly cleaved with 500 μg of pea mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). The cleavage of ferrochelatase-I precursor by both chloroplast and mitochondrial extracts was prevented by the inclusion of EDTA, indicating that the processing activity was due to the respective processing peptidases, both of which require metal ions for activity (e.g. Refs. 26Robinson C. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Whelan J. Knorpp C. Harmey M.A. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, and 31Böhni P.C. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rather than nonspecific proteases, which are particularly active in stromal extracts (32Musgrove J.E. Elderfield P.D. Robinson C. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 1616-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The only other protein which has been reported to be targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria is glutathione reductase from pea (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Since this work was carried out in vivo in transgenic tobacco plants, it was not possible to compare the relative efficiencies of targeting to the two organelles nor was it possible to determine the contribution of cytosolic glutathione reductase to the total activity. In pea, the majority of glutathione reductase activity is found in the chloroplasts (77%), with only 3% in mitochondria and the remaining 20% cytosolic (10Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus one could conceivably argue that the import into mitochondria is the result of mistargeting. This seems unlikely to be the explanation for our results with ferrochelatase-I however, since it was imported with approximately the same efficiency into chloroplasts and mitochondria (Fig. 4), both prepared from the same tissue (1–2-week-old pea leaves). If it were simply that import into one organelle was an artifact, it would be expected to be much less efficient than into the genuine location, as was seen for the targeting to yeast mitochondria of passenger proteins fused to Chlamydomonas SSU presequence (5Hurt E.C. Soltanifar N. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are no determinations of the proportion of ferrochelatase activity between mitochondria and chloroplasts, but Little and Jones (11Little H.N. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) found that the specific activity was very similar in mitochondria and etioplasts from dark grown barley leaves, and indeed the two isoforms had very similar properties. Direct comparison of activity and import efficiency for ferrochelatase is, however, complicated by the fact that in chloroplasts there is a separate isozyme, ferrochelatase-II (13Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, even without direct evidence of dual targeting of ferrochelatase-I in vivo, the behavior of precursor proteins in import experiments in vitro has generally been assumed to reflect the situation in vivo, and there is no reason why this should not be the case for ferrochelatase-I. Furthermore, although until recently it was assumed that multiple isoforms of an enzyme located in different compartments were encoded by separate nuclear genes, as is the case for superoxide dismutase (33van Camp W. van Montagu M. Inze D. Foy-er C.H. Mullineaux P.M. Causes of Photooxidative Stress and Amelioration of Defense Systems in Plants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 317-341Google Scholar) and malate dehydrogenase (34Gietl C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), examples of proteins targeted to more than one location are becoming more common. For example, the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of rat fumarase (35Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and isopentenyl-pyrophosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase and ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase from yeast (36Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are each the products of a single gene, as are the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of alanine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in Arabidopsis (37Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of transcription start sites in the latter gene showed the presence of two potential AUG codons in some transcripts, suggesting the possibility that the same message could give rise to two different polypeptides. A similar suggestion has been made for pea glutathione reductase (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).For ferrochelatase-I, alternative transcription or translation cannot be the explanation for the dual targeting we have observed. In general, there is a single radiolabeled protein of 50 kDa in the translation products of pAF3, corresponding to the predicted size of the full-length precursor. Although there is a second AUG in the message, the protein translated from this codon would be 45 amino acids shorter, equivalent to a loss of 5 kDa, which would easily be resolved in the gels. Consequently, our results have considerable implications for the mechanism of precursor recognition by mitochondria and chloroplasts, since it appears that identical targeting information is recognized by the chloroplast and mitochondrial import machineries. Conversely, should it prove that in vivo there is no dual targeting, then our results imply that negative factors must be present within the cell to inhibit incorrect targeting of ferrochelatase-I to one or another organelle. Because ferrochelatase-II appears to be exclusively chloroplastic and is not expressed in nonphotosynthetic tissue,2 ferrochelatase-I is the likely mitochondrial isoform. These negative factors would therefore be operating to prevent ferrochelatase-I import into chloroplasts.The results also indicate that there may be something unusual about ferrochelatase itself. In our analysis of Arabidopsisferrochelatase-I cDNAs, we have found one class (termed F5) which is shorter than AF3 by about 180 base pairs,2 such that the polypeptide it encodes would be translated from the second AUG. Despite missing the majority of the mitochondrial targeting information, this clone nonetheless was able to rescue a yeast hem15 mutant devoid of ferrochelatase activity. A similar result was obtained with a construct encoding a truncated form of yeast ferrochelatase (38Prasad A.R.K. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18198-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The authors found that in hem15 cells containing this clone, although there was detectable ferrochelatase activity, this was improperly localized throughout all the membranes of the cell, rather than confined to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is the normal location of ferrochelatase (39Harbin B.M. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The amount of heme synthesized in these cells was reduced compared with wild-type, but this was sufficient to allow functional complementation of the mutant, probably because in wild-type yeast, ferrochelatase activity is not limiting for normal heme synthesis (40Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7278-7283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although theArabidopsis F5 clone may simply represent a truncated cDNA formed during library construction, an intriguing possibility is that this encodes a cytosolic form of ferrochelatase. Recently, ferrochelatase activity has been found associated with the plasma membrane, which also contains measurable activity of the previous enzyme of the tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (41Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 274-278Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The product of this enzyme, protoporphyrin IX, is extremely photoreactive, as evidenced by the effectiveness of the diphenylether herbicides which cause this compound to accumulate (42Witowski D.A. Halling B.P. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 632-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43Matringe M. Camadro J.-M. Labbe P. Scalla R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In treated plants in the light, reactive oxygen species are formed which then cause lipid peroxidation and rapid cell death (44Duke S.O. Becerril J.M. Sherman T.D. Matsumoto H. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1991; 449: 371-386Google Scholar). The presence of ferrochelatase in several cell membranes may thus be a means to ensure that any protoporphyrin IX made under normal circumstances is rapidly metabolized and not allowed to accumulate. In this respect, ferrochelatase would have a similar role to glutathione reductase, which is also an important part of the plant cell's apparatus to deal with oxidative stress. Correct targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins within the eukaryotic cell is essential for its function and for the biogenesis of the various organelles. The majority of proteins destined for the mitochondria or chloroplasts are synthesized initially as precursors with N-terminal extensions. These serve as transit peptides to direct the protein to receptors on the surface of the organelle and are generally removed during or after import by specific processing proteases. Analysis of each class of transit peptide has revealed that there is little conservation at the primary sequence level either in composition or in length, although some general features have been identified, such as the fact that mitochondrial presequences frequently form amphiphilic α-helices (1Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). It is generally considered that they are very specific and that the receptor machinery on the outer membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria is able to discriminate between bona fide precursors and those which reside in another organelle. For example, the Nicotiana plumbaginifoliatransit peptide from the β subunit of F1-ATPase will direct proteins to plant mitochondria in vitro (2Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Whelan J. Knorpp C. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) orin vivo (4Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1987; 328: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but not to chloroplasts. Similarly, chloroplast precursors such as the 33-kDa subunit of the photosynthetic water-splitting complex (OEC33) (3Whelan J. Knorpp C. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or the chlorophylla/b-binding protein (2Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not targeted to plant mitochondria. Conversely, there is evidence that some “mis-sorting” can occur with chloroplast transit peptides into fungal mitochondria and vice versa. For example, the transit peptide of the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (SSU) 1The abbreviations used are: SSU, small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; COX, cytochrome oxidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NAD-ME, NAD-malic enzyme; LHCP, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein; Tes,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SSU, small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; COX, cytochrome oxidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NAD-ME, NAD-malic enzyme; LHCP, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein; Tes,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. fromChlamydomonas directed the import of passenger proteins into yeast mitochondria both in vivo and in vitro (5Hurt E.C. Soltanifar N. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a reciprocal experiment, Huang et al. (6Huang J. Hack E. Thornburg R.W. Myers A.M. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit Va (COXVa) transit peptide directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to both chloroplasts and mitochondria in transgenic tobacco. However, both systems used artificial fusion proteins in heterologous systems, and both presequences used were atypical: that of the ChlamydomonasSSU has the potential to form an amphiphilic α-helix more typical of mitochondrial transit peptides (7Franzen L.-G. Rochaix J.-D. Von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas the yeast COXVa presequence was predicted to form an antiparallel β-sheet (8Cumsky M.G. Trueblood C.E. Ko C. Poynton R.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, since fungi do not possess chloroplasts, there is no need for their mitochondria to have mechanisms to discriminate between precursor proteins, so these data do not necessarily prove mistargeting of proteins between chloroplasts and mitochondria in vivo. In contrast, Creissen et al. (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have reported that expression of the cDNA for pea glutathione reductase in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in the targeting of the enzyme both to chloroplasts and to mitochondria. They were also able to show that this targeting was due to the transit peptide, since alone it was able to target a bacterial phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein to both organelles in vivo. This is not mistargeting, however. Glutathione reductase is found in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the cytosol (10Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), but it is encoded by a single nuclear gene in peas, so the translated protein must contain all the information needed for targeting to these three subcellular locations. Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) is the last enzyme of heme biosynthesis, and its activity has been detected in both mitochondria and plastids (11Little H.N. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using functional complementation of a yeast mutant defective in the enzyme, we isolated a single cDNA clone (AF3) for ferrochelatase from Arabidopsis thaliana (12Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor protein encoded by the AF3 cDNA was shown to be targeted to chloroplasts in vitro and processed to the mature size. Furthermore, it was processed by pea stromal extract, but not by maize mitochondrial extract nor by purified mitochondrial processing peptidase from Neurospora. We therefore assumed that this was the chloroplast isoform of the enzyme. Subsequently, we isolated an additional 27 cDNA clones by the same method, which fell into two groups on the basis of restriction maps and Southern hybridization. 2K. S. Chow and A. G. Smith, manuscript in preparation. 2K. S. Chow and A. G. Smith, manuscript in preparation. The larger group, comprising some 22 clones, was essentially the same as the original AF3 clone and subsequently was found to be encoded by the same gene, designated ferrochelatase-I. The other group of 5 cDNAs encoded a ferrochelatase (ferrochelatase-II) with 70% amino acid similarity to the ferrochelatase-I protein. Since we had demonstrated that ferrochelatase-I was targeted to chloroplasts, we expected that ferrochelatase-II was the mitochondrial isoform. However, all attempts to import the precursor protein into isolated mitochondria were unsuccessful. Instead, the protein was imported into chloroplasts and processed to the mature size, with an efficiency similar to that of the ferrochelatase-I precursor (13Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since we had screened over 106 clones in our functional complementation experiment and found a total of 27 independent ferrochelatase cDNAs, it was unlikely that there would be a third isoform of the enzyme. This prompted us to investigate further the targeting of ferrochelatase-I. In this paper we describe experiments which demonstrate that the ferrochelatase-I protein is dual-targeted to both plant mitochondria and chloroplasts in vitro. DISCUSSIONWe have clearly demonstrated that the precursor for ferrochelatase-I from Arabidopsis is imported into both mitochondria and chloroplasts from peas in vitro and processed to the mature size of about 42 kDa. The import into mitochondria is not due to contamination of the mitochondrial preparations with chloroplasts, since it was abolished by valinomycin (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), which destroys the membrane potential necessary for protein import (29Schleyer M. Schmidt B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It also is not due to lack of discrimination by our mitochondrial preparation since there was no equivalent import of the exclusively chloroplast proteins LHCP (Fig.1 C) or porphobilinogen deaminase (Fig. 5). Similarly, the pea chloroplasts do not take up proteins that are found exclusively in mitochondria such as COXIV or adenine-nucleotide transporter (data not shown), and valinomycin also does not inhibit ferrochelatase-I import into chloroplasts (Fig. 3 B, lane 4).In addition, although previously the precursor to ferrochelatase-I was not processed in vitro with mitochondrial extract from maize (12Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have been able to demonstrate cleavage with mitochondrial extract from pea (Fig. 2 B, lane 8). The reason for this discrepancy is probably due to the amount of extract used in the two experiments: although some evidence of processing was seen with lower concentrations, we only observed convincing processing with 500 μg of pea mitochondrial protein, 5 times more than was used for the maize extract, even though this lower amount was able to process efficiently the precursor to yeast COXIV (12Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it may also reflect the fact that the ferrochelatase-I precursor is from a dicotyledonous plant, as is pea, while maize is a monocot. Indeed the maize NAD-ME precursor was still rather poorly cleaved with 500 μg of pea mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). The cleavage of ferrochelatase-I precursor by both chloroplast and mitochondrial extracts was prevented by the inclusion of EDTA, indicating that the processing activity was due to the respective processing peptidases, both of which require metal ions for activity (e.g. Refs. 26Robinson C. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Whelan J. Knorpp C. Harmey M.A. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, and 31Böhni P.C. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rather than nonspecific proteases, which are particularly active in stromal extracts (32Musgrove J.E. Elderfield P.D. Robinson C. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 1616-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The only other protein which has been reported to be targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria is glutathione reductase from pea (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Since this work was carried out in vivo in transgenic tobacco plants, it was not possible to compare the relative efficiencies of targeting to the two organelles nor was it possible to determine the contribution of cytosolic glutathione reductase to the total activity. In pea, the majority of glutathione reductase activity is found in the chloroplasts (77%), with only 3% in mitochondria and the remaining 20% cytosolic (10Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus one could conceivably argue that the import into mitochondria is the result of mistargeting. This seems unlikely to be the explanation for our results with ferrochelatase-I however, since it was imported with approximately the same efficiency into chloroplasts and mitochondria (Fig. 4), both prepared from the same tissue (1–2-week-old pea leaves). If it were simply that import into one organelle was an artifact, it would be expected to be much less efficient than into the genuine location, as was seen for the targeting to yeast mitochondria of passenger proteins fused to Chlamydomonas SSU presequence (5Hurt E.C. Soltanifar N. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are no determinations of the proportion of ferrochelatase activity between mitochondria and chloroplasts, but Little and Jones (11Little H.N. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) found that the specific activity was very similar in mitochondria and etioplasts from dark grown barley leaves, and indeed the two isoforms had very similar properties. Direct comparison of activity and import efficiency for ferrochelatase is, however, complicated by the fact that in chloroplasts there is a separate isozyme, ferrochelatase-II (13Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, even without direct evidence of dual targeting of ferrochelatase-I in vivo, the behavior of precursor proteins in import experiments in vitro has generally been assumed to reflect the situation in vivo, and there is no reason why this should not be the case for ferrochelatase-I. Furthermore, although until recently it was assumed that multiple isoforms of an enzyme located in different compartments were encoded by separate nuclear genes, as is the case for superoxide dismutase (33van Camp W. van Montagu M. Inze D. Foy-er C.H. Mullineaux P.M. Causes of Photooxidative Stress and Amelioration of Defense Systems in Plants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 317-341Google Scholar) and malate dehydrogenase (34Gietl C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), examples of proteins targeted to more than one location are becoming more common. For example, the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of rat fumarase (35Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and isopentenyl-pyrophosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase and ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase from yeast (36Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are each the products of a single gene, as are the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of alanine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in Arabidopsis (37Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of transcription start sites in the latter gene showed the presence of two potential AUG codons in some transcripts, suggesting the possibility that the same message could give rise to two different polypeptides. A similar suggestion has been made for pea glutathione reductase (9Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).For ferrochelatase-I, alternative transcription or translation cannot be the explanation for the dual targeting we have observed. In general, there is a single radiolabeled protein of 50 kDa in the translation products of pAF3, corresponding to the predicted size of the full-length precursor. Although there is a second AUG in the message, the protein translated from this codon would be 45 amino acids shorter, equivalent to a loss of 5 kDa, which would easily be resolved in the gels. Consequently, our results have considerable implications for the mechanism of precursor recognition by mitochondria and chloroplasts, since it appears that identical targeting information is recognized by the chloroplast and mitochondrial import machineries. Conversely, should it prove that in vivo there is no dual targeting, then our results imply that negative factors must be present within the cell to inhibit incorrect targeting of ferrochelatase-I to one or another organelle. Because ferrochelatase-II appears to be exclusively chloroplastic and is not expressed in nonphotosynthetic tissue,2 ferrochelatase-I is the likely mitochondrial isoform. These negative factors would therefore be operating to prevent ferrochelatase-I import into chloroplasts.The results also indicate that there may be something unusual about ferrochelatase itself. In our analysis of Arabidopsisferrochelatase-I cDNAs, we have found one class (termed F5) which is shorter than AF3 by about 180 base pairs,2 such that the polypeptide it encodes would be translated from the second AUG. Despite missing the majority of the mitochondrial targeting information, this clone nonetheless was able to rescue a yeast hem15 mutant devoid of ferrochelatase activity. A similar result was obtained with a construct encoding a truncated form of yeast ferrochelatase (38Prasad A.R.K. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18198-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The authors found that in hem15 cells containing this clone, although there was detectable ferrochelatase activity, this was improperly localized throughout all the membranes of the cell, rather than confined to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is the normal location of ferrochelatase (39Harbin B.M. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The amount of heme synthesized in these cells was reduced compared with wild-type, but this was sufficient to allow functional complementation of the mutant, probably because in wild-type yeast, ferrochelatase activity is not limiting for normal heme synthesis (40Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7278-7283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although theArabidopsis F5 clone may simply represent a truncated cDNA formed during library construction, an intriguing possibility is that this encodes a cytosolic form of ferrochelatase. Recently, ferrochelatase activity has been found associated with the plasma membrane, which also contains measurable activity of the previous enzyme of the tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (41Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 274-278Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The product of this enzyme, protoporphyrin IX, is extremely photoreactive, as evidenced by the effectiveness of the diphenylether herbicides which cause this compound to accumulate (42Witowski D.A. Halling B.P. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 632-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43Matringe M. Camadro J.-M. Labbe P. Scalla R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In treated plants in the light, reactive oxygen species are formed which then cause lipid peroxidation and rapid cell death (44Duke S.O. Becerril J.M. Sherman T.D. Matsumoto H. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1991; 449: 371-386Google Scholar). The presence of ferrochelatase in several cell membranes may thus be a means to ensure that any protoporphyrin IX made under normal circumstances is rapidly metabolized and not allowed to accumulate. In this respect, ferrochelatase would have a similar role to glutathione reductase, which is also an important part of the plant cell's apparatus to deal with oxidative stress. We have clearly demonstrated that the precursor for ferrochelatase-I from Arabidopsis is imported into both mitochondria and chloroplasts from peas in vitro and processed to the mature size of about 42 kDa. The import into mitochondria is not due to contamination of the mitochondrial preparations with chloroplasts, since it was abolished by valinomycin (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), which destroys the membrane potential necessary for protein import (29Schleyer M.

The binding of AUF1 to AREs is believed to serve as a signal to an mRNA-processing pathway that degrades mRNAs encoding many cytokines, oncoproteins, and G protein-coupled receptors. Because the ARE binding activity of AUF1 appears central to the regulation of many important genes, we analyzed the domains of the protein that are important for this activity. Examination of the RNA binding affinity of various AUF1 mutants suggests that both RRMs may be required for binding to the human c-fos ARE. However, the two RRMs together are not sufficient. Highest affinity binding of AUF1 to an ARE requires an alanine-rich region of the N terminus and a short glutamine-rich region in the C terminus. In addition, the N terminus is required for dimerization of AUF1. However, AUF1 binds an ARE as a hexameric protein.

Highest affinity binding of AUF1 to an ARE requires an alanine-rich region of the N terminus and a short glutamine-rich region in the C terminus. In addition, the N terminus is required for dimerization of AUF1. However, AUF1 binds an ARE as a hexameric protein. Thus, protein-protein interactions are important for high affinity ARE binding activity of AUF1. RNA processing is an important component of regulated gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Together, the rates of transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA transport, translation, and mRNA degradation determine the steady-state amount of mRNA, and hence protein, that will be present in a cell at a given time. Each of these processes of RNA metabolism involves RNA-binding proteins that exhibit specific protein-RNA interactions (reviewed in Ref. 1McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, defining how such proteins interact with their RNA substrates is integral to understanding the complex control of RNA processing. A variety of conserved protein motifs mediate specific protein-RNA interactions (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most common and well characterized of these motifs is the RNA recognition motif (RRM), 1The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; ARE, A + U-rich element; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP, heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; mdeg, millidegrees. also called a consensus sequence RNA-binding domain. This motif consists of 80–90 amino acids containing two conserved sequences: a highly conserved octamer motif, RNP-1, and a less conserved hexamer motif, RNP-2 (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 3Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The general structure of an RRM consists of a βαβ-βαβ folding pattern in a four-stranded β-sheet with the two α-helices packed against one face of the sheet. The RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs lie on the two central strands at the center of the β-sheet. These motifs probably provide general RNA binding activity. The mechanisms by which RRMs provide sequence-specific or structure-specific RNA recognition are unknown. However, recognition of specific targets is thought to be provided by unique amino acids located in intradomain loops and tails. Nonetheless, this seemingly simple view is complicated by two observations. (i) Multiple RRMs within some proteins are required for high affinity RNA binding (see Ref. 3Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and references therein); and (ii) complex communication can occur between amino acids in the intradomain loops and tails (4Zeng Q. Hall K. RNA. 1997; 3: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the efforts of many laboratories are being directed toward dissecting the molecular mechanisms of specific RNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins. We previously molecularly cloned the RNA-binding protein AUF1. AUF1 binds with high affinity to a variety of AREs present in the 3′-UTRs of mRNAs encoding many cytokines, oncoproteins, and G protein-coupled receptors (5Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Binding of AUF1 to an ARE is thought to act as a signal to target the mRNA for rapid degradation. Because the ARE binding activity of AUF1 appears central to the regulation of many important genes, we analyzed the domains of the protein that are important for this activity. Binding assays with various mutants suggest that both RRMs may be required for ARE binding, but they are not sufficient. Amino acids flanking the RRMs seem to contribute to ARE binding, but their contribution is not simply to maintain or allow proper folding of the protein. Instead, the flanking amino acids appear to allow protein-protein interactions that may be crucial for high affinity ARE binding activity. In particular the alanine-rich N terminus is important for homodimerization of AUF1. However, AUF1 binds an ARE as a hexameric protein. Thus, additional protein-protein interactions are involved in the high affinity ARE binding activity of AUF1. All enzymes and plasmid vectors were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) unless otherwise noted. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by both restriction analyses and either dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase (version 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.) or by cycle sequencing with Taq Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Wild-type and mutant AUF1 constructs were cloned into pTrcHis vectors (Invitrogen) to create fusion proteins with an N-terminal polyhistidine (His6) tag followed by an epitope tag consisting of the 11-amino acid, T7 gene 10 leader peptide. Reading frames of His6-AUF1 expression constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the junctions of the pTrcHis vectors and the inserts. The entire coding region of p37 AUF1 resides on a 910-base pair BsmAI (New England Biolabs) fragment spanning nucleotides 236–1146 of the pBS8 cDNA sequence. This fragment was blunted and inserted into the SmaI site of the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector to yield plasmid pGEM7Z/P37CR (7Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.S. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This construct served as the parent for various restriction fragments that were cloned into pTrcHisB at theAsp718 (Boehringer Mannheim)-HindIII sites to create vectors encoding AUF1-(1–286), AUF1-(1–194), AUF1-(1–29/195–286), AUF1-(29–194), and AUF1-(1–257). Plasmid pTrcHisC/AUF1-(92–286) was constructed by inserting theBglII-HindIII fragment from pGEM7Z/P37CR intoBglII-HindIII-digested pTrcHisC. AUF1-(69–229) and AUF1-(69–257) were created by PCR amplification of the p37 AUF1 cDNA and ligation of the PCR fragments toBglII-HindIII-digested pTrcHisC, creating plasmids pTrcHisC/AUF1-(69–229) and pTrcHisC/AUF1-(69–257), respectively. AUF1-(29–286) was created by PCR amplification of pGEM7Z/P37CR, digesting the PCR product with KpnI andHindIII, and ligating it toKpnI-HindIII-cut pTrcHisB. Plasmid pTrcHisB/AUF1-(1–229) was constructed by a three-way ligation of theAsp718-BglII fragment from AUF1-(1–194), theBglII-HindIII fragment from pTrcHisC/AUF1-(69–229), andAsp718-HindIII-digested pTrcHisB. AUF1-(1–239/248–286) was created by polymerase chain reaction-directed deletion of the cDNA sequences in pTrcHisB/p37CR encoding the glutamine-rich region of the protein. Wild-type and mutant His6-AUF1 fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described by Pende et al.(7Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.S. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The concentration of each His6-AUF1 fusion protein was estimated by comparison of the intensities of the full-length polypeptide and dilutions of BSA in Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. RNA containing the c-fos ARE was synthesized by transcription of BglII-digested plasmid pα19Rβ+ARE (5Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), using T3 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). ApparentK d values were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and PhosphorImager analyses as described by DeMaria and Brewer (8DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Free probe concentration was plottedversus His6-AUF1 concentration, and apparentK d values were determined as the protein concentration at which 50% of the RNA was bound (9Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type His6-AUF1-(1–286) and His6-AUF1-(69–229) protein samples were diluted into a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mm potassium acetate to a final protein concentration of 5 μm. CD spectra were recorded from 190–230 nm at room temperature on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter using a cuvette with a 0.05-cm path length. The ellipticity values (mdeg) were converted to mean residue ellipticity (deg·cm2·dmol−1) according to the following formula (10Parks J.S. Gebre A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 266-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): [θ] = θ/10CL, where [θ] represents mean residue ellipticity; θ is ellipticity (mdeg),C is residue molar concentration (i.e. molar concentration of His6-AUF1-(1–286) × 326 residues/mol or molar concentration of His6-AUF1-(69–229) × 201 residues/mol), and L is path length of the cell in cm. For denaturation studies, the protein was incubated in buffer containing various concentrations of GdnHCl (0–7.6 m). For the samples and blanks, the ellipticity (mdeg) at 222 nm was measured, where the signal was collected for a total of 300 points to produce an averaged value for each sample and blank. The appropriate blank value was then subtracted from the sample value at each GdnHCl concentration. A plot of CD (in mdeg) versus GdnHCl concentration for each protein was constructed. The standard free energy of denaturation (Δ Gd0) was derived from each curve according to the method of Sparks et al. (11Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based upon the denaturant binding model described by Pace (12Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Δ Gd0 was determined for each protein using two different protein preparations to obtain an average ± S.D. For all analyses, a 1 × 19-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia) was equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5.5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate). Purified recombinant fusion protein at a concentration of 6 μm in 300 μl of buffer A (final volume) was loaded onto the column, and 60 300-μl fractions were collected. The protein elution profile was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a UA-5 absorbance detector (Isco). The column was calibrated with the following proteins: apoferritin (443 kDa, R S = 6.7 nm), β-amylase (200 kDa,R S = 3.7 nm), BSA (66 kDa,R S = 3.5 nm), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa,R S = 2.4 nm). Elution profiles of these proteins were determined spectrophotometrically as above. The void volume was determined using blue dextran. For examination of the RNA-bound form of the wild-type His6-AUF1-(1–286) fusion protein, an RNA-binding reaction was performed using either 32P-labeled c-fos ARE or rabbit β-globin 3′-UTR (as a negative control). The reaction was treated with ultraviolet light to cross-link the protein to the RNA, and then it was treated with RNase A as described by DeMaria and Brewer (8DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This was loaded onto a calibrated Sephacryl S-300 column in which the column buffer contained 10 mg/ml Torula RNA (Sigma) to reduce nonspecific retention (13Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected as described above, and protein-RNA complexes were detected by Cerenkov counting. Five to twenty percent sucrose gradients in buffer A contained 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purified recombinant fusion protein at a concentration of 6 μm in 200 μl of buffer A was layered onto a preformed gradient and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 20–30 h at 4 °C. Fifty-six 200-μl fractions were collected, and the protein elution profile was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a UA-5 absorbance detector. In addition, protein in selected fractions was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 20 μg/ml lysozyme (as carrier) by incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min. Each precipitate was resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resulting gels were either silver-stained or stained with Coomassie Blue. Velocity sedimentation centrifugation was also performed with the protein standards β-amylase (8.9 S), BSA (4.3 S), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.3 S). Elution profiles of these proteins were determined spectrophotometrically and by gel staining. For each His6-AUF1 protein, the sedimentation coefficient,s, was obtained from the following ratio with respect to each standard. Distance traveled from meniscus by His6­AUF1Distance traveled from meniscus by standard=Equation 1 sof His6­AUF1sof standardFor each protein, the sedimentation coefficient was determined as the average of the values obtained from comparison to each of the standards in two separate experiments. For examination of the RNA-bound form of the wild-type His6-AUF1-(1–286) fusion protein, an RNA-binding reaction was performed using either 32P-labeled c-fos ARE or rabbit β-globin 3′-UTR (as a negative control). The reaction was treated with ultraviolet light to cross-link the protein to the RNA and then treated with RNase A as described by DeMaria and Brewer (8DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This was run on a sucrose gradient, and fractions were collected as described above. Protein-RNA complexes were detected by Cerenkov counting. The monomer molecular mass of each protein was determined from the amino acid composition. The native molecular mass of each protein was calculated from the equation (14Barnett S.F. Friedman D.L. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), M=6πηRSNs/(1−v̄ρ)Equation 2 where η is the viscosity (g/cm·s), R Sis the Stokes radius (cm), N is Avogadro's number, ands is the sedimentation coefficient. The partial specific volumes, v̄, of His6-AUF1-(1–286), His6-AUF1-(1–194), His6-AUF1-(92–286), and His6-AUF1-(29–194) were calculated as 0.7217 ml/g, 0.7217 ml/g, 0.7301 ml/g, and 0.7270 ml/g, respectively, from amino acid composition by the method of Laue et al. (15Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The solvent density, ρ, was measured as 1.0059 g/ml. The frictional ratio, ƒ/ƒ0, of each protein was calculated from the equation (14Barnett S.F. Friedman D.L. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), f/f0=RS/(3v̄M/4πN)1/3Equation 3 Using quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we showed previously that purified, recombinant His6-p37 AUF1 fusion protein binds the human c-fos ARE with an apparent K d of 7.8 ± 0.4 nm. (The wild-type fusion protein will hereafter be referred to as His6-AUF1-(1–286).) As shown in Fig.1, the predicted AUF1 polypeptide contains two tandem, nonidentical RRMs. Adjacent to RRM1 is an alanine-rich, N-terminal region of 68 amino acids. C-terminal to RRM2 is an 8-amino acid region containing six glutamine residues. This is followed by a short C-terminal region. To examine the involvement of the RRMs and other regions of AUF1 in ARE binding, we constructed several N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of His6-AUF1 that were purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography. Each purified recombinant fusion protein was tested for binding to the wild-type, 32P-labeled c-fos ARE by gel mobility shift assays. The dissociation constant, or apparentK d, was calculated for each protein by determining the protein concentration at which 50% of the RNA probe was bound (8DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). His6-AUF1-(92–286) and His6-AUF1-(1–194) lack a portion of either RRM1 or RRM2, respectively, and these mutant proteins bound the c-fos ARE with respective 100- and 70-fold lower affinities than wild-type His6-AUF1 (Fig. 1). These results suggest that both RRMs are important for high affinity ARE binding. In support of this suggestion, His6-AUF1-(1–257), which retains both RRMs but lacks the C-terminal 29 amino acids, bound the c-fos ARE with an apparent K d of 5.3 nm, similar to the 7.8 nm apparent K d for wild-type His6-AUF1 (Fig. 1; Ref. 8DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, both RRM1 and RRM2 together are not sufficient for ARE binding, since His6-AUF1-(69–229) bound the c-fos ARE with 280-fold lower affinity than the wild-type protein. Nonetheless, the necessity of the RRMs is demonstrated by a mutant, His6-AUF1-(1–29/195–286) (depicted in Fig. 4), in which most of the amino acids comprising the RRMs were deleted. Comparison of this mutant with the wild-type protein using UV-cross-linking analysis with 32P-labeled c-fos ARE revealed undetectable binding by His6-AUF1-(1–29/195–286) (data not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that the RRMs of AUF1 are necessary for ARE binding, but they are not sufficient. Since the C-terminal 29 amino acids of AUF1 are dispensable for high affinity ARE binding, the importance of both the N-terminal and glutamine-rich regions for ARE binding was examined. His6-AUF1-(69–257) bound the c-fos ARE with 180-fold lower affinity than the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). His6-AUF1-(69–257) and His6-AUF1-(1–257) differ only by the presence of the N-terminal region in the latter; therefore, the N-terminal region of AUF1 is required for high affinity ARE binding activity. His6-AUF1-(1–229) was then created to assess the importance of amino acids C-terminal to RRM2 for ARE binding. His6-AUF1-(1–229) bound the c-fos ARE with an affinity of 207 nm, 27-fold lower than the affinity displayed by the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). Thus, amino acids C-terminal to RRM2 are important for high affinity ARE binding. To determine if the glutamine-rich region contributes to high affinity binding, this 8-amino acid region (amino acids 240–247) was deleted from the full-length protein. This mutant, His6-AUF1-(1–239/248–286), bound the c-fos ARE with an apparent K d of 36 nm, a 4.5-fold lower affinity than that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). This result suggests that the glutamine residues located in this domain do contribute to the ARE binding activity of AUF1. However, based upon the low binding affinity of His6-AUF1-(1–229), amino acids in the C terminus flanking the glutamine residues also contribute to the RNA binding activity. As a control for the possibility that one or more of the mutant proteins with low affinity binding had lost RNA binding activity during purification, ARE binding activity was analyzed in aliquots of the same bacterial extracts used for purification of the wild-type and mutant polypeptides. By UV-cross-linking analysis using these bacterial lysates and 32P-labeled c-fos ARE (8DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), ARE binding was either undetectable or occurred with at least 100-fold lower affinity than wild-type His6-AUF1 for the mutant proteins that bound the c-fos ARE with low affinity in the mobility shift assays shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Therefore, putative loss of RNA binding activity during purification of the mutant proteins is unlikely. The results can be summarized as follows. (i) While the RRMs appear important for high affinity ARE binding activity, both RRM1 and RRM2 together are not sufficient for ARE binding. (ii) The N-terminal region of AUF1 is required for high affinity ARE binding activity. (iii) Amino acids C-terminal to RRM2, particularly the glutamines and amino acids flanking the glutamines, are also important for high affinity ARE binding. However, the C-terminal 29 amino acids appear not to contribute to RNA binding, since their truncation has no effect on ARE binding affinity. For many RRM-containing proteins, either one RRM or a combination of the RRMs is usually sufficient for high affinity RNA binding (see “Discussion”). Thus, the low (2200 nm) ARE binding affinity of the His6-AUF1-(69–229) mutant (containing RRM1 plus RRM2 alone) is unusual among RRM-containing proteins. To examine the possibility that the low ARE binding affinity of this mutant might be simply due to its misfolding, the thermodynamic stabilities of the wild-type protein and the AUF1-(69–229) mutant were measured. Both proteins have CD spectra similar to other RRM-containing proteins (3Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,16Lu J. Hall K.B. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RRMs are folded in a structure similar to that observed for this class of proteins (Fig.2, upper panels). A combination of chemical denaturation with various concentrations of GdnHCl and ellipticity measurements at 222 nm was used to reveal changes in α-helical content as a function of GdnHCl concentration (Fig. 2, bottom panels). Application of the denaturant binding model of Pace (12Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) with these denaturation curves revealed that the thermodynamic stabilities (Δ Gd0 of unfolding) of the wild-type protein and the AUF1-(69–229) mutant are similar (1.941 ± 0.008 kcal/mol versus 1.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Therefore, it is unlikely that the low affinity of the AUF-(69–229) mutant for the ARE is due to misfolding of the polypeptide. We conclude from the ARE-binding studies that amino acids flanking the RRMs are necessary for the high affinity ARE binding activity of AUF1. However, the analyses of the thermodynamic stabilities suggest that they do not simply serve to permit proper folding of the RRMs. Nonetheless, the amino acids flanking the RRMs must play some role in the RNA binding function of AUF1. Since some RNA-binding proteins self-associate (e.g. see Ref. 18Zapp M.L. Hope T.J. Parslow T.G. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7734-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), it is possible that protein domains flanking the RRMs of AUF1 are involved in AUF1 self-association. To address this question, the hydrodynamic properties of wild-type and mutant His6-AUF1 proteins were examined to determine their native molecular mass in solution. Gel filtration analysis of His6-AUF1-(1–286) was used to determine the Stokes radius of the native protein. Four protein standards were used to calibrate the Sephacryl S-300 column (Fig. 3,upper panel). His6-AUF1-(1–286) at a concentration of 6 μm was loaded onto the column, and fractions were collected. The amount of His6-AUF1-(1–286) present in each fraction was determined spectrophotometrically, and relative amounts were plotted versus fraction number (Fig.3, upper panel). Analysis of the gel filtration data by the method and equations of Ackers (19Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) yielded a Stokes radius of 3.6 nm (Table I). Gel filtration using 500 nm His6-AUF1-(1–286) produced a protein elution profile identical to that shown in Fig. 3 (data not shown), demonstrating that the protein did not form detectable aggregates at the higher (6 μm) concentration. In addition, both purified cellular AUF1 and recombinant AUF1 (without a His6tag) synthesized by translation in vitro displayed the same elution profile as that in Fig. 3 (data not shown). This control demonstrates that the gel filtration profile shown in Fig. 3 is not unique to the bacterially expressed protein.Table IPhysical properties of wild-type and mutant His6-AUF1 proteinsHis6-AUF1AUF1-(1–286) (wild type)AUF1-(1–194)AUF1-(29–194)AUF1-(92–286)Stokes radius, R s (nm)3.63.53.62.6Sedimentation coefficient, s4.6 S3.9 S1.4 S2.6 SMonomer mass (Da)35,92225,11022,36026,614Native mass (Da)68,29456,29421,45028,717Frictional ratio,f/f 01.31.42.01.3The His6-AUF1 proteins analyzed are listed across the top, with numbers in parentheses corresponding to the amino acids of AUF1 contained in the polypeptide.

Analysis of these data yielded Stokes radii of 3.5 and 2.6 nm for His6-AUF1-(1–194) and His6-AUF1-(92–286), respectively (Table I). The larger Stokes radii of His6-AUF1-(1–286) and His6-AUF1-(1–194) suggested that either each of these proteins contains more than one polypeptide or that each is a highly anisotropic monomer. To distinguish between these two possibilities, velocity sedimentation analyses were performed to determine sedimentation coefficients, which were then used in combination with the Stokes radii to calculate molecular mass values that are not dependent upon the shape of the molecule (14Barnett S.F.

https://openalex.org/W2106012226,"Wortmannin is a natural product that inhibits signal transduction. One target of wortmannin in mammalian cells is the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We show that wortmannin is toxic to the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae and present genetic and biochemical evidence that a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase), STT4, is a target of wortmannin in yeast. In a strain background in which stt4 mutants are rescued by osmotic support with sorbitol, the toxic effects of wortmannin are similarly prevented by sorbitol. In contrast, in a different strain background, STT4 is essential under all conditions and wortmannin toxicity is not mitigated by sorbitol. Overexpression of STT4 confers wortmannin resistance, but overexpression of PIK1, a related PI 4-kinase, does not. In vitro, the PI 4-kinase activity of STT4, but not of PIK1, was potently inhibited by wortmannin. Overexpression of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase homolog MSS4 conferred wortmannin resistance, as did deletion of phospholipase C-1. These observations support a model for a phosphatidylinositol metabolic cascade involving STT4, MSS4, and phospholipase C-1 and provide evidence that an essential product of this pathway is the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

Small cell-permeable compounds have proven valuable tools to study signal transduction. For example, studies on the mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive antifungal natural products cyclosporin A and FK506 led to the identification of the protein phosphatase calcineurin as a critical calcium sensor during T-cell activation and physiological responses in yeast cells. Related studies of another natural product, the immunosuppressant rapamycin, revealed a role for the TOR kinase homologs in regulating cell proliferation in both yeast and mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar and 2Cardenas M.E. Lorenz M. Hemenway C. Heitman J. Perspect. Drug Discovery Design. 1994; 2: 103-126Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a hydrophobic steroid-related natural product of the fungus Talaromyces wortmannii (reviewed in Ref. 3Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Wortmannin is an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits signal transduction events in a variety of cell types. For example, wortmannin inhibits neutrophil and platelet activation by a variety of ligands, such as leukotriene B4, platelet-activating factor, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, and thromboxane, which act via G-protein-coupled receptors (4Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, wortmannin also blocks insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in adipocytes (6Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, wortmannin can block signal transduction events emanating from either G-protein-coupled or tyrosine kinase receptors, which signal through distinct pathways. Wortmannin does not affect immediate signal transduction events in these pathways, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PI3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PLC, phospholipase C; HA, hemagglutinin; GAL, galactose. 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PI3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PLC, phospholipase C; HA, hemagglutinin; GAL, galactose. or Ca2+ mobilization. That stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester overcomes the inhibitory effects of wortmannin (7Ferby I.M. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30485-30488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggests that wortmannin acts upstream of protein kinase C, possibly at a point at which G-protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways converge. Several observations suggested that a relevant in vivotarget of wortmannin might be an enzyme, namely the lipid kinase that phosphorylates the 3-position of phosphatidylinositol: PI 3-kinase. First, wortmannin blocks antigen-dependent stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity in rat basophils (4Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, wortmannin markedly inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate production in neutrophils stimulated with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, consistent with a block in phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) by PI 3-kinase (5Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the ability of insulin to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in adipocytes is inhibited by wortmannin (6Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit that interacts with other signal transduction elements via SH2 domains (9Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The activity of purified PI 3-kinase is potently inhibited in vivo and in vitro by wortmannin (4Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O.

Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Finally, using anti-wortmannin antibodies and protease digestion, it has been shown that wortmannin forms a covalent complex with an active site residue of the 110-kDa PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit, lysine 802 (4Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G.

Although wortmannin potently inhibits the PI 3-lipid kinase with an IC50 of 5 nm, other potential targets exist. For example, wortmannin inhibits a protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase, with an IC50 of ∼20 nm (12Nakanishi S. Kakita S. Takahashi I. Kawahara K. Tsukuda E. Sano T. Yamada K. Yoshida M. Kase H. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2157-2163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, wortmannin also inhibits DNA-dependent protein kinase, a member of the PI 3/4-kinase superfamily, with an IC50 of 200 nm (13Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Demethoxyviridin, a structural analog of wortmannin, inhibits a membrane associated PI 4-kinase from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe(IC50 = 100 nm) (14Woscholski R. Kodaki T. McKinnon M. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whose identity has not been established. Recently a wortmannin-sensitive, membrane-associated PI 4-kinase, shown previously to maintain hormone-regulated PI4P pools in mammalian cells (15Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), was cloned from a human cDNA library (18Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, wortmannin inhibits several protein and lipid kinases. Previous studies of antifungal natural products reveal that both the mechanisms of action as well as drug targets are often highly conserved from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes. We report here our studies on the mechanism of action and targets of wortmannin in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that a target of wortmannin in yeast is the PI 4-kinase STT4 (19Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions that rescue cells lacking STT4 also overcome wortmannin toxicity, overexpression of STT4 renders cells wortmannin-resistant, and the PI 4-kinase activity of STT4 is inhibited by wortmannin in vitro. The second yeast PI 4-kinase, PIK1 (20Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), does not appear to be a target of wortmannin in vivo, and the PI 4-kinase activity of PIK1 is not sensitive to wortmannin in vitro. STT4 is tightly associated with a membrane-pellet fraction. In addition, we report that STT4 is essential in some yeast strains. Because wortmannin inhibition causes a nonspecific cell cycle arrest, STT4 function may be required throughout the cell cycle. Mammalian homologs of both yeast STT4 and PIK1 have been recently cloned (15Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, the mammalian PIK1 homolog, and not the mammalian STT4 homolog, is wortmannin-sensitivein vitro. We also find that overexpression of the yeast PI4P 5-kinase homolog MSS4 or deletion of the yeast gene encoding phospholipase C (PLC1) confer wortmannin resistance, supporting a model in which the inhibitory effects of wortmannin may be due to depletion of an essential PI4,5P2 pool. Our studies underscore the utility of yeast as a model system to identify drug targets, suggest caution in the use of wortmannin as a specific inhibitor of mammalian PI 3-kinase, reveal that diverse members of the lipid/protein kinase superfamily are wortmannin-sensitive, and provide evidence for a phosphatidylinositol metabolic cascade in yeast involving sequential action of STT4, MSS4, and PLC1 in which PI4,5P2 is an essential lipid product.

Strain SEY6210 (MATa leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9) and an isogenic vps34mutant strain PHY102 were from Scott Emr (24Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The STT4 gene was disrupted in the JK9–3da/α diploid strain (ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 his4 trp1 rme1 HMLa) by integrative disruption with the Δstt4::G418 allele obtained by PCR amplification of the G418 resistance gene with primers 5′-AAGGCAGATGAGATTTACCAGAGGATTGAAAGCCTCTTCATCTTTCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC and 5′-GTACGGAATGCCATTTGTGAGCCTTTGGAATTCATCATAACCTTTGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG with the plasmid pFA6-kanMX2 as template (47Wach A.

Similarly, thePLC1 gene was disrupted in the JK9–3da/α diploid strain by integrative disruption with the Δplc1::G418allele obtained by PCR amplification of the G418 resistance gene with primers 5′-AAACGTACAACGGTAAGGTCATTCACGCAGTGTATATGCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC and 5′-CGTATTTATGAATATGTGTATTTGGCCGGAAAAAGATCGCCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG to yield the PLC1/Δplc1::G418 strain SMY31–1. Plasmid-containing Δplc1::G418 andPLC1 haploid strains were obtained by transforming SMY31–1 with the plasmid, sporulating and dissecting. Yeast media were prepared as described (25Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Wortmannin (Sigma) was added to the media from concentrated stocks prepared in Me2SO. DNA manipulations were carried out as outlined in Ref. 26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate/heat shock method (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The following plasmids were used. 1) pYeF1 and pYeF2 (28Cullin C. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Yeast. 1994; 10: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) are 7.1-kilobase pair 2-μm plasmids carrying the URA3 gene and the GAL promoter and were used to epitope-tag STT4 and PIK1. 2) pGALHA-STT4–8 (HA-STT4) was created by ligating the STT4gene into the NotI site of pYeF1 in frame with the HA epitope tag at the 5′ end of the gene, placing the fusion gene under the control of the GAL promoter. The STT4 gene was amplified by PCR from a plasmid copy of STT4using primers 5′-TTAAGCGGCCGCATGAGATTTACCAGAGGAGATTG and 5′-TATAGCGGCCGCGTCAGTACGGAATGCCATTTGAGCC. 3) pNSC8 (PIK1-HA) was constructed by ligating the PIK1 gene into pYeF2 with the 5′ BamHI site and the 3′ NotI site, in frame with the HA epitope tag at the 3′ end of the gene, placing the fusion gene under the control of the GALpromoter. The PIK1 gene was amplified by PCR from a plasmid copy of PIK1 using primers 5′-TTTTTCGGATCCATGCATAAAGCATCCAGTTCAAAG and 5′-ATTTGGTAGCGGCCGCTATATATACCCTGTGTAATAAG. 4) pNSC19 (2μ FAB1) was constructed by digesting theFAB1 gene, along with approximately 2 kilobase pairs of 5′-untranslated region, from the plasmid pAY60 (29Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) usingXhoI and NotI and ligated into the polylinker of the plasmid pRS426 (URA3, 2μ) digested with the same enzymes. 5) pMSS4–12 (2μ MSS4) consists of the MSS4gene on YEp352 (2μ, URA3) (30Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 6) pEP1 (2μ PLC1) consists of a triple HA epitope cloned into the 5′ end of PLC1 cloned into YEp351 (2μ,LEU2) (31Payne W.E. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4351-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For PIK1 assays, cells transformed with plasmid pGALPIK1-HA were inoculated in synthetic media lacking uracil supplemented with 2% raffinose, grown to OD600 = 0.5–0.8, and expression of PIK1-HA induced with 2% galactose for 2 h. As a control for protein expression and antibody specificity, parallel cultures were grown as above and supplemented with 2% glucose instead of galactose. For STT4 assays, the isogenic wild-type STT4strain YS3–6D and the Δstt4–16C strain were grown in YPD media. Preparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitations, lipid kinase reactions, and TLC analysis were performed as described previously (32Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5892-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in equal amounts (by protein) of cell lysate in a total volume of 1 ml with 3 μl of anti-HA mouse monoclonal 12 CAS (Babco) antibody. Where indicated, the immunoprecipitates were preincubated with the appropriate concentration of wortmannin for 10 min at 4 °C, and the reactions were started by addition of 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP and 10 μm MgCl2. All reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with occasional gentle agitation; under these conditions, the reactions were linear for up to 30 min. Strain JK9–3da transformed with pGAL-HASTT4 was grown in S-raffinose minus uracil media to OD600 = 0.5–0.8, after which 2% galactose was added and incubated for 1 h. Cell-free lysates and P100 and S100 fractions were prepared as described (32Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5892-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell fractions were analyzed by Western blot with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (see above), followed by ECL detection (Amersham). Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that potently inhibits mammalian PI 3-kinase (33Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). We sought to identify wortmannin targets in yeast. Wortmannin inhibited the growth of yeast on synthetic minimal medium with a minimum inhibitory concentration of ∼10 μg/ml (Fig.1 A). Wortmannin treatment did not cause cell lysis or a specific cell cycle arrest (data not shown). In addition, wortmannin was not toxic to yeast cells grown on rich YPD media, possibly due to nonspecific drug binding by yeast extract components as has been observed with other toxins. Consistent with this interpretation, addition of yeast extract to synthetic media prevented wortmannin toxicity (data not shown). Wortmannin can inhibit the yeast PI 3-kinase VPS34p in vitro (24Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at concentrations higher (IC50 = 3 μm) than those that inhibit mammalian PI 3-kinase (IC50 ∼ 5 nm) (33Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). However, yeast cells lacking VPS34 are both viable and remain wortmannin-sensitive, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of ∼1 μg/ml (Fig. 1 A). Thus, VPS34 is not the only target of wortmannin in yeast. The ∼10-fold increased sensitivity of Δvps34 mutant cells to wortmannin compared with the isogenic VPS34 parent strain could result from an increase in the free drug concentration due to the loss of one drug binding target. Alternatively, this effect may be nonspecific becauseΔvps34 mutant cells have perturbed vacuolar function, grow slowly, and are temperature-sensitive, and thus might be inherently more drug-sensitive. The latter explanation is supported by the finding that end1 and vps3 mutations, which also result in vacuolar defects and temperature-sensitive slow growth, are similarly wortmannin-hypersensitive (data not shown). Because yeast cells lacking VPS34 have no detectable PI 3-kinase activity or PI3P, yet retain sensitivity to wortmannin, this drug must inhibit an additional target other than PI 3-kinase in yeast. Recent studies demonstrate that wortmannin or its analog demethoxyviridin also inhibit PI 4-kinases from mammals and fission yeast (14Woscholski R. Kodaki T. McKinnon M. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two PI 4-kinases, PIK1 and STT4, have been identified in S. cerevisiae (19Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Flanagan C.A.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We tested whether the PIK1 or STT4 PI 4-kinases are targets for wortmannin in yeast. PIK1 is an essential enzyme (21Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Garcia-Bustos J.F. Marini F. Stevenson I. Frei C. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A yeast strain expressing a temperature-sensitive PIK1 mutant (pik1-ts) was inhibited by wortmannin at permissive and semi-permissive temperatures with the same minimum inhibitory concentration as the isogenic wild-typePIK1 strain (Fig. 1 A). These findings suggest that PIK1 is not a target of wortmannin. STT4 is also essential for growth on standard yeast growth media, but the inviability of Δstt4 mutant cells can be remediated on rich media, such as YPD, by 1 m sorbitol (19Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and more poorly on a synthetic medium with 1 m sorbitol (Fig.1 B, lower left quadrant). To test if wortmannin inhibits STT4 in vivo, we asked whether 1 msorbitol would rescue cells from wortmannin toxicity. Remarkably, in synthetic complete media, 1 m sorbitol rescued cells from the toxic effects of 10 μg/ml wortmannin (Fig. 1 B). Thus, conditions that allow growth of cells lacking STT4 (Δstt4) also allow growth in the presence of wortmannin. In several other yeast strain backgrounds, we and others 2S. Emr, D. Levin, and D. Voelker, personal communications. have found thatΔstt4 mutant cells are inviable and are not rescued by 1m sorbitol (Fig.2 A and data not shown). Thus, in these other strain backgrounds, STT4 is essential under all conditions. Correspondingly, in strain backgrounds where STT4 is essential, 1 m sorbitol failed to rescue cells from wortmannin toxicity (Fig. 1 B). In summary, in synthetic media lacking sorbitol, STT4 is essential and wortmannin is toxic in all strains. In one unusual strain, both the lethality of anΔstt4 mutation and wortmannin toxicity can be overcome by osmotic support with 1 m sorbitol. These findings provide genetic evidence that the PI 4-kinase STT4 is a target of wortmanninin vivo. STT4 is probably not the only wortmannin-sensitive target in yeast, because sorbitol did not rescue cells lacking STT4 from wortmannin toxicity (Fig. 1 B, lower left quadrants). To explore genetic differences between strain backgrounds with respect to the essential function of STT4 a nonisogenic cross was performed between the Δstt4 viable mutant and our wild-type laboratory strain (in the presence of sorbitol). Sporulation and dissection of 24 tetrads revealed 1 tetrad with two wild-typeSTT4 and two slow growth, sorbitol-dependentΔstt4 segregants (parental ditype), 5 tetrads consisting of two wild-type STT4, one slow growth sorbitol-dependent Δstt4 mutant, and one inviable segregant (tetratype), and 18 tetrads consisting of two wild-type STT4 spores and two inviable spores (nonparental ditype). These results are consistent with a minimum of three unlinked extragenic suppressors required for sorbitol rescue of theΔstt4 mutation. As mentioned above, STT4 is essential in our yeast laboratory strain background, and thus an STT4/Δstt4heterozygous diploid sporulates to yield tetrads containing two viable (STT4) and two inviable (Δstt4) segregants (Fig. 2 A). An HA epitope-tagged version of theSTT4 gene was cloned under the transcriptional control of the GAL promoter (pGALHA-STT4). Expression of STT4 complemented theΔstt4 mutation and restored growth even when cells were grown in glucose, which reduces expression from the GAL promoter (Fig.2 B). Rescue of the stt4::G418 mutant cells required the STT4 expression plasmid, as these cells were inviable on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium, which is toxic to cells containing the plasmid-borne URA3 marker. Interestingly, growth in glucose provided a level of STT4 expression that also conferred resistance to 10 μg/ml wortmannin (Fig.3). Overexpression of STT4 from the GAL promoter markedly inhibited growth, and thus we could not assess wortmannin toxicity under these conditions (data not shown). That STT4 overexpression is toxic suggests the activity of this enzyme may normally be regulated in vivo. Expression from the GAL promoter of an epitope-tagged form of the PIK1 PI 4-kinase, PIK1, complemented a pik1-ts mutation but did not confer wortmannin resistance and was not toxic when cells were grown with either glucose or galactose (Fig. 3 and data not shown). These findings implicate the STT4 PI 4-kinase as a specific target of wortmannin in yeast. To further assess the wortmannin sensitivity of STT4 and PIK1 in vitro, these enzymes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-STT4 polyclonal antiserum or with an HA epitope-tagged version of PIK1 and an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with PI and [γ-32P]ATP, and PI4P production was detected by borate thin layer chromatography and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation from cells expressing STT4 yielded detectable PI 4-kinase activity (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), whereas cells lacking STT4 (Δstt4) yielded no PI 4-kinase activity (Fig. 4 B, lane 4), establishing the specificity of the antisera for STT4. The PI 4-kinase activity of STT4 was inhibited ∼80% and ∼95% by 1 and 10 nm wortmannin, respectively (Fig. 4, B–D). In comparison, galactose induction of PIK1-HA led to a marked overexpression of PIK1 as detected by Western blot (Fig. 4 A) and to a corresponding increase in HA-precipitable PI 4-kinase activity (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 5 and 7); however, the PI 4-kinase activity of PIK1-HA was completely resistant to wortmannin at a concentration of 1, 10, or 20 μm (Fig. 4 A, lane 6, and data not shown). This is in accord with previous observations that the PI 4-kinase activity of PIK1 purified to homogeneity is not sensitive to wortmannin at high concentrations. 3J. Thorner, personal communication. These findings provide biochemical evidence that the PI 4-kinase activity of STT4 is inhibited by wortmannin, and confirm our genetic evidence that STT4 is a target of wortmannin in yeast. To further characterize STT4, cells expressing HA-STT4 were fractionated into soluble (S100) and insoluble (P100) fractions and the amount of STT4 in these fractions was determined by Western blot. STT4 was exclusively detected in the particulate (P100) fraction (Fig.5). Similar fractionation results were obtained with endogenous STT4 detected with an anti-STT4 polyclonal antisera (data not shown). The strength and nature of the STT4 association to the P100 fraction was tested by treating the cell lysate previous to centrifugation with agents known to disrupt membrane-protein or protein-protein interactions. STT4 was solubilized by 1% SDS; however, treatment with 2% Triton X-100 or with agents that interfere with protein-protein interactions, such as 0.5m NaCl and 1.6 m urea, failed to extract STT4 from the particulate fraction (Fig. 5). These results indicate that STT4 is tightly associated with the pellet fraction, possibly via assoc"

Recently, eight L-type amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 of the calcium channel α1subunit were identified to substantially contribute to 1,4-dihydropyridine sensitivity. To determine whether these eight L-type residues (Thr1066, Gln1070, Ile1180, Ile1183, Tyr1490, Met1491, Ile1497, and Ile1498; α1C-a numbering) are sufficient to form a high affinity 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site in a non-L-type calcium channel, we transferred them to the 1,4-dihydropyridine-insensitive α1A subunit using site-directed mutagenesis. 1,4-Dihydropyridine agonist and antagonist modulation of barium inward currents mediated by the mutant α1A subunits, coexpressed with α2δ and β1a subunits inXenopus laevis oocytes, was investigated with the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. The resulting mutant α1A-DHPi displayed low sensitivity for 1,4-dihydropyridines. Analysis of the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding region of an ancestral L-type α1 subunit previously cloned from Musca domestica body wall muscle led to the identification of Met1188 (α1C-a numbering) as an additional critical constituent of the L-type 1,4-dihydropyridine binding domain. The introduction of this residue into α1A-DHPi restored full sensitivity for 1,4-dihydropyridines. It also transferred functional properties considered hallmarks of 1,4-dihydropyridine agonist and antagonist effects (i.e. stereoselectivity, voltage dependence of drug modulation, and agonist-induced shift in the voltage-dependence of activation). Our gain-of-function mutants provide an excellent model for future studies of the structure-activity relationship of 1,4-dihydropyridines to obtain critical structural information for the development of drugs for neuronal, non-L-type calcium channels.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels are activated by membrane depolarization and mediate the rapid and selective entry of calcium into excitable cells. The subsequent rise in intracellular calcium triggers a variety of cellular responses, including excitation-contraction coupling, excitation-secretion coupling, synaptic plasticity, and the modulation of transcription events (for a review, see Refs. 1Catterall W.A.

On the basis of electrophysiological and pharmacological criteria, voltage-dependent calcium channels are classified into L-, N-, T-, P/Q-, and R-type channels (reviewed in Refs. 3Birnbaumer L.

They are distinguished from the other types by their high sensitivity to 1,4-dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines (8Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Trends Pharmacol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), whereas DHP agonists promote the open state (11Hess P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 337-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of channel modulation mediated by these drugs has yet to be completely elucidated. The DHP binding domain is located on the α1 subunit (12Striessnig J. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10769-10773Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is tightly coupled to a high affinity calcium binding site (13Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) representing the ion selectivity filter (14Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.-F. Tsien R.W.

One essential requirement to fully understand the molecular mechanism of channel modulation is the identification of amino acid residues that mediate DHP agonist and antagonist effects. Photoaffinity labeling, combined with antibody mapping (12Striessnig J. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) identified parts of the high affinity DHP binding domain. Using a gain-of-function approach, we have shown that introducing only as little as 9.4% L-type sequence (including transmembrane segments IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6) is sufficient to transfer DHP sensitivity to the DHP-insensitive class A (BI-2) calcium channel α1 subunit (18Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we demonstrated that two amino acid residues of segment IIIS5 are critical for the DHP interaction (19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30330-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 of the α1 subunit, six other L-type amino acid residues were identified to be required for DHP binding by creating chimeras and mutants that were monitored for a reduction or loss of DHP sensitivity (20Peterson B.Z.

Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we used a gain-of-function approach to investigate whether these eight L-type residues, when removed from their natural sequence environment, are able to form a functional DHP interaction domain. The DHP-insensitive α1A subunit was chosen as the acceptor molecule (22Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K.

We discovered that an additional methionine residue in transmembrane segment IIIS6 of the L-type calcium channel is also required for DHP sensitivity. Together, these nine L-type amino acid residues of the resulting motif allow for the construction of a fully functional agonist- and antagonist-sensitive DHP binding pocket in α1A subunits.

The intermediate clone was subsequently cut with ClaI* (nucleotide 4925A) and XbaI (3′ of the polyadenylating signal in pNKS2), and this cassette was replaced by the respective fragment of AL20/YMII containing segment IVS6. For α1A-DHP, mutation V1512M was introduced into α1A-DHPi by using the SalI*-ClaI* cassette of A (nucleotides 4744–4925). Chimeras and mutants were inserted into the polyadenylating transcription plasmid pNKS2 (provided by O.

Barium inward currents (I Ba) through voltage-gated calcium channels were measured between 2 and 5 days after injection of cRNA using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (Turbo Tec 01C, NPI-Electronic, Germany). Voltage-recording microelectrodes and current-injecting electrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and had resistances of 1–2 megaohms. All experiments were carried out at room temperature using barium as the charge carrier in a solution composed of 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 40 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). The recording chamber (volume, 150 μl) was continuously perfused with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Drug-containing solutions were applied with the same flow rate. Stock solutions (10 mm) of drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C in the dark. Experiments were carried out in sodium light, and stock solutions were freshly diluted in bath solution. Modulation of peak I Ba was measured from a holding potential of −80 mV in the absence (control) and presence of drug-containing solutions at equilibrium (half-time for the development of the stimulatory effect by 10 μm (±)-BayK 8644 was 12 ± 3 min, n = 5, for α1A-DHP). Test potentials corresponded to the peak potential of the current-voltage relations for measurements ofI Ba block by antagonists, and 10 mV hyperpolarized to the peak potential of the current-voltage relations for measurements of agonist modulation. To obtain the voltage of half-maximal I Ba activation (V 0.5act) current-voltage relation curves were fitted to the function I Ba =G max × (V −V rev)/(1 + exp((V −V 0.5act)/k act), whereG max is the maximal conductance, V is the test potential, V rev is the reversal potential, and k act is the slope factor of the activation curve. I Ba inhibition (antagonist effects), given as percentage of inhibition, was calculated as (1 − peak I Ba (drug)/peakI Ba (control)) × 100%, and current amplification (agonist effects) was calculated as peakI Ba (drug)/peak I Ba(control) and given as -fold stimulation. DHP effects were indistinguishable at pulse frequencies between 0.017 Hz and 0.1 Hz. Therefore, unless stated otherwise, a standard pulse frequency of 0.017 Hz and 0.034 Hz was used to assess agonist and antagonist modulation, respectively. The pClamp software package (version 5.51; Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 0.2 kHz, and stored on a computer hard disk. Benzoxadiazol-DHPs were from Sandoz AG (Basel, Switzerland), (±)-BayK 8644 was from Bayer AG (Wuppertal, Germany), and FPL 64176 was from Fisons Pharmaceuticals (Leicestershire, UK). Data are given as the mean ± S.E. from the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was calculated using the unpaired t test. IC50values for the concentration-response relationships were determined by fitting the experimental data to the general dose-response equation (30DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 4: E97-E102Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we transferred the L-type residues Thr1066, Gln1070, Ile1180, Ile1183, Tyr1490, Met1491, Ile1497, and Ile1498 (numbering according to α1C-a) to the α1A subunit by replacing the corresponding non-L-type residues. The resulting mutant α1A-DHPi (Fig.1 A) was coexpressed with auxiliary α2δ and β1a subunits inXenopus oocytes to test if these residues can form an L-type DHP binding domain within the background of α1A sequence. α1A-DHPi gave rise to barium inward currents with a threshold of activation between −35 and −25 mV (Fig. 1 B). The midpoint voltage of current activation was −8.6 ± 1.0 mV (n = 13), and maximal I Baamplitudes were reached at test potentials between 0 and 10 mV.I Ba modulation by the standard DHP probes (±)-BayK 8644 (agonist) and (±)-isradipine (antagonist) was considerably reduced when compared with recombinant L-type calcium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (18Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PeakI Ba of α1A-DHPi, measured at peak potentials of the current-voltage relations, was blocked by (±)-isradipine (Fig. 1 B, upper panel) with a low apparent potency, yielding an IC50 of ∼10 μm (Fig. 4 B). The stimulation of peakI Ba by 10 μm (±)-BayK 8644 was only 1.6 ± 0.1-fold (n = 7, Fig. 4 A) at test potentials 10 mV negative to the peak of the current-voltage relations (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Most features of BayK 8644 modulation were not detectable, such as the agonist-induced slowing of macroscopicI Ba-activation at threshold potentials (not shown) as well as a slowing of channel deactivation (Fig.1 B, lower panel). 10 μm (±)-BayK 8644 failed to significantly (p > 0.01) shift the midpoint voltage of I Ba activation (V 0.5act = −7.2 ± 0.7 mV,n = 3) but clearly elicited a change of macroscopicI Ba inactivation (Fig. 1 B,lower panel).Figure 4Met1188 increases the sensitivity to agonist and antagonist modulation.

B, concentration-response relationship of (±)-isradipine inhibition of peak I Ba mediated by α1A-DHPi (triangles) and α1A-DHP (circles). Data from at least three recordings are depicted as mean ± S.E.; IC50values (α1A-DHPi, IC50 ≈ 10 μm; α1A-DHP, IC50 = 67 nm, n H = 0.54) were obtained by a fit (solid line) to the general dose-response equation (30DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 4: E97-E102Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The DHP antagonist effect on α1A-DHPi was stereospecific as expected for L-type channels. At identical concentrations (10 μm) the plus enantiomer of isradipine was more potent than its minus counterpart (Fig. 1 C). This finding suggested a specific interaction of isradipine with α1A-DHPi, albeit at a reduced sensitivity. Taken together, these data indicated that DHP sensitivity of α1A-DHPi is reduced when compared with recombinant L-type calcium channel α1 subunits coexpressed with α2δ and β1a subunits inXenopus oocytes (18Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S.

Thus, one or more other L-type amino acid residues are required for certain DHP actions and high DHP sensitivity. Recently, we have cloned the ancestral L-type α1M subunit from housefly (M. domestica) body wall muscle (24Grabner M. Bachmann A. Rosenthal F. Striessnig J. Schulz C. Tautz D. Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar to L-type α1 subunits derived from vertebrate skeletal muscle (6Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V.

Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to investigate the DHP sensitivity of α1M by means of a chimeric calcium channel α1 subunit, termed AL12m (Fig.2 A), that was constructed in analogy to the DHP agonist- and antagonist-sensitive chimeras AL12h and AL12s (18Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, theI Ba-modulation of AL12m differed from AL12h and AL12s. I Ba of AL12m was clearly blocked by (±)-isradipine, but stimulation by (±)-BayK 8644 could not be detected. We exploited this absence of agonist sensitivity to identify additional amino acid residues that are involved in the DHP interaction. Sequence alignments of transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 from cardiac and skeletal muscle L-type α1 subunits with α1Mrevealed three amino acid divergences (Fig. 2 C) in α1M, located within previously described core regions of the DHP interaction domain (20Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For the Musca channel, two Met to Val exchanges were identified, one each in IIIS6 and IVS6, and an Ala to Ser conversion was also found in IVS6. Interestingly, each of these residues (Met1188, Met1491, and Ala1494; α1C-a numbering) is highly conserved among vertebrate L-type channel α1 subunits and possesses a highly conserved counterpart (Val1512, Phe1805, and Ser1808, respectively; α1A numbering) in non-L-type α1 subunits. We therefore converted single amino acid residues in AL12m to vertebrate L-type sequence and tested the DHP sensitivity of the resulting chimeras AL12m/V1048M, AL12m/V1352M, and AL12m/S1355A (numbering according to α1M; Ref. 24Grabner M. Bachmann A. Rosenthal F. Striessnig J. Schulz C. Tautz D. Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both Val to Met conversions (but not the Ser to Ala substitution) resulted in an increased agonist sensitivity (Fig. 2 E). In contrast to AL12m-mediated currents, 10 μm (±)-BayK 8644 stimulated the I Ba peak amplitudes of AL12m/V1048M and AL12m/V1352M 1.6 ± 0.1-fold (n = 4), and 1.4 ± 0.1-fold (n = 4), respectively. Although BayK 8644-mediated agonist modulation of these AL12m mutants did not reach the extent observed for recombinant L-type channels or the chimeras AL12s and AL12h (18Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), each of the methionine residues played an important role for agonist sensitivity. It remains to be investigated whether simultaneous conversion of both residues could elicit full BayK 8644 sensitivity. The inhibition of peak I Ba by 10 μm (±)-isradipine was 70 ± 6% (n = 5), 69 ± 7% (n = 4), 80 ± 3% (n = 3), and 64 ± 6% (n = 4) for AL12m, AL12m/V1048M, AL12m/V1352M, and AL12m/S1355A, respectively (Fig. 2 D), and therefore comparable (p < 0.01) for AL12m and the single mutants derived thereof. These findings suggested that these two methionine residues play a prominent role in agonist modulation, at least within a sequence environment that presumably contains additional, low affinity interaction sites for DHP antagonists in the S5-S6 linker of domain IV, similar to the α1S/α1A-chimeras AL10 and AL13 (18Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The substantial contribution of Met1491 (AL12m/V1352M) in transmembrane segment IVS6 to agonist sensitivity is in agreement with previously published studies (20Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N.

Interestingly, phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains found in Shc and IRS-1 adopt a PH domain structure, suggesting that PTB domains are a class of PH domains that bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in NPXY motifs (12Eck M.J.

Thus, each class of PH domains may engage specific ligands that are required for efficient assembly of relevant membrane-associated complexes. The activated insulin receptor kinase phosphorylates IRS proteins at multiple tyrosine residues that bind Src homology-2 domains in various signaling proteins (SH2 proteins).

To determine if the PH domain of IRS-1 is specifically required for coupling to the activated insulin receptor, it was replaced by a PH domain from several related or unrelated proteins (Fig.1). Chimeric IRS-1 proteins reveal that heterologous PH domains (βark, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), or spectrin) weakly couple IRS-1 and the insulin receptor, whereas the homologous domains (IRS-2, Gab-1) participate with the PTB domain to mediate the interaction of chimeric IRS-1 with the activated insulin receptor. These results are consistent with a conserved and specific adapter function for PH domains in the IRS protein family. cDNAs for the PH domains of rat PLCγ (Asp863-Thr972), human β-spectrin (Pro1061-Lys1274), and bovine βark (Pro469-Gly688) were graciously provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, Duke University (10Touhara K.

Lysates were prepared from unstimulated or insulin-stimulated COS-7 cells expressing IRS-1 or various chimeric IRS-1 proteins. After immunoprecipitation with αIRS-1CT,in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol was performed on immune complexes as described, separated by thin layer chromatography, and identified by autoradiography (19Yenush L.

For preparation of the NPEY affinity matrix, a polymerase chain reaction fragment encoding four tandem NPEY repeats (derived from amino acids 944–983 of the insulin receptor) was cloned into pGEX-2T and expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. After coupling of the expressed NPEY-containing protein to glutathione-Sepharose, this motif was phosphorylated with the activated insulin receptor as described previously (14Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of NPEY-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads (approximately 25 μg of NPEY fusion protein) was incubated with wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptor in 50 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm ATP, and 4 mmMnCl2. The kinase reaction proceeded at 22 °C and was terminated 1 h later by washing the Sepharose beads three times with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.4. As a control for these binding experiments, a nonphosphorylated NPEY peptide column was generated as described above except that no insulin receptor was included in the preparation. Lysates from cells overexpressing wild type or chimeric IRS proteins were prepared by three freeze/thaw cycles in 0.15 m sucrose containing 50 mm Hepes, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μmvanadate. Cleared lysate from 5 × 106 cells in 200 μl was added to 20 μl of packed NPEY peptide beads and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. After a brief wash with 100 μl of lysis buffer, proteins bound to immobilized NPEY peptides were eluted by an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by immunoblotting with α-IRS1CT. The capacity of chimeric IRS-1 proteins to serve as substrates of the insulin receptor was tested in stably transfected 32D myeloid progenitor cells. 32D cells are ideal for studying mutant IRS proteins because they contain few insulin receptors (approximately 500/cell) and no detectable endogenous IRS-1 or IRS-2 (13Sun X.J.

Cell lines expressing equivalent levels of wild type IRS-1 or chimeric IRS-1 proteins were selected by immunoblotting with α-IRS1CT (Fig.2 A). The chimeric IRS-1 proteins migrated at the appropriate molecular mass during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that they were correctly expressed. Insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type IRS-1, but without the PH domain tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, removal of the PTB domain reduced the sensitivity to insulin of IRS1ΔPTBtyrosine phosphorylation, confirming that the PTB domain, unlike the PH domain, was not essential in 32D cells (19Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing a homologous PH domain from IRS-2 or Gab-1 restored insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig.2 A). In contrast, insulin did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing heterologous PH domains derived from βark, PLC, or spectrin (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, the homologous PH domains coupled the chimeric IRS-1 proteins to the activated insulin receptor, whereas the heterologous PH domains did not. As revealed by prior studies, overexpression of the human insulin receptor in 32D cells (32DIR) restored tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1ΔPH and IRS1ΔPTB to normal levels (Fig. 2 B) (19Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As expected, chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing a homologous PH domain from IRS-2 or Gab-1 were tyrosine phosphorylated comparably to wild type IRS-1 in 32DIR cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, chimeric IRS-1 proteins with a PH domain from βark or spectrin were insensitive to insulin and poorly tyrosine phosphorylated; the PLCγ PH domain mediated more sensitivity to insulin, but the level of phosphorylation was still far below normal (Fig. 2 B). Thus, heterologous PH domains did not substitute for the native IRS-1 PH domain, even at high insulin receptor levels (Fig. 2 B). Thus, efficient insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 specifically requires a PH domain derived from the IRS protein family. The inability of chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing the PH domains of βark, PLCγ, or spectrin to undergo insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in 32DIR was surprising and suggested that a heterologous PH domain interferes with the interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. Heterologous PH domains may incorrectly target the chimeric IRS-1 protein or disrupt the function of the adjacent PTB domain; the latter effect seems likely because the PTB domain alone is ordinarily sufficient to mediate phosphorylation of IRS1ΔPTB in 32D cells expressing the insulin receptor. To evaluate this possibility, the binding of chimeric IRS-1 proteins to immobilized, phosphorylated NPEY motifs was tested. Lysates from 32D cells expressing similar levels of wild type IRS-1 or IRS-1 chimera were incubated with Sepharose beads containing nonphosphorylated or tyrosine-phosphorylated NPEY peptide (Fig.3 A). Wild type IRS-1 bound to the phosphorylated NPEY peptide but not to the nonphosphorylated control (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected, deletion of the PTB domain completely abrogated interaction with the phosphorylated NPEY motifs, whereas removal of the IRS-1 PH domain had no effect on binding. Chimeric IRS-1 proteins containing the PH domain from Gab-1 or IRS-2 bound normally, whereas the PH domain from βark, PLCγ, or spectrin blocked the interaction between chimeric IRS-1 proteins and the phosphorylated NPEY peptide (Fig. 3). Thus, the presence of a heterologous PH domain in IRS-1 impaired binding of the PTB domain to the phosphorylated NPEY motif, providing at least one explanation for the inability of these chimeric proteins to undergo insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in 32IR cells. The capacity of chimeric IRS-1 proteins to engage p85 and activate PI-3 kinase was tested in COS-7 cells transiently expressing recombinant proteins. Consistent with the results of 32D cells, the heterologous PH domains of βark, PLCγ, or spectrin did not mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeric IRS-1 proteins nor their association with the PI-3 kinase (Fig. 4). The insulin-stimulated PI-3 kinase activity associated with chimeric IRS-1 proteins bearing the PH domains of Gab-1 or IRS-2 was comparable to that detected in immunoprecipitates of wild type IRS-1. Thus, homologous PH domains mediate IRS-1-specific signaling in at least two cell backgrounds. PH domains are diverse modules with a common structural fold which direct proteins to membranes or other cellular compartments. Our results suggest that the PH domains in IRS proteins are functionally similar and are required for coupling to the activated insulin receptor. Because the insulin receptor does not appear to bind these PH domains directly, our work supports the hypothesis that specific membrane elements or adapter proteins engage the PH domain to facilitate interaction between IRS proteins and the insulin receptor. Many isoforms of PH domains bind phospholipids, which may target proteins to membrane surfaces: the PH-domain of spectrin contains a site for membrane binding (4Macias M.J. Musacchio A. Ponstingl H. Nilges M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1994; 369: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); the PLCδ1 PH-domain binds both inositol trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (7Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar); the βark PH domain binds phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and Gβγ subunits (10Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). But these PH domains do not function in IRS-1, and they actually impair tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in 32DIR cells. Thus, the ability to bind these membrane components may not be the essential feature for coupling IRS proteins to the activated insulin receptor. We have demonstrated that disruption of PTB domain function is one explanation for the inability of heterologous PH domains to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of chimeric IRS-1 molecules. Recent results suggest that the PH and PTB domains in intact IRS proteins may function cooperatively to mediate coupling with the insulin receptor. The presence of a heterologous PH domain in IRS-1 may interfere with the proper folding of the adjacent PTB domain, thereby impairing recognition of the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the insulin receptor. However, in 32DIR cells a PTB domain is not required for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1, so disruption of its function cannot be the only explanation for this inhibition. Alternatively, the PTB domain may inhibit the function of the heterologous PH domains. These possibilities will be tested in the future when specific ligands are available for analysis. Heterologous PH domains may target the chimeric IRS-1 proteins incorrectly, decreasing their interaction with the activated insulin receptors. If PH domains are needed simply to bind phospholipids and tether proteins to membranes, then the PH domains of βark and PLCγ which both bind membrane lipids should function in IRS-1 (10Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Their failure to do so suggests that either phospholipid binding is not sufficient to mediate productive interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor or that heterologous PH domains bind certain phospholipids that are incompatible with coupling of IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. Recent studies of the PH domain provide additional support for the specificity of PH domain interactions; expression of chimeric pleckstrin variants containing either the βark or dynamin PH domain in COS cells failed to produce morphological characteristics associated with wild type pleckstrin (30Ma A.D. Brass L.F. Abrams C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, the PH domains of PLCγ and pleckstrin were ineffective at blocking dynamin-mediated rapid exocytosis, whereas the native dynamin PH domain produces a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells (31Artalejo C.R. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the PH domains of IRS-2 and Gab-1 were the only homologous structures tested in the present study, we conclude provisionally that similar domains from IRS-3 and p62dok will also function in chimeric IRS-1 proteins since they are insulin receptor substrates. However, alignment of the PH domains from the five known IRS proteins does not clearly reveal potentially critical elements required for IRS-1 function because few identical regions occur. The β3/β4-loop is positively charged in all of the IRS proteins but absent from the heterologous PH domains; this loop could contribute the specificity for engaging a negatively charged membrane element. The β1/β2-loop may also convey binding specificity, but this region of the PH domain is rather variable even among the IRS proteins. A lethal mutation in the PH domain of Btk occurs in the second β-strand, suggesting that this subdomain could be important for ligand binding (32Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M.

Further analysis of the common regions in IRS PH domains may reveal the structural requirements for ligand recognition and provide a means to identify relevant binding partners. The nature of the specific ligands for the PH domain in IRS proteins is unknown. Unlike the PTB domain, which binds directly to the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the juxtamembrane regions of the insulin receptor, the PH domain does not appear to interact directly with the insulin receptor; yeast two-hybrid screens and biochemical approaches repeatedly fail to demonstrate a direct interaction between the insulin receptor and this structural module of IRS-1 (22Gustafson T.A.

However, the specificity and sensitivity provided by the PH domain, especially in the absence of the PTB domain, strongly suggest that it binds to a ligand that is in close association with the insulin receptor. Perhaps the receptor coordinates a favorable phospholipid environment that binds to the PH domain. Alternatively, the insulin receptor may engage an adapter protein that recruits the PH domain into the activated insulin receptor complex. Elucidation of the mechanism used by the PH domain to couple IRS proteins to the insulin receptor may provide important insights into the molecular basis of insulin resistance and enable the design of new drugs to restore the insulin response in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients or disrupt IRS protein function in cancer."

Full-length versions of these isoforms were assembled and expressed in COS cells. Whereas the “a” forms were phosphorylated easily with PKC, isoform 2b was phosphorylated only a little, and isoform 3b was not phosphorylated at all. Phosphorylation of isoforms 2a and 3a did not affect their basal activity, but prevented the stimulation of their activity by calmodulin and their binding to calmodulin-Sepharose. This indicated that phosphorylation prevented activation of these isoforms by preventing calmodulin binding. Based on these results, phosphorylation of the pump with PKC would be expected to increase free intracellular Ca2+ levels in those cells where isoforms 2a and 3a are expressed.

The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is an important element in removing Ca2+ from the cell during intracellular signaling and in maintaining the very low resting level of cytosolic Ca2+ of the unstimulated cell. The pump is known to be activated in many different ways: by calmodulin, acidic phospholipids, phosphorylation with protein kinases, proteolysis, and dimerization. Although the mechanisms of all of these regulations have not been determined, the way calmodulin stimulates the pump is fairly well understood. Calmodulin binds tightly to a specific domain that is 92 amino acids upstream of the carboxyl terminus of hPMCA4b 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+ pump; r, rat; h, human; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.

Until very recently the subjects available for study have been intact cells or biological membranes of unknown isoform composition; only in the case of the erythrocyte membrane had the isoform composition of the pump been determined, consisting primarily of hPMCA4b. Cloning of the pump has revealed the existence of at least four different genes coding for the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. PMCA1 and PMCA4 are widely expressed, whereas PMCA2 and PMCA3 are more specialized forms which are expressed primarily in brain, skeletal muscle, and heart. Alternative splices at two different sites raise the number of possible pump isoforms to more than 20. One of the alternative splices occurs at the C hot spot near the middle of the calmodulin-binding domain; this splice changes the carboxyl-terminal third of the calmodulin-binding domain and the rest of the regulatory region (12Shull G.E. Greeb J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8646-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this alternate splice in hPMCA4 changed the structure of the calmodulin-binding domain and the autoinhibitory region, and as a result, hPMCA4a had a higher basal activity and a much lower calmodulin affinity than hPMCA4b (13Enyedi A.

Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Studies on the erythrocyte Ca2+ pump (which is mainly hPMCA4b) indicated that phosphorylation by PKC occurs at its carboxyl terminus (10Wang K.K.W. Wright L.C. Machan C.L. Allen B.G. Conigrave A.D. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies inferred that threonine 1102, in the middle of the calmodulin-binding domain, was one of the sites of phosphorylation. Subsequent studies on synthetic peptides suggested that phosphorylation of this residue would prevent binding of calmodulin to the pump while it would cause a calmodulin-like activation (15Hofmann F. Anagli J. Carafoli E. Vorherr T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24298-24303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Farrar Y.-J.K. Vanaman T.C. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 1390Google Scholar). Since the part of the calmodulin-binding domain that contains this threonine residue is conserved in all isoforms, this model predicted that PKC would regulate the more than 20 isoforms uniformly. Recently, however, we showed (utilizing truncated mutants) that the site in hPMCA4b most readily phosphorylated by PKC occurs in a different location, downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The region where PKC phosphorylated the pump under mild conditions was part of the autoinhibitory region but was not involved in calmodulin binding. Thus, phosphorylation at this site caused partial activation of the pump, and full activation occurred when calmodulin bound to the phosphorylated enzyme. A construct that lacked this site but contained the calmodulin-binding domain became phosphorylated only at a relatively high PKC concentration. Whether this phosphorylation occurred at threonine 1102 is being studied by further mutations. Another important finding of our study was that phosphorylation did not prevent binding of calmodulin, i.e. the phosphorylated form of hPMCA4b bound to calmodulin-Sepharose. The most readily phosphorylated region of hPMCA4b is located downstream of the C “hot spot” where the alternate splice of the mRNA occurs. This region of the molecule is highly variable. Inspection of the sequences in the corresponding regions of isoforms 2 and 3 of PMCA indicates that they have different candidate sequences for phosphorylation with protein kinases and that phosphorylation of them might have different consequences on their activity. Among the pump isoforms, hPMCA4b has been studied extensively, but little is known about the other forms. Other isoforms of the pump have been expressed in COS cells only recently, which has made it possible to study their unique properties (17Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

In the study presented here, we examined the phosphorylation with PKC of isoforms rPMCA2b, -2a, -3b, and -3a. While isoforms rPMCA2a and 3a, like hPMCA4b, appeared to be very sensitive to PKC phosphorylation, rPMCA2b was phosphorylated only a little and rPMCA3b was not phosphorylated at all. Unlike the case of hPMCA4b, phosphorylation of rPMCA2a and -3a prevented their binding to calmodulin-Sepharose. While phosphorylation with PKC did not affect the basal activity of rPMCA2a and -3a, it prevented stimulation of the activity by calmodulin. 45Ca and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Calmodulin and calmodulin-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma. PMA and rat brain PKC (containing isoforms α, β1, β2, and γ) were purchased from Calbiochem. The specific activity of the PKC preparation was 1130 units/mg of protein. LipofectAMINETM, Opti-MEM, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Full-length versions of rPMCA2a were constructed as described in Elwess et al. (18Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

A 5′ forward polymerase chain reaction primer (GGGATCATAGGTGTCGACCCGTCC) containing a SalI site and a 3′ reverse primer (CTGAAGAGGTACCTGACTTGGTGG) containing a KpnI site amplified the rPMCA3a cDNA. This was done using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer); a total volume of 100 μl was used with 900 ng of template being added per sample. The reaction (in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler) was initiated with a 2-min melting step at 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final 5-min extension step at 72 °C. The expected product was ∼3.9 kilobases. The full-length rPMCA3a DNA was cloned into the pMM2 expression vector at the SalI and KpnI sites. rPMCA3a cDNA was digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the pUC19 vector at these sites; XL-1 Blue competent cells (Stratagene) were used for the transformation. Amplification was done to produce the carboxyl terminus of the rPMCA3b isoform. The GeneAmp RNA polymerase chain reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) was used with 50 ng of rat brain mRNA per sample used as the template; the total volume per reaction sample was 100 μl. The reaction was initiated with a 2-min melting step at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 5-min extension step at 72 °C. The 5′ forward primer which contained a BamHI site was CCTCCACCGGATCCAGACACAGATCCG. The 3′ reverse primer which contained a XhoI site was CTGGCTCGAGGGATGTCTCCATGCTGTGG. The expected product was ∼330 base pairs. The products were digested withBamHI and XhoI and ligated into the SK+ Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) at these sites. The ∼330-base pair rPMCA3b carboxyl terminus was digested out of SK+ Bluescript and cloned into the rPMCA3a cDNA (in pUC19) at the BamHI and KpnI sites using standard ligation and transformation procedures. The now full-length rPMC3b gene was digested out of pUC19 using SalI and KpnI and was ligated into the expression vector pMM2 at these sites. Standard transformation procedures were followed. All sequencing was done by the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility with a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer using the ABI Prism dye primer cycle sequencing ready reaction kit. The sequences of 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b were identical to those originally reported (12Shull G.E. Greeb J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8646-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Burk S.E.

Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) based on the protocol described by the manufacturer. 25 × 105 COS cells were seeded in a 150-cm2 flask. Transfection was initiated when the cells were 70–80% confluent. DNA-LipofectAMINETM complex for each flask was formed by incubating 8 μg of DNA and 100 μl of LipofectAMINE in 3.6 ml of serum-free medium for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with the complex in 14.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium. After 5 h of incubation the cells were supplemented with serum, and incubation continued for a total of 24 h. The DNA-LipofectAMINETM complex containing medium was then replaced with fresh tissue culture medium with 10% serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Crude microsomal membranes from COS cells were prepared as described by Enyedi et al. (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake by microsomal vesicles was carried out in a 200-μl reaction mixture and assayed by filtration as described (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The filters and reaction medium were as described previously (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Microsomes at 10–20 μg/ml concentration were incubated in the presence of 20 milliunits (0.0875 μg/ml) of PKC and 100 nm PMA. Ca2+ uptake by the vesicles was started by the addition of 6 mm ATP. After 2 min, 72.5 nm calmodulin was added where appropriate, and incubation was continued for an additional 5 min. The reaction was terminated by separating the microsomes with filtration through the Millipore filters. 10 μg of microsomal membrane was phosphorylated basically as described (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 200-μl reaction mixture contained 100 mm KCl, 25 mm TES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 100 μm CaCl2, and 90 μm EGTA. This mixture was preincubated for 3 min with 20 milliunits (0.0875 μg/ml) of PKC and 100 nm PMA, and the reaction was started by the addition of 20 μm[32P]ATP. After a 5-min incubation the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm inorganic phosphate. The precipitate was supplemented with 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, washed three times with the same trichloroacetic acid solution, and then dissolved in the electrophoresis sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 125 mg/ml urea, and 100 mmdithiothreitol. An aliquot of this solution containing 2 μg of membrane protein was applied to each track of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This was also done as described previously (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, the phosphorylation reaction described above was terminated by putting the samples on ice, and subsequently, 40 μl of extraction solution (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was added. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. Then, 50 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose beads were introduced to each sample, and binding was allowed to proceed on ice for 90 min. The unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads four times with 200 μl of 5 times diluted extraction buffer containing 1 mm cold ATP. The proteins bound to the calmodulin-Sepharose were removed by incubating the beads with the electrophoresis sample buffer described above, which contained SDS-urea. The beads were separated from the samples by centrifugation, and an aliquot of each sample was applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This was done as described (11Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Western blots were immunostained using antibody 5F10 which reacts with all of the pump isoforms (21Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To study the phosphorylation with PKC of additional isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, the “a” and “b” forms of rPMCA2 and rPMCA3 were overexpressed in COS cells. For comparison, hPMCA4b, a well characterized isoform of the pump, was also expressed. The full-length rPMCA2 and rPMCA3 clones were generously given to us by Dr. G. Shull, University of Cincinnati, and we incorporated them into the expression vector pMM2. Fig.1 A shows an immunoblot of the expressed proteins. To visualize the pump isoforms we used monoclonal antibody 5F10, which has been shown to recognize all isoforms of the PMCA family. As judged from the staining intensity and the migration pattern of the isoforms, the level of expression was nearly the same and the size corresponded well to the expected molecular mass which has been calculated from the protein sequences of each isoform. An endogenous PMCA, isoform 1b, is also present in COS cell membranes, but it does not interfere with any of the measurements reported here. It doesn't interfere because, in electrophoresis, it migrates slower than any of the other isoforms and is separated from the bands corresponding to the overexpressed pump proteins. That no staining at the position of PMCA1b is seen shows that it represents only a minor component of these membranes. Phosphorylation with PKC of equal amounts of expressed PMCA isoforms in COS cell membranes was studied. Fig. 1 A shows an immunoblot of the phosphorylated samples whereas Fig. 1 B is an autoradiogram of that immunoblot. In panel C of Fig. 1 the amount of phosphorylation is related to that of hPMCA4b as control. Strong phosphorylated bands were found associated with the expressed hPMCA4b, rPMCA2a, and rPMCA3a isoforms. In contrast, the phosphorylation of rPMCA2b was much weaker, and no phosphorylated band at the position of rPMCA3b was found. It is important to emphasize that no additional phosphorylation of the pump isoforms was observed even at much higher PKC concentrations, at which the phosphorylation of the other membrane proteins became more pronounced (not shown). Whether phosphorylation of 2a and 3a with PKC affects calmodulin binding was tested by loading the phosphorylated proteins onto calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+. Subsequently, the beads were washed extensively with Ca2+-containing solutions to remove the unbound proteins. The proteins bound to the calmodulin-Sepharose beads were eluted and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A) and autoradiography (Fig.2 B). As in Fig. 1, the immunoblot and autoradiogram were done on the same blot. The amount of phosphorylation was also related to that of hPMCA4b (Fig. 2 C). The immunoblot of Fig. 2 shows that substantial amounts of the isoforms could be recovered from the calmodulin-Sepharose beads. The phosphorylation pattern of the isoforms, however, changed significantly from that seen in Fig. 1,B and C. The hPMCA4b eluted from calmodulin-Sepharose displayed a strong phosphorylated band, indicating that phosphorylation of hPMCA4b did not prevent binding to calmodulin-Sepharose, in good agreement with previous findings. In contrast, only weak labeling of the rPMCA2a and -3a bands eluted from calmodulin-Sepharose could be detected. This indicates that phosphorylation of rPMCA2a and -3a blocked calmodulin binding, and only the nonphosphorylated form of these isoforms bound to the calmodulin-Sepharose beads. That a substantial amount of nonphosphorylated 2a and 3a could be recovered from the calmodulin-Sepharose beads shows that phosphorylation of the isoforms was not complete. From a previous experiment (22Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we concluded that a large proportion of the membrane vesicles have a right-side-out orientation. In these vesicles, PKC cannot reach the cytoplasmically oriented regions of the pump, leaving a substantial nonphosphorylated portion of isoforms 2a and 3a. When solubilized, these regions become readily accessible and will bind to the calmodulin-Sepharose beads. We tested the effect of phosphorylation with PKC on the activity of rPMCA2a and -3a in the presence and absence of calmodulin. Since the conditions for phosphorylation were similar to those of Ca2+ transport, phosphorylation with PKC was allowed to occur during the Ca2+ transport assay. In similar experiments we have shown that PKC activated hPMCA4b only partially and that maximum activation occurred when calmodulin was present. In contrast, we show in Fig. 3 that neither rPMCA2a nor -3a was stimulated by the kinase; rather phosphorylation of these isoforms prevented stimulation by calmodulin. This agreed well with the finding that phosphorylation of both rPMCA2a and -3a prevented binding to calmodulin-Sepharose. In conclusion, we show here for the first time that PKC regulates isoforms 2a and 3a of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump in an entirely different way from the regulation seen in isoform 4b. The carboxyl-terminal regulatory regions of the isoforms studied are shown in Fig. 4. As marked in the figure, in hPMCA4b the most easily phosphorylatable site(s) lie outside of the 28-residue calmodulin-binding domain, and thus, phosphorylation does not affect binding of calmodulin. In hPMCA4a the calmodulin-binding domain is twice as long as in hPMCA4b (14Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the calmodulin-binding domains of the 2a and 3a isoforms are probably also long. Inspection of the sequences at the carboxyl terminus suggests that there are several candidate sequences for PKC phosphorylation in rPMCA2a and -3a within this longer domain. The phosphorylation site(s) in these isoforms are yet to be determined but, based on the interference of phosphorylation with calmodulin-binding, they are expected to lie within the calmodulin-binding domain. Little or no phosphorylation by PKC was found in the “b” forms of rPMCA2 and -3. This finding provides additional evidence against the widely accepted threonine (in the middle of the calmodulin-binding domain) as a phosphorylation site. Since the sequence around this threonine is conserved in all isoforms, if it were a phosphorylation site, hPMCA4b, rPMCA2b, and rPMCA3b would all be expected to be equally good substrates for PKC phosphorylation. Another important finding of our study was that PKC did not affect the basal activity of rPMCA2a and -3a. On the contrary, by inhibiting the binding of calmodulin it prevented calmodulin stimulation of the activity of these isoforms. Thus, PKC would inhibit the activity of these pumps in the cell. That inhibition would increase the intracellular Ca2+ during Ca2+ signaling in those cells where rPMCA2a and -3a are expressed. Since in brain both calmodulin and rPMCA2a are abundant, the unique regulation of this Ca2+ pump isoform is expected to have a great significance. Our studies indicate that the regulation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump with alternative RNA splicing, calmodulin, and PKC is more complex than has generally been believed."

Substrates consisting of a 25-mer RNA annealed to complementary DNA ranging in length from 9–17 nucleotides were designed to create overhanging single strand RNA regions extending 5′ and 3′ from the RNA-DNA duplex. Digestion of single strand RNA was observed exclusively within the 3′ overhang region and not the 5′ overhang region. RNase H digestion of the 3′ overhang region resulted in digestion products with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini. The number of single strand RNA residues cleaved by RNase H is influenced by the sequence of the single strand RNA immediately adjacent to the RNA-DNA duplex and appears to be a function of the stacking properties of the RNA residues adjacent to the RNA-DNA duplex. RNase H digestion of the 3′ overhang region was not observed for a substrate that contained a 2′-methoxy antisense strand. The introduction of 3 deoxynucleotides at the 5′ terminus of the 2′-methoxy antisense oligonucleotide resulted in cleavage.

Biochem. 1970; 14: 279Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). RNase H activity appears to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes and bacteria (2Itaya M. Kono K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4443-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Busen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9434-9443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This family of enzymes functions as endonucleases exhibiting limited sequence specificity and requiring divalent cations to produce 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini (4Crouch R.J. Dirksen M.L. Linn S.M. Roberts R.J. Nuclease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 211-241Google Scholar). RNase H1 from Escherichia coli is perhaps the best characterized isotype of this family of enzymes. The substrate requirements for RNase H1 have been studied extensively. The dissociation constants for various duplexes and E. coliRNase H1 indicate that this enzyme is a double strand RNA-binding protein that cleaves RNA only in an RNA-DNA duplex (5Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cleavage specificity of the enzyme appears to be due to the catalytic process and not the binding interaction between RNase H and the substrate duplex. For example, although RNase H exhibited a binding affinity for substrates containing 2′-methoxy modifications approximately equal to the unmodified RNA-DNA heteroduplex, RNase H activity was ablated by these modifications. Kinetic analyses of substrates containing RNA duplexed with chimeric oligonucleotides composed of a mixture of deoxy- and 2′-modified nucleotides demonstrated that the rate of cleavage was a function of the length of the deoxy portion of the chimeric oligonucleotide, i.e. the cleavage rate decreased with a diminishing number of contiguous deoxynucleotides, and complete loss in activity was observed for chimeric oligonucleotides containing less than 4 contiguous deoxynucleotides (6Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Crooke S.T.

In all cases E. coli RNase H1 cleavage of the RNA was observed to occur exclusively within regions base-paired to DNA. In this communication we report that E. coli RNase H1 can cleave single strand RNA extending 3′ from an RNA-DNA duplex. The fact that the products are 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl suggests that the enzyme cleaves single and double strand regions via the same mechanism. Furthermore, these data suggest that E. coliRNase H1 cleaves RNA in RNA-DNA duplexes through a DNase-like mechanism. A series of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ranging in length from 9 to 17 were designed to target a 25-mer RNA producing a heteroduplex with overhanging single strand RNA regions of varying length and sequence composition at both the 3′ or 5′ termini (Fig.1). The single strand RNA regions 3′ to the heteroduplex ranged in length from 5 to 16 residues and were positioned on the 25-mer RNA such that the sequence composition of the single strand RNA immediately 3′ of the heteroduplex consisted of either mixed purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, a string of three purines, or two pyrimidines. Heteroduplexes were preformed and then digested with RNase H, and the digestion products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, the secondary structures of the heteroduplex substrates were mapped using single strand-specific ribonucleases, as described previously (8Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12055-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Digestion outside of the heteroduplex site was observed for all of the oligodeoxynucleotide-RNA duplexes tested (substrates 1–6, Fig. 1). These cleavages were observed exclusively in the region 3′ of the heteroduplex. Under no circumstances was cleavage observed in the single strand RNA region 5′ to the heteroduplex and consistent with earlier reports. The 5′-most cleavage site observed on the RNA was 5 nucleotides downstream of the 3′ end of the oligodeoxynucleotide (7Crooke S.T. Lemonidis K.M. Neilson L. Griffey R. Lesnik E.A. Monia B.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The greatest number of single strand RNA cleavage sites was observed for the substrate containing the string of three purines within the single strand region immediately adjacent to the heteroduplex (substrate 6, Fig. 1). RNase H digestion of this substrate resulted in four cleavage sites within the single strand region of the RNA. The substrates containing mixed pyrimidine and purine sequences or two pyrimidines in the overhanging RNA resulted in fewer cleavage sites, with a maximum of two cleavage sites observed for these substrates (substrates 1–5, Fig. 1). Enzymatic structure mapping of the heteroduplexes with single strand-specific ribonucleases showed that the RNA regions flanking the heteroduplex were indeed single-stranded (Fig. 1), and thus alternative intramolecular or intermolecular structures were not formed. The length of the single strand RNA sequence downstream of the heteroduplex (e.g. ranging from 5 to 16 residues for the substrates tested) appeared to have no effect on the number of cleavage sites within the single strand RNA region. For example, the substrate containing the longest single strand region, i.e. 16 nucleotides, exhibited only two cleavage sites outside of the heteroduplex (substrate 2, Fig. 1), whereas four single strand RNA residues of the substrate containing a 6-nucleotide single strand region were digested by RNase H (substrate 6, Fig.1). These data suggest that the ability of E. coli RNase H1 to cleave single strand RNA regions is a function of the structure of these regions resulting from the sequence composition and not the length of the single strand RNA. Analysis of the RNase H digestion products suggests that the overhanging single strand regions are cleaved by the same mechanism as the heteroduplex region (Fig. 2). Specifically, the cleavage products for both the heteroduplex and single strand overhanging regions were found to consist of a 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that E. coli RNase H1 cleaves RNA in an RNA-DNA duplex leaving a 5′-phosphorylated product (1Hausen P. Stein H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 279Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition these data suggest that the RNase H cleavage of the overhanging regions differs from many single strand-specific endoribonucleases which produce a 3′-phosphorylated product (9Ikehara M. Ohtsuka E. Togunaga T. Nishikawa S. Uesugi S. Tanaka T. Aoyana Y. Kikyodani S. Fujimoto K. Yanase K. Fuchimura K. Morioka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These RNases follow a two-step mechanism involving the use of the 2′-hydroxyl to perform a nucleophilic in-line attack on the phosphorus resulting in the formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate intermediate. This trigonal bipyrimidal intermediate is then hydrolyzed to form the 3′-phosphorylated product (10Roberts G.C.K. Dennis E.A. Meadows D.H. Cohen J.S. Jardetzky O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic pathway for RNase H remains unknown, the enzyme likely uses a catalytic mechanism similar to that observed for other nucleases which have been shown to produce a 5′-phosphorylated product (e.g. DNases, RNase P, and group I and II ribozymes) (11Cech T.R. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 239-269Google Scholar). These nucleases supply the nucleophile required to react directly on the phosphorus center, thus eliminating the requirement of the 2′-hydroxyl. RNase H has adopted this DNase-like mechanism presumably because in stacked and/or duplexed RNA the position of the 2′-hydroxyl is such that an in-line attack of the phosphorus is not possible via the 2′-hydroxyl (12Brown R.S. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4785-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that substrates containing RNA hybridized to 2′-methoxy oligonucleotides do not support RNase H activity (6Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Inoue H. Hayase Y. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To determine whether heteroduplex substrates containing 2′-methoxy antisense oligonucleotides would support RNase H digestion of single strand RNA overhangs, we designed a 2′-methoxy antisense analog (substrate 15, Fig. 1) of the antisense sequence that yielded the greatest number of cleavage sites outside of the heteroduplex region (substrate 6, Fig. 1). Consistent with previous studies, the heteroduplex substrate containing the 2′-methoxy antisense oligonucleotide did not support RNase H activity within the heteroduplex region. In addition, no cleavage of the single strand RNA region was observed with this substrate. Clearly, digestion of the 3′-overhanging RNA by RNase H requires that the antisense sequence consist of deoxynucleotides. To determine if oligonucleotides consisting of both deoxynucleotides and 2′-methoxynucleotides would support RNase H cleavage of the 3′ overhang region, we designed chimeric oligonucleotides with the deoxynucleotide portion on the 5′ end of the antisense sequence adjacent to the 3′ overhang region and varied the size of the deoxynucleotide portion of the chimeric oligonucleotide from 1 to 5 residues (substrates 10–14, Fig. 1). Again, the antisense sequence selected for this study corresponded to the oligodeoxynucleotide which yielded the greatest number of cleavages within the 3′ overhang (substrate 6, Fig. 1). E. coli RNase H1 digestion of substrates 10–14 shows that three of the five substrates containing the chimeric oligonucleotides were cleaved by the enzyme. Furthermore, in all cases in which cleavage was observed with these substrates, the RNase H cleavage occurred exclusively within the single strand RNA region. Interestingly, the substrates containing chimeric oligonucleotides exhibited fewer cleavage sites within the single strand RNA region as compared with the analogous unmodified substrate (substrate 6, Fig. 1). These data also suggest that placement of a minimum of 3 deoxynucleotides at the 5′ end of the antisense oligonucleotide was required to support RNase H cleavage. Kinetic analysis of the substrate containing the chimeric oligonucleotide with the 5-deoxynucleotide portion at the 5′ end showed that this substrate was digested byE. coli RNase H1 at approximately the same rate as the unmodified RNA-DNA substrate (data not shown). Previous studies with chimeric oligonucleotides containing a string of 5 deoxynucleotides within other regions of the oligonucleotide showed that these substrates were digested 3- to 5-fold more slowly than the unmodified RNA-DNA substrate (5Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that placement of the deoxynucleotide portion at the 5′ end of the chimeric oligonucleotide and adjacent to the 3′ RNA overhang serves to effectively increase the size of the substrate portion of the chimeric oligonucleotide. The cleavage patterns for the various substrates tested show that the 5′-most cleavage site on the RNA is 5 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the oligodeoxynucleotide and that the 3′-most cleavage site extends 4 residues past the heteroduplex into the single strand 3′ overhang region. These data are consistent with the observed structure and function of RNase H1. Structural studies suggest that the enzyme exhibits a selective “binding directionality” with respect to the RNA of the heteroduplex substrate such that the binding region on the enzyme is positioned several residues 5′ to the catalytic region (14Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Miyashiro H. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1990; 347: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the binding interaction is sensitive to the structure of the substrate with the enzyme exhibiting a 40-fold greater affinity for RNA-DNA heteroduplexes than single strand RNA (9Ikehara M. Ohtsuka E. Togunaga T. Nishikawa S. Uesugi S. Tanaka T. Aoyana Y. Kikyodani S. Fujimoto K. Yanase K. Fuchimura K. Morioka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, presented with an RNA-DNA substrate containing overhanging single strand RNA regions, the enzyme would preferentially bind to the heteroduplex region of the substrate. Binding of E. coli RNase H to the 3′-most end of the oligodeoxynucleotide duplexed with RNA would result in cleavage several nucleotides downstream on the RNA (e.g. yielding the observed cleavage 5–7 nucleotides from the 3′ end). Binding of RNase H to the 5′-most end of the oligodeoxynucleotide duplexed with the RNA would result in cleavage within the downstream 3′ overhang region of the RNA (e.g. yielding the observed cleavage 1–4 nucleotides from the 5′ end). Said another way, RNase H-induced cleavages less than 5 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the oligodeoxynucleotide or more than 4 residues within the 3′-overhanging RNA are not observed presumably because this would position the binding region of the enzyme within the overhanging single strand RNA, a region for which the enzyme exhibits significantly lower affinity (Fig.3). The greater number of cleavage sites observed for the substrate containing the string of purines may be due to the fact that single strand purines exhibit a greater propensity to continue stacking on the base pairs of a duplex (16Posrschke D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Reich C. Tinoco I. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 833-848Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the footprint of the enzyme appears to comprise a single helical turn on the duplex substrate and this binding/catalytic interaction is sensitive to the helical structure of the substrate, the extended helical structure created by the continued stacking of single strand RNA residues on the heteroduplex would serve to effectively increase the size of the substrate beyond the heteroduplex. Single strand sequences consisting of pyrimidines and mixed purines/pyrimidines also continue stacking but are in general limited to 1 or 2 residues immediately adjacent to the duplex (16Posrschke D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Reich C. Tinoco I. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 833-848Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This lower propensity for stacking may explain why these substrates exhibited fewer cleavages within the 3′ overhang. Given that cleavage of the 3′-overhanging RNA region by RNase H occurs with the enzyme bound to the heteroduplex region and that the 2′-hydroxyl does not appear to function as the nucleophile during catalysis, we designed RNA-DNA duplexes with 3′- and 5′-overhanging DNA regions to determine whether, provided with the heteroduplex binding site, RNase H would cleave single strand DNA adjacent to the RNA-DNA duplex. These substrates were patterned after substrates 4 and 6 (Fig.1 B), with the exception that 32P-end-labeled DNA was substituted for the RNA strand and RNA was substituted for the DNA strand. In both cases, no digestion of the DNA was observed for either the heteroduplex or single strand regions (data not shown). These data suggest that although the enzyme is capable of binding to the heteroduplex region, cleavage of the single strand overhanging region requires the presence of the 2′-hydroxyl. The role of the 2′-hydroxyl with respect to RNase H catalysis is unclear particularly in light of the fact that group I and II ribozymes, which also produce 5′-phosphorylated products, have been shown to cleave DNA (18Robertson D.L. Joyce G.F. Nature. 1990; 344: 467-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 19Herschlag D. Cech T.R. Nature. 1990; 344: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data support the proposed catalytic mechanism involving a single Mg2+ ion (14Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Miyashiro H. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11535-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Uchiyama Y. Iwai S. Ueno I. Ikehara M. Ohtsuka E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Oda Y. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism uses the 2′-hydroxyl to position the single water-bound Mg2+ ion and the amino acid residue (Asp-70) to activate the water nucleophile. Alternatively, the lack of cleavage observed within the overhanging single strand DNA region may be due to the difference in base-stacking properties between single strand RNA and DNA adjacent to the heteroduplex region. E. coli RNase H1 activity has been shown to be sensitive to the helical structure of the substrate, preferring A-form-like duplexes over B-form duplexes (5Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, stacking of the single strand DNA on the heteroduplex region in a manner other than an A-form-like structure would likely result in the observed abrogation of RNase H activity. In addition to the helical structure of the substrate, RNase H activity within the 3′ overhang appears to be sensitive to chemical modifications within the antisense oligonucleotide. For example, RNase H activity was abrogated by 2′-methoxy substitution within the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide sequence. Activity was restored with the introduction of a minimum of 3 deoxynucleotides at the 5′ end of the 2′-methoxy-substituted antisense oligonucleotide (substrates 10–12, Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the rate at which the RNA in a chimeric heteroduplex is digested by E. coli RNase H is a function of the length of the deoxynucleotide portion of the chimeric oligonucleotide (6Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Crooke S.T. Lemonidis K.M. Neilson L. Griffey R. Lesnik E.A. Monia B.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, with longer RNAs, improved RNase H activity may be realized by placing the deoxynucleotide portion at the 5′ end of the chimeric antisense oligonucleotide and thereby effectively increasing the size of the substrate. Finally, these data suggest that for RNase H cleavage of single strand RNA to occur, at the minimum two criteria must be met. First, in order for the enzyme to bind to the substrate in a way that supports cleavage of the single strand RNA overhang, the duplex region must be positioned 5′ to the cleavage site. Second the 5′ end of the antisense sequence must consist of a minimum of 3 deoxynucleotides. These data support previous observations that RNase H is both directional and processive (7Crooke S.T.

Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Clearly the selective binding directionality exhibited by RNase H plays a crucial role in the biological processes involving the enzyme. For example, E. coli RNase H1 is believed to participate in DNA replication by removing the upstream RNA primers of Okazaki fragments (23Kellar W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 81: 3993-3997Google Scholar). The binding specificity and polarity exhibited by the enzyme,i.e. binding region positioned several residues 5′ to the catalytic region, is consistent with the orientation of the RNA primers which are positioned 5′ with respect to the Okazaki fragments. Similar cleavage specificity with respect to the position of the RNA primers has been observed for calf thymus RNase H1 (24Huang L. Yong K. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25922-25927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNase H activity is also often implicated in antisense oligodeoxynucleotide-mediated degradation of RNA. In a previous study examining E. coli RNase H1 activity on antisense oligonucleotide-induced RNA pseudo-half-knot structures we have shown that cleavage of the structured RNA is profoundly affected by the binding directionality of the enzyme (25Lima W.F. Mohan V. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18191-18199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that the binding polarity exhibited by RNase H has important implications both biologically and pharmacologically. The demonstration that E. coli RNase H1 cleaves single strand RNA adjacent to heteroduplex regions via the same mechanism as it cleaves RNA within the heteroduplex, coupled with the demonstration that the enzyme is a double strand RNA-binding protein (5Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggests that the enzyme may have derived from genes coding for an RNA-binding protein and a DNase-like nuclease. The nuclease domain enables cleavage of stacked RNA whereas the double strand RNA binding domain serves either to provide greater substrate specificity or to modulate enzyme activity in a manner similar to that suggested for the double strand RNA binding domain of S. cerevisiae RNase H1 (26Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 246-259PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Henri Sasmor and Pierre Villet for oligonucleotide synthesis and Drs. Thomas W.

https://openalex.org/W2069860821,"Stimulation of platelets by collagen leads to activation of a tyrosine kinase cascade resulting in secretion and aggregation. We have recently shown that this pathway involves rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of an Fc receptor γ chain, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), enabling interaction with the tandem SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Activation of Syk lies upstream of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ2. In the present study we sought to test directly the role of the ITAM/Syk interaction and the role of the Src-related kinases in collagen receptor signaling using mouse megakaryocytes. We demonstrate that the calcium-mobilizing action of a collagen-related peptide (CRP) is kinase-dependent, inhibited by the microinjection of the tandem SH2 domains of Syk and abolished in Syk-deficient mice. Furthermore, the CRP response is abolished by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 and inhibited in Fyn-deficient mice. In contrast, the calcium response to the G-protein-linked receptor agonist thrombin is not significantly altered under these conditions. These results provide direct evidence of the functional importance of Fyn and Syk in collagen receptor signaling and support the megakaryocyte as a model for the study of proteins involved in this pathway.

The extracellular matrix protein collagen has a fundamental role in hemostasis. Upon vascular damage, platelets adhere to subendothelial collagen leading to platelet degranulation, aggregation, and development of a hemostatic plug. Collagen activates platelets through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; SH2, Src homology 2; CRP, collagen-related peptide; FcR-γ chain, Fc receptor γ chain; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; SH2, Src homology 2; CRP, collagen-related peptide; FcR-γ chain, Fc receptor γ chain; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. leading to formation of the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and a rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i ) (1Blake R.A.

Syk is a 72-kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which is assembled into signaling complexes via interaction between its tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) found in receptors of the immune system (5Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ITAM has the amino acid sequence YXX(L/I)X6–8YXX(L/I) (7Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated on the conserved tyrosine residues by a member of the Src family of kinases upon receptor activation (8Jackson S. Scoenwaelder S. Yuan Y. Salem H. Cooray P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 640-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that stimulation of platelets with collagen, or a collagen-related peptide (CRP), induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ chain (FcR-γ chain), which contains an ITAM, allowing formation of an association with Syk (9Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated, via use of genetically deficient mice, the absolute requirement for both Syk and the FcR-γ chain for collagen-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and functional responses in mouse platelets (10Poole A. Gibbins J. Turner M. van Vugt M. van de Winkel J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V. Watson S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Syk is also phosphorylated on tyrosine when platelets are stimulated with thrombin (11Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2277-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs in the absence of significant PLCγ2 phosphorylation (1Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thrombin elicits a rise in [Ca2+] i via a G-protein link to PLCβ (12Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A. Manning D.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, since Syk-deficient platelets have normal functional responses to thrombin the significance of Syk phosphorylation in thrombin receptor signaling remains unclear (10Poole A. Gibbins J. Turner M. van Vugt M. van de Winkel J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V. Watson S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The range of techniques that can be used to verify the role of Syk in collagen and thrombin receptor signaling in platelets is hampered by the absence of a nucleus and by their small size. It is possible to overcome these limitations through experiments on the platelet precursor cell, the megakaryocyte (13Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Semin. Hematol. 1986; 23: 43-67PubMed Google Scholar). Megakaryocytes are large (20–50 μm), terminally differentiated polyploid cells comprising 0.1% of bone marrow cells. They can be obtained in reasonable yield only through surgery, limiting experimentation on human tissue. In the present study we have therefore used mouse megakaryocytes in conjunction with single-cell video imaging to investigate the role of Src and Syk family kinases in collagen receptor signaling. CRP has been used to activate the collagen receptor in these experiments to limit contributions from other receptors. CRP mimics platelet activation by collagen, inducing marked tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR-γ chain, Syk, and PLCγ2 but is unable to bind to the integrin α2β1 (9Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R.

A number of other proteins have also been proposed as candidate collagen receptors including glycoprotein IV (GPIIIb, CD36) and uncharacterized 65- and 85–90-kDa glycoproteins (17Deckmyn H.

We demonstrate the requirement of Syk for CRP-induced [Ca2+] i rises via introduction of a protein comprising the tandem SH2 domains of Syk and studies of Syk-deficient megakaryocytes. Neither treatment has a significant effect on the Ca2+-mobilizing response of the G-protein receptor-coupled agonist, thrombin. We further demonstrate the importance of the Src family kinases, and in particular the kinase Fyn, for CRP-induced [Ca2+] i rises. These data provide direct evidence for a functional role of Syk and Fyn in collagen receptor signaling. These studies support the megakaryocyte as a model of signaling pathways in platelets (23Tertyshnikova S. Fein A.

Hanke (Pfizer, U.K.). Thrombin, apyrase, staurosporine, and poly-l-lysine (M r 70,000) were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, U.K.). Fura-2 and calibration standards were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other agents were from previously reported sources (3Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains of Syk was constructed and expressed as described previously (3Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L.

The generation of BALB/c radiation chimeric mice reconstituted with Syk-deficient fetal liver has been described (10Poole A. Gibbins J. Turner M. van Vugt M. van de Winkel J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V. Watson S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Fyn-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Dr. P. Soriano (Division of Molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (24Stein P.L. Lee H.M. Rich S. Soriano P. Cell. 1992; 70: 741-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Mice (4–8 weeks) were killed by cervical dislocation, and the femoral bones were extracted. Control data were generated on male BALB/c mice. The bone marrow was gently washed through a 23-gauge needle into a Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' solution containing 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.2 units/ml apyrase. The cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min in the presence of prostacyclin (1 μg/ml) and resuspended for experimentation in a modified Hanks' solution (143 mmNaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). Experiments were performed at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Bone marrow cells were plated onto coverslips coated in poly-l-lysine (M r 70,000). Microinjection of proteins and Fura-2 (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with glass capillaries was performed with an Eppendorf microinjector 5242 and manipulator 5170. Fura-2 was present in the microinjection needle at a concentration of 2.5 mm. The tandem SH2 domains of Syk were present in the microinjection needle at a concentration of 135 μg/ml and introduced to the cells at a calculated concentration of approximately 0.5 μm (26Graessman A. Graessman M. Mueller C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Agonists were dissolved in the external solution and added to the well containing the cells by pipetting; the tyrosine kinase inhibitor staurosporine was given 180 s before CRP. Single-cell digital imaging of [Ca2+] i was performed using Ionvision software (Improvision, Warwick, U.K.). Fluorescence video images were captured at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm with emission at 510 nm. Calculation of [Ca2+] i from the 340:380 ratio was performed by the use of a previously established calibration curve using standard solutions of various free Ca2+concentrations applying a viscosity correction factor (27Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using Ionvision software for the Macintosh. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. of data collected from a minimum of three mice. Statistical analysis was by Student's t test. Megakaryocytes were identified on the basis of their size and morphology. Cells possessing the characteristics of granular megakaryocytes (Stage III) or mature megakaryocytes (Stage IV) were used for experimentation. No discernible difference in response could be detected between the two stages. Megakaryocytes injected with Fura-2 exhibited a uniform distribution of Ca2+ throughout the cytosol. There were no oscillations in resting [Ca2+] i, unlike those seen in rat megakaryocytes (23Tertyshnikova S. Fein A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Uneyama C. Uneyama H. Takahashi M. Akaike N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1995; 291: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Fura-2-loaded megakaryocytes demonstrated a rise in [Ca2+] i when treated with CRP (2.5 μg/ml) and thrombin (1 unit/ml) as shown in Fig.1 A. The steady resting basal [Ca2+] i was measured as 92 ± 13 nm (n = 18). CRP induced a rapid rise in [Ca2+] i, which peaked at a mean of 348 ± 31 nm (Table I) and returned to basal levels within 100 s. The G-protein receptor-coupled agonist, thrombin, caused a larger peak [Ca2+] i rise to 456 ± 36 nm (Table I), which returned rapidly to basal within a period of 100 s. The response to thrombin was not significantly different whether given before or after exposure to CRP (not shown).Table IRole of tyrosine kinases in the rise in [Ca 2+ ] i by CRP and thrombinPeak [Ca2+] i value1-aMean ± S.E.nResting2.5 μg/ml CRP1 unit/ml thrombinnmControl92 ± 13348 ± 31456 ± 3618+ 3 μm staurosporine118 ± 23149 ± 281-bIndicates significant inhibition of response compared with control cells (p < 0.01).,1-cIndicates no significant difference compared with resting levels.456 ± 718+ Syk SH2 protein109 ± 17158 ± 201-bIndicates significant inhibition of response compared with control cells (p < 0.01).412 ± 2611Syk-deficient64 ± 1573 ± 151-bIndicates significant inhibition of response compared with control cells (p < 0.01).,1-cIndicates no significant difference compared with resting levels.411 ± 309+ 10 μm PP1121 ± 16133 ± 141-bIndicates significant inhibition of response compared with control cells (p < 0.01).,1-cIndicates no significant difference compared with resting levels.516 ± 428Fyn-deficient109 ± 14147 ± 191-bIndicates significant inhibition of response compared with control cells (p < 0.01).540 ± 4913Combined data are shown from a series of Fura-2-microinjected cells showing comparison between control cells, cells treated with staurosporine (3 μm), cells injected with the tandem SH2 domains of Syk, cells from Syk-deficient mice, cells treated with PP1 (10 μm), and cells from Fyn-deficient mice.

The table shows peak intracellular calcium values of cells at rest and upon stimulation with CRP (2.5 μg/ml) and thrombin (1 unit/ml). The values are shown as mean ± S.E. (n ≥ 8, from at least three animals). To investigate whether CRP signals through a kinase-dependent pathway we applied the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine (29Blake R.A. Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to the external solution bathing the megakaryocytes, at a concentration of 3 μm. Staurosporine had no significant effect on resting [Ca2+] i but abolished the [Ca2+] i rise induced by CRP (2.5 μg/ml) (TableI). The example experimental record in Fig. 1 B clearly shows an abolition of the response to CRP. Staurosporine did not significantly alter the peak response to thrombin (1 unit/ml; mean peak value, 456 ± 71 nm (Table I)) but prolonged the period of increased [Ca2+] i, taking in excess of 400 s to return to basal levels. The involvement of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk in the collagen signaling pathway was investigated by co-microinjection of the tandem SH2 domains of Syk and Fura-2. It was hypothesized that the protein would compete with endogenous Syk for binding to the Fc receptor γ chain ITAM, preventing downstream phosphorylation events and a rise in [Ca2+] i . Injection of the Syk protein did not significantly alter resting [Ca2+] i (109 ± 17 nm). The peak [Ca2+] i response induced by CRP was significantly reduced to a mean of 158 ± 20 nm (p< 0.01) (Fig. 1 C and Table I). This value is significantly higher than basal (p < 0.02), possibly reflecting the fact that not all endogenous Syk is being competed out. The mean peak [Ca2+] i value obtained after thrombin stimulation was 412 ± 26 nm, which is not significantly different from non-injected control cells (Fig. 1 C and Table I). Prolongation of the thrombin response was not observed. The apparent requirement of Syk for CRP-induced [Ca2+] i rises was further investigated in megakaryocytes from radiation chimeric mice reconstituted with fetal liver deficient in Syk. Successful reconstitution was demonstrated by the absence of Syk in immunoblots of platelet lysates (not shown). Syk-deficient megakaryocytes showed no significant difference in resting [Ca2+] i from controls (Fig.1 D, Table I). Treatment with CRP (2.5 μg/ml) failed to induce a significant rise in [Ca2+] i above basal levels. The mean peak [Ca2+] i value obtained by thrombin stimulation was not significantly different from the wild type control at 411 ± 30 nm but showed a slight prolongation of the period of raised [Ca2+] i . This demonstrates that Syk is essential for [Ca2+] i increases induced by CRP. It is proposed that a member of the Src family of kinases phosphorylates the ITAM upon activation of antigen receptors (8Jackson S. Scoenwaelder S. Yuan Y. Salem H. Cooray P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 640-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It can therefore be speculated that a member of this family is involved in phosphorylation of the FcR-γ chain following stimulation by CRP. This hypothesis was investigated using the pyrazolopyrimidine PP1, a reported Src family kinase inhibitor (30Hanke J. Gardner J. Dow R. Changelian P. Brissette W. Weringer E. Pollok B. Connelly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). This inhibitor is reported to be selective for the kinases Fyn and Lck over other members of the family of Src-like kinases and also over Zap-70, a member of the Syk family of kinases. Fura-2-injected megakaryocytes were treated with PP1 for 3 min prior to agonist addition. PP1 abolished the rise in [Ca2+] i in response to CRP (Fig. 1 E, Table I). In contrast, thrombin induced a rise in [Ca2+] i to a mean peak value of 516 ± 42 nm, a value higher than that seen in control cells although this effect did not reach statistical significance. This indicates that one or more members of the Src family kinases are essential for the calcium-mobilizing action of CRP but that they are not required for thrombin signaling. Given that PP1 is reported to be selective for Fyn and Lck and that Lck is absent in platelets, studies were performed on mice genetically manipulated to lack the Fyn protein to see if CRP signaling was impaired. Fyn was not detected by immunoblot in the platelets from Fyn-deficient animals, and the absence of Fyn was confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (not shown). Fyn-deficient megakaryocytes injected with Fura-2 showed no significant difference in resting [Ca2+] i in comparison with control cells. Treatment with CRP elicits a small rise in [Ca2+] i from the resting value of 109 ± 14 nm to a peak of 147 ± 19 nm (Fig.1 F, Table I). This rise is significantly higher than resting (p < 0.05) but is dramatically reduced compared with control cells (p < 0.01). The peak [Ca2+] i response to thrombin was greater than control at 540 ± 49 nm, but this did not reach statistical significance. In addition a short period of oscillations in [Ca2+] i was observed after the initial thrombin-induced peak. These results suggest that Fyn plays a crucial role in signaling by CRP but little or no role in that of thrombin. Various biochemical studies have provided evidence for the involvement of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk in the signaling pathway elicited by collagen stimulation in platelets (1Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Poole A.W. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to verify this model through direct evaluation of the role of Syk and the Src family of kinases in signaling by collagen using single-cell imaging and microinjection techniques in megakaryocytes, the precursor cell for the platelet. We have shown that mouse megakaryocytes exhibit a rise in [Ca2+] i when treated with CRP and thrombin. Through the use of the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine we have shown that the Ca2+-mobilizing action of CRP is dependent on kinase activity. In contrast the peak Ca2+response to thrombin is unaffected. This is in agreement with data from platelets where thrombin is known to elicit a rise in [Ca2+] i via a G-protein-dependent pathway acting through PLCβ (10Poole A. Gibbins J. Turner M. van Vugt M. van de Winkel J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V. Watson S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The prolonged period of increased [Ca2+] i induced by thrombin in the presence of staurosporine could reflect an inhibition of kinase-dependent extrusion mechanisms, loss of an inhibitory action of protein kinase C at the level of PLCβ (31Watson S.P. Hambleton S. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or prolongation of Ca2+ influx mechanisms (32Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Microinjection of the tandem SH2 domains of Syk into mouse megakaryocytes significantly inhibited the Ca2+-elevating action of CRP but had no significant effect on the action of thrombin. We propose that the injected protein is competing with endogenous Syk for binding to the ITAM in the FcR-γ chain, which is phosphorylated in CRP-stimulated platelets. The lack of a catalytic domain in the injected protein inhibits downstream phosphorylation of PLCγ2, preventing a rise in [Ca2+] i . Current evidence suggests that the receptor recognizing CRP is one component of the collagen receptor complex and is associated with the FcR-γ chain (9Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Upon receptor activation endogenous Syk binds to the collagen receptor complex via interaction of its SH2 domains with the ITAM on the FcR-γ chain (6Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have demonstrated the importance of the tandem SH2 domain region of Syk for optimal association with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs (33Kurosaki T. Johnson S. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 34Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, introduction of Syk SH2 domains to RBL-2H3 cells by permeabilization of the membrane (35Taylor J. Karas J. Ram M. Green O. Seidel-Dugan C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4149-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in T cells by overexpression (36Northrop J. Pustelnik M. Lu A. Grove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inhibits signaling via the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) and the T cell antigen receptor, respectively. Importantly, inhibition was seen at concentrations similar to those used in the present study. The equilibrium binding affinity for association of tandem Syk SH2 domains to the phosphorylated ITAM of the FcεRI receptor has been shown to be 1.4 nm, demonstrating that this is a very high affinity interaction (37Chen T. Repetto B. Chizzonite R. Pullar C. Burghardt C. Dharm E. Zhao Z. Carrol R. Nunes P. Basu M. Danho W. Visnick M. Kochan J. Waugh D. Gilfillan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25308-25315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The high binding affinity supports a specific action of the Syk tandem SH2 domain protein. Specificity in the action of Syk SH2 domains is also suggested by the fact that several other SH2 domains, including the tandem SH2 domains of PLCγ1, do not alter the response to CRP. 2B. Gross, S. K. Melford, and S. P. Watson, manuscript in preparation. Specific inhibitory action of SH2 domains has also been demonstrated for stimuli in other cells (36Northrop J. Pustelnik M. Lu A. Grove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Aroca P. Mahedevan D. Santos E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1839-1846PubMed Google Scholar, 39Roche S. McGlade J. Jones M. Gish G. Pawson T. Courtneidge S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4940-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, the complete lack of a Ca2+ mobilization by CRP in megakaryocytes lacking Syk confirms an essential role for Syk in transducing the signal and is in agreement with the observation that platelets from Syk-deficient mice do not respond to collagen (10Poole A. Gibbins J. Turner M. van Vugt M. van de Winkel J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V. Watson S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that the action of Syk lies upstream of Ca2+ mobilization. The lack of inhibitory effect of both the injected Syk SH2 domains and absence of Syk on thrombin stimulation suggests that Syk does not perform an important role in the Ca2+-mobilizing action of this G-protein-coupled receptor pathway. The physiological significance of phosphorylation of Syk caused by thrombin stimulation may occur downstream of PLCβ and Ca2+ mobilization or may have no involvement in the rise of [Ca2+] i . The role of Syk may be in ending the Ca2+ response, given the extended Ca2+ flux in Syk-deficient megakaryocytes stimulated with thrombin. Inhibition of the Src family of kinases by the selective agent PP1 abolishes the Ca2+ rise induced by CRP. This suggests a crucial involvement of Src kinases in this receptor pathway, possibly through phosphorylation of the ITAM on the FcR-γ chain, analogous to current models of signaling by immune receptors. The large inhibition of CRP response seen in Fyn-deficient mice suggests that Fyn may act upstream of Ca2+ mobilization and may be the crucial kinase responsible for phosphorylation of the ITAM. It could also be possible that Fyn lies between Syk and PLCγ2. The small rise in [Ca2+] i in Fyn-deficient mouse megakaryocytes in response to CRP presumably reflects redundancy among members of the Src family of kinases but could reflect a Syk-dependent, Fyn-independent signaling pathway, which is not via the FcR-γ chain. It has been proposed that Fyn can influence the function of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in T cells (40Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In our studies it is unlikely that the inhibitory action of Fyn deficiency on CRP signaling is at the level of the IP3R given that the Ca2+-mobilizing action of thrombin, which also signals via the IP3R, is not inhibited either in the presence of PP1 or in the Fyn-deficient mice. Our studies highlight several comparisons with the role of tyrosine kinases in signaling via other immune receptors. Syk deficiency abolished Ca2+ mobilization mediated by the FcεRI in mast cells (41Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar) and by the B-cell antigen receptor in the chicken B-cell line, DT40 (42Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In mast cells, it has been suggested that signaling via FcεRI, which is associated with the FcR-γ chain, involves sequential activation of Lyn and then Syk (41Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar, 43Nishizumi H. Yamamoto Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2350-2355PubMed Google Scholar). In this cell type Lyn deficiency results in a reduced Ca2+ response to activation of FcεRI (43Nishizumi H. Yamamoto Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2350-2355PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provide the first demonstration of the functional importance and relative action of Syk and Fyn in the mobilization of Ca2+ by the receptor for collagen in mice megakaryocytes. The data provide further evidence that the collagen receptor, presumably GPVI (see Introduction), signals in a manner similar to an immune receptor. The megakaryocyte could provide a model for the study of other proteins that participate in signaling by collagen and by immune receptors in general, e.g. SLP-76, PLCγ, or p38 (44Robinson A. Gibbins J. Rodrı́guez-Liñares B. Finan P. Wilson L. Kellie S. Findell P. Watson S. Blood. 1996; 88: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are grateful to Dr. M. Barnes for CRP, Dr. Che-Leung Law for the fusion construct of Syk, Dr. P. Soriano for Fyn-deficient mice, and Dr. J. Hanke for PP1. We appreciate the help of Dr. A.

Stroma-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a novel chemokine that blocks the entry of T-tropic HIV-1 mediated by fusin/CXCR4/LESTR (leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor). In this work we demonstrate that SDF-1 triggers increases in intracellular calcium and inhibits the proliferation of myeloid progenitor cell line 32D. By contrast, SDF-1 neither triggers a calcium response nor affects the proliferation of the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D-GR that is deficient in CXCR4. Responsiveness to SDF-1 was rescued by transfection of 32D-GR cells with a cDNA encoding the human CXCR4. The data indicate that SDF-1 induces myelosuppression by activation of CXCR4.

Chemokines are peptides of 70–100 amino acids secreted by many cell types in response to injury and infection. Two major subfamilies of chemokines are distinguished according to the position of the first two cysteines, the CXC or CC. Chemokines activate and induce migration of leukocytes in a cell-specific fashion (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). SDF-1 1The abbreviations used are: SDF-1, stroma-derived factor-1; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IL, interleukin; mSDF-1, murine SDF-1; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein. is a CXC chemokine secreted constitutively from several cell types. Two isoforms of SDF-1 have been identified, α and β, which are generated by differential splicing (2Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). SDF-1 was initially characterized as a pre-B-cell stimulatory factor (3Nagasawa T. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Recently, SDF-1 has been identified as a highly efficient chemotactic factor for T-cells, monocytes (4Bleul C.C.

Springer T. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of SDF-1 by many tissues has suggested that SDF-1 plays a key role in homing T-cells and monocytes under basal conditions (4Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnova J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the SDF-1 gene in mice was shown to be lethal with severe abnormalities in B-cell lymphopoiesis, bone marrow myelopoiesis, and development of the cardiac ventricular septum (6Nagasawa T.

Since SDF-1 is constitutively expressed by bone marrow cells we investigated whether SDF-1 also regulates myelopoiesis. Our data indicate that SDF-1 induces myelosuppression of bone marrow-derived cell line 32D by activation of CXCR4. The murine IL-3-dependent 32D and 32D-GR cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. J.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and maintained at a cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. 32D-GR cells (107 cells/ml) were transfected by electroporation with the human CXCR4 cDNA subcloned into the unique EcoRI site of the expression vector pMEXneo (13Watowich S.S.

SDF-1 resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline was added to the empty culture dish prior to the addition of the cell suspension in agar medium. After 7 days of incubation clusters of 50 or more cells were scored as colonies. Exponentially growing 32D or 32D-GR cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaHPO4, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm Probenecid. Cells (107/ml) were loaded with 5 μm of the calcium-sensitive dye Indo-1AM for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (17Grynkyewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium levels were monitored at 37 °C with a spectrofluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer 650–10S) using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm. Total RNA (10 μg) was fractionated on denaturating formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membranes. RNA was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA encoding human CXCR4. Blots were washed twice in 0.25 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min and once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Blots were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 24 h. Since SDF-1 is constitutively expressed by bone marrow-derived stromal cells (2Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) we investigated whether SDF-1 plays a role in myelopoiesis. SDF-1-induced intracellular signals in myeloid precursor cells were monitored by increases in the level of intracellular Ca2+. We found that SDF-1α or -β increased the intracellular Ca2+ in 32D cells (Fig.1), a non-tumorigenic cell line that exhibits features of normal myeloid progenitor cells (16Metcalf D. Blood. 1985; 65: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to leukemic cell lines, the proliferation of 32D cells requires the presence of IL-3 (18Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ response mediated by SDF-1β was concentration-dependent, and a maximal response was achieved with 100 nm SDF-1β (Fig. 1). Cells treated with SDF-1α or -β were weakly responsive to subsequent additions of SDF-1α or -β showing homologous desensitization. Other chemokines including IL-8, MIP-2, neutrophil activating peptide-2, platelet factor-4, melanocyte growth stimulatory activity, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, or ATP did not desensitize the Ca2+response mediated by SDF-1β. The SDF-1-induced calcium responses in 32D cells were similar to those previously observed with T-cells and monocytes (7Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). In addition, SDF-1β failed to induce calcium responses in 32D cells pretreated with pertussis toxin (data not shown), demonstrating that the SDF-1β receptor is coupled to Giproteins. To evaluate the functional role of SDF-1 on myeloid progenitor cells we tested the effect of SDF-1β on the proliferation of 32D cells using agar colony assays (16Metcalf D. Blood. 1985; 65: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, 32D cells form colonies in semisolid culture that are strictly dependent on the presence of IL-3. As shown in Fig.2, SDF-1β inhibited colony formation of 32D cells, suggesting that SDF-1β is a myelosuppressor.Figure 2Inhibition of proliferation of progenitor cells by SDF-1. Effect of SDF-1 on colony formation of 32D cells (•), 32D-GR (▪), and 32D-GR transfected with CXCR4 cDNA (•). Each point represents the average of two independent experiments. The standard deviations of the responses of 32D-GR cells transfected with CXCR4 cDNA are indicated by bars. The variability of responses of 32D and 32D-GR cells is negligible.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the calcium responses and suppression of proliferation of 32D cells are mediated by activation of the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 we first explored the expression of CXCR4 in 32D cells by Northern blot analysis. Blots of RNA extracted from 32D cells, Jurkat T cells, and white blood cells were probed with human CXCR4 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3, all these cells express the mRNA of CXCR4. Second, we found that 32D-GR cells (19Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Maviolio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar), a cell line derived from 32D cells, neither express the mRNA of CXCR4 (Fig. 3) nor exhibit the typical SDF-1β-dependent Ca2+ response (Fig.4). However, similarly to 32D cells, 32D-GR cells exhibit the typical ATP-dependent Ca2+ responses (Fig. 4, A and C), form colonies in semisolid culture, and require IL-3 for proliferation. Both 32D and 32D-GR form a similar number of colonies; however, SDF-1β failed to inhibit the proliferation of 32D-GR cells (Fig. 4). Finally, responsiveness to SDF-1 was rescued by transfection of 32D-GR with human CXCR4 cDNA. Figs. 2 and 4 show that SDF-1 triggers a calcium response and inhibits proliferation of 32D-GR cells expressing the human CXCR4. These data indicate that SDF-1β induces myelosuppression by activation of CXCR4. Previously, several chemokines including IL-8, platelet factor-4, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β have shown myelosuppressive activity in bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells; however, the heterogeneity and low frequency of precursor cells from bone marrow has precluded the identification of receptor systems that mediate the effect of these chemokines (20Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Lu L. Maze R. Beckmann M.P. Cerami A. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3448-3458PubMed Google Scholar, 21Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Hague N. Benninger L. Sarris A. Cornetta K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23282-23292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that these chemokines mediate their myelosuppressive activity via CXCR4 since they do not activate CXCR4 or desensitize the calcium responses mediated by SDF-1. Probably, these chemokines bind specific receptors. Indeed, we have recently shown the endogenous expression of the murine homolog of the human IL-8 receptor B in 32D cells. 2X. Sanchez, K. Suetomi, B. Hodges, J. Horton, and J. Navarro, unpublished results. The constitutive expression of SDF-1 by bone marrow stromal cells strongly argues for a major role of the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 on myelopoiesis.Figure 4Mobilization of intracellular calcium in CXCR4-deficient cells and cells rescued by transfection with human CXCR4 cDNA. SDF-1β (25 nm) or ATP (500 nm) were added to: A, 32D cells; B, 32D-GR cells; and C, 32D-GR cells transfected with human CXCR4 cDNA.

A single mammalian gene had been reported to account for glycogen biogenesis in liver and muscle, the two major repositories of glycogen. We describe the characterization of novel forms of glycogenin, designated glycogenin-2 (GN-2), encoded by a second gene that is expressed preferentially in certain tissues, including liver, heart, and pancreas. Cloning of cDNAs encoding glycogenin-2 indicated the existence of multiple species, including three liver forms (GN-2α, GN-2β, and GN-2γ) generated in part by alternative splicing. Overall, GN-2 has 40–45% identity to muscle glycogenin but is 72% identical over a 200-residue segment thought to contain the catalytic domain. GN-2 expressed in Escherichia coli or COS cells is active in self-glucosylation assays, and self-glucosylated GN-2 can be elongated by skeletal muscle glycogen synthase. Antibodies raised against GN-2 produced in E. coli recognized proteins of M r ∼66,000 present in extracts of rat liver and in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells. In H4IIEC3 cells, most of the GN-2 was present as a free protein but some was covalently associated with glycogen fractions and was only released by treatment with α-amylase.

Glycogenin-2, a novel self-glucosylating protein involved in liver glycogen biosynthesis.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 276Issue 17PreviewSince publication of this paper, a couple of relevant matters have come to light. Our inability to clone a glycogenin-2 cDNA or gene from rodent tissues prompted us to re-examine the two pieces of evidence presented in this paper for the existence of glycogenin-2 in the rat. First, we had reported the presence of glycogenin-2 in rat H4IIEC3 cells as judged by Western blotting. We have now found that the cells used were of human origin as judged by the karyotype. Furthermore, when we reacquired H4IIEC3 cells from the ATCC, we could not detect glycogenin-2 by Western blotting or by PCR. Full-Text PDF Open Access Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose, is a metabolic energy reserve accumulated in many cell types (1Preiss J. Walsh D.A. Ginsburg V. Robbins P. Biology of Carbohydrates. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 199-314Google Scholar). In mammals, the major glycogen deposits in absolute amount are those of skeletal muscle and liver. These glycogen reserves have somewhat different functions, but both pools contribute to blood glucose homeostasis. In eukaryotes, the pathway of glycogen biogenesis consists of an initiation step and a subsequent phase of bulk polysaccharide synthesis mediated by glycogen synthase and the branching enzyme (see, for example, Ref. 2Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. LeRoith D. Olefsky J.E. Taylor S. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 213-222Google Scholar). The existence of a specific initiator protein, postulated from the work of Krisman and colleagues (3Krisman C.R. Barengo R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), was substantiated by characterization of a protein, glycogenin, that was covalently linked to glycogen and that acted as a primer for the action of glycogen synthase (4Pitcher J. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3097-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Glycogenin was also found to be enzymatically active (4Pitcher J. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3097-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A model for muscle glycogen biosynthesis evolved in which glycogenin would undergo a selfglucosylation reaction to generate the oligosaccharide primer for glycogen synthase action (reviewed in Refs.6Roach P.J. Skurat P.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 289-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Alonso M.D. Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Glycogenin is an oligomer, probably a dimer, and it has been proposed that the self-glucosylation, while intramolecular, is intersubunit (9Cao Y. Steinrauf L.K. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both the enzymic machinery and the regulatory mechanisms for glycogen metabolism differ, at least in part, between liver and muscle. Muscle and liver isoforms of glycogen synthase (10Roach P.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and phosphorylase (11Newgard C.B. Hwang P.K. Fletterick R.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) have been defined by biochemical analysis and cDNA cloning, whereas to date there appear to be single genes encoding the branching and debranching enzymes (12Thon V.J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7509-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang B.Z. Ding J.H. Enghild J.J. Bao Y. Chen Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first glycogenin to be characterized at the molecular level was from mammalian muscle. Campbell and Cohen (14Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) purified and sequenced rabbit skeletal muscle glycogenin, and a cDNA encoding this protein was subsequently cloned (15Viskupic E. Cao Y. Zhang W. Cheng C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25759-25763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogenin was also purified from liver as a protein associated with glycogen, and sequencing of several derived peptides indicated sequence identity with muscle glycogenin (16Smythe C. Villar-Palasi C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was therefore concluded that the same form of glycogenin was responsible for glycogen biogenesis in both liver and muscle (16Smythe C. Villar-Palasi C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ercan et al. (17Ercan N. Gannon M.C. Nuttall F.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22328-22333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also described a self-glucosylating protein of similar size present in rat liver, whereas several other reports have noted mammalian proteins, of different sizes, that had some of the properties of glycogenin (reviewed in Refs. 7Alonso M.D. Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and 18Gannon M.C. Nuttall F.Q. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 163-194Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Whether or not these species are related by amino acid sequence to the known glycogenin was not established. In other organisms, however, there is clear evidence for multiple glycogenin-like proteins (see Ref. 6Roach P.J. Skurat P.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 289-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two self-glucosylating proteins, Glg1p and Glg2p, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been characterized and shown to be required for glycogen accumulation in that organism (19Cheng C. Mu J. Farkas I. Huang D. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6632-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, searching GenBank revealed that Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis briggsae, and Arabidopsis thalianaall express multiple glycogenin-like messages (6Roach P.J. Skurat P.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 289-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the existence of a second mammalian glycogenin gene preferentially expressed in liver, heart, and, to a lesser extent, pancreas. The protein, which we designate glycogenin-2, has all the properties expected of glycogenin; it can self-glucosylate, can act as a substrate for glycogen synthase, and is released from glycogen by α-amylase treatment. This finding makes it necessary to reconsider the enzymic components implicated in the pathway for glycogen biogenesis in these tissues. Two EST 1The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase pair(s). clones, identified by data base searches, were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The brain EST clone (corresponding to the sequence with accession number H04891) and the breast EST clone (corresponding to the sequence with accession number R71874) were completely sequenced on both strands. Several errors were found in the original sequences in the data base, and complete corrected sequences for the two cDNA clones have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers U94357 (brain) and U94358 (breast). Sequences from the other ends of the breast clone (accession number R71875) and brain clone (accession number H04789) were already present in the data base. A small overlapping region (80 base pairs) of identical sequence was found in the brain and breast cDNA clones. These cDNAs were used as probes to screen human brain and human liver cDNA libraries (5′-stretch plus cDNA libraries, in λgt10, fromCLONTECH). A 320-base pairHindIII-EcoNI fragment (probe 1) of the brain clone was used to screen the brain library, and a 0.3-kbEcoRI-NcoI fragment from the 5′-end of brain clone 9–1 (see Fig. 1 and “Results”) was used for liver library screening. Totals of 4 × 105 plaques were screened for each library. Probes were randomly labeled by [α-32P]dCTP using a New England Biolabs NEBlot™ kit. Approximately 2 × 106 cpm/ml probe was used for hybridization which was carried out in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mNaH2PO4·H2O, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4), 10 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's solution: 0.2 g/liter Ficoll, 0.2 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2 g/liter bovine serum albumin), 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, 0.2% SDS, 50% formamide, 0.05% pyrophosphate at 42 °C for 18 h. Filters were first washed twice in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 20 min each and then washed twice for 20 min in 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Positive clones were picked, replated, and taken to plaque purity. λ phage DNA was purified using polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation of the plate lysate, followed by phenol:chloroform (1:1) DNA extraction. Purified λ DNA preparations were digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pGEM7 vector (Promega) for sequencing. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy termination method of Sanger (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar), either manually or with an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. All DNA sequences reported in this work result from sequencing the corresponding cDNAs on both strands. For cDNA clones with internal EcoRI sites, the order of theEcoRI fragments was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using uncut λDNA as templates and primers that straddle theEcoRI sites. A human multiple tissue Northern blot was obtained from CLONTECH. The blot was hybridized with probes from the brain clone (H04789/H04891) using either probe 1 or a 1.2-kb PstI-NotI fragment (probe 2). The filter was also probed with a 0.9-kbNotI-SalI fragment (probe 3) from the breast clone (R71874/R71875). Probes were randomly labeled by [α-32P]dCTP, as described above. Normally 2 × 106 cpm probe/ml hybridization solution was used. Hybridization was performed in 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, 0.05% pyrophosphate at 42 °C for 18 h. The filter was washed for 20 min twice in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed for 20 min twice in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The filter was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Before each re-use, the filter was stripped in boiling 0.5% SDS solution for 10 min, followed by a wash with 2 × SSC for 10 min according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and then exposed for several days at −80 °C to confirm that no signal remained. The coding sequences from the liver cDNAs encoding glycogenin-2α and glycogenin-2γ (clones 7′ and 1′, respectively) were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pET-28a so as to express NH2-terminally His6-tagged forms of the proteins. Thus,EcoRI-ClaI fragments (0.4 kb for clone 1′ and 0.6 kb for clone 7′) containing the ATG sites were excised and ligated into the corresponding sites in the pGEM7 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to create NdeI sites at the ATG start codons by changing the sequence from ACCATG to CATATG using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic oligonucleotides for clone 1′ were: CCCGCGGCGCCACTGCATATGTCGGCCACCATTG(+) and CATTGGTGGCCGACATATGCAGTGGCGCCGCGGG(−). The oligonucleotides for clone 7′ were: CCCGCGGCGCCACTGCATATGTCGGAGACAGAG(+) and CTCTGTCTCCGACATATGCAGTGGCGCCGCGGG(−). All regions that were subjected to mutagenesis or to PCR amplification were sequenced. Finally, NdeI-ClaI fragments encoding the NH2-terminal segment of the protein andClaI-EcoRI fragments encoding the COOH-terminal portion were ligated into pET-28a via a three-piece ligation. The resulting plasmids (pET-28a-7′ and pET-28a-1′) were transformed intoE. coli BL21/DE3 cells for expression. Conditions for cell culture and purification of the His6-tagged proteins were essentially as described previously (21Mu J. Cheng C. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26554-26560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For analysis of self-glucosylation, recombinant GN-2α protein, at 120 μg/ml, was routinely incubated for 30 min with 77 μmUDP-[U-14C]glucose (specific activity 265 mCi/mmol) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, at 30 °C. To test the ability of the proteins to serve as substrates for elongation by glycogen synthase, after 30 min of self-glucosylation, purified glycogen synthase (from rabbit skeletal muscle) and unlabeled UDP-glucose were added, to final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 27 mm, respectively, and incubated for another 120 min. To test the inhibitor sensitivity, the self-glucosylation was done as described above in the presence of 10 mm effectors but was measured using a filter assay similar to that described previously (21Mu J. Cheng C. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26554-26560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot (5 μl) removed from the reaction was spotted onto P81 chromatography paper followed by three washes (30 min each) in 0.5% phosphoric acid and once in ethanol. The dried paper was counted by a liquid scintillation counter. All three full-length forms of liver glycogenin-2 (from clones 1′, 2′, and 7′) were expressed in COS-1 cells. The coding regions were excised from the corresponding pGEM7 vectors with EcoRI and cloned into theEcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for transfection in COS-1 cells. Transient transfection was achieved using LipofectAMINE from Life Technologies, Inc. Normally, 5 μg of plasmid was used for transfection of each 35-mm dish at a stage when the cells were ∼80% confluent. After transfection, the cells were maintained in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days before they were harvested in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Cells were broken by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing. The plates were then scraped with a rubber policeman and the material further homogenized by pipetting. Total cell lysate (1 mg/ml protein) was used to assay self-glucosylation (as described above) and Western analysis (see below). Recombinant His6-tagged glycogenin-2α purified by Ni2+-agarose chromatography was used for antibody production in guinea pigs (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc). The specificity of the antisera was tested by Western hybridization using extracts from COS-1 cells expressing glycogenin-2 (see “Results”). The Western blot procedure was essentially as described previously (21Mu J. Cheng C. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26554-26560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Signals were visualized by using either the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham) or 125I-protein A (5 μCi/10 ml hybridization). Normally, the antiserum was diluted 1:2000 for Western analysis. Rat hepatoma H4IIEC3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers were harvested in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreiotol) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, cells were homogenized by repeated pipetting. The supernatant obtained by centrifuging the cell lysate at 17,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C was used for Western analysis. Some samples were treated with 60 μg/ml α-amylase (Worthington) for 30 min at 30 °C before Western blot. Previously, we had produced guinea pig polyclonal antibodies to rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (22Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10710-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are effective for immunoprecipitation but not for Western analysis. These were available as a purified IgG fraction. Serum containing guinea pig polyclonal antibodies to rabbit muscle glycogenin (23Skurat A.V. Lim S.-S. Roach P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), also produced in this laboratory, are effective for both immunoprecipitation and Western hybridization. Serum containing polyclonal antibodies to rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase produced in chicken was kindly provided by John C. Lawrence Jr., University of Virginia. It was used for Western analysis of glycogen synthase at 1:4000 dilution. For the Western analysis of rat liver samples, liver from fed rats was homogenized in cold buffer (0.25m sucrose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant from this low speed spin was centrifuged at 8500 × gfor 10 min. Protein taken from the pellet fraction was used for Western analysis. Supernatants from extracts of H4IIEC3 cells were obtained as described above and incubated with 60 μg/ml α-amylase for 30 min at 30 °C. Antisera to glycogenin-2 was added to 1 ml of supernatant (1.2 mg of protein/ml) at 1:200 dilution; for the anti-glycogen synthase IgG, 2 μg of antibody was added. Cell extracts were incubated on ice for 1 h before addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). The samples were then incubated for another 1 h on a nutator at 4 °C, followed by two washes, first with 1 ml of buffer containing 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.3 mNaCl and then with 1 ml of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 m NaCl. After the second wash, the pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 37.9 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. Confluent monolayers of H4IIEC3 cells, grown in forty 100-mm plates, were rinsed twice in 6 ml of buffer B (containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, lysed cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant (containing a total of 210 mg protein) was adjusted with MnCl2 and CaCl2to final concentrations of 3 mm. The protein was loaded onto a column (5 ml) of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with buffer C (containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreiotol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm MnCl2, and 3 mm CaCl2). The column was washed with buffer D (buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl) and was then eluted with a linear gradient of glucose formed of 50 ml of buffer D and 50 ml of buffer D plus 1 m glucose. Fractions of 2 ml were collected. Protein was quantitated by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glycogen was measured as described by Skurat et al. (25Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE followed the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) as described previously (21Mu J. Cheng C. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26554-26560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recombinant glycogenin-1, with an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag, was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (9Cao Y. Steinrauf L.K. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Searches of expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases with the muscle glycogenin sequence revealed numerous entries with identical or almost identical sequences. In addition, there were two matching EST sequences that were similar, but not identical, to that of muscle glycogenin. These cDNAs, which were derived from human brain (accession numbersH04789/H04891) and breast (accession numbers R71874/R71875) libraries, were sequenced in their entirety (see Fig.1). The two clones shared a region of identity but contained 3′ regions that differed completely from one another. Both were partial clones. Using the brain clone as a probe, we screened a human brain cDNA library and identified four related cDNAs, none of which was full-length (Fig. 1). Two clones were identical. We also screened a human liver cDNA library and isolated four apparently full-length cDNAs. Two of the four liver cDNAs were identical, leaving three independent clones that differed at their 5′-ends (Fig. 1). Despite their multiplicity, all of the cDNAs appear to be derived from a single gene since there were common segments of absolute sequence identity. We propose to name the corresponding protein glycogenin-2 because, as described below, it has properties consistent with its serving a similar function to the known glycogenin. Muscle glycogenin can be termed glycogenin-1 where needed for clarity. After skeletal muscle, liver is the major repository of glycogen in the body, and so most effort was applied to analyzing clones from this source. The three independent cDNAs analyzed each had long open reading frames and differed in regions immediately following the start codon; they are named glycogenin-2α (accession number U94362), glycogenin-2β, (accession number U94363), and glycogenin-2γ (accession number U94364). Glycogenin-2α (501 amino acids) has an insertion of 40 residues compared with glycogenin-2γ, whereas glycogenin-2β has an insert of 9 residues that aligns with the extreme NH2 terminus of glycogenin-1. This 9-amino acid insert in glycogenin-2β is also present in glycogenin-2α. It seems most likely that the three different forms are generated by alternative splicing. Where they overlap, the three liver cDNAs have identical sequences except in three locations. First, the cDNA encoding glycogenin-2γ has a region of 5′-sequence that does not match glycogenin-2α or glycogenin-2β. The region of sequence dissimilarity ends with an EcoRI site and is probably due to an artifact during library construction. Second, glycogenin-2α and γ share a codon insertion with respect to glycogenin-2β. A possible explanation for this difference is the existence of different alleles. Finally, glycogenin-2α has a G → T substitution in the 3′ noncoding sequence. The liver glycogenin-2 isoforms α, β, and γ have predicted M r of 55,150, 51,841, and 50,995 with predicted pI values of 4.75, 4.72, and 4.76, respectively. Overall, the proteins would have 42–45% amino acid identity to muscle glycogenin (Fig. 2). However, there is 72% identity over an NH2-terminal region of about 200 amino acids thought to be involved in catalysis (6Roach P.J. Skurat P.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 289-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other partial cDNAs potentially define as many as four more isoforms of glycogenin-2. H04789/H04891 and brain clone 9–1 (accession number U94360) have identical sequences where they overlap and would predict a protein with an internal deletion of 71 COOH-terminal residues with respect to liver glycogenin-2α. We designate this isoform glycogenin-2δ. Brain clones 4–1 and 9–2 are identical (accession number U94361) and similarly code for a protein with a deletion in the COOH terminus with respect to glycogenin-2α, but in this case the deletion is only 36 residues. This form is termed glycogenin-2ζ. Brain clone 2–1 (accession number U94359) has two internal EcoRI sites, and the two EcoRI fragments at the 5′-end are most likely due to artifacts during library construction. The 3′ EcoRI fragment has a region of sequence matching the 3′ regions of the liver glycogenin-2 messages except for a 13-base insertion in the noncoding sequence. However, preceding this segment of identity is a sequence not present in any of the other clones and which does not have an open reading frame. We are therefore doubtful as to the legitimacy of this clone. Finally, the breast clone would encode a partial protein sequence consistent with that, for example, predicted by the liver clones except that the sequence is truncated by a stop codon introduced by a single base change. This form is designated glycogenin-2ε. The full significance of the various partial glycogenin-2 cDNAs will require further study. The tissue distribution of glycogenin-2 expression was analyzed by Northern blotting of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from several different tissues. Using three different probes derived from the original brain (H04789/H04891) and breast (R71874/R71875) clones (see “Experimental Procedures”), we obtained essentially the same results. A single hybridizing signal corresponding to a size of 3.6 kb was detected, with the strongest signal for liver RNA (Fig.3). The band was broad enough, however, that we would not have distinguished the small differences in size predicted by the cDNAs for glycogenin-2α, β, and γ. A species of similar size was clearly visible with heart and, more weakly, with pancreas. The longest liver cDNA was 3.2 kb, suggesting that we lack little of the mRNA sequence. Indeed, if the 3′ of the brainH04789/H04891 clone, which does extend to a poly(A) tail, is shared by the glycogenin-2α clone, we can account for 3.4 kb of the message. To test whether glycogenin-2 has properties expected of a self-glucosylating initiator protein, we expressed it in bacterial and mammalian cells. The glycogenin-2α coding sequence was inserted into a pET vector so that it would be produced in E. coli as a fusion protein with an NH2-terminal polyhistidine tag. The protein was expressed in E. coli and purification by Ni2+-agarose chromatography yielded a major species of apparentM r 66,000, compared with a predictedM r of 57,329 for the His6-tagged protein (Fig. 4 A). The reason for this aberrant electrophoretic mobility is not known, but it is probably not due to glucosylation since it was not significantly affected by α-amylase. Some smaller protein species were present and these probably represent proteolytic degradation products. After incubation with UDP-[U-14C]glucose, glycogenin-2α incorporated radioactive label indicating that it was capable of self-glucosylatio"
https://openalex.org/W2066326124,"Multiple tissue-specific, DNase-hypersensitive sites are correlated with known or potential regulatory regions of the human keratin 18 (K18) gene. One of these sites is found within exon 6, close to a potential AP-1 binding site. Footprint analysis confirmed that this site is capable of binding c-Jun and c-Fos in vitro. However, exon 6 can stimulate expression of a reporter gene driven by the K18 proximal promoter independent of AP-1 in F9 cells and additionally modulates AP-1 responsiveness when in combination with an intron enhancer. Analysis in transgenic mice and by transient transfections of mutant forms of the K18 gene showed that exon 6 contributes to the expression of the K18 gene. However, substitution of part of exon 6 with the corresponding part of the keratin 19 gene which lacks an AP-1 site decreased but did not destroy the regulatory activity of the exon. Furthermore, this mutation did not alter either the tissue specificity or the position-independent and copy number-dependent behavior of the K18 gene. In contrast, a frameshift mutation within exon 6 dramatically decreased the expression of the gene. K18 RNA expression from the frameshift mutation was less than 10% of the wild type K18 transgene. This decline in expression was the result of a combination of decreased stability of mutant K18 RNA and the creation of a negative regulatory element that can interact with the first intron regulatory elements and actively suppress K18 expression. These results demonstrate that a protein-coding portion of the K18 gene also has a regulatory function.

These results demonstrate that a protein-coding portion of the K18 gene also has a regulatory function. The transcriptional regulatory elements of eukaryotic genes are located both upstream and downstream of the transcription initiation site. Downstream regulatory elements for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are found within both coding and noncoding proximal exons and further downstream within introns or within the region 3′ of the last exon. However, examples of regulatory elements found within distal coding exons of mammalian genes are much less common. Here, we investigate a potential regulatory element located within exon 6 of the keratin 18 (K18) 1The abbreviations used are: K18, K19, and K8, keratin 18, 19, and 8, respectively; bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl- transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: K18, K19, and K8, keratin 18, 19, and 8, respectively; bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl- transferase. gene. The K18 gene contains seven exons that code for a type I intermediate filament protein that is normally coexpressed with its heteropolymeric partner, keratin 8 (K8), in a variety of internal, single-layered epithelial tissues such as liver, kidney, and intestine. K18 and K8 expression generally persists in cancers that arise from these tissues (1Oshima R.G. Baribault H. Caulin C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 445-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A 10-kilobase genomic fragment containing the K18 gene has all of the genetic information necessary for position-independent, copy number-dependent, and tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice (2Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). K18 expression is regulated in part by proximal promoter elements, including multiple SP-1 sites and a TATA box, three negative regulatory elements within the first intron, and a complex 100-bp enhancer element also within the first intron (3Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an analysis of DNase I-hypersensitive regions of the gene in transgenic mouse tissues indicates that a potential regulatory element appears to reside within exon 6, the penultimate exon of the gene (5Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Deletion of this region of the gene decreased transient expression of transfected constructions, and reintroduction of exon 6 into the gene or the cDNA restored expression levels. We have now characterized this element further and have evaluated its importance in vivo. An element within exon 6 binds AP-1 components (c-Jun and c-Fos) and interacts with the first intron enhancer to promote AP-1 responsiveness. Transgenic mice generated from a mutant K18 gene containing a 33-bp substitution of exon 6 with the corresponding region of keratin 19 (K18/19), without an AP-1 site, express significantly less RNA in adult liver and intestine. In addition, we have compared this chimeric K18/19 gene to a related construction that alters the reading frame of K18 in exon 6 to generate a premature termination codon but does not change the AP-1 site. The alterations within the K18/19 gene and the exon 6 frameshift result in decreased expression in transgenic mice by different mechanisms. The frameshift mutation leads to an increased rate of RNA turnover and little RNA accumulation, whereas the alteration of exon 6, which eliminates the AP-1 site, does not change the stability of the mRNA. In addition, the frameshift mutation interferes with the activity of the intron enhancer. These results show that regulatory elements within a distal coding exon of K18 cooperate with the first intron enhancer to facilitate optimal expression of the gene but are not essential for either integration site-independent or copy number-dependent expression. In the K18/19 gene, 33 bp of exon 6 were replaced with the corresponding coding sequence of the K19 cDNA by introducing a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide between the BamHI and SmaI sites of exon 6 in a fragment of the whole K18 gene. Subsequently, the wild type K18 gene fragment was replaced by a fragment defined by a uniqueBstEII site in exon 5 and a KpnI site in exon 7. To generate the K18-Bam gene, the BamHI site in exon 6 was digested and filled with the use of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. This 4-bp insertion altered the reading frame. The resulting plasmid contained the ClaI site at the place of BamHI site and the termination codon TGA 18 bp downstream of the ClaI site in exon 6 (Fig.1). The XKCAT, XKCATIS, and XKCATE100 constructions for CAT assay have been described previously (4Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Exon 6 and its K18/19 and BamHI modifications were made by polymerase chain reaction amplifications from the corresponding plasmids with primers containing SalI sites. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned into theXhoI sites of XKCAT, XKCATIS, and XKCATE100 plasmids upstream of the K18 gene promoter. Transgenic mice were prepared by standard procedures as described previously (2Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Thorey I.S. Meneses J.

The HindIII fragments of K18/19 and K18-Bam constructions were used for microinjections. The transgenic animals were identified by dot-blot hybridization of tail DNA with a K18 cDNA hybridization probe. K18-Bam founder mice were generated in C57Bl6 × SJL F2 hybrid mice by the DNX corporation (Princeton, NJ) under a contract from the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development Mouse Development Facility. Subsequent breeding of the founder mice was performed with C57Bl6 mice. K18/19 mice were generated by The Burnham Institute Transgenic Mouse Service in the FVB/N strain of mice. F9 and HR9 cells were transfected as described (3Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J.

CAT constructs were cotransfected with LK444-Lac vector representing the human β-actin promoter driving the β-galactosidase gene for normalization of transfection efficiency. Because the LK444-Lac vector is responsive to AP-1 activity but not to Ets2 activity (data not shown), normalization was performed only within the set of transfected cells receiving the same transactivators. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (3Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Pankov R.

Transgene copy number was determined by dot-blot or by Southern blot hybridization with a K18 probe followed by quantitation in an Ambis radioactivity image analyzer. Signals were normalized for each tissue by hybridizing the stripped filter with a mouse L32 ribosomal protein cDNA hybridization probe. The estimation of copy number of the transgene was done as described previously (7Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2214-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RNA was purified from dissected mouse tissues using guanidine isothiocyanate and ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride (10Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). The levels of K18 RNA were determined by RNase protection assay using an SP6 RNA polymerase [32P]UTP-labeled antisense transcript of the 431-bp fragment of the K18 gene, overlapping the RNA start site and part of the first exon (5Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The neo RNA was detected with an SP6 RNA polymerase antisense transcript of the 245-bp fragment of the neo gene (5Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). L32 ribosomal gene RNA was measured simultaneously. A 147-bp fragment of the L32-4A gene (nucleotides 103–250) (11Dudov K.P. Perry R.P. Cell. 1984; 37: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites and cloned into pGEM1. Digestion with EcoRI and transcription by SP6 polymerase yielded a 187-nucleotide probe. The protected K18 signal was normalized to the signal obtained from the endogenous mouse L32 RNA or the cotransfected neo RNA. The specific radioactivity of the L32 riboprobe was adjusted to 10 times less than that of the K18 riboprobe. Footprint analysis with purified c-Fos and c-Jun was performed as described previously for the K18 intron enhancer (4Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Exon 6 was amplified using oligonucleotides with external XbaI sites, matching the K18 gene at K18 nucleotide 5525 and ending with nucleotide 5748. The amplified XbaI fragment was cloned into pUC19. The fragment was end labeled and excised using the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the polylinker. The gel-purified probe was incubated with bovine serum albumin, purified c-Jun and c-Fos, or the Ets2 DNA binding domain in 50 μl containing 10% glycerol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma). After digestion with the indicated concentrations of DNase I, the products were displayed on a sequencing gel and were detected by autoradiography. Recombinant c-Jun and c-Fos were gifts from Dr. T. Deng (University of Florida, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). The DNA binding domain of Ets2 was used as described previously (1Oshima R.G. Baribault H. Caulin C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 445-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell.

This recombinant protein binds consensus Ets binding sites and functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of Ets2 transactivation (12Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J.J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J.

HR9 parietal endodermal cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of the pMC1NeoA plasmid and 15 μg of the K18 (pGC1853) (13Kulesh D.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Kulesh D.A. Oshima R.G. Genomics. 1989; 4: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), K18/19, or the K18-Bam plasmids. After overnight incubation with the plasmid precipitates, the cells were washed and incubated in complete culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum) and 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. RNA was extracted at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after exposure to the drug using the acidic phenol method (15Chomcznski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase to remove residual plasmid DNAs (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14Google Scholar) and was analyzed by RNase protection assay for the neo and K18 RNAs simultaneously. Exon 6 of the K18 gene contains potential AP-1 and Ets binding sites (Fig. 1). To assess whether these sites are capable of binding AP-1 or Ets proteins, the region was subjected to DNase I footprinting in the presence of either purified c-Fos and c-Jun or recombinant Ets2 DNA binding domain. Purified AP-1 components recognized the putative AP-1 site and resulted in a clear footprint over the suspected element (Fig.2, lanes 4 and 5). No evidence for Ets2 binding to the region was evident, even though a potential Ets binding site is found just upstream of the AP-1 site (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). The same conditions resulted in a clear footprint of the Ets site in the first intron enhancer (9Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence have previously implicated the sixth exon of the K18 gene in transcriptional regulation. First, a DNase-hypersensitive site is found associated with the exon in transgenic tissues that express K18 (5Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Second, an HpaII restriction enzyme site within the exon is less methylated in tissues that express the gene (5Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Third, deletion of portions of exon 6 and 7 from the K18 gene reduces the level of K18 RNA expressed in transfected cells, and reintroduction of exon 6 rescues the deficiency (5Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism and biological role of exon 6 in further detail, we have assayed the regulatory activity of the exon removed from the context of the K18 gene. Fragments corresponding to exon 6 sequences of the K18 gene, a 33-bp substitution of K18 exon 6 with the homologous coding sequence of K19 (K18/19) which lacks the AP-1 site or a 4-bp frameshifting insertion in exon 6 (K18-Bam) (Fig. 1), were inserted into a CAT vector driven by the 250-bp proximal promoter of the K18 gene (XKCAT). In addition, the fragments were tested in the presence of either the K18 first intron (XKCATIS) or with a 100-bp fragment of the first intron, corresponding to the approximate minimal enhancer (XKCATE100) (Fig.3 A). The vectors were transfected into either F9 embryonal carcinoma cells that have low AP-1 activity or into HR9 parietal endodermal cells that express mouse K18 and have substantial AP-1 activity. In addition, an expression vector for c-Fos was cotransfected with the vectors in F9 cells to test the response of the constructs to elevated AP-1 activity. c-Fos has been shown previously to be the most potent AP-1 activator of the K18 gene in F9 cells (3Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Campbell C.E. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 774-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Muller R. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1984; 311: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 3, B,C, and D. The expression of the XKCAT proximal promoter constructs in F9 cells was weak, but the presence of exon 6 or the K18/19 modification of this exon increased expression 3–5-fold (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). The coexpression of c-Fos did not stimulate the expression of any of these constructs. The addition of the first intron or the Ets/AP-1 oncogene response element resulted in increased activity and significant induction when c-Fos was coexpressed as shown previously (3Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 C, lanes 2, 3, 6, and7). The smaller 100-bp enhancer element (XKCATE100) increased activity further in F9 cells, as reported previously. The differences in activity of XKCATIS (Fig. 3 C, lane 1) and XKCATE100 (Fig. 3 C, lane 5) are caused by the presence of three negative regulatory elements in the larger intron sequence which are active in F9 cells but not HR9 cells (9Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The K18/19 modification of exon 6 did not stimulate either the basal activity or the Fos-induced activity as effectively as the wild type exon. This suggests that the AP-1 site found in the wild type K18 exon 6, but not in the K18/19 exon 6, contributes modestly to the transcriptional stimulatory activity of exon 6 but is not the only positive regulatory element. We have shown previously that mutation of the AP-1 binding site within the intron enhancer of the K18 gene abolishes the response to coexpressed AP-1 in transfection experiments (9Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Exon 6 stimulates the K18 proximal promoter activity independent of AP-1 but also modulates the AP-1 responsiveness of the intron enhancer. In contrast to the wild type exon 6, the K18-Bam alteration, which inserts 4 bp into the exon, abolished the stimulatory activity of exon 6 both in the absence (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) and presence of the larger intron fragment (Fig. 3 C, lane 4) and the smaller 100-bp intron enhancer (Fig.3 C, lane 8). In contrast to F9 cells, the addition of the exon 6 fragments did not augment activity of either construct in differentiated HR9 cells (Fig.3 D, lanes 2, 3, 6, and7). This result is consistent with previous results that showed that the AP-1-dependent enhancer coded for by the 100-bp intron 1 fragment was fully active in HR9 cells, presumably because AP-1 components were not limiting these reporter constructions. No difference is observed between XKCATIS and XKCATE100 in HR9 cells because the three silencer elements found in the larger intron fragment are not active in differentiated cells (9Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in HR9 parietal endodermal cells, the construct containing exon 6 from the K18-Bam gene, in combination with the longer intron fragment, repeatedly resulted in much less activity (Fig. 3 D, lane 4). This negative regulatory activity was dependent on the presence of the intron sequences containing the three negative regulatory elements because exon 6 of K18-Bam did not influence the activity of the XKCATE100 vector in HR9 cells (Fig. 3, panel D, lane 8, and panel C, lane 8). This negative activity of exon 6 containing the BamHI mutation is unusual because it requires an intron fragment that contains elements that were thought to be active only in undifferentiated F9 cells but not in HR9 cells. The combination of the longer intron fragment and the mutant exon 6 now appears inhibitory in differentiated HR9 cells. Because the AP-1 site within exon 6 appeared to interact with other regulatory elements of the K18 gene, the importance of exon 6 was evaluated within the context of the whole gene. Immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected HR9 cells indicated that the chimeric K18/19 gene was capable of generating K18/19 RNA and protein that were incorporated into the endogenous keratin intermediate filament network (data not shown). The transcriptional response of this construct was assessed by transfection into F9 cells with or without coexpressed c-Jun, c-Fos, and Ets2. To standardize for differences in transfection efficiency, the pMC1NeoA plasmid coding for the neo gene was cotransfected with each plasmid mixture, and simultaneous assessment of the neo RNA was measured in the RNase protection analysis. The results are shown in Fig.4 A, and normalized data are shown in Fig. 4 B. In F9 cells, the K18 gene is expressed at a low level (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 1; panel B, lane A). Coexpression of c-Jun stimulates expression of the gene only modestly (Fig. 4 B, lane B). However, coexpression of c-Fos is much more potent (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 3; panel B, lane C). Similar to c-Jun, Ets2 activates the K18 gene only modestly by itself. However, coexpression of Ets2 with either c-Jun or c-Fos increases expression (Fig. 4, panel A, lanes 5 and6; panel B, lanes E and F). Maximal stimulation is seen when all three factors are expressed simultaneously (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 7;panel B, lane G). In contrast to the wild type K18 gene, the K18/19 construct was poorly activated by c-Fos (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 10;panel B, lane C), consistent with the results of the CAT constructions. In addition, the response to Ets2 and the combination of Ets2 and AP-1 components was greatly reduced for the K18/19 gene. When supplemented with all three transcription factors, the activity of the K18/19 gene was moderately reduced (Fig. 4,panel A, lane 14; panel B, lane G). Because the primary Ets-responsive element of the K18 gene is within the first intron enhancer element and Ets2 does not bind directly to exon 6 sequences, these results indicate an interaction between the regulatory elements of exon 6 and the first intron, resulting in effects that are dependent upon the particular AP-1 and Ets component expressed. The maximum level of expression of the K18/19 gene in F9 cells when supplemented with Ets2, c-Fos, and c-Jun is about 58% of the wild type gene. Thus it appears that regulatory elements found within exon 6, including the AP-1 site, act to modulate transcriptional activity of the K18 gene in transfected cultured cells. To evaluate the importance of exon 6 elements in vivo, transgenic mice were generated with the K18/19 and K18-Bam genes. Standard pronuclear injection of fertilized mouse embryos resulted in four lines of each type of mouse (Table I). Southern blot analysis was performed to ensure that all of the transgenic lines contained the mutant K18 genes and to confirm the normal head-to-tail tandem organization predominantly found in transgenic mice. All lines contained the K18/19 gene in tandem array as assessed by Southern blot patterns using restriction enzyme, which cut the transgene only once with no apparent rearrangements (data not shown). Quantitative dot-blot analysis was performed as described previously to estimate the total number of integrated genes (Table I).Table IRNA expression by transgenic miceLineCopy no.OrganK18 RNA pgRNA/geneAvg.

RNA values are represented as pg of K18 RNA/10 μg of total RNA. Four transgenic mouse lines were also established from the K18-Bam construction (Fig. 1), which contains a 4-bp insertion in exon 6 and subsequently generates a frameshift terminating five codons downstream of the original K18 reading frame. This mutation was created in an attempt to generate mice expressing a dominant acting mutant form of K18, capable of disrupting K8/K18 intermediate filament structure. A very similar truncated K18 protein was characterized previously after expression of the truncated form of the cDNA from a human β-actin promoter (20Kulesh D.A. Ceceña G. Darmon Y.M. Vasseur M. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the results of Southern blot analysis for the K18-Bam gene of three lines, in which the normal BamHI site is destroyed, and a diagnosticClaI site results from the manipulations of the position of the BamHI site. Separate analysis of the fourth line confirmed the same pattern (data not shown). Dot-blot analysis of tail DNAs and Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA from these animals confirmed a normal head-to-tail integration pattern and 13–40 copies of the K18-Bam gene inserted (Table I). K18 RNA expression in several organs of the K18/19 and K18-Bam mice was measured by RNase protection assay. Fig.6 A shows one result, comparing the levels of expression of the different lines in intestine, kidney, and liver. The levels of K18 RNA were compared with synthetic standard K18 mRNA, in this and other assays, to estimate the level of expression. RNAs from K18-Bam mice were analyzed similarly (Fig.6 B). Table I shows the values for representative mice of all lines, and a summary of data for each line is shown in Fig.7.Figure 7Summary of the expression level of K18/19 and K18-Bam transgenic mice.

Biochemical characterization of two such mutants, G680V and G691C, has allowed us to identify separate facets of myosin motor function perturbed by each alteration. Compared with wild type, the G680V myosin exhibits a substantially enhanced affinity for several nucleotides, decreased ATPase activity, and overoccupancy or creation of a novel strongly actin-binding state. The properties of the novel strong binding state are consistent with a partial arrest or pausing at the onset of the mechanical stroke. The G691C mutant, on the other hand, exhibits an elevated basal ATPase indicative of premature phosphate release. By releasing phosphate without a requirement for actin binding, the G691C can bypass the part of the cycle involving the mechanical stroke. The two mutants, despite having alterations in glycine residues separated by only 11 residues, have dramatically different consequences on the mechanochemical cycle.

The study of the family of molecular motors recently has been invigorated by the availability of crystal structures of both the myosin (1Rayment I. Holden H.M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This information, combined with a wealth of biochemical characterization of these motors, provides a platform on which to build a complete understanding of the mechanics of these pivotal cellular components. In a complementary approach, we have been generating conditionally functional (cold-sensitive) mutants of myosin II in the Dictyosteliumsystem (8Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1995; 140: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1996; 143: 801-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our isolation of cold-sensitive myosin mutants, we uncovered two mutations in a biochemically renowned region of the protein, a helical element that houses two highly reactive cysteines in rabbit myosin. This region of myosin was first characterized because of the chemical accessibility of two cysteines contained within it (positions 697 (SH2) and 707 (SH1) in rabbit myosin). The crystal structure of chicken pectoralis muscle S1 displays these cysteines in a bent α-helix, separated from one another by 18 Å and facing opposite sides of the molecule (2Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However, cross-linking experiments using rabbit skeletal muscle myosin demonstrate that during the stroking cycle, the two approach more closely than in the absence of nucleotide (10Burke M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5559-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and can be directly joined by a disulfide linkage, indicative of a separation of only about 3 Å and a substantially altered geometry (11Huston H.E. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8945-8952Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The conformational changes are not purely local, in that either cysteine can cross-link with residues in other parts of the structure (for example, SH1-Cys522, and SH2-Cys540 in rabbit (12Ue K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1889-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Chaussepied P. Morales M.F. Kassab R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) during the cycle. Chemical modification studies have demonstrated that addition of bulky hydrophobic groups to the cysteines dramatically changes the properties of the myosin molecule, particularly with regard to the promiscuity and activity of its ATPase. The physiological substrate of myosin is Mg2+-ATP which supports only low-level ATPase activity in the absence of actin. However, if provided with Ca2+-ATP or K+-ATP, rabbit myosin shows dramatically enhanced ATPase activity in the absence of actin. Modification of either thiol further activates the calcium ATPase, while preventing the potassium ATPase (14Seidel J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 180: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cross-linking the reactive thiols using a variety of linking agents results in a molecule lacking measurable ATPase activity and holding a “trapped” nucleotide in its catalytic site. Thus the “thiol region” of the molecule is not only mobile, it markedly influences events at the active site. In Dictyostelium myosin II, one of the thiol positions (SH1) is occupied by a threonine residue (Thr688). Nonetheless sequence conservation in this region allows unambiguous alignment of the myosin sequences from chicken and rabbit muscle withDictyostelium myosin II (Fig.1). The bend in the helix in which the two cysteines lie occurs at an absolutely conserved glycine residue, and the C terminus of the helix is demarcated by a second absolutely conserved glycine residue. We recovered alterations at both the bend glycine (position Gly680 in Dictyostelium myosin II) and the C-terminal glycine (position Gly691 inDictyostelium) in a screen for cold-sensitive myosin mutants arising from random mutagenesis (8Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1995; 140: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1996; 143: 801-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of these glycines by bulkier residues has previously been suggested by Huston et al. (11Huston H.E. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8945-8952Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cold-sensitivity resulting from alteration of either of these glycines suggests the exciting possibility that these mutations block transitions between conformations occurring during the motor cycle, trapping these conformations in the absence of sufficient thermal energy. We have undertaken a thorough biochemical characterization of these mutants, as well as limited characterization of glycine-to-alanine changes at each position, to uncover information about the conformations and roles of this region in the cycle. One of the mutations at a position corresponding to Gly680(Gly699 in the rat skeletal muscle myosin used for the study) has also been characterized by Kinose et al. (15Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; ($$): 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) through site-directed mutagenesis (15Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; ($$): 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Their analysis of motility and actin-activated ATPase led them to focus on alterations of product release properties of the motor. Our findings suggest that this is indeed one facet of the aberrant behaviors of Gly680alterations, although we also find perturbation of nucleotide binding and Ca2+-ATPase and extension of a novel strong binding state. Finally, our characterization of position Gly691alterations leads us to conclude that alteration of this position causes dramatically different defects from those at position 680, primarily resulting in markedly facilitated Pi release under a variety of conditions. ATP and ADP (disodium salt, approximately 99% pure according to the manufacturer) were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. ATPγS 1The abbreviation used is: ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). (tetralithium salt, >85% pure according to the manufacturer) was purchased from CalBiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Preparation of full-length myosins was performed as described (16Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, Dictyostelium cytoskeletons were prepared by mechanical lysis in an EDTA-containing low-salt buffer, followed by extraction of myosin with a MgATP-containing high-salt buffer. This was followed by two rounds of salt-dependent assembly-disassembly of myosin filaments accompanied by low-speed spins to remove contaminating material or to recover myosin filaments, as appropriate. The purified proteins were treated withDictyostelium myosin light chain kinase as described previously (17Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin S1 was synthesized from a truncated myosin gene, encoding the normal or mutantDictyostelium sequence up to amino acid Val865, which was followed by sequences encoding Pro-His-His-His-His-His-His-STOP. This myosin S1 was prepared by a modification of the procedure of Manstein et al. (18Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 million cells were recovered from surfaces and washed in 15 ml of ice-cold Bonner's solution (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2), followed by addition of 20 mm NaN3 for 10 min. Cells were washed with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.04% NaN3, and resuspended in 300 μl of wash buffer containing 5 units of alkaline phosphatase, and protease inhibitor mixtures I and II. protease inhibitor mixture I (100 ×) contained 200 mm N-carboberzoxy-Pro-Ala, 10 mg/mlN-α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 8 mg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl cloromethyl ketone, 0.2 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1.5 mg/ml leupeptin. Protease inhibitor II (1000 ×) contained 150 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by adding 300 μl of wash buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixtures I and II, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cytoskeletons were spun down in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed once with 500 μl of wash buffer plus (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Cytoskeletons were resuspended in 50 μl of wash buffer plus, and then mixed with 50 μl of wash buffer plus containing 20 mm magnesium ATP (pH adjusted to 7.5) and 0.4 m KCl. After incubating on ice for 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 125,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of Qiagen Ni-NTA resin and incubated in a cold room under rotation for 45 min. After incubation, the resin was washed once with 0.5 ml of Ni-wash buffer (30 mmimidazole, pH 8.0 at 4 °C, 5 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm ATP and 0.2 m KCl, and twice with 0.5 ml of Ni-wash buffer. TheDictyostelium myosin S1 was eluted in 20 μl of 200 mm imidazole buffer (pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min in a cold room under rotation. The elution was repeated once. G-actin was isolated from an acetone powder of chicken breast muscle by the method described by Spudich and Watt (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for rabbit muscle and frozen at −80 °C until the day of use. F-actin was prepared by polymerization of G-actin by adding 0.2m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP. F-actin was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 75 mm KCl. Basal, actin-activated, and high-salt Ca2+-ATPase activities were measured as described by Ruppel and Spudich (16Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Essentially, ATPase activity was measured by liberation of radioactive Pi from [γ-32P]ATP by a modification of the method of Clarke and Spudich (20Clarke M. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In vitro movement assays were performed by observation of fluorescently labeled actin filaments over nitrocellulose surfaces coated with myosin as described by Uyedaet al. (21Uyeda T.Q.P. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). F-actin (2–3 μm), S1 (0.05–0.1 μm), and nucleotides (ATP, ADP, ATP(s), etc.) in a 200 μl of total volume were mixed well and incubated at 13, 20, or 26 °C for 15 min. Samples were then quickly transferred into preincubated tubes and immediately spun in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge at 130,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatants were discarded. Pellets were resuspended in the Wash Buffer Plus and run on a SDS-PAGE gel. The myosin S1 bands were stained by Coomassie Blue and scanned on a transmissive scanner. Quantification of relative S1 amount in the different bands on the same gel was done by the NIH Image software. K d values were calculated by plotting the data points according to the Michaelis-Menten equation.. All mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis of M13.Myo.Cend using oligonucleotides 680.mute (5′-TTGCAATG(C/T)TGTCCTCG), 691A.mute (TCGTAAAGCTTTCCCAA), and 691C.mute (TCGTAAATGTTTCCCAA). Double-stranded phage DNA was prepared and theBglII-NcoI fragment containing the mutations was used to replace the BglII-NcoI fragment of pBIG.Myo.SXX.ΔMsc. This vector contains engineeredSalI, XhoI, and XbaI restriction sites at positions 418, 1248, and 1521 in the coding sequence, respectively, and contains a deletion of DNA between MscI sites at 1925 and 2422 allowing recognition of inserted mutant DNA. S1-His6 constructs were generated by subcloning the sameBglII-NcoI fragment into pTIKL.ΔMscI.His6 using a similar strategy. pTIKL.ΔMscI.His6 was created by replacing theBglII-NcoI fragment of pTIKL-S1.His 2T. Q.-P. Uyeda, unpublished data. with theBglII-NcoI fragment of pBIG.Myo.SXX.ΔMsc described above. We first sought to reproduce in vitro the observed in vivo failures of the G680V and G691C myosins by characterizing their ability to support actin filament sliding in vitro. Under standard conditions, both mutants supported poor movement (Fig. 2), consistent with their myosin-deficient phenotypes in vivo. Filament sliding is on the order of 10% the wild type rate for each mutant. To ascertain whether either of the mutants could have a braking effect on motility supported by wild-type myosin, we performed mixing experiments in which the normal amount of wild type filaments were first mixed with 10% of their number of mutant filaments. The mixture was then applied to the coverslip and assayed under standard conditions. The mutants demonstrated dramatically different properties: while the mixture containing 10% G691C myosin moved similarly to a pure wild-type population, the mixture containing 10% G680V strongly resembled a pure mutant population. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the G680V mutant has created or elongated a strongly bound state, such that a minority population of mutant molecules can restrict movements generated by wild type myosin acting on the same filament. The G691C mutant, on the other hand, did not demonstrate any deleterious effect on wild type motility, suggesting that it does not over-occupy a strongly bound state. We next characterized the ATPase activities of each mutant. We examined: 1) basal Mg2+-ATPase, which measures hydrolysis of ATP in the absence of activation by actin (note that the rate-limiting step in this process for wild-type myosins is actually Pi release rather than hydrolysis per se); 2) actin-activated ATPase; and 3) high-salt Ca2+-ATPase, a non-physiological activity that entails bypass of the actin requirement for product release. For most myosin IIs, including Dictyostelium's, the latter ATPase has a rate comparable to the actin-activated ATPase. For these studies, we employed full-length myosins, and characterized not only the G680V and G691C myosins, but also structurally milder mutations at each position created by site-directed mutagenesis. The milder forms were G680A and G691A, created on the rationale that the small, non-hydrophobic alanine would be a more acceptable substitute for glycine than cysteine or valine. Each assay was performed at 13, 21, and 30 °C to determine if we could correlate any in vitro properties with thein vivo cold-sensitivity of the mutants as assessed by the azide assay (9Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1996; 143: 801-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most marked alteration caused by position 691 changes was in the basal ATPase results. While wild-type ATPase activity is just detectable in the assay, both G691A and G691C myosins have dramatically enhanced activity (Table I and Fig.3). This enhancement is present at all temperatures tested, and increases with increasing temperature. At each temperature, the ATPase rate of the G691C mutant is greater than the G691A mutant, in concordance with the relative severity of the two mutants in vivo 3B. Patterson, unpublished observations. and the anticipated structural alterations. Thus both position 691 mutants “unlock” the basal ATPase. Since this reaction is limited by product release, specifically release of Pi, we conclude that substitution of bulkier residues for Gly691 enhances the release or escape of inorganic phosphate in the absence of actin.Table IATPase activities of mutant and wild type myosinsATPases (mol Pi/min/mol myosin)TemperatureWTG680AG680VG691AG691CBasal13185.13.6404921ND1-aND, none detected.1659609730322619184257Actin-activated1313248474238212331134320515730414400197579588High-salt/Ca2+13181455.623625921326126185375093047215919653810ATPase activity for basal ATPase, actin-activated ATPase, and high-salt Ca2+-ATPase are shown for wild type and mutant myosins at 13, 21, and 30 °C.1-a ND, none detected. Open table in a new tab ATPase activity for basal ATPase, actin-activated ATPase, and high-salt Ca2+-ATPase are shown for wild type and mutant myosins at 13, 21, and 30 °C. Addition of actin to wild-type myosin measurably enhances its ATPase activity (Table I and Fig. 3) yielding a roughly 10-fold increase compared with basal ATPase at each temperature. The position 691 mutants actually have lower actin-activated ATPases than wild type at 13 and 21 °C, but each has greater actin-activated ATPase at 30 °C. Even more striking is the comparison of the actin-activated ATPase to the basal ATPase: at 13 °C both mutants show greater or equal ATPase activity in the absence of actin than in its presence (Table I); in other words, there is no evidence that actin plays a role in stimulating the ATPase. This situation is ameliorated at 21 °C: the G691A actin-activated ATPase is approximately 3-fold greater than its basal ATPase, while the G691C actin-activated ATPase reaches 1.5 times its basal level at the same temperature. Both mutants also show activation induced by actin at 30 °C: 3-fold for G691A and 2.2-fold for G691C. These data probably reveal the phenomenon underlying the cold-sensitivity of the mutants in vivo: obviation of the actin binding requirement for release of Pi at low temperatures. The Ca2+-ATPases for position 691 mutants are greater than wild-type, but this relative increase is not as dramatic as that observed for their basal ATPases. As with wild-type, the Ca2+-ATPases are higher than the actin-activated ATPases at each temperature, but a strict correlation cannot be drawn between the extent of the high-salt Ca2+-ATPases and the failures of the mutants in vivo. The G680A and G680V mutants behave very differently from those at position 691 (Table I and Fig. 3). If anything, the basal ATPases of these mutants are lower than those of wild-type. The actin-activated ATPases of the two mutants are notable: for G680A myosin, the 30 °C actin-activated ATPase is comparable to that of wild-type, whereas at 21 °C the value for G680A myosin is half that of wild-type, and at 13 °C it is substantially less than half. The basic pattern is similar for G680V myosin, but the deficiency is more pronounced: while at 30 °C the activity is roughly half that of wild-type, at 21 and 13 °C, the deficit is greater still: actin-activated ATPases are at 36 and 19% of wild-type levels, respectively. It is interesting to note, however, that the extent of activation conferred by addition of actin to the basal ATPase is as good orbetter for the two mutants in comparison to wild-type (i.e. the activity is stimulated ∼10-fold in each case). Finally, the high-salt Ca2+-ATPases reveal a striking difference between wild-type and position 680-altered mutants. While for wild-type, these conditions give rise to greater activity than actin-activation, for both position 680 mutants, this is not the case. While G680A myosin shows moderate ATPase activity in the presence of high-salt and Ca2+-ATP, that of G680V myosin is virtually undetectable at all three temperatures. This effect appears to be specifically due to a failure of Ca2+ to induce the ATPase, since addition of high-salt in amounts comparable to those found in the Ca2+ assay to the basal (Mg2+) ATPaseelevates this ATPase rather than inhibiting it. 4Y. Wu and B. Patterson, unpublished observations. Thus for the G680 mutants, we find a more stringent requirement for actin to complete the ATPase cycle and a failure to be induced by the biologically unlikely substrate Ca2+-ATP. To further delineate the biochemical deficiency underlying the inadequacies of the G680V mutant, we investigated the actin binding properties of the mutant expressed as an S1 (amino acids 1–865 followed by a proline and a 6-histidine tag) and characterized at the non-permissive temperature (13 °C) under a variety of conditions. The in vitro motility data (see above) suggested that G680V mutant myosin had an extended strongly bound state or a strengthened “weakly” bound state, giving rise to the “braking” of actin filament movement by wild-type myosin. We therefore investigated the possibility that the weakly bound state of the G680V mutant engaged in enhanced/strengthened binding, thus accounting for interference of G680V myosin with in vitromovement driven by wild type. We assayed the ability of G680V-S1 and wild-type S1 to co-sediment with actin in the presence of ATPγS. Since this analog is only slowly hydrolyzable by myosin (22Kuczmarski E.R. Palivos L. Aguado C. Yao Z. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it effectively arrests the motor at the pre-cleavage (ATP-bound) state. For wild type myosin, this state exhibits only weak affinity for actin. By performing the assay using a variety of concentrations of ATPγS, we indirectly assessed the affinity of mutant and wild-type S1s for ATPγS. As shown in Fig. 4, at 13 °C G680V myosin has dramatically higher apparent affinity for the nucleotide than wild type (roughly 25-fold), but displays the expected weak affinity for actin in the presence of nucleotide, as evidenced by its failure to co-sediment with actin in the assay. Complexes between G680V-S1 and ADP + BeF3 or G680V-S1 and ADP + AlF(x), which mimic the ATP-bound and mid-cleavage states of ATP, respectively (4Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), also release from actin filaments during co-sedimentation assays.4 We therefore concluded that the G680V mutation did not confer dramatically stronger binding to actin during weakly bound states. Characterization of steady-state binding of G680V-S1 to actin in the presence of ATP gave dramatically different results. Concentrations up to 1 mm ATP effected no more than 25% release of G680V-S1 from actin in the co-sedimentation assay. This was surprising, since the K m of Dictyostelium S1 for ATP is on the order of 100 μm as measured by actin-activated ATPase (17Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the strongly bound state of the cycle has been calculated to be on the order of 5% of the total, at least for rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II (21Uyeda T.Q.P. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). If this holds for Dictyostelium, in the presence of millimolar ATP we would expect the majority of S1 to be free. Indeed, this is the result we obtain with wild-type S1; at 300 μm ATP and 3 μm actin, only 25% co-sediments with actin (Fig. 5). Since we had determined that the affinity of ATPγS for the mutant wasgreater than that of wild-type, we reasoned that failure of the mutant S1 to bind ATP was unlikely to be the cause of the observed failure to release from actin. We confirmed this by demonstrating that the K m of the G680V-S1 for ATP as measured by actin-activated ATPase is approximately 120 μm, comparable to that of wild-type, for which we calculate aK m of 97 μm. 5B. Patterson and Y. Wu, unpublished data. Since the G680V-S1 bound ATP with high affinity and progressed through the cycle in the presence of actin (as evidenced by ATPase activity), we tested the hypothesis that the strong-binding defect of the mutant lay in an inability to release ADP at the end of the cycle,i.e. the mutant had an enhanced affinity for ADP. We investigated this possibility by taking advantage of the demonstrated affinity of G680V-S1 for ATPγS. Since ATPγS binds with high affinity and releases G680V-S1 from actin even at low salt, we assayed for the ability of ADP to compete for G680V-S1 heads as measured by actin binding in the presence of ATPγS. We determined the ratio of ADP/ATPγS at which half the G680V-S1 was bound to actin. This experiment was carried out in the presence of 100 μmATPγS, a concentration sufficient to almost quantitatively release G680V from actin filaments in the absence of ADP. As shown in Fig.6, ADP is able to compete successfully with ATPγS for the binding site of G680V at a ratio of 10:1, comparable to that of wild-type. Thus, since the relativeaffinities of the two molecules are similar to that of wild-type and the absolute affinity of ATPγS for G680V-S1 is 40-fold higher than it is for wild-type, we infer that the G680V mutant indeed has an enhanced affinity for ADP as well. We attempted to correlate this increased affinity for ADP with the exaggerated strong binding to actin shown by the mutant in the presence of ATP. We sought to take advantage of the greater salt-sensitivity of actin binding displayed by the rabbit skeletal muscle S1-ADP complex compared with nucleotide-free S1 (23Phan B.C. Faller L.D. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7712-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the actin binding behavior of G680V-S1 in the presence of 250 mm KCl at 13 °C. We characterized the amount of G680V-S1 released from actin in the absence of nucleotide, in the presence of 1 mmADP, and in the presence of increasing amounts of ATP. Under these high-salt conditions we were able to readily discern an effect of ATP on G680V-S1 affinity for actin. Release of significant amounts of G680V-S1 occurred even at the lowest concentration of ATP (3 μm) (Fig. 5). ∼75% of the G680V-S1 is released from actin by an ATP concentration of 300 μm, compared with only ∼20% release effected by this concentration of ATP in the absence of KCl. This release is demonstrating salt sensitivity of an intermediate in the ATPase cycle as it is observed only in the presence of ATP and not in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ATPγS. However, despite the rationale that led to the experiment, we find that ADP does not enhance release of G680V-S1 from actin in the presence of 250 mm KCl, demonstrating that the release we are observing in the presence of ATP must be occurring from a complex different from that which can be achieved solely by introduction of ADP. The G680A and G680V mutant myosins exhibit several aberrant properties. The most dramatic finding is derived from the in vitro “dominance” of G680V myosins poor motility even when mixed with a 10-fold excess of wild-type. This braking ability indicates abnormally long occupancy of a strongly bound state. Such a state can arise from at least four alterations: 1) an impaired ability to bind nucleotide, stalling the molecule in the tight-binding “rigor” state; 2) an increase in the affinity of myosin for actin during the weakly bound (ATP and ADP·Pi states); 3) inability to release ADP with the same kinetics as wild-type; and 4) extension of a normally short-lived strong-binding state or creation of a novel one, resulting in abnormal continuance of a strong-binding myosin-product state or states. The first possibility, inability to bind nucleotide, is ruled out since the K m for ATP that we measure for the G680V mutant is comparable to that of wild type. Notably, the affinity of myosin for ATPγS in the presence of actin is dramatically greater than that of wild type, as measured by ability of ATPγS to release myosin from actin filaments. The latter experiment also addresses possibility number 2, enhanced “weak” binding. Due to its low rate of hydrolysis, ATPγS effectively arrests myosin in a state similar to the ATP-bound state. The behavior of G680V-S1 in the presence of sufficient quantities of ATPγS mimics wild-type, in that G680V-S1 does not co-sediment with actin in the presence of ATPγS. Thus we do not detect any evidence of strengthened weak binding states for G680V-S1. The third possibility, inability of the G680V mutant to efficiently release ADP, appears to be occurring. This possibility is consistent with, although not dictated by, the demonstrated greater affinity of G680V-S1 for ATPγS. We have taken advantage of the affinity of G680V-S1 for ATPγS to indirectly demonstrate high affinity for ADP: a similar ratio of ADP is required to compete with ATPγS for binding to G680V as is required to compete for binding of wild type. Thus the relative affinities of ADP and ATPγS are the same for mutant and wild-type, and the mutant affinity for ADP must also be 40-fold higher than that of wild type. Second, we have demonstrated that ADP interferes with the actin-activated ATPase of the mutant at much lower levels than are required for interference with the wild-type actin-activated ATPase. 6B. Patterson and Y. Wu, unpublished results. Thus overzealous affinity for nucleotide, as it manifests at the end of the cycle with ADP, potentially contributes to the poor motility of the G680V mutant and to its ability to interfere with motility of wild-type myosin in mixing experiments. The fourth possibility, extension of a novel or normally short-lived strong-binding state, also appears to be the case. The G680V mutant S1 clearly over-occupies a strongly bound state during the ATPase cycle, in that it co-sediments with actin even at ATP levels well aboveK m (Fig. 5). Under similar conditions, the majority of wild-type S1 is released, consistent with its spending only a fraction of its ATPase cycle in strongly bound states. Our data further suggest that this strongly bound state does not correspond to canonical rigor or ADP-bound states. Co-sedimentation of G680V-S1 with actin in the presence of ATP is salt-sensitive in a manner notcharacteristic of the ADP-bound state. In the presence of 250 mm KCl, 75% of G680V-S1 is released from actin by 100 μm ATP, while only ∼20% is released in the absence of KCl. Thus at steady state, ∼50% of the G680V-S1 exists in an actin-binding state that can be “defeated” by 250 mmKCl. Since actin-bound states of G680V-S1 induced by ADP or withholding nucleotide are not sensitive to 250 mm KCl, this salt-sensitive state must occur at some other point of the mechanochemical cycle. This state must be short-lived or non-existent in wild type S1 in that we do not observe more than 10% enhancement of release of wild-type S1 from actin in the presence of 250 mm salt. Furthermore, since the addition of KCl “masks” the aberrant behavior of G680V-S1 (excepting the apparent higher affinity for nucleotide), extension of the novel salt-sensitive state is apparently the primary difference between the wild type and G680V ATPase cycles. The above interpretation is also consistent with the ATPase data (Fig.3). Essentially in all cases, mutation at position G680 depresses the ATPase rate. Certainly for the basal ATPase, the rate-limiting step is phosphate release, and the behavior of the G680V mutant is consistent with a raised energetic barrier to phosphate release. This point in the biochemical cycle is believed to be closely juxtaposed to the onset of tight binding to actin and initiation of the powerstroke, at which time novel states of actin binding might be anticipated. Our data are consistent with a model in which the G680V-S1 initiates productive interaction with actin, but that the release of phosphate normally triggered by this event is greatly delayed. The G691C mutant also has readily identifiable alterations in behavior compared with wild-type. The accelerated basal ATPase rate demonstrates that the mutant must speed up a rate-limiting step, which for this reaction is Pi release. Comparing the basal ATPase to the actin-activated ATPase is informative: while the wild-type exhibits substantial increases in activity brought about by the presence of actin, the G691C mutant shows little if any enhancement, especially at the lower temperatures. These data are consistent with the underlying cause of cold-sensitivity in vivo being a failure to efficiently couple product release (and by implication, the transduction of the ATP hydrolysis energy into a mechanical stroke) with actin binding. At the low temperature, Pi release occurs regardless of the presence of actin, whereas the normal coupling is merely inefficient at the permissive temperature. The Ca2+-ATPase reinforces this view of the G691C as a promiscuous ATPase: the mutant's activity for this aberrant substrate is even higher than that of wild type. Thus again we can explain the biological ineffectiveness of the mutant: by releasing Pi without “waiting” to interact with actin, the mutant is able to complete the ATPase cycle without performing useful work. The fact that both the cold-sensitive mutants we recovered in this region are glycine alterations was one of the factors that led us to analyze them. The possibility that the mutant phenotypes arise from substitution of a flexible residue with more constrained ones is consistent with our goal of isolating myosins restricted in their ability to undergo critical conformational changes (8Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1995; 140: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The behavior of the glycine → alanine changes (G680A and G691A) are consistent with this interpretation: in each case, the comparatively small alanine side chain (in contrast to valine or cysteine) confers a defect essentially identical in direction to the larger alteration recovered in the screen, but markedly lesser in degree. Thus G680A myosin has almost normal actin-activated ATPase activity at 30 °C and detectable Ca2+-ATPase at all temperatures, while the G680V mutant myosin has only ∼50% of the wild type actin-activated ATPase at 30 °C, proportionally even less at the lower temperatures, and barely detectable Ca2+-ATPase at any temperature. The G691A mutation similarly has less elevated basal ATPases at all temperatures than G691C, and shows greater actin-activation (as compared with basal ATPase) than G691C at 21 and 30 °C. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that the mutants make adoption of certain states in the motor cycle more favorable or more stable than for wild type. Crystallographic analysis of these mutants may therefore yield fresh insights into the different structural states of the myosin cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2014589819,"Secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) from mammalian cells requires the presence of functional microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). We previously reported that co-expressing the human intestinal form of apoB, B48, with both subunits of human MTP in oleate-treated Sf21 cells led to a dramatic induction of B48 secretion. Deletion mutagenesis studies showed that the cysteine-enriched amino terminus of apoB was necessary for the MTP responsiveness (Gretch, D. G., Sturley, S. L., Wang, L., Dunning, A., Grunwald, K. A. A., Wetterau, J. R., Yao, Z., Talmud, P., and Attie, A. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8682–8691). We therefore hypothesized that the small subunit of MTP, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), plays a role in apoB secretion by facilitating correct disulfide bond formation. To determine whether the enzymatic activities of PDI are important for MTP-stimulated apoB secretion, the wild type PDI subunit was replaced with an active site mutant, mPDI (Cys36 → Ser/Cys380 → Ser), lacking both disulfide shuffling and redox activities. MTP containing mPDI was fully functional in promoting apoB and triglyceride secretion. Therefore, the shufflase and redox activities of PDI are not necessary for the function of MTP. Since PDI exists in large molar excess over the other subunit of MTP, the role of free PDI (independent of the MTP complex) was investigated. PDI or mPDI was co-expressed with B48 and B17, a fragment encompassing the amino-terminal 17% of apoB. Mutant PDI significantly and specifically reduced the accumulation of the B17 and B48 both intracellularly and in the culture medium. The reduction was partially eliminated by the protease inhibitorN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, consistent with rapid co- or post-translational degradation of apoB in the presence of mPDI. Treating the cells with oleate reversed the effect of mPDI on B48 secretion in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on B17. In conclusion: 1) the role of PDI in the MTP complex involves functions other than its known enzymatic activities; 2) one or both of the enzymatic activities of free PDI is/are important for the MTP-independent steps of apoB secretion; 3) oleate can affect apoB secretion at high physiological concentrations and compensate for the insufficiency of PDI activities.

Many secretory and plasma membrane proteins have disulfide bonds. Correct disulfide arrangement is crucial not only for protein structure and function, but also for their progress through the secretory pathway beginning in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; apoB, apolipoprotein B; DTT, dithiothreitol; LDL-R, low density lipoprotein receptor; apoE3, apolipoprotein E3; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; hpi, hours post-infection; ALLN,N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WT, wild type; RBP, retinol-binding protein; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; mPDI, mutant PDI.

Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), formation of the native disulfide pattern appears to be an enzyme-facilitated process (2Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1) is a multi-functional protein that plays a key role in the co- and post-translational modification of secretory and cell surface proteins in all eukaryote cells (2Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is a major ER-resident protein. As an enzyme, PDI catalyzes the rearrangement of pre-existing disulfide bonds (referred to as the “shufflase” activity) as well as net formation or breakage of disulfide bonds, depending on the reduction potential of the environment (the “redox” activity). Although PDI can catalyze both types of enzymatic reactions, it is the shufflase activity that appears to be essential in eukaryotic cells (4Laboissière M.C.A. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PDI serves as a subunit in two known protein complexes. It is the β subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in collagen biosynthesis (5Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K.M.R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I.

PDI also forms a heterodimer with a 97-kDa protein that has in vitro lipid transfer activities, to form microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), located in the ER lumen of hepatocytes and intestinal cells (6Wetterau J.R.

Mutations within the 97-kDa subunit of MTP are responsible for abetalipoproteinemia, a genetic disease distinguished by the inability to secrete triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins: chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (9Wetterau J.R.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is an essential protein component of chylomicrons and VLDL (12Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The full-length apoB molecule (apoB100 or B100) has 4536 amino acid residues and multiple proposed lipid binding regions. In humans, VLDL is secreted from the liver carrying B100, while the intestine produces chylomicrons with a truncated form of apoB, B48 (the amino-terminal 48% of B100), due to an RNA editing event that converts the codon for Gln2153 to a stop codon (14Powell L.M.

We have previously reconstituted the mammalian lipoprotein assembly pathway in Sf21 insect cells by using baculovirus-mediated expression of human genes encoding apoB and the MTP subunits (18Gretch D.G.

Sf21 cells can secrete some B48 even in the absence of human MTP, suggesting that they possess an endogenous MTP-like function. However, expression of human MTP greatly enhanced B48 secretion in these cells. Deletion analyses of apoB demonstrated that the MTP responsiveness requires both the amino terminus and a sufficient length of apoB (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A.

Although a physical interaction between MTP and the amino terminus of apoB has been detected (20Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which MTP mediates lipoprotein assembly and secretion are not well understood. The amino terminus of apoB is enriched in cysteine residues: out of the 25 cysteines in B100, 12 are clustered within the first 11% of the protein, forming six disulfide bonds (22Yang C. Kim T.W. Weng S. Lee B. Yang M. Gotto A.J. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There are only two more disulfide bonds in the rest of the molecule. In Sf21 cells, most apoB fragments without the amino terminus were secretion-incompetent (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In hepatoma cells, treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) interrupts secretion of newly synthesized apoB. These observations are consistent with a role for the amino terminus of apoB in the proper folding of the protein and its assembly with lipids (23Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the disulfide-rich amino terminus of apoB led to our hypothesis that PDI may be involved in apoB secretion by assisting in correct disulfide bond formation. In the present study, this hypothesis was tested by expressing an enzymatically inactive form of human PDI. We first asked if the catalytic activities of PDI are required for the MTP heterodimer to facilitate apoB secretion. As we have shown previously, the effect of MTP cannot be detected unless human PDI is expressed along with the 97-kDa subunit in Sf21 cells (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This result implied that the endogenous insect PDI cannot form a functional complex with the 97-kDa subunit of MTP. Hence, this system provided us with the unique opportunity to explore the role of human PDI in the MTP complex without interference from the endogenous enzyme. In addition to its role in the MTP complex, PDI also exists in a free form in high abundance in the ER lumen. Since Sf21 cells can secrete some apoB in the absence of human MTP and secretion of short apoB truncations can be MTP-independent, the second question we asked is whether the enzymatic activities of PDI are necessary at steps in the apoB secretion pathway not involving MTP. PDI has two active sites that are homologous with the active site of another thiol-reactive enzyme, thioredoxin (2Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The active sites contain the sequence -WCGHCK-. Since the amino-terminal cysteine within each active site has a relatively low pK a and is more solvent-accessible, it acts as the nucleophile that initiates the PDI-catalyzed reactions (24Chivers P.T. Laboissière M.C.A. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 2559-2667Google Scholar, 25Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This cysteine residue is sufficient for the shufflase activity (4Laboissière M.C.A. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Chivers P.T. Laboissière M.C.A. Raines R.T.

To catalyze disulfide bond formation and breakage, both cysteine residues within at least one of the active sites are required; the second cysteine residue functions to displace the mixed disulfide between the first cysteine and the substrate of PDI (24Chivers P.T. Laboissière M.C.A. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 2559-2667Google Scholar, 25Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed a PDI mutant devoid of both enzymatic activities. The amino-terminal cysteines of both active sites were mutated to serines: Cys36 → Ser/Cys380 → Ser; mPDI (28Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We discovered that within the MTP complex, the enzymatic activities of PDI were not necessary to obtain the induction of apoB and triglyceride secretion. However, in the absence of adequate free fatty acid supplementation, expression of free, active site mutated PDI inhibited apoB secretion. These results are consistent with two distinct roles of PDI in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. The production of the recombinant baculoviruses encoding human B17, B48, apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3), the truncated low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R354), and the 97-kDa subunit of human MTP are described elsewhere (10Ricci B.

Infection efficiency for each experiment in this report was more than 95% as determined visually. At 44 h post-infection (hpi), the cells were harvested and PDI was isolated as described (33Gilbert H.F. Kruzel M.L. Lyles M.M. Harper J.W.

Sf21 cells were infected with a total m.o.i. of 10. The ratios between different viruses for individual experiments are indicated in the figure legends. At 27 hpi, the media were changed and oleate was introduced as needed. Bovine serum albumin-oleate complexes were prepared as described (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A.

Cells were washed, sonicated and assayed for total protein (Pierce BCA assay). All samples were treated with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Quantitative immunoblot analyses were carried out and detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies visualized by AttoPhos™ (JBL Scientific, Inc.) and a Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager set to 500 V, with a 570-nm filter. Band volumes were integrated using the Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software (version 4.2). Internal standards were used to determine the linearity of the signal and to ensure quantitative transfer across all lanes of the blot. Cells were infected as described above with a total m.o.i. of 10. At 27 hpi, fresh media containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin complexed with 1 mm oleate and 6.25 μCi of [3H]oleate/ml were added. Seventeen hours later, lipids were extracted from the medium and cell samples (35Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol.

Resolved lipids and lipid standards were stained with iodine and the bands for triglyceride were scraped from the plate for quantitation of radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Cells were infected as described above with a total m.o.i. of 10. At 35 hpi, the media were removed and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.2). This was followed by incubation with methionine/cysteine-free medium for 1 h at 27 °C. Then the cells were pulse-labeled with the methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 5, 10 and 15 min. The protease inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) was dissolved in ethanol and added to the methionine/cysteine-free medium as indicated at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The same volume of ethanol was added to control plates. At each time point, cells were washed, collected, and lysed by sonication. Aliquots of cell lysate were used for protein assay and immunoprecipitation as described (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE fractionation. Bands corresponding to B17 and B48 were excised and radioactivity was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. To study the importance of the enzymatic activities of PDI in apoB secretion, recombinant baculoviruses encoding the wild type and active site mutated human PDI were generated and used to infect Sf21 insect cells. Wild type and mutant PDI (mPDI) were each purified from infected cells and assayed for the shufflase activity by testing their ability to refold scrambled ribonuclease A in vitro (34Laboissière M.C.A. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a control experiment, a sample isolated from mock-infected cells with the same purification strategy was used. Only the wild type PDI was able to catalyze the reactivation of ribonuclease A (Fig. 1). Neither the control nor the mutant PDI displayed any shufflase activity. The lack of activity in the control sample indicated that the endogenous insect PDI was not purified with the procedure for human PDI. Since the lack of shufflase activity will ensure the absence of the redox activity (34Laboissière M.C.A. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the latter was not assayed. We previously observed a dramatic induction of B48 secretion from Sf21 cells upon co-expression with MTP in the presence of oleate (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, B17 (the amino-terminal 17% of apoB100) had little response to either oleate or MTP. To determine whether the stimulation of B48 secretion by MTP requires an enzymatically active PDI subunit, B48 was co-expressed with either the wild type or mutant form of human PDI, together with the 97-kDa subunit. B48 co-expressed with individual subunits of MTP or wild type baculovirus (WT) were used as controls. All cells were treated with 1 mm oleate. Cells expressing both MTP subunits secreted at least 4-fold more B48 than control cells infected with either an irrelevant virus (WT) or recombinant baculovirus encoding only one subunit of MTP (Fig.2). MTP with the mutant PDI induced B48 secretion to the same level as compared with the wild type MTP. This result suggests that the mutant PDI is fully capable of forming a functional complex with the 97-kDa subunit of MTP to enhance apoB secretion. The role of PDI in the MTP complex therefore involves a function that is intrinsic to its association with the 97-kDa subunit, but does not require the known enzymatic activities of PDI. When supplemented with oleate, Sf21 cells can synthesize triglyceride and store it as intracellular droplets. However, they are unable to secrete large quantities of triglyceride unless the cells express both B48 and MTP (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assess whether the enzymatic activities of PDI are necessary for MTP-mediated triglyceride mobilization, we measured triglyceride secretion from cells labeled with [3H]oleate (Fig.3). When co-expressed with B48 and the 97-kDa subunit, the mutant PDI functioned just as effectively as wild type PDI in stimulating triglyceride secretion in cells exposed to 1 mm oleate. The enrichment of cysteine residues near the amino terminus of apoB might indicate a role for disulfide bonds in stabilizing apoB structure and facilitating lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Since the role of PDI in the MTP complex does not reside in its enzymatic activities, we explored the possibility that free PDI might play a role in apoB secretion at steps not involving MTP. This was done by expressing the enzymatically inactive form of PDI in the absence of the 97-kDa subunit of MTP. Since our expression system did not permit us to express the 97-kDa subunit at low levels, it was necessary to express mPDI by itself to prevent it from being sequestered into an MTP complex. Two carboxyl-terminal truncated apoB constructs, B17 and B48, were used. Co-expression of mPDI with B17 or B48 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the secreted and intracellular levels of both apoB fragments when compared with values obtained in the presence of the wild type PDI (Fig. 4, A and B). The level of apoB was similar in cells expressing wild type PDI and cells expressing no exogenous PDI (data not shown). Additionally, total protein synthesis and secretion were not affected by the mutant PDI. Our results are consistent with the cysteine-rich amino terminus of apoB having a requirement for the enzymatic activities of PDI for optimal secretion. This interpretation would predict that expression of a segment of apoB not including the amino terminus would not be responsive to mPDI. We tested this prediction by co-expressing with mPDI a carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoB, B88-100 (18Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Neither the secretion nor the intracellular accumulation of B88-100 was affected by mPDI (Fig. 4 C). Since B88-100 contains two free cysteines that are not disulfide-bonded, it is likely that only the regions of apoB that have disulfide bonds are sensitive to mPDI. To assess the specificity of the mPDI effect, we co-expressed two other proteins with mPDI. Human apoE3 has"

We have partially purified the editing activity from extracts of a McArdle cell line overexpressing His6-hemagglutinin-tagged, rat APOBEC-1 using metal-chelating affinity chromatography. The 1,200-fold purification achieved by this approach was partially dependent on exogenously added RNA containing a mooring sequence for editosome assembly. Affinity-purified editing activity could be separated by 300 mm NaCl extraction into two fractions, a salt-resistant fraction (editing fraction 1; EF1) and a salt-soluble fraction (EF2).

Previously identified candidate auxiliary factors including the p66/p44 apoB RNA binding proteins and the presumptive editosome assembly factor p240 were all present in the affinity-purified editing complex. Moreover, virtually all of p66, p240, and APOBEC-1 were present in EF1, whereas p44 was quantitatively recovered in EF2. This is the first demonstration that p66 and p44 can bind to apoB RNA independently of one another. In addition, 100- and 55-kDa apoB RNA cross-linking proteins have been identified in the APOBEC-1 affinity-purified material. RNA competition studies demonstrated that p100, p66, and p55 bound selectively to apoB RNA, whereas p44 had general RNA cross-linking characteristics.

RNA competition studies demonstrated that p100, p66, and p55 bound selectively to apoB RNA, whereas p44 had general RNA cross-linking characteristics. The data underscore the multiplicity of auxiliary factors potentially involved in apoB RNA editing and suggest an editosome far more complicated than may have been previously appreciated.

Kuo S.-R. Steinburg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cell extracts with anti-p240 mAb yielded p240 along with additional proteins, together referred to as AUX240. APOBEC-1 was not detected in AUX240, nor did AUX240 have autonomous editing activity. Extracts depleted of AUX240 had impaired editosome assembly and editing activity that could be restored by the addition of AUX240 in a concentration-dependent manner (25Schock D. Kuo S.-R. Steinburg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, editing activity in untreated extracts was stimulated by the addition of AUX240.An APOBEC-1-interacting protein designated ABBP-1 (APOBEC-1-bindingprotein-1) was cloned recently using the yeast two-hybrid system (26Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is an alternatively spliced variant of previously cloned heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B. A role for this protein in apoB mRNA editing has been suggested by the findings that ABBP-1 could bind to APOBEC-1 as well as apoB RNA and down-regulation of ABBP-1 in editing competent cells by transfection with an antisense ABBP-1 cDNA construct impaired editing efficiency. ABBP-1 and APOBEC-1 are, however, not sufficient to edit, suggesting that other auxiliary proteins must be involved.Affinity columns generated by immobilizing E. coli-expressed 6-histidine-tagged APOBEC-1 (His6-APOBEC-1) on metal-chelating resins have been exploited to isolate auxiliary factors (27Yang Y. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Mehta A. Banerjee S. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteins adsorbed in this manner complement the recombinant APOBEC-1 in editing activity. The molecular masses of proteins obtained by APOBEC-1 affinity chromatography are complex and overlap those observed in AUX240 (25Schock D. Kuo S.-R. Steinburg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Yang Y. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrated several novel characteristics of partially purified editosomes through a variation of APOBEC-1 affinity chromatography, based entirely on a homologous system of mammalian expressed proteins. Affinity-purified editosomes were dissociated into two fractions by 300 mm salt extraction that could reconstitute fully functional editing complexes when recombined but that alone were insufficient in complementing APOBEC-1. The 300 mm salt-resistant fraction (EF1) contained auxiliary factors associated with APOBEC-1 including p66, p240, and a 100-kDa apoB RNA cross-linking protein (p100). Proteins released from editosomes by 300 mm salt included p44 and a 55-kDa apoB RNA cross-linking protein (p55). The data show for the first time that p66 and p44 are capable of binding apoB RNA independent of one another and that in the context of purified editosomes, p100, p66, and p55 bind apoB RNA selectively, whereas p44 is a general RNA cross-linking protein. Finally, the data suggest that the mooring sequence may play a critical role in recruiting auxiliary factor(s) for editosome assembly.DISCUSSIONWe have achieved an approximately 1,200-fold partial purification of editing activity by APOBEC-1 affinity chromatography and characterized the purified editing complex by salt fractionation. Our data demonstrated that the editosome can be operationally divided into two fractions, a 300 mm NaCl-resistant fraction designated as EF1 and a 300 mm NaCl soluble fraction designated as EF2. Although virtually all of APOBEC-1 was retained in EF1, it was not capable of autonomous editing. On the other hand, EF2 was not sufficient as a source of auxiliary factors, since it did not support apoB RNA editing in the presence of recombinant APOBEC-1. Editing activity could be imparted to EF1 through the addition of EF2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The data argued against the possibility that the loss of editing activity in EF1 was due to denaturation of APOBEC-1 by salt extraction. Rather, the data clearly demonstrated both EF1 and EF2 contained auxiliary factors necessary for complementing APOBEC-1 to edit.We have found that preincubation with mooring sequence containing apoB RNA enhanced the recovery of affinity-purified editing activity but did not affect the amount of APOBEC-1 retained on the TALONTM metal-chelating columns (data not shown). These data corroborate with our previous findings that the mooring sequence plays a pivotal role in editosome assembly (9Harris S.G. Sabio I. Mayer E. Steinberg M.F. Backus J.W. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7382-7392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that some or all of the interactions of auxiliary factors with APOBEC-1 are mooring sequence-dependent.Our data differed from those of Mehta et al. (28Mehta A. Banerjee S. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) who reported that all of the auxiliary factors sufficient to support APOBEC-1 in editing were eluted with 0.4 m KCl from APOBEC-1 affinity resin adsorbed with baboon kidney extracts. There are many differences in the experimental design between the present study and that of Mehta et al. that may account for these disparate observations. As mentioned earlier, the role of post-translational modifications in APOBEC-1 interactions with auxiliary factors has not been evaluated. This raises the question of whether auxiliary factor interactions with E. coli-expressed APOBEC-1 and mammalian expressed APOBEC-1 are the same at the level of salt sensitivity despite their functional consequence. Second, both approaches yielded functional editing activity, but editosome assembly in our study took place in the presence of apoB RNA substrate. In this regard, the salt-resistant fraction of auxiliary factors seen in our study may reflect interactions arising in editosomes that are engaged with apoB RNA, whereas the conditions of Mehta et al. (28Mehta A. Banerjee S. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) may reflect the organization of editosomes prior to their interaction with RNA substrate. Third, it may not be valid to assume that identical proteins (or the same number of proteins) are involved just because both tissue extracts can serve as a source of auxiliary factors. Finally, the trivial explanation that the differences in observed salt sensitivity was due to the use of KCl versus NaCl or 400 mm versus 300 mm has not been formally ruled out.Our data demonstrated that the two presumptive apoB RNA-binding proteins p66/p44 were both present in the affinity-purified editosomes, suggesting that both proteins were affiliated with APOBEC-1. The association of p66 with APOBEC-1 was resistant to 300 mm salt extraction, whereas under the same conditions p44 was separated from APOBEC-1. Cross-linking of p66 to apoB RNA has been shown to be mooring sequence-selective (9Harris S.G. Sabio I. Mayer E. Steinberg M.F. Backus J.W. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7382-7392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together with kinetic data demonstrating that p66 cross-linking to apoB RNA preceded the onset of editing activity, it is tempting to speculate that p66's function is to bind the mooring sequence and in some way guide APOBEC-1 dimers (11Lau P.P.

A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), RNA competition analyses demonstrated that p44 in the affinity-purified editosomes had general RNA cross-linking activity and was not selective for the mooring sequence. We currently cannot explain why purification of the editosomes affected p44's RNA binding specificity. This does not rule out a role for p44 in the editing reaction, since APOBEC-1 also has general RNA cross-linking activities (12Oka K. Kobayashi K. Sullivan M. Martinez J. Teng B.-B. Ishimura-Oka K. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1456-1460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Anant S. MacGinnitie A.J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14762-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both low and high affinity RNA-protein interactions are known to be involved in several forms of RNA processing (30$$Google Scholar). Whether p44 is required for apoB mRNA editing remains to be determined.We have found two additional RNA cross-linking proteins of 100 and 55 kDa in the affinity-purified editing fraction. In previous studies, a 55-kDa RNA cross-linking protein was only occasionally observed in crude extracts, and the significance of its occurrence relative to apoB RNA editing was uncertain (9Harris S.G. Sabio I. Mayer E. Steinberg M.F. Backus J.W. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7382-7392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that although the interactions between p55 and APOBEC-1 or other components were salt-sensitive, it bound to apoB RNA selectively.p100 is a novel RNA cross-linking protein and, like p55, demonstrated selective interactions with apoB RNA. In contrast to p55, p100's association with APOBEC-1 was resistant to 300 mm salt extraction. The data suggest that p100 may also be involved in the editing process. Failure to detect p100 in past studies may have been due to use of crude extract fractions, particularly if p100 is in low abundance.Finally, we have demonstrated that p240 is a component of affinity-purified editosomes. Previous data suggested that p240 itself or in complex with other proteins as AUX240 mediated protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly of fully functional editosomes (26Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The selective distribution of p240 as a salt-resistant component of the editosome supports this possibility. The yield of p240 in affinity-purified editosomes relative to that in the crude extracts was low, suggesting that its interactions are transient or that it may not solely function in editing. Further studies will be necessary to evaluate the possibility of protein-protein interactions between p240 and other components of either EF1 or EF2.In conclusion, we have used mammalian expressed APOBEC-1 as an affinity ligand to purify auxiliary proteins from rat hepatoma cell extracts. This approach has extended our understanding of the auxiliary factor requirement in five ways. 1) Assembly of functional editosomes by the auxiliary factor(s) and APOBEC-1 is mooring sequence-dependent. 2) These functional complexes can be subdivided into two fractions, EF1 and EF2, based on salt solubility. Neither EF1 nor EF2 is sufficient to support editing activity but establishes full editing function when reconstituted. 3) The affinity-isolated editing activity contains the presumptive editosome assembly factor, p240, and four RNA cross-linking proteins, p100, p66, p55, and p44. 4) p100, p66, and p55 are apoB-selective, RNA cross-linking proteins, whereas p44 has general RNA cross-linking capacity. 5) p66 and p44, previously characterized as simultaneously binding to apoB RNA, are shown here to have independent RNA cross-linking capabilities. These data constitute the strongest support to date for the multiprotein composition of the editosome involved in apoB mRNA editing.

The values obtained, 40,273 and 21,469 Da, for domains I and III, respectively, are similar to those estimated from the amino acid sequences of the proteins. Evidently, there are no prosthetic groups or metal centers that can serve as reducible intermediates in hydride transfer between nucleotides bound to these proteins. The transient-state kinetics of hydride transfer catalyzed by mixtures of recombinant domains I and III were studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The data indicate that oxidation of NADPH, bound to domain III, and reduction of acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (an NAD+ analogue), bound to domain I, are simultaneous and very fast. The transient-state reaction proceeds as a biphasic burst of hydride transfer before establishment of a steady state, which is limited by slow release of NADP+.Hydride transfer between the nucleotides is evidently direct. This conclusion indicates that the nicotinamide rings of the nucleotides are in close apposition during the hydride transfer reaction, and it imposes firm constraints on the mechanism by which transhydrogenation is linked to proton translocation.

Transhydrogenase is found in the inner membranes of animal mitochondria and the cytoplasmic membranes of some bacteria. It couples the transfer of hydride ion equivalents between NAD(H) and NADP(H) to the translocation of protons across the membrane. The net reaction is as follows. NADH+NADP++Hout+⇔NAD++NADPH+Hin+Equation 1 For many years, the question as to whether hydride transfer between the nucleotides is direct or indirect has been a matter of controversy. It is central to our understanding of the energy-coupling reactions.Transhydrogenase comprises three domains. Domains I and III protrude from the membrane (on the matrix side in mitochondria and on the cytoplasmic side in bacteria). Domain II spans the membrane. There are separate sites on the enzyme for NAD(H) and for NADP(H); the former is located on domain I, and the latter on domain III (for reviews, see Refs. 1Jackson J.B. J. Bioenerg.

It was implied that a functional group on the enzyme, presumably either an amino acid residue or an unidentified prosthetic group, can serve alternately as a hydride acceptor and hydride donor. For example, E+NADH⇔E(H)+NAD+Equation 2 E(H)+NADP+⇔E+NADPHEquation 3 where E(H) represents the reduced-enzyme intermediate. However, in subsequent work other plausible explanations were found for the earlier data (7Lever T.M. Palmer T. Cunningham I.J. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

Moreover, the conclusions from steady-state kinetic analysis of transhydrogenase from various sources (7Lever T.M. Palmer T. Cunningham I.J. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

The addition of nucleotides is random, and fast, relative to the rate of a subsequent step in turnover. The reaction does not appear to take place via a substituted enzyme mechanism, and therefore the existence of a reduced enzyme intermediate, which is stable in the absence of nucleotide, is unlikely (viz. reactions exemplified by Equations 2 and 3). However, the steady-state data do not rule out the possible existence of a reduced enzyme intermediatewithin the ternary complex, that is a reaction of the following type. E+NADH+NADP+⇔NADH·E·NADP+⇔NAD+·E(H)·NADP+⇔Equation 4 NAD+·E·NADPH⇔E+NAD++NADPHThe possibility that Cys residues in the polypeptide chain might serve as reducible intermediates in hydride transfer (see, for example, Refs. 1Jackson J.B.

Hou C. Bragg P.D. Rydstrom J. Biochem. J. 1997; 234: 681-687Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that other amino acid residues have redox potentials in the appropriate range to serve as intermediates in transhydrogenation between NAD(H) and NADP(H). It has sometimes been stated in the literature that transhydrogenase is devoid of prosthetic groups that might be involved in the hydride transfer pathway, although our survey indicates that studies are incomplete. 1) It was established many years ago that there is no detectable flavin fluorescence from purified preparations of the mitochondrial enzyme (14Hojeberg B. Rydstrom J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). 2) Analyses of amino acid sequences of transhydrogenases do not reveal the existence of metal-binding motifs. 3) It has been shown that concentrated solutions of the highly purified recombinant domains I and III (which together are catalytically active, see below) do not have any absorbance that might be attributable to chromophoric groups in the proteins (15Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we are unaware of studies on transhydrogenase which rule out the presence of weakly, or nonabsorbing, prosthetic groups. By analogy with dehydrogenases, a number of possible prosthetic groups or metal ions might be envisaged to have a role as an intermediate in hydride transfer. For example, in view of the strong sequence similarity between transhydrogenase and the soluble enzyme alanine dehydrogenase (17Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), covalently bound pyruvate might be considered as a potential hydride acceptor.A mixture of the isolated recombinant forms of domains I and III ofR. rubrum transhydrogenase catalyzes the so-called “cyclic reaction” at a rate approaching that observed with the complete, membrane-located enzyme (16Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Evidently the complex of domains I and III is capable of rapid rates of hydride transfer, even in the absence of membrane-spanning domain II, and thus the apparatus for hydride transfer is located entirely within the two peripheral domains. We report below on the use of electrospray mass spectrometry to determine accurately the molecular masses of these peripheral domains with a view to establishing whether or not they possess covalently bound groups that might participate in the hydride transfer reaction. We also describe an experiment in which we examine the pre-steady-state kinetics of transhydrogenation catalyzed by a mixture of recombinant domains I and III using stopped-flow spectroscopy. In contrast to steady-state kinetic analysis, this procedure can reveal the presence of reaction intermediates. There are no other published descriptions of the pre-steady-state kinetics of reactions catalyzed by transhydrogenase. As hydride donor (binding to domain III), we use NADPH, and as hydride acceptor (binding to domain I), we use the NAD+ analogue, AcPdAD+. 1The abbreviations used are: AcPdAD+, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: AcPdAD+, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide. The difference in the absorbance spectra between the reduced forms of the two nucleotides enables us to measure the rate of oxidation of NADPH, and the rate of reduction of AcPdAD+, in real time.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant forms of domain I and domain III of R. rubrum transhydrogenase were expressed in E. coli C600 from plasmids pCD1 (15Diggle C.

Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the protein concentrations were determined using the microtannin assay (19Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As normally prepared, the domain III protein is associated with tightly bound NADP+ (typically 0.1–0.4 mol·mol−1) and NADPH (about 0.5 mol·mol−1) (16Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For stopped flow experiments the bound NADP+ was replaced by incubating domain III protein (75 μm) in 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, with 105 μm NADPH at 4 °C for 2 h (16Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Stopped-flow experiments were performed with an Applied Photophysics DX-17MV in its absorbance mode (2-mm optical path length). The instrument dead time, determined from the reaction ofl-ascorbic acid with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, as described (20Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), was 1.31 ms. The monochromator slit widths were set to 5 nm. The absorbance coefficient at 375 nm for AcPdAD+reduction (corrected for the contribution from accompanying NADPH oxidation) was 6.1 mm−1·cm−1(21Palmer T. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that at 320 nm for NADPH oxidation (corrected for the contribution from accompanying AcPdAD+ reduction) was 3.01 mm−1·cm−1 (calculated from data given (22Siegel J.M. Montgomery G.A. Bock R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). Rate constants and amplitudes were calculated from the raw data using the instrument software, making due correction for the apparatus dead time.Samples of domains I and III were prepared for analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry by dialyzing samples (25 μm) against water. The examination of domain I was performed in collaboration with Dr. C. Robinson, University of Oxford, using a Micromass Platform II and Nanoflow electrospray ionization. Data were acquired using MassLynx software. The domain III analysis was carried out in collaboration with Dr. P. R. Ashton, University of Birmingham, using a VG-Prospec in electrospray ionization mode. In both cases the carrier matrix was 20% methanol. The precision of both instruments is better than ±0.01%. Molecular masses were estimated from the amino acid sequences of domains I and III using the Genetics Computer Group program (University of Wisconsin).

In fact, PAF has been implicated as a mediator of inflammation, allergic reactions, and shock (for review, see Chao and Olson (1Chao W. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar)). Tissue PAF levels are modulated by regulation of key steps in both the biosynthetic and degradative pathways. The degradation of PAF occurs through the hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of PAF and produces biologically inactive lyso-PAF. PAF-acetylhydrolase catalyzes the hydrolytic reaction, and this enzyme is present in mammalian blood (2Farr R.S. Cox C.P. Wardlow M.L. Jorgensen R. Clin. Immunol.

Setaka M. Nojima S. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both intracellular and extracellular PAF-acetylhydrolase isoforms have been described. The molecular cloning and characterization of the human plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase was recently reported (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This 44-kDa protein was isolated from human plasma, and amino acid sequence analysis led to the screening of a macrophage cDNA library where a positive cDNA clone was isolated. The cDNA encoded a 441-amino acid protein, which contained a secretion signal sequence. Tew et al. (12Tew D.G. Southan C. Rice S.Q. Lawrence M.P. Li H. Boyd H.F. Moores K. Gloger I.S. Macphee C.H.

In addition to the extracellular enzyme, the molecular characterization of two intracellular PAF-acetylhydrolases has been reported. Bovine brain PAF-acetylhydrolase, isoform 1b, is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of 29-, 30-, and 45-kDa subunits (13Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K.

Moreover, the cDNA sequences for a bovine and a human intracellular PAF-acetylhydrolase, isoform II, were published recently (15Hattori K. Adachi H. Matsuzawa A. Yamamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Aoki J. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33032-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The intracellular isoform II exhibited 43% amino acid identity to the human plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase.The source of serum PAF-acetylhydrolase is not known, but a likely source is the liver since the liver secretes several plasma proteins in abundance, including lipoproteins. Cultured hepatocytes and the human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2, secrete PAF-acetylhydrolase into the culture media (16Satoh K. Imaizumi T. Yoshida H. Takamatsu S. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1993; 42: 672-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Svetlov S.I. Howard K.M. Miwa M. Flickinger B.D. Olson M.S. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16667-16673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, macrophages secrete large amounts of PAF-acetylhydrolase (19Stafforini D.M. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9682-9687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Narahara H. Frenkel R.A. Johnston J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but whether macrophages contribute to the level of the circulating plasma enzyme has not been proven. Northern blot analyses of different human tissues demonstrated the presence of plasma-type acetylhydrolase mRNA in thymus and tonsil, tissues which contain macrophages in abundance (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Even though hepatocytes secrete the plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase in culture, Tjoelkeret al. (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) found no detectable level of PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA in normal human liver. It is quite possible that the abundance of PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA is so low as to be undetectable in whole liver total RNA. Alternatively, as a mechanism to avoid PAF-induced pathophysiology, PAF-acetylhydrolase expression may achieve detectable levels only in response to a need for greater degradation of increased PAF levels following tissue injury.Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that the isolated perfused rat liver responds to PAF with significant effects on both vascular resistance and glucose output (21Shukla S.D. Buxton D.B. Olson M.S. Hanahan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10212-10214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Buxton D.B. Shukla S.D. Hanahan D.J. Olson M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13758-13761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Buxton D.B. Fisher R.A. Briseno D.L. Hanahan D.J. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or endotoxin stimulation and that the Kupffer cells were the site of PAF synthesis (26Chao W. Siafaka-Kapadai A. Hanahan D.J. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 27Chao W. Siafaka-Kapadai A. Olson M.S. Hanahan D.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also, we specifically demonstrated the presence of PAF receptors (28Chao W. Liu H. DeBuysere M. Hanahan D.J. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13591-13598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PAF receptor RNA (17Svetlov S.I. Howard K.M. Miwa M. Flickinger B.D. Olson M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in Kupffer cells. We have extended our research to intact animal models and have demonstrated that PAF accumulates in the intact liver exposed to various types of injury, including ischemia-reperfusion (29Zhou W. McCollum M.O. Levine B.A. Olson M.S. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), obstructive jaundice (30Zhou W. Chao W. Levine B.A. Olson M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G587-G592PubMed Google Scholar), and endotoxin exposure (31Olson M.S. Kitten A.M. Eakes A.T. Howard K.M. Miller J.E. Mustafa S.B. Shimazu T. Liver Innervation. John Libbey & Co., Ltd., London1996: 75-85Google Scholar). It may be appropriate to assume that increased PAF levels signal an increase in the level of PAF-acetylhydrolase for PAF degradation. For this reason, we have investigated whether plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase expression in the liver is regulated in response to endotoxic challenge in the intact rat.A diverse set of pathophysiological responses accompanies exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including the induction of endotoxic shock and activation of the immune system and the complement cascade (32Reatz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Several biological responses to LPS are thought to be mediated by the release of proinflammatory substances such as cytokines and lipid mediators. Using a liver-focused model of endotoxemia, we have demonstrated for the first time the presence of plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in rat liver. The expression in the liver was cell type-specific and was limited to Kupffer cells. After endotoxin exposure, the expression of PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA increased 20-fold. Concurrent with the increase in liver plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA, there was a 2-fold increase in the circulating plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activity.DISCUSSIONRibonuclease protection assays revealed the presence of plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in rat liver. In untreated rat liver, PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA was barely detectable in 80 μg of total liver RNA. Based on the difference in the specific activity of the ribonuclease protection probes, PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA was 1000-fold less abundant than GAPDH mRNA. Thus, the PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA is an extremely low abundance transcript in normal rat liver and is not detectable by Northern blotting of total rat liver RNA. In a Northern blot of various human tissue RNAs, Tjoelker et al. (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) detected PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in thymus, tonsil, and placental RNA but none in heart, kidney, or liver RNA. Although it is possible the authors' inability to detect plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in human liver was a result of species differences between rat and human, the negative Northern blot for human liver most likely reflects the low abundance of PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA in normal tissue and demonstrates the necessity of detecting the acetylhydrolase transcript using the more sensitive ribonuclease protection assay. LPS infusion into a mesenteric vein resulted in a 20-fold induction of plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in the liver 24 h following treatment.The low abundance of PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA suggested that the message may only be present in a specific subpopulation of liver cells. Following 24 h of in vivo LPS exposure, hepatocytes, endothelial cells and Kupffer cells were isolated and assayed for the presence of PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA. The PAF-acetylhydrolase transcript was limited to Kupffer cells in the liver. Although the 1.8-kb transcript also was detected in the Northern blot of freshly isolated sinusoidal endothelial cells, the amount of message present was consistent with a 10% contamination of the endothelial cells with Kupffer cells. This level of contamination of freshly isolated endothelial cells is routinely observed in our laboratory, 2A. T. Eakes, personal communication. and the subsequent plating and culturing of the endothelial cells removes the Kupffer cell contamination. In addition, cultured endothelial cells do not secrete PAF-acetylhydrolase into the culture medium (data not shown), whereas cultured Kupffer cells actively secrete PAF-acetylhydrolase activity into the culture medium. 3S. I. Svetlov, K. M. Howard, M. S. DeBuysere, and M. S. Olson, manuscript in preparation. The increase in Kupffer cell PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA following endotoxin exposure became apparent at 6 h and reached a maximum at 24 h. Forty-eight hours after LPS treatment the PAF-acetylhydrolase remained induced. This time course of induction following LPS treatment exactly matched the time of induction seen in whole liver and paralleled the increase detected in plasma acetylhydrolase activity. Induction of neutropenia failed to alter the elevated expression of PAF-acetylhydrolase in the liver. It is our contention that Kupffer cells constitute the major source of hepatic plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase and that infiltrating neutrophils (and the subsequent infiltration of mononuclear cells) are not responsible for the elevated hepatic acetylhydrolase RNA detected after LPS exposure. Previously, we have demonstrated that in jaundiced rats neutropenia failed to alter the increase seen in hepatic PAF concentrations; this confirmed the Kupffer cell as the source of PAF production (30Zhou W. Chao W. Levine B.A. Olson M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G587-G592PubMed Google Scholar).Plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase is considered to have an important role in controlling the pathophysiological effects of PAF. The level of PAF-acetylhydrolase in the plasma can be altered by genetic factors, since deficiency of this enzyme is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait among five affected Japanese families (38Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y. Sakata S. Araki Y. Matsumoto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This inherited deficiency of PAF-acetylhydrolase is the result of a point mutation in exon 9 which abolishes enzymatic activity (44Stafforini D.M. Satoh K. Atkinson D.L. Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Yoshida H. Imaizumi T. Takamatsu S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The level of plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activity also can be altered by acquired factors. Changes in the activity of plasma acetylhydrolase have been found in conjunction with asthma (38Miwa M.

In the case of clinical sepsis, two conflicting reports have been published. In one instance, PAF-acetylhydrolase activity was significantly higher in 17 septic patients who died than in 13 septic patients who survived (52Endo S. Inada K. Yamashita H. Takakuwa T. Nakae H.

Leong L.L. Sturm M.J. Taylor R.R. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PAF-acetylhydrolase activity was approximately half of normal in patients severely ill with clinical sepsis. In the present study using an acute endotoxin exposure model to reproduce the clinical situation observed in post-surgical shock, lipopolysaccharide exposure resulted in a 2-fold increase in the plasma acetylhydrolase activity. This increase in activity was evident at 24 h following LPS exposure and remained elevated at 48 h following LPS exposure. The elevated plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activity likely reflects a physiological response to inactivate elevated levels of PAF during episodes of endotoxin exposure. Additionally, elevated levels of plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase could prevent the accumulation of oxidized phospholipids which may be problematic in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia.When Kupffer cells from untreated rats were maintained in cell culture, we observed constitutively activated expression of PAF-acetylhydrolase. This expression was apparent within 5 h of plating the cells, was maximally induced by 19 h, and persisted throughout the culture interval. The cell culture-induced expression of PAF-acetylhydrolase is in direct contrast to another LPS-stimulated response in Kupffer cells, the induction of nitric oxide synthase. Kupffer cells are known to express inducible nitric oxide synthase after exposure to LPS bothin vivo (54Buttery L.D. Evans T.J. Springall D.R. Carpenter A. Cohen J. Polak J.M. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 755-764PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro. The process of Kupffer cell isolation and culturing does not induce nitric oxide synthase expression in the absence of LPS (55Mustafa S.B. Howard K.M. Olson M.S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1622-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated Kupffer cells from untreated rats express PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA during the culture process to the same extent as that seen in vivo following LPS treatment, this observation would argue against an increase in Kupffer cell number as being responsible for the increase of PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in vivo. Recent studies have demonstrated that monocytes do not secrete PAF-acetylhydrolase activity until they differentiate into macrophages (19Stafforini D.M. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9682-9687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Narahara H. Frenkel R.A. Johnston J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This differentiation-dependent expression was observed at the level of RNA as there was no PAF-acetylhydrolase mRNA in freshly isolated monocytes, but expression was induced and maintained during differentiation into macrophages (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In addition, the myelocytic leukemic cell line (HL-60) also produced and secreted PAF-acetylhydrolase when the cells were differentiated into macrophages following stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In the HL-60 cells, LPS inhibited the secretion of PAF-acetylhydrolase in a dose-dependent manner (20Narahara H. Frenkel R.A. Johnston J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Likewise, we have observed a decrease in acetylhydrolase mRNA in cultured Kupffer cells incubated with LPS. Although Kupffer cells are the terminally differentiated resident macrophages of the liver, they express barely detectable levels of PAF-acetylhydrolase RNA in vivo until LPS or a downstream mediator of LPS activates the macrophage. The opposite effect of LPS in cultured macrophage cells demonstrates the necessity of studying LPS effects on macrophage PAF-acetylhydrolase expression in an in vivo model of endotoxemia.The mechanism of LPS stimulation of PAF-acetylhydrolase expression remains to be determined. LPS regulates the expression of numerous genes and can affect the rate of transcription as observed for tumor necrosis factor α (56Taffet S.M. Singhel K.J. Overholtzer J.F. Shurtleff S.A. Cell. Immunol. 1989; 120: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or can affect the stability of the message as seen with interleukin-1 (57Yu S.F. Koerner T.J. Adams D.O. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 48: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Also, LPS could have an indirect effect on PAF-acetylhydrolase expression through elevated levels of PAF. Incubation of rat hepatocytes in culture with exogenous PAF increased secretion of PAF-acetylhydrolase, whereas lyso-PAF and the nonhydrolyzable analog methylcarbamyl-PAF significantly reduced secretion (17Svetlov S.I. Howard K.M. Miwa M. Flickinger B.D. Olson M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Also, PAF stimulated the secretion of PAF-acetylhydrolase in the human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2, in a cycloheximide-sensitive fashion (58Satoh K. Imaizumi T. Kawamura Y. Yoshida H. Hiramoto M. Takamatsu S. Takamatsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Liver PAF levels are elevated significantly 3 h after LPS exposure in this endotoxin exposure model. 4K. M. Howard, J. E. Miller, S. A. K. Harvey, A. T. Eakes, and M. S. Olson, manuscript in preparation. We are currently investigating whether the increase in acetylhydrolase expression is mediated via the PAF receptor by elevated levels of PAF or through a PAF-independent LPS-associated signaling pathway.Our evidence suggests the liver may play an important role in regulating levels of PAF-acetylhydrolase in the circulation under pathophysiological situations. Elevated levels of serum PAF-acetylhydrolase activity were detected in patients with chronic cholestasis. Normalization of liver function following liver transplantation was accompanied by a reduction to normal or near normal PAF-acetylhydrolase levels (49Meade C.J. Birke F. Metcalfe S. Watson C. Jamieson N. Neild G. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in a liver-focused model of endotoxemia that plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase expression in Kupffer cells is induced concomitant with an increase in the circulating PAF-acetylhydrolase activity. The Kupffer cells of the liver are a likely cellular source for the increase in plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activity; however, neutrophils, circulating macrophages, or other blood components could augment the elevation in plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activity following trauma/injury episodes. Alterations in hepatic plasma-type PAF-acetylhydrolase expression may constitute an important mechanism for elevating PAF-acetylhydrolase levels in the blood, thus implicating the liver as an important component in minimizing PAF-mediated pathophysiology of the liver and/or other organs exposed to endotoxic challenge.

In fact, PAF has been implicated as a mediator of inflammation, allergic reactions, and shock (for review, see Chao and Olson (1Chao W. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar)). Tissue PAF levels are modulated by regulation of key steps in both the biosynthetic and degradative pathways. The degradation of PAF occurs through the hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of PAF and produces biologically inactive lyso-PAF. PAF-acetylhydrolase catalyzes the hydrolytic reaction, and this enzyme is present in mammalian blood (2Farr R.S. Cox C.P. Wardlow M.L. Jorgensen R. Clin. Immunol.

Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar), has attracted much attention in studies on protein folding. The enzyme catalyzes the formation, reduction, or isomerization of disulfide bonds of proteins depending on the redox potentials in in vitro systems (2Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the formation of native disulfide bonds of nascent peptides in vivo (3Noiva R.

Although the three-dimensional structure has not yet been reported, the PDI molecule has been suggested to be constructed of several domains in the order of -a-b-b′-a′-c as inferred from its cDNA deduced sequence (5Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and structural studies (6Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M.

PDI is also a remarkable multifunctional protein (13Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its isomerase activity it is the essential β subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase (14Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9801-9807Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that PDI is not only an isomerase but also has chaperone activity (3Noiva R. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1515-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Wang C.C. Guzman N.A. Prolyl Hydroxylase, Protein Disulfide Isomerase, and Other Structurally Related Proteins. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). This was supported by its assistance in the in vitro refolding of denatured proteins with no disulfide bond, such asd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (19Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rhodanese (20Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acidic phospholipase A2(APLA2) (22Yao Y. Zhou Y.C. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although Lilie et al. (23Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R.B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had reported that PDI showed no chaperone effect on the refolding of denatured immunoglobulin Fab with intact disulfides. A PDI mutant, inactive as an isomerase, has the same function as an essential subunit for the assembly of the fully active tetramer of prolyl-4-hydroxylase α2β2 (24Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the dimer of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein complex (25Lamberg A. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Ehnholm C. Shoulders C. Scott J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of PDI in the above two proteins is independent of its isomerase activity but related to its chaperone-like peptide binding function. The deletion of the NH2-terminal 3 amino acid residues of the peptide binding region of human PDI indeed prevents prolyl-4-hydroxylase tetramer formation (25Lamberg A. Jauhiainen M. Metso J.

It was shown that a mutant PDI with Ser substituted for Cys at the -CGHC- active sites and devoid of isomerase activity can increase the folding and secretion of lysozyme coexpressed in yeast (27Hayano T. Hirose M. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The yeast bearing a mutant PDI shortened from the COOH terminus and devoid of the putative peptide binding region in the middle part of the molecule can hardly survive (28LaMantia M. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It has been shown in our previous work that the chaperone activity of PDI in assisting GAPDH refolding is suppressed by competitive peptide binding (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which also inhibits its enzymatic activity (12Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F.

In this paper a mutant human PDI, abb′a′, with the deletion of the COOH-terminal 51 amino acid residues responsible for peptide binding, has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The mutant shows neither peptide binding ability nor chaperone activity in assisting the refolding of denatured GAPDH but displays most of the catalytic activities of PDI and assists the reactivation of denatured and reduced APLA2 and lysozyme to an extent significantly lower than those by the native bovine enzyme. The plasmid pBR322-PDI, containing the full-length of human PDI (hPDI) cDNA (11Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

APLA2 was from Agkistrodon blomhoffii brevicaudus (Agkistrodon halys Pallas) (31Wu X.F. Jiang Z.P. Chen Y.C. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 1984; 16: 664-671Google Scholar). PDI was prepared from bovine liver (bPDI) essentially according to Lambert and Freedman (32Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and showed one band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a specific activity of more than 800 units/g.S-Carboxymethylated A-chain of insulin was prepared according to Zheng et al. (33Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Modified PDI (mPDI) carboxymethylated at thiols in the -CGHC- sequence of active sites, was prepared as described previously (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and dithiothreitol were from Promega. VentR DNA polymerase and the large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase I were from New England Biolabs, Inc. The prokaryotic gene fusion expression vector pGEX-4T-1, E. coliBL21 strain (F−, ompT, RB−, mB−), the T7 sequencing kit, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. α-35S-dATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was from Fluka. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), NAD+ (98%), and NADPH (type III) were from Boehringer Mannheim. Thrombin, glutathione reductase (yeast, type III), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 98–99% albumin, fraction V), guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl),Micrococcus lysodeikticus dried cells, and insulin were from Sigma. Hen egg white lysozyme was from Serva. All other chemicals were local products of analytical grade. The concentrations of GdnHCl-denatured GAPDH, and denatured and reduced APLA2 were determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. The concentrations of other proteins were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm with the following absorption coefficients (A 1 cm0.1%): 0.94 for PDI, 0.66 for BSA, 0.98 for GAPDH, 1.03 for insulin, 1.3 for APLA2, 1.14 for S-carboxymethylated A-chain of insulin (35Hua Q.X. Qian Y.Q. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 189: 234-240Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), 2.63 for native lysozyme, and 2.37 for denatured lysozyme (21Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A 1 cm0.1% value of abb′a′ was determined to be 0.83. For the convenience of comparison, both GAPDH and PDI are considered as protomers in the calculation of molar ratios. Thiol groups of proteins were determined with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (36Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). The primer I (5′-CGGGATCCGACGCCCCCGAGGAG-3′) was designed to hybridize with the first 15 nucleotides at the 5′-terminus of the hPDI cDNA sequence and contains a BamHI site (underlined) just before the sequence. The reverse primer II (5′-GGGTTAGTAATCGATGAC-3′) with a stop codon (underlined) hybridizes with the sequence between 1309 and 1320 base pairs of the hPDI cDNA. The double-stranded 1.3-kilobase DNA fragment coding for the sequence of the Asp1 to Tyr440 of PDI (abb′a′) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using VentR DNA polymerase with the above two primers and pBR322-PDI as a template. The polymerase chain reaction product was elongated to blunt ends in both termini with the large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase I, digested with BamHI at the 5′-terminus, and ligated into pGEX-4T-1 digested with BamHI and SmaI in-frame with the glutathioneS-transferase fusion codons to construct the expression plasmid pGEX-abb′a′. The foreign DNA sequences cloned into the expression plasmid was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Protein production was carried out in E. coli strain BL21 containing the pGEX-abb′a′ plasmid. Cells grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium were diluted 100-fold and grown at 28 °C with vigorous shaking to anA 600 of 0.8, and then grown for another 4 h after adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellet was disrupted by sonication and then mixed gently with 1% Triton X-100 by stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant of cell lysate was loaded onto a 2-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B RediPack column, and the fusion protein on the matrix was cleaved with 100 units of thrombin at 22 °C for 16 h. The eluted abb′a′ fraction was loaded onto a Mono Q HR (5/5) column equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.3m NaCl. The abb′a′ fraction was identified by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, dialyzed thoroughly, and lyophilized. The disulfide isomerase and thiol-protein oxidoreductase (TPOR) activities were assayed according to Lambert and Freedman (32Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lysozyme activity was determined at 30 °C by following the absorbance decrease at 450 nm of a 0.25 mg/ml M. lysodeikticus suspension in 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 100 mm NaCl (21Puig A.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Denaturation and assisted reactivation of GAPDH and APLA2 by bPDI and/or abb′a′ were carried out according to Cai et al. (19Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Yaoet al. (22Yao Y. Zhou Y.C. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), respectively. Lysozyme at 20 mg/ml was completely denatured and reduced in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 8 m GdnHCl and 150 mmdithiothreitol at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction mixture was brought to pH 2.0 with 6 n HCl, dialyzed first against 0.01 n HCl for 3 h and then against 0.1 nacetic acid at 4 °C thoroughly. The denatured and reduced lysozyme was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. Oxidative refolding of reduced and denatured lysozyme was carried out by dilution into phosphate buffer containing 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm GSSG, and 2 mm GSH, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 10 μm. The activity recovery was completed and determined 2 h after dilution. CD spectrum determinations in the far ultraviolet region from 200 to 250 nm were carried out with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. ANS fluorescence spectra were measured at 25 °C in a Hitachi F-4010 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. The inserted coding sequence for abb′a′ in the expression plasmid pGEX-abb′a′ was verified by DNA sequence analysis (data not shown). The constructed protein should contain residues 1–440 and an additional Gly-Ser at the NH2 terminus of hPDI. Experimental conditions for sonication, growth temperature, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentration were optimized by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). Fig. 1 shows the high yield of abb′a′ expression and the homogeneity of the purified product. The molecular weight of abb′a′ is about 48,000 as expected. As shown in Fig.2, the CD spectrum of abb′a′ is almost the same as that of bPDI, indicating that the COOH-terminal shortened enzyme has secondary structures closely similar to that of bPDI. The same ANS fluorescence spectra of bPDI and abb′a′ indicated that the truncation of COOH-terminal 51 residues of PDI has little effect on the surface hydrophobicity of the intact molecule (data not shown). The mutant abb′a′ has about 69 ± 3% of isomerase activity and 80 ± 2% of TPOR activity compared with that of bPDI (TableI), suggesting that the truncation of the COOH-terminal 51 amino acid residues of PDI has only a minor effect on these enzymatic activities.Table IActivities of PDI, abb′a′ and mPDIChaperoneIsomerizationReduction%%PDI+100100abb′a′−69 ± 380 ± 2mPDI+−− Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig.3, the presence ofS-carboxymethylated A-chain of insulin inhibits the TPOR activity of PDI; in sharp contrast, it has no effect on the TPOR activity of abb′a′. The above result is highly suggestive that theS-carboxymethylated A-chain of insulin inhibits the TPOR activity of PDI by binding at its peptide binding site, which is lacking in the mutant abb′a′. Fig.4 shows that the reactivation of GAPDH in the presence of bPDI increases from 4 to 19% with the increase of the molar ratio of PDI to GAPDH from 0 to 10. In contrast, with BSA used for comparison, abb′a′ at the same range of ratios shows no effect on the reactivation of denatured GAPDH. This result indicates the necessity of the peptide binding site of PDI for its chaperone activity in the reactivation of GAPDH. It has been proposed that the foldase activity of PDI consists of both its isomerase and chaperone activities and the latter activity can be fully replaced by mPDI (22Yao Y. Zhou Y.C. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which is devoid of isomerase activity but nearly as active as native PDI in its chaperone activity in assisting the reactivation of GAPDH (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured and reduced APLA2, containing seven disulfide bonds, upon dilution in the presence and absence of abb′a′ and/or mPDI was determined to examine the foldase activity of abb′a′. Fig. 5 Ashows that the spontaneous reactivation of APLA2 at 12 μm is only about 1%, and the reactivation in the presence of abb′a′ takes 10 h to reach completion as in the presence of PDI. In the presence of abb′a′ the reactivation yield increases with increasing concentrations of abb′a′ to a maximal level of 15% when the molar ratio of abb′a′ to APLA2 approaches 2 as shown in Fig. 5 B. Higher ratios of abb′a′ has little further effect on the reactivation of APLA2. mPDI alone has no effect on the reactivation of APLA2; however, the simultaneous presence of both mPDI and abb′a′ increases markedly the reactivation yield of APLA2 compared with the same amount of abb′a′ alone in the refolding buffer. In presence of mPDI at 36 μm together with abb′a′ at 120 μm the reactivation yield of APLA2 approaches 48%, about the same as the maximal level obtainable by native bPDI. Further increases in the concentrations of either mPDI or abb′a′ or both have no further effect on the reactivation of APLA2. As shown in Fig. 6 the very low spontaneous reactivation of denatured and reduced lysozyme in phosphate buffer increases with increasing concentrations of bPDI in the refolding buffer to a maximal level of around 71% at a stoichiometric amount of PDI. However, the maximal reactivation yield of lysozyme in presence of abb′a′ is reduced to 58% under the same condition. From the nearly identical CD spectra and ANS binding, in addition to similar enzyme activities between bPDI and abb′a′, it appears that the addition of 2 extra residues at the NH2 terminus and the deletion of the COOH-terminal 51 amino acid residues show little effect on the secondary structures, the surface hydrophobicity, and the enzymatic activity of PDI. The NH2-terminal sequence of PDI seems to be of little importance as it has also been found that even an extension of 10 residues at the NH2 terminus showed no deleterious effect on the properties of PDI (38Gao Y. Quan H. Jiang M.Y. Dai Y. Wang C.C. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 54: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The mutant abb′a′ is structurally stable and retains most of the isomerase and oxidoreductase activities of PDI, suggesting that it is more or less independent from the c domain, but the involvement of the c domain in the above activities cannot be excluded, apart from the peptide binding site; it could also contribute to substrate binding. Alternatively, deletion of the c domain could alter somewhat the functional conformation of PDI, leading to decreased enzymatic activities. The peptide inhibition of the TPOR activity of PDI suggests its binding at the peptide binding site of PDI (12Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemstry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is not surprising that the TPOR activity of abb′a′ is not inhibited by the presence of an excess of the peptide as abb′a′ no longer has the c domain, which is the major if not the only peptide binding site (11Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above results indicate that, contrary to the previous suggestion (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the c domain does not appear to be essential for the enzymatic activities of PDI, and the peptide binding site and the substrate binding site are not identical. However, the above does not exclude the possibility that occupation at the peptide binding site could interfere with substrate binding to the substrate binding site, and the c domain could partially contribute to the substrate binding site, thus the peptide and substrate binding sites could be close to and overlapping with each other. This appears to be different from the E. coli trigger factor, in which the active site of peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase is separated widely enough from the peptide binding site so that the binding of an unfolded protein does not interfere with the catalysis of prolyl cis/transisomerization in a small peptide (39Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnz T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown previously, the presence of a peptide in the refolding buffer suppresses GAPDH reactivation assisted by PDI, indicating that peptide binding in competition with the GAPDH folding intermediates prevents and suppresses the PDI-assisted refolding of GAPDH (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is to be expected and is actually found that abb′a′ is unable to assist the reactivation of denatured GAPDH and thus provides a straightforward demonstration that the peptide binding site at the c domain of PDI is directly responsible for its chaperone activity. It is widely accepted that PDI plays a critical role in nascent peptide folding by catalyzing the formation of native disulfide(s). However, PDI as a foldase not only catalyzes disulfide isomerization but is also intrinsically involved in peptide chain folding through its peptide binding site(s). Therefore PDI most likely binds with folding intermediates at different folding stages (see SchemeFS1). The two processes of disulfide formation and peptide folding are intimately interdependent and work in cooperation in the generation of the native conformation of disulfide-containing proteins. The chemically modified PDI alkylated at active site cysteine residues is devoid of isomerase activity but retains its chaperone activity almost fully (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this report, the COOH-terminal truncated PDI shows most of the catalytic activity but is devoid of any chaperone activity. Comparisons of the properties and the possible roles of these derivatives in assisting protein folding are summarized in Table I and Scheme FS1, respectively. For spontaneous refolding (the central lines ina, b, and c) the denatured and reduced protein (U) would undergo a fast conformational change upon dilution to form intermediate (I1), which could fold first to I2 and finally to native molecule (N) through both folding steps and oxidative disulfide formation. Both intermediates I1 and I2 face two alternative folding pathways, correct folding to the native molecule (N) and misfolding leading to aggregation (A). The presence of PDI and/or its derivatives affect the relative proportion between the alternative pathways. As shown in Scheme FS1 a, PDI, being a chaperone, binds with I1 at its peptide binding site of domain c and prevents the aggregation of I1. On the other hand, PDI also probably binds at the substrate binding site with I2, which is assumed to represents a folding intermediate better folded than I1 with thiols properly paired to be oxidized to the native disulfide(s) and also decrease aggregation and increase reactivation. As shown in Scheme FS1 b, abb′a′, devoid of a peptide binding site, no longer binds with I1 but binds indeed with I2 through its substrate binding sites and catalyzes disulfide formation, leading to the native molecule (N) with significantly lower efficiency than PDI does. This could also explain the fact that the reactivation of APLA2 assisted by abb′a′ at all concentrations shows a lag phase for the first 30 min (Fig.5 A) in contrast to the apparent first order kinetics of PDI-assisted reactivation (22Yao Y. Zhou Y.C. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, abb′a′ does not show anti-chaperone activity of PDI in assisting the reactivation of lysozyme in HEPES buffer. 2J. L. Song, H. Quan, and C. C. Wang, unpublished data. As shown in Scheme FS1 c, mPDI, with full peptide binding activity of PDI, binds with both I1 and I2, but without isomerase activity it is unable to catalyze the formation of disulfide and hence the native molecule from I2. After dissociated from the respective complexes with mPDI, the intermediate would aggregate irreversibly, and therefore mPDI does not increase the reactivation yield. However, with both abb′a′ (as enzyme only) and mPDI (as chaperone only) simultaneously present in the refolding buffer, the cooperative action of the two PDI derivatives could assist the reactivation of APLA2 to the same maximal level as native PDI does, but the amount of abb′a′ required in this case for the maximal reactivation is much more than by native PDI alone. This could be accounted for by a higher efficiency of PDI with both functions in the same molecule compared with the combined action of two molecules in abb′a′ and mPDI. It is also significant that compared with thioredoxin, PDI acquired an additional -CXXC- containing domain, domain a′, as well as the domain c during evolution so as to function as a foldase with both isomerase and chaperone activities, whereas thioredoxin shows neither peptide binding ability (3Noiva R. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) nor chaperone activity (29Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and has a much lower isomerase activity than PDI (2Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Similarly, the trigger factor composed of peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase and peptide binding sites has an efficiency for assisting protein folding 1,000-fold higher than that of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (39Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnz T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As a foldase, PDI assists folding of different target proteins containing disulfide bond with efficiency different from that shown for APLA2 (from 1 to 45%) and lysozyme (from 1 to 71%). This can be explained by the difference in the folding pathway and properties of folding intermediates of the substrates on the one hand and in the specificity of PDI itself as a chaperone or an isomerase on the other. For APLA2, the maximal reactivation level decreased from 45 to 15% when PDI was replaced by abb′a′, whereas for lysozyme, the level decreased from 71 to 58%. It appears that for APLA2 refolding the chaperone function of PDI is more important compared with the refolding of lysozyme. We are grateful to Prof. K. Kivirikko, University of Oulu, Finland, for the generous gift of the cloned human PDI gene and Prof. Y. C. Zhou, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Academia Sinica, for the kind gift of APLA2.

We examined whether similar changes also occur following administration of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I to the intact animal. In female rats starved overnight, CrkL phosphorylation was significantly increased 12 min after insulin-like growth factor-I administration. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was not detectable in either control or treated animals. Paxillin, a 65–70-kDa phosphoprotein containing high affinity binding sites common for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of CrkII and CrkL, was observed in both CrkII and CrkL immunoprecipitates.

Similar effects of insulin-like growth factor-I treatment on the association of CrkL with tyrosine phosphorylated paxillin were observed in fibroblasts overexpressing CrkL. This study demonstrates that the activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor induces changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions of the Crk proteins in vivo. The different responses of CrkL and CrkII to insulin-like growth factor-I receptor activation suggest distinct roles for these two adapter proteins in signal transduction.

The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)-I 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGF-IR, IGF-type I receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SH, Src homology; JNK, Jun kinase; rh, recombinant human; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBST, PBS + Tween 20; ic, intracardiac; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. and IGF-II are related structurally and, to some extent, functionally to insulin. The expression of the IGFs and their receptors is essentially ubiquitous during fetal and postnatal development, acting as autocrine/paracrine factors to regulate cellular mitogenesis and differentiation that are asssociated with tissue and organ development (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). The IGFs have been demonstrated in vitro to act as progression factors in several cell types, stimulating progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. The cellular responses to both IGF-I and -II are believed to occur primarily in response to the activation of the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). The IGF-IR is structurally similar to the insulin receptor, consisting of α2 β2heterotetramers (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). The ligand binding domains are situated in the α-subunit, while the β-subunit contains the tyrosine kinase domain and various motifs responsible for the interaction with intracellular signaling proteins such as Shc, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, and IRS-2. In addition to effects on mitogenesis and differentiation, the IGF-IR has been implicated in the regulation of cell motility, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr.

Metab. 1997; 8: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several second messenger systems have been implicated in signaling the changes in cell behavior associated with IGF-IR activation. The phosphorylation of IRS-1 is an immediate consequence of IGF-IR activation (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 4Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IRS-1 then acts as a docking protein for multiple signaling proteins including Grb2, the p85 subunit of phosphoinositol-3′ kinase, the phosphatase PTP1D (Syp), Nck, and CrkII (4Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Adapter proteins such as Grb2, Nck, and Crk function to mediate protein-protein interactions and are believed to have an important role in regulating the activity of intracellular second messenger systems (6Feller S. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). v-Crk and its cellular homologs CrkII (7Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the more recently discovered Crk-like or CrkL protein (8ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp H. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar), are composed of Src homology (SH) domains and lack intrinsic enzymatic activity. SH2 and SH3 domains are modular structures found in many proteins and have been implicated in protein-protein interactions (6Feller S. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both Crk proteins are comprised of a single N-terminal SH2 domain and two SH3 domains (SH3-N, SH3-C), with a third member of the Crk family, CrkI, lacking the SH3-C due to the alternate splicing of CrkII mRNA (7Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The inducible binding of the Crk SH2 domains to phosphotyrosine motifs contained in the target proteins is believed to localize effector proteins bound constitutively to the Crk SH3 domains. Thus, the SH2 domain of CrkII has recently been suggested to link the focal adhesion proteins p130Cas and paxillin to the Jun kinase (JNK) pathway (9Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange protein C3G is bound constitutively to the SH3 domains in CrkII and is believed to activate JNK, which has been shown to be essential for the oncogenic functions of v-Crk (9Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Both Crk proteins have also been shown to mediate the association of C3G with tyrosine phosphorylated Cbl (10Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Druker B.J. Band H.

Biol. 1996; 16: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the Crk SH3 domains also bind to other signaling proteins including the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl (12Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and DOCK180 (13Hasegawa H. Kiyokawa E. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1770-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), suggesting that several pathways may be regulated by Crk. For example, CrkL reportedly links paxillin to BCR-Abl, an oncogenic form Abl (14Salgia R. Uemura N. Okuda K. Li J.-L. Pisick E. Sattler M. de Jong R. Druker B. Heisterkamp N. Chen L.B. Groffen J.

CrkII is tyrosylphosphorylated following the activation of the nerve growth factor receptor (trkA) (15Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7375-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) (16Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L. Barbazuk S.M. Turck C.W. Hirai H. Matsuda M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two nonreceptor kinases, c-Arg and c-Abl, have been shown to tyrosine phosphorylate Crk in vitro, while in fibroblasts derived from c-Abl knockout mice (Abl-/-), Crk phosphorylation is inhibited (12Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The tyrosylphosphorylation of tyrosine 221 or 222, depending on the species, located between the SH3-N and SH3-C of CrkII results in the formation of an intramolecular binding site for the SH2 domain (18Rosen M.K. Yamazaki T. Gish G.D. Kay C.M. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The formation of this intramolecular bond is believed to prevent the N-terminal SH2 and SH3 domains from associating with other proteins (12Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 18Rosen M.K. Yamazaki T. Gish G.D. Kay C.M. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus tyrosine phosphorylation represents a possible mechanism to control the protein binding activity of CrkII. Since a similar tyrosine-containing motif is also present in CrkL, the phosphorylation of this tyrosine (tyrosine 207) may regulate CrkL binding activity by a similar mechanism. While the function and regulation of the Crk proteins have been extensively examined in cell culture and in vitro systems, few studies have examined Crk in the intact animal. Accordingly, we examined whether the phosphorylation and protein-protein association of endogenous CrkII and CrkL change in response to IGF-IR activation in an IGF-responsive developing tissue, the uterus. The IGF-IR is known to have a critical role in mediating the effects of estrogen on the development of the uterus in the rodent. The development of the uterus is severely impaired in mice homozygous for a deletion of the IGF-I gene (19Baker J. Hardy M.P. Zhou J. Bondy C. Lupu F. Bellve A.R. Efstradiatis A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 903-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), while estrogen treatment of ovariectomized rats stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR β-subunit and IRS-1 (20Richards R.G.

Fetal bovine serum was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (UBI, Lake Placid, NY). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were starved overnight prior to treatment. rhIGF-I was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to a final concentration such that 100 μl contained a dose equivalent to 2 μg/g of body weight. Rats were anaesthetized using ketamine HCl (50 mg/kg intramuscular) and given a single intracardiac (ic) injection of rhIGF-I or diluent (PBS, pH 7.4). Animals were sacrificed by decapitation at the indicated times following injection, and the uterus was excised and snap frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were stored at −70 °C prior to extraction. Tissues were solubilized by homogenization for 30–60 s in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate (Na3OVO4), 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 60 mm N-octylglucoside, and 10% v/v glycerol). Lysates were precleared of intact cells and tissue debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove detergent-insoluble material. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the Bradford-Lowry reaction (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), with aliquots of the samples stored at −80 °C. Fibroblasts (NIH3T3) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mcg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 mcg/ml). Subfluent cultures in 100-mm dishes were serum starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for 18 h prior to stimulation with 10 nm rhIGF-I. Stable transfectants of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing CrkL were generated using pCXN2-CrkLR essentially as described for CrkII (5Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CrkL cDNA was excised from pSG5-CrkL (21ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretas T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into pCXN2, which was then introduced into NIH3T3 fibroblasts using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) followed by selection using Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 800–1600 μg of protein. For IRS-1 immunoprecipitations, lysates were diluted 1:4 in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.67 mmNa3OVO4, 0.4 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mm NaF, 0.133% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol). For all other immunoprecipitations, the samples were diluted in buffer C (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1% Triton X-100). Samples were precleared by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% w/v in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C with antibody, samples were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 2–4 h at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm Na3OVO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters for 4 h at 0.23 A. Filters were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies in PBST plus 1% BSA were allowed to bind to proteins overnight at 4 °C. After washing in PBST, the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, followed by extensive washes in PBST plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were detected using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL). Calculations and statistical analysis (t-test using Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons) were performed using Excel Version 6.0 (Microsoft Corp.). Prior to determining whether IGF-IR activation induced changes in Crk phosphorylation, we examined as a positive control the effect of IGF-I treatment on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Fig.1 is a representative Western blot showing the effect of IGF-I treatment on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-I in the rat uterus. Treatment of female rats starved overnight was associated with an approximately 2.0-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which was statistically significant at 3 min (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunoblotting with an anti-IRS-1 antibody confirmed that approximately equal amounts of IRS-1 protein were being precipitated, with the phosphorylation data shown in Fig. 1 B adjusted to account for any differences in the amount of IRS-1 protein in the precipitates CrkL immunoprecipitates from lysates of starved female rats treated with rhIGF-I or diluent using a polyclonal antibody revealed a broad band that migrated slower than CrkII. Immunoblotting of CrkL immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that only the slower migrating isoform of CrkL was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in both the basal and IGF-I-stimulated state (Fig.2 A). Treatment with rhIGF-I was associated with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the upper CrkL band compared with basal levels (Fig. 2 A). The amount of tyrosine phosphorylation in CrkL immunoprecipitates as determined by densitometry exhibited an approximately 2-fold increase in response to rhIGF-I treatment 3, 6, and 12 min after injection (Fig.2 B, and data not shown). To examine CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation, CrkII immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-CrkII antibodies. As with CrkL, a broad band was observed in immunoprecipitates using a polyclonal CrkII antibody, which on some gels resolved into a doublet. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was not detected, even upon prolonged exposure of immunoblots (30 min, data not shown). In comparison, tyrosine phosphorylation was easily observed in CrkL immunoprecipitates after a 30-s exposure. Treatment with rhIGF-I did not result in a change in CrkII phosphorylation in the rat uterus (data not shown). Having shown that IGF-I differentially regulates Crk phosphorylation, we next examined whether IGF-I also affected the association of CrkII and CrkL with other signaling proteins. We observed that a diffuse tyrosylphosphorylated protein in the region of 60–80 kDa was present in both CrkII and CrkL immunoprecipitates. Paxillin has an apparent molecular weight similar to the tyrosylphosphorylated protein we observed and has been shown to contain high affinity binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain (12Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The presence of paxillin in CrkII and CrkL immunoprecipitates was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figs.3 and 4). Treatment of starved female rats with rhIGF-I differentially regulated the association of tyrosylphosphorylated paxillin with CrkL and CrkII. The amount of paxillin in CrkL immunoprecipitates was reduced following rhIGF-I treatment (Fig. 3). The apparent dissociation of the paxillin-CrkL complex was observed to occur as early as 3 min after IGF-I treatment (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with rhIGF-I stimulated a marked increase in the association of paxillin with CrkII (Fig. 4). The increase in the association of paxillin with CrkII occurred as early as 3 min (data not shown).Figure 4Increased association of CrkII with paxillin in uterine lysates of starved rats treated with IGF-I. CrkII immunoprecipitates from females rats sacrificed 12 min following an ic injection of either 1 μg/g rhIGF-I (12) or diluent alone (0) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-paxillin (top panel), anti-phosphotyrosine (middle panel), or anti-CrkII (bottom panel) antibodies as described in Fig.4. A lane containing 10 μg of lysate (L) from one of the rats treated with diluent is shown for the paxillin blot. The blots shown are representative of two immunoprecipitations from the two animal studies shown in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since there have been no reports concerning the regulation of the association of either Crk protein with paxillin by IGF-Iin vitro, we next examined whether the changes in the association of Crk with paxillin observed in vivo also occur in cultured cells. The data from cell culture studies were similar to that observed in vivo. Fig. 5shows the effect of IGF-I treatment on the association of CrkL with paxillin in NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing CrkL (D20 and D22). IGF-I treatment resulted in a marked reduction in the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin (Fig. 5). CrkII and CrkL are involved in many processes requiring changes in the activity of intracellular signaling proteins, ranging from mitogen receptor signal transduction to cell adhesion. Data from studies using cultured cells indicate that the formation of multiprotein complexes containing the Crk proteins is involved in the signal transduction process of several receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (23Kizaka-Kondoh S.

Previous work in this laboratory has focused on the role of Crk in the signal transduction process of the IGF-IR. The overexpression of CrkII in 293 cells and fibroblasts increases the mitogenic response to IGF-I (5Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IGF-I treatment is also associated with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII while causing a marked reduction in the association of CrkII with IRS-1 (5Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In light of these data, we decided to examine whether IGF-IR activation in vivo regulates the phosphorylation of the Crk proteins and their interaction with paxillin, previously identified as having high affinity binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain (22Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The development of the uterus is regulated by the IGF system acting in a paracrine manner, with uterine growth severely retarded in mice in which theIgf1 gene has been deleted by homologous recombination (19Baker J. Hardy M.P. Zhou J. Bondy C. Lupu F. Bellve A.R. Efstradiatis A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 903-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). IGF-IR mRNA is expressed at all stages of uterine development in both the myometrium and endometrium, while IGF-I mRNA exhibits a more restricted pattern of expression that is dependent on the stage of development (19Baker J. Hardy M.P. Zhou J. Bondy C. Lupu F. Bellve A.R. Efstradiatis A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 903-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The data from the present study are significant in that the tyrosine phosphorylation and protein-protein association of CrkL and CrkII are differentially and rapidly regulated by IGF-Iin vivo. IGF-I treatment increased the association of CrkII with paxillin in the rat uterus. A recent report has shown that v-Crk signals via C3G and a Ras-like protein to the JNK pathway, with paxillin and p130 Cas postulated to act as docking sites important for the colocalization of the substrates necessary for the activation of this pathway (9Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that this pathway may also play an important role, and be physiologically relevant, in defining the actions of IGF-I on the growth and development of the uterus. While in vitro data indicate that the JNK pathway is activated by v-Crk, it is also possible that CrkII is affecting other pathways. For example, CrkII has also been shown to be important for Ras-induced ERK activation by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl while having no effect on epidermal growth factor receptor signaling to Ras (27Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). CrkL phosphorylation in the uterus increased markedly following IGF-I stimulation. In contrast, CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected and was not affected by IGF-I stimulation. The c-Abl and c-Arg tyrosine kinases have been reported to interact with and phosphorylate both CrkL and CrkII in vitro, while Crk phosphorylation is markedly reduced in cells not expressing Abl (12Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The constitutive interaction of CrkII and CrkL with Abl occurs through the binding of the Crk SH3 domains to a proline-rich motif in c-Abl. One possible explanation for the differential phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkL observed in the uterus is that the subcellular localization of CrkII, CrkL, and c-Abl are discrete in a way that does not favor phosphorylation of CrkII. Presumably, the Abl kinase is able to interact with and tyrosine phosphorylate CrkL in response to the stimulation of the IGF-IR. Another possibility is that a novel tyrosine kinase, specific for CrkL, is activated following IGF-I stimulation and is responsible for the phosphorylation of CrkL. Given the previous reports showing that CrkL and CrkII associate with similar proteins, and that Crk is not phosphorylated in Abl-/- fibroblasts (12Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 21ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretas T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar, 28Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar), the former hypothesis appears to be more likely. CrkII bound to paxillin under conditions where there was dissociation of CrkL, and in fact, CrkII association with paxillin increased markedly following IGF-I stimulation. This result suggests that the CrkL SH2 domain was no longer able to bind to tyrosine residues on paxillin following IGF-I stimulation. The phosphorylation of CrkL on tyrosine 207 and CrkII on tyrosine 221 results in the formation of an intramolecular SH2 binding site, inhibiting the intermolecular interactions of the Crk proteins(12, 18). If this model is correct, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL associated with IGF-I stimulation in the present study may account for the dissociation of CrkL from paxillin. Since we were unable to detect either CrkL or CrkII in paxillin immunoprecipitates (data not shown), we cannot determine which of the CrkII or CrkL isoforms bind to paxillin or, indeed, if phosphorylated CrkL forms a complex with paxillin. The difference in the effect of IGF-IR stimulation on the binding of CrkII and CrkL to paxillin is particularly intriguing given that the CrkII and CrkL SH2 domains have been reported to bind to the same two (P)YXXP motifs (Tyr-31 and Tyr-118) of the paxillin protein (14Salgia R. Uemura N. Okuda K. Li J.-L. Pisick E. Sattler M. de Jong R. Druker B. Heisterkamp N. Chen L.B. Groffen J. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29145-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This result may imply that CrkL associates with paxillin in the unstimulated state and is displaced by CrkII following IGF-IR activation of a CrkL tyrosine kinase. CrkL appeared to be more abundant in the uterus; therefore, when CrkL tyrosine phosphorylation is low it may act to inhibit the downstream effects of CrkII by saturating the Crk SH2 binding sites present in paxillin. Importantly, this result also implies that in the natural state CrkL and CrkII may be activating distinct signaling pathways, perhaps with mutually exclusive functions. In any event, the results from this study imply that the protein binding activity of CrkII and CrkL may be regulated independently following IGF-IR activation. The effect on IGF-IR activation on the association of CrkL and CrkII with paxillin may indicate a role for the focal adhesion complex in IGF-IR signal transduction. Paxillin, as a component of the focal adhesion complex (26Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 29Salgia R. Li J.-L. So S.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), may serve as solid phase on which the Crk proteins can bind and thereby localize effector proteins such as mSos, C3G, or Abl to their appropriate sites of action. CrkL has been reported to colocalize the Abl tyrosine kinase with paxillin (14Salgia R. Uemura N. Okuda K. Li J.-L. Pisick E. Sattler M. de Jong R. Druker B. Heisterkamp N. Chen L.B. Groffen J. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29145-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another focal adhesion protein, p130 Cas, has also been reported to contain multiple Crk SH2 binding sites (30Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and may, therefore, interact with CrkII and CrkL in a similar manner. Several studies have raised the possibility that the interaction of the Crk proteins with the focal adhesion complex may play an important role in activating signal transduction pathways. For example, the constitutive association of BCRAbl, CrkL, and p130 Cas has been shown to result in alterations in the structure of focal adhesion-like structures (31Salgia R. Pisick E. Sattler M. Li J.-L. Uemura N. Wong W.-K. Burky S.A. Hirai H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25198-25203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the stimulation of cell migration by IGF-I involves changes in the cytoskeletal structure, including an increase in p125 FAK and paxillin tyrosine-phosphorylation and the promotion of actin polymerization (3Leventhal P.S. Feldman E.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,32Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5214-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We initially chose to examine the effect of IGF-I treatment on IRS-1 phosphorylation as a positive control (20Richards R.G. DiAugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 on tyrosine residues occurs rapidly in response to IGF-IR activation (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 4Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the uterus, estrogen treatment of ovariectomized rats has been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of both the IGF-IR β-subunit and of IRS-1 (20Richards R.G. DiAugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our results support the hypothesis that the increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation observed with estrogen treatment is associated with an increase in the activity of the IGF-IR in the uterus. In conclusion, this study has shown that rapid changes in the tyrosylphosphorylation of CrkII and CrkL and their association with paxillin, a component of the focal adhesion complex, are features of signal transduction from the IGF-IR in the intact animal. These observations suggest that the formation and dissociation of multiprotein complexes containing Crk proteins are a physiological response to IGF-IR activation and may be involved in the stimulation of uterine growth by IGF-I. The different responses of CrkII and CrkL in terms of phosphorylation and association with paxillin indicate that these two proteins may possess distinct roles in the IGF-IR signal transduction process. Together, the results from this study provide important insights into the signal transduction process of a mitogenic receptor in the growing animal and provide the basis for future studies.

Indeed, analyses of both viral and endogenous glycoproteins expressed in epithelial cells, using recombinant DNA approaches, have shown that the information required for polarized transport depends on specific structural determinants contained in the newly synthesized glycoproteins (11Matter K.

In addition, studies using type I membrane glycoprotein chimeras as well as truncation mutants have suggested that the ectodomains of these membrane proteins possess signals for apical transport (9McQueen N.L.

Most recently, this idea has been extended to suggest that both secretory glycoproteins and the ectodomains of membrane glycoproteins may use N-linked carbohydrates either indirectly (19Wagner M. Morgans C. Koch-Brandt C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 84-88PubMed Google Scholar) or directly (20Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K.

Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) found that complete inhibition of glycosylation did not affect polarized viral glycoprotein expression. On the other hand, information for the basolateral transport of the vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein is contained within its cytoplasmic/transmembrane extension (23Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and furthermore, specific motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of several mammalian membrane protein receptors and lysosomal membrane glycoprotein lgp120 are now recognized to be essential for the targeting of these proteins to the basolateral surface (24Casanova J.E.

Of course, it should be noted that most of these studies have employed single-spanning membrane proteins with a type I topology (29Mellman I. Yamamoto E. Whitney A. Kim M. Hunziker W. Matter K. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has not been excluded that specific basolateral targeting information can also exist in protein luminal domains (9McQueen N.L.

HN is a type II membrane protein with a small N-terminal signal/anchor region and a large C-terminal ectodomain (33Hiebert S.W. Paterson R.G. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Paterson R.G. Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7520-7524Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In recent years, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) has been a favored reporter for protein targeting, as chimeric genes containing specific sorting information can relocate the normally cytosolic PK moiety to the nucleus (35Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar, 36Dang C.V. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4048-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (37Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), or the mitochondria (38Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 481-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With this in mind, a chimera including the signal/anchor portion of HN was found to redirect PK to the cell surface, suggesting that specific protein targeting information may reside in this region of HN (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear if this segment could also account for polarized apical delivery of HN. In this study, we have utilized HN-PK chimeras to examine this question in stably transfected MDCK cells. Construction of the HN48PK chimera via an in-frame EcoRI linker (5′-CGGAATTCC-3′, encoding the hydrophilic linker Arg-Asn-Ser) in pSV63 has been described (previously called APK) (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Intact HN48PK was excised from pSV63 withXhoI and subcloned first into pGEM7Z and then, usingHindIII and XbaI sites, into pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). This produced the plasmid pRC/HN48PK, encoding a protein joining HN residues 1–48 to PK residues 17–529 by a 3-amino acid linker (encoding Arg-Asn-Ser), driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. To construct HN72PK, an oligonucleotide (5′-TTGGATCCAAGCTTATGGTTGCAGAAGATGCCCCT-3′) containing a HindIII site followed by HN nucleotides 320–340 was used as an upstream primer, and an oligonucleotide (5′-GTCGGAATTCCTGCGACAGAGAGAATATT-3′) containing HN nucleotides 521–538 followed by an EcoRI linker was used as a downstream primer to amplify the N-terminal fragment 1–72 of the HN gene by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (40Chen S.Y. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5902-5909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragment was isolated after digestion withHindIII and EcoRI, and along with the PK moiety isolated from pRC/HN48PK by digestion with EcoRI and XbaI, a three-way ligation was performed using pRC/CMV vector that had been digested with HindIII andXbaI. Thus, the hybrid protein expressed by the recombinant plasmid pRC/HN72PK encodes HN residues 1–72 joined to PK residues 17–529 by a 3-amino acid linker (encoding Arg-Asn-Ser), driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. To construct secretory PK, an oligonucleotide (5′-ACTGAAGCTTATGGACAGCAAAGGT-3′) containing aHindIII site followed by bovine preprolactin nucleotides 68–83 was used as an upstream primer, and an oligonucleotide (5′-ATCGGAATTCCGGTGGAGACCACACC-3′) containing the sequence of preprolactin nucleotides 145–160 followed by an EcoRI linker was used as a downstream primer to amplify by polymerase chain reaction the preprolactin signal peptide provided in plasmid form (gift of Dr. V. Lingappa, University of California, San Francisco). The amplified DNA fragment was then isolated after digestion withHindIII and EcoRI, and along with the same PK cDNA moiety (isolated from pRC/HN48PK by digestion withEcoRI and XbaI), a three-way ligation was performed using pRC/CMV vector that had been digested withHindIII and XbaI. Thus, the hybrid protein expressed by this recombinant plasmid encodes the N-terminal cleavable prolactin signal peptide residues 1–31 joined to PK residues 17–529 by a 3-amino acid linker (encoding Arg-Asn-Ser), driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. MDCK cells (strain II) were transfected with the above recombinant plasmids by the Lipofectin method as described previously (40Chen S.Y. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5902-5909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies were selected and maintained in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Subclones of transfected MDCK cells were induced with 10 mm sodium butyrate for 16 h (26Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and then labeled for 2 h with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium. The labeled cells were lysed in 1 ml of TNT lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) plus 0.1% SDS, and the clarified lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-PK bound to protein A-agarose and analyzed by 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). At least two colonies expressing the desired protein from each cDNA construct were randomly selected for further analysis. Immunoprecipitated samples were denatured in 0.5% SDS plus 1% 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min; cooled; and then incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C with 10,000 units/ml PNGase F (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. Costar Transwell polycarbonate filter units with a pore size of 0.4 μm were used. Cells (2 × 106) were plated and grown for 4 days, and the formation of electrically tight cell monolayers was confirmed by measuring transepithelial resistance with chopstick electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Inc., New Haven, CT). All clones exhibited resistance between 100 and 125 Ω·cm2 prior to their use in experiments. Selective cell-surface biotinylation was performed according to published procedures (41Le Bivic A. Quaroni A. Nichils B. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For measurement of polarized protein distribution at steady state, biotinylated proteins isolated with streptavidin-agarose were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by specific immunoblotting. Filter-grown cells were pulse-labeled with 400 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium. After different periods of chase in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing excess methionine and cysteine, the apical and basolateral surfaces were selectively biotinylated as described above. The cells were then lysed in TNT lysis buffer, clarified by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were denatured in 1% SDS, diluted 10-fold into TNT lysis buffer, and then re-precipitated after incubation with 10 μl of 4% streptavidin-agarose (Sigma). The radiolabeled biotinylated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager. For assaying labeled secretion of PK, the transfected MDCK cell lines were either pulse-labeled as described above (see Fig. 4 B) or continuously labeled for 8 h with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (see Fig. 4 A). Media bathing the labeled cells were collected from either the apical or basolateral chamber, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The clarified media were examined by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Polarized MDCK cells grown on Transwell units were incubated with SV5 at 20 plaque-forming units/cell in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. At this time, the cells were washed, and the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% newborn calf sera. Infected cells were maintained at 37 °C for 14 h for further analysis. For immunoblotting, biotinylated samples were analyzed by reducing 8.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (0.2-μm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in the same buffer. Protein-bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated specific secondary antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Immunoblots were quantified by scanning densitometry. The method was validated by using serial dilutions of protein samples to establish a linear relationship of ECL densities in the range of protein concentrations studied. Monoclonal antibodies to SV5 HN were kindly provided by Dr. R. E. Randall (42Randall R.E. Young D.F. Goswami K.K.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2769-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An antiserum to chicken PK was prepared in rabbits, which received a total of 250 μg of antigen (five × 50 μg). The first intramuscular injection of PK was emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by three boosts at weekly intervals emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Finally, a single intravenous dose of PK (without adjuvant) was administered 5 days before bleeding. Previous studies have established that for chimeras that position the normally cytosolic PK moiety in the lumen of the secretory pathway, a major fraction of the expressed chimera undergoesN-linked glycosylation and intracellular transport to the cell surface (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since our goal was to attach putative signals for polarized protein targeting to the PK reporter, we first set out to examine the fate of a chimeric protein expressed after ligating a cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal 31-amino acid signal peptide of preprolactin directly to PK itself (“secretory PK”) (Fig.1). This signal peptide contains the information necessary for normal cleavage by signal peptidase (43Nothwehr S.F. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17202-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5735-5740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a threonine residue as the new N terminus of the mature protein. After G418 selection of stably transfected MDCK cells, clones expressing this form of PK were identified by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis. Unglycosylated secretory PK with an uncleaved signal is predicted to be a polypeptide of 547 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, whereas unglycosylated secretory PK after cleavage of the signal peptide is 517 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼56 kDa. Indeed, when we expressed a leaderless cytosolic form of PK in COS cells, this unglycosylated polypeptide lacking a signal peptide migrated on SDS-PAGE at the predicted size of ∼56 kDa (data not shown). For expression in the lumen of the secretory pathway, the PK cDNA sequence contains one potential N-linked glycosylation site (45Lonberg N. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3661-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we observed that in MDCK cells expressing secretory PK, intracellular immunoreactive forms of PK included different closely migrating species: the majority ran as an ∼58-kDa species, whereas a smaller portion ran at ∼56 kDa (Fig.2 A, second lane). 2Previous expression of the PK moiety in the lumen of the secretory pathway has established that a minor fraction of PK can undergo a second distinct N-glycosylation event at a non-consensus site (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We found that in all MDCK clones expressing secretory PK within the first 10 passages, besides ∼70% of PK that is singly glycosylated and migrates at ∼58 kDa, an additional minor form of intracellular and released PK could be detected at ∼60 kDa. We established that this minor form represented PNGase F- and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive glycosylation at a non-consensus site, in addition to the glycosylation that occurs at the consensus asparagine, identical to that which has been reported for a fraction of HN48PK (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For secretory PK, there is a hint of this doubly glycosylated form secreted into the medium of clonal MDCK cells from early passage in the second lane of Fig. 2 B. However, as a function of passage number, expression of this additionally glycosylated form diminished to below the limits of detection in our pulse-labeling experiments. We should note that the presence or absence of this additional glycosylation event had no detectable effect on the routing of secretory PK to the basolateral surface. To see if the larger form occurred as a consequence of N-linked glycosylation, the secretory PK forms expressed in MDCK cells were treated with PNGase F. In this case, all forms collapsed into a single species of ∼56 kDa (Fig. 2 A, third lane). Because PNGase F removes N-linked glycans that are added in the lumen of the secretory pathway, these molecular mass data strongly suggest that secretory PK had indeed been translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and underwent removal of the prolactin signal peptide and that most of the secretory PK receivedN-glycosylation as has been reported for the membrane-bound form (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such N-linked glycosylation has been proposed to have important benefits in favoring protein stability and export through the secretory pathway (46Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 47Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 48Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 49Wada I. Kai M. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 101-113Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the stability and export of newly synthesized secretory PK in MDCK cells over a 12-h chase. As expected at the zero chase time, secretory PK was quantitatively intracellular (Fig.3 A). There was intracellular loss of a portion (∼50%) of labeled PK during the first 2 h of chase (Fig. 3 B) that is not understood; loss was seen for both the 58- and 56-kDa forms (Fig. 3 A). Following this, however, between 2 and 12 h of chase, the remaining immunoprecipitable 58-kDa PK was progressively released from the cells to the medium, with t½ ≈ 4 h and with an efficiency of ∼90% over this time course (Fig. 3 C). As expected, PNGase F treatment converted PK in the medium back to an ∼56-kDa species (Fig. 2 B). The release of ∼58-kDa PK was not due to nonspecific cell leakage or lysis, as the 56-kDa form of PK was retained quantitatively within the MDCK cells (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, secretory PK recovered free in the medium was not sedimentable in a 1-h spin at high speed (data not shown). Thus, the data in Figs. 1, 2, 3 indicate that the prolactin signal-PK chimera enters the lumen of the secretory pathway and undergoes N-linked glycosylation. While a portion of the PK protein is apparently degraded intracellularly, the remaining glycosylated 58-kDa form is competent for intracellular transport and behaves as a valid secretory protein marker. Next, we investigated the polarity of PK secretion from filter-grown MDCK cells. Stable MDCK transfectants expressing secretory PK were continuously labeled for 8 h, and apical and basolateral media were collected and analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography (Fig. 4 A,upper panel). Interestingly, only 20% of secreted PK (∼58 kDa) was found on the apical side of transfected cells, with 80% recovered in the basolateral medium (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). By contrast, the endogenous MDCK secretory protein gp80/clusterin (50Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was released with apical predominance (data not shown). To exclude possible rapid apical secretion of PK followed by re-internalization and transcytosis to the basolateral side, polarized cell monolayers were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 5 min, and the kinetics of initial release of 58-kDa PK was followed as a function of chase time (Fig. 4 B, left panels). Evidently, from the moment that PK secretion is first detected, the protein is directly delivered with a fixed polarized ratio leading to ∼80% in the basolateral medium (Fig. 4 B, right panel). Clearly, the glycosylated PK molecule exhibits no sorting signal for apical specific transport in MDCK cells. We next examined the expression of the HN48PK chimera (Fig. 1), in which the HN N terminus including its signal/anchor is linked to the luminally oriented PK protein (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates with anti-PK serum from cells transfected with pRC/HN48PK revealed two closely migrating species, a major band at ∼67 kDa and a slightly less intense band at ∼65 kDa (Fig. 5 A). When treated with PNGase F to remove N-linked oligosaccharides, the two different species migrated with the same mobility as a nonglycosylated form at ∼63 kDa (Fig. 5 B), in agreement with previous reports (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the luminal domain of HN48PK underwent N-linked glycosylation in MDCK cells, as is the case for secretory PK (Fig. 2) and for HN48PK expression in CV1 cells, where the chimera underwent glycosylation en route to residence at the cell surface (39Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To examine the polarized surface distribution of the HN48PK chimera in filter-grown MDCK cells, we utilized cell-surface biotinylation. As a control, in SV5-infected MDCK cells, ∼95% of blottable HN was found on the apical surface (Fig.6, left). Interestingly, linking the N-terminal region containing the signal/anchor of HN to PK (Fig. 1) caused a change in the targeting of the glycosylated PK reporter (Fig. 5) from a basolateral (Fig. 4) to an apical surface distribution. Specifically, ∼75% of HN48PK was now present on the apical surface of transfected cells (Fig. 6,right). The data indicate that the N-terminal region of HN, even when transplanted onto a basolaterally targeted luminal domain, by itself is sufficient for preferential apical distribution, although this steady-state distribution is less completely apical than that found for the full-length HN protein in the setting of expression with other viral components. To determine whether the apical distribution of HN48PK was accomplished by direct polarized delivery from thetrans-Golgi network, we examined the kinetics of first appearance of the newly synthesized protein on the apical and basolateral surfaces. Filter-grown monolayers were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min and chased for various times. At each chase interval, replicate cell monolayers were biotinylated on either the apical or basolateral side. As a control, virally infected MDCK cells were examined, and it was found that initial delivery of intact HN was ≥90% to the apical surface (Fig.7 A), whereas the HN48PK protein arrived at 90 and 180 min with an apical preference in the 80–85% range (Fig. 7 B) (and this apical delivery was already detectable at 45 min (data not shown)). The ratio of polarized initial delivery of HN48PK (apical/basolateral ≥ 4:1) to the cell surface was slightly higher than the ratio of protein distribution at steady state (apical/basolateral ≅ 3:1), just opposite of what would be expected if this protein distribution were derived from basolateral to apical transcytosis. Thus, these results indicate that the polarized sor"

Gel filtration analysis showed that urea at low concentrations, 1.0–1.2m, dissociated the RecA oligomer to almost a monomeric state prior to the unfolding of each molecule. Upon treatment with 1.0 m urea, the circular dichroism spectrum showed a decrease in the α-helical content of RecA. A similar decrease was observed in the absence of urea for RecA at an extremely low protein concentration; the RecA oligomer dissociated to an almost completely monomeric state. The properties of RecA at low urea concentrations were similar to those of a truncated RecA lacking the first 33 N-terminal residues (Δ33RecA). Addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 33 N-terminal residues to Δ33RecA increased the α-helical content. These results suggest that local folding of the N-terminal domain is coupled to protein-protein interactions of monomeric RecA, which are involved in the regulation of filament formation.

A. 1980; 77: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Sancar A. Stachelek C. Konigsberg W. Rupp W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2611-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), characterized by numerous functional properties in its active form (3Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 229-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 4Egelman E.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 189-197Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These actions include homologous recombination of DNA strands, self-polymerization in the presence or absence of DNA, DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP, and stimulation of autocleavage of LexA and certain other repressor proteins. RecA forms various quaternary structures, which are inherent in the activities exhibited by the protein. RecA is active only when it forms a nucleoprotein filament, which consists of a helical array of monomers bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. This highly ordered structure is sustained predominantly by protein-protein interactions between contiguous monomers (6Williams R.C. Spengler S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RecA is an α/β protein, and its polypeptide chain is folded into three continuous domains, referred to as the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-binding site has been assigned to the central domain by analyzing the structure of the crystal containing ADP (8Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although no crystal of the RecA-DNA complex has been analyzed, two unordered loops in the central domain are presumed to be the DNA-binding sites (9Wang Y. Adzuma K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30927-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One interesting feature of crystalline RecA is that the RecA molecules form a helical filament even in the absence of DNA (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Based on the structure in the crystal, two regions involved in protein-protein interaction have been identified; the N-terminal domain interacts with a complementary site in the central domain of the adjacent molecule in the filament. Nevertheless, the filament structure in the crystal resembles that of an inactive filament when observed by electron microscopy (14Stasiak A. Egelman E.H. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, in the absence of DNA and nucleotides, RecA exists in multiple oligomeric states (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford III, W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and protein-protein interactions within these oligomers have not been well studied. We have recently studied the properties of an N-terminally truncatedE. coli RecA, designated Δ33RecA, which lacks the first 33 amino acid residues (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Δ33RecA shows reduced self-association, which results in reduced DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, in the presence of MgCl2 Δ33RecA does self-associate, although a higher protein concentration and longer time are required for completion of the process than for the wild-type protein. These results suggested that the 33 N-terminal amino acid residues play an important role not only in protein-protein interactions but also kinetic regulation of the self-association process. Separately, a controversial observation has been reported; a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 24 amino acids of RecA was able to bind to DNA when the peptide underwent a conformational change from an unordered structure to an α-helix (18Zlotnick A. Brenner S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 209: 447-457Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further study is required to reveal the region involved in the self-association of RecA. To investigate the self-association process in detail, we studied the urea-induced denaturation of RecA. In the case of an oligomeric protein like RecA, studying denaturation can provide information about protein-protein interactions, because it involves dissociation of the oligomers in addition to unfolding of the monomers. Moreover, for a multifunctional and multidomain protein like RecA, stepwise denaturation may result in the stepwise loss of its functional properties. In this study, we found that partial unfolding was coupled to dissociation of the RecA oligomer. Interestingly, the properties of RecA at low urea concentrations were similar to those of Δ33RecA. We then synthesized a peptide corresponding to the first 33 N-terminal amino acid residues of RecA (Rec33) and investigated its properties. The results obtained suggest that a local folding transition in the N-terminal domain occurs upon protein-protein interaction of monomeric RecA. E. coli RecA (19Kuramitsu S. Hamaguchi K. Tachibana H. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2363-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Δ33RecA (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. The RecA concentration was determined using an ε278 value of 2.16 × 104m−1cm−1 (19Kuramitsu S. Hamaguchi K. Tachibana H. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2363-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A peptide, corresponding to 33 N-terminal residues of E. coli RecA, was synthesized using a peptide synthesizer (model PSSM-8, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) by the solid-phase method using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry. The sequence of the peptide was NH2-AIDENKQKALAAALGQIEKQFGKGSIMRLGEDR-CONH2. The crude peptide was purified by preparative HPLC on a C18column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptide was stored at −30 °C after lyophilization. The identity of the peptide was checked by amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing. The peptide concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Bovine carbonic anhydrase II and adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) were purchased from Sigma and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. All other reagents of analytical grade were purchased commercially. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a spectropolarimeter (model J-500A, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an interface and computer. For denaturation experiments, protein samples were incubated for at least 2 h at each urea concentration prior to carrying out spectroscopic measurements. Gel filtration analysis was performed using a Superdex 200 HR column (1 cm × 30 cm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in a Gilson HPLC chromatography system. For denaturation experiments, the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h at each concentration of urea and were eluted with buffer containing the same concentration of urea at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the following proteins: immunoglobulin G (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (64 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (43 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa). Blue dextran was also used for column calibration. The elution profile was monitored by recording the absorbance at 220 or 230 nm. All the measurements were performed at approximately 25 °C. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 4 h in 3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing various concentrations of urea, and then MgCl2 was added to produce a final concentration of 10 mm. From 30 s after mixing, the turbidity was monitored at 360 nm using a spectrophotometer (model U-3000, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). All the measurements were performed at 25 °C. Hydrolysis of ATP by RecA was measured by an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay (20Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with some modifications (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We investigated the urea-induced denaturation of wild-type RecA using CD spectroscopy. All measurements were performed after incubation of the samples for 2 h at 25 °C. Control measurements showed no difference in the signals of samples that had been incubated at 25 °C for 2 h and 24 h. These results indicate that the folding equilibrium was reached within 2 h at each urea concentration. The CD spectra of 10 μm RecA in the far-UV region are shown in Fig. 1 A. Without urea, RecA showed negative double maxima at approximately 210 and 220 nm, which is characteristic of an α-helix. In the presence of 0.8 or 1.2 m urea, the ellipticity at around 220 nm decreased, whereas that at around 210 nm was almost unaltered. When the concentration of urea was increased to 2.0 m and beyond, the intensity over the whole wavelength range decreased coincidentally. Addition of 8.0 m urea resulted in substantial loss of the signal. As shown in Fig. 1 B (closed circles), the ellipticity at 222 nm decreased gradually as the concentration of urea increased (in this figure, the CD amplitudes are expressed as the molar ellipticity, θ M,222, to make it easy to compare the amplitudes of wild-type RecA and Δ33RecA). Although cooperative transitions were difficult to see clearly, a small transition was recognized at low urea concentrations. The transition midpoint was estimated to be at approximately 1.0 m urea, although no stable intermediate state was observed and the plateau in the transition curve was difficult to define. The transient intermediate state at a urea concentration of approximately 1.2m possessed approximately 85% of the native CD spectral amplitude. This reduced intensity indicates that RecA in the presence of 1.2 m urea was in a partially unfolded state. By contrast, such a transition was not observed for Δ33RecA (Fig.1 B, open circles); low concentrations of urea, up to 1.2 m, had little effect on the intensity of its CD signal, which was close to that of wild-type RecA with 1.2m urea. These results imply that the transition observed for the wild-type protein with approximately 1.0 m urea is associated with the N-terminal region. The CD spectra of RecA in the near-UV region, 250–320 nm, are shown in Fig.2 A. The spectra in the presence of 0 and 0.8 m urea were similar to each other. When the concentration of urea was increased to 1.2 m, the shape of the spectrum altered and its sign at around 275 nm changed from plus to minus. The change in the mean residue ellipticity at 275 nm with the change of urea concentration is shown in Fig.2 B. This transition curve was at least biphasic, and the cooperativity of the first phase was much higher than that of the second. The transition midpoint was at approximately 1.0 murea for the first phase, whereas that for the second phase was difficult to determine. It was of interest that the sign of the signal changed from plus to minus upon the first transition. This suggests that the microenvironments around the side chains of the aromatic amino acids were drastically altered at approximately 1.0 m urea. Since the signal amplitude was almost zero in the presence of 8m urea, the transient intermediate near 1.2 murea was probably retained an ordered structure, which may differ from that in the native state. Note that the midpoints for the first transition in the near-UV region and for the transition in the far-UV region were very close to each other. The spectrum of Δ33RecA in the native state was similar to that of the wild-type protein with 1.2 m urea (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its transition curve for urea denaturation was distinct from that of wild-type protein; no transition was recognized in the range of 0–3.0m urea (Fig. 2 B, open circles). Together with the far-UV CD spectra, this result implies that the N-terminal region is associated with the spectral transition of the wild-type protein with approximately 1.0 m urea. At 10 μm, RecA exists in multiple oligomeric states (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To reveal whether the transitions observed above reflected dissociation, unfolding, or both, the dependence of these transitions on the protein concentration was investigated (Fig. 3). In the far-UV region, the transition midpoint for the first transition was shifted to approximately 0.7 m urea at a protein concentration of 1 μm, whereas for 10 μmprotein it was approximately 1.0 m urea (Fig.3 A). This dependence suggests that the first transition in the far-UV CD spectrum was associated with an oligomeric state of the protein. At a protein concentration of 40 μm, the transition curve was almost the same as that for 10 μmprotein. This implies that, at concentrations above 10 μm, the oligomeric states of RecA were equivalent to changes in the secondary structure caused by the low concentration of urea. A dependence on the protein concentration was also observed for the spectral transition in the near-UV region (Fig. 3 B). At a protein concentration of 1 μm, the transition midpoint was shifted to approximately 0.6 m urea, which appeared to be close to the midpoint, 0.7 m urea, for 1 μm protein in the far-UV region. Contrary to the transition in the far-UV region, however, increasing the protein concentration to 40 μm resulted in a shift of the transition midpoint to approximately 1.2 m urea. These results suggest that this transition in the near-UV region was more directly related to the oligomeric states of the protein than that in the far-UV region. This interpretation may be supported by the fact that the near-UV CD spectra reflect tertiary and quaternary structures of the protein. Therefore, it appears that the spectroscopic transition observed with low concentrations of urea is associated with the dissociation process in the denaturation of RecA. Since complete denaturation of the oligomeric enzyme must involve dissociation to monomers, we wanted to know whether the transient intermediates observed above were oligomeric or monomeric. To evaluate the oligomeric state and the compactness of the molecule, gel filtration of RecA was performed in the presence of urea (Fig.4 A). In the absence of urea, RecA at 10 μm was eluted predominantly in the void volume of the column, and small fractions of the protein were also eluted at larger volumes, indicating that RecA exists as various forms of oligomers in equilibrium. As the concentration of urea was increased to 1.0 m, the elution peak broadened and the average size of the RecA molecules decreased, as summarized in the inset in Fig. 4 A. This behavior was considered to reflect the process of RecA oligomer dissociation as the urea concentration increased. When the concentration of urea was increased to 1.2 m, a large peak appeared near the void volume and a small peak was detected at 13.4 ml, which was the largest elution volume among the samples examined in this study. On the basis of the elution volumes of molecular mass standards in the native conformation, an elution volume of 13.4 ml corresponded to a relative molecular mass of approximately 55,000 in a folded conformation. This value is significantly larger than that of the RecA monomer calculated from its amino acid sequence. At a urea concentration of 1.4 m, RecA was eluted almost as a single peak, which was near the void volume of the column. Small peaks near the void volume were also observed for 0.8–1.2 m urea. Since unfolding of the polypeptide chain is expected to cause expansion of the apparent volume of the molecule, it is reasonable to consider that these peaks near the void volume corresponded to an unfolded state of the RecA molecule. The small drifts in the range of elution volume from 8 to 12 ml for urea concentrations above 1.0 m may also correspond to a variety of unfolded molecules. As the concentration of urea was increased further, the elution volumes increased only slightly (Fig. 4 A, inset), but the shapes of their peaks became sharper, implying that the apparent size of the molecules had become larger. As a control experiment, we examined the elution profile of Δ33RecA (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of urea, the elution volume of Δ33RecA was a little larger than that of the wild-type monomer, indicating that it exists as a monomer. At a urea concentration of 1.2m, Δ33RecA was eluted near the void volume of the column (data not shown). As denaturation of Δ33RecA did not involve dissociation, we concluded that this peak corresponded to an unfolded state of the molecule. This result supports the notion that the peak of wild-type RecA that eluted near the void volume corresponds to an unfolded state. Therefore, the results indicate that dissociation of RecA oligomer is followed by unfolding of the monomer. To further investigate the effect of urea on the oligomeric state of RecA, self-association in the presence of urea was examined by adding MgCl2 to the solution, since MgCl2 has been shown to induce association of RecA (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The turbidity resulting from RecA aggregation is considered to be represented by the optical density of the solution at 360 nm, as shown in Fig. 5 A. Without urea, the absorbance at 360 nm increased drastically immediately after the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. At a urea concentration of 0.2m, an increase in turbidity also occurred immediately after the addition of MgCl2, and association was almost complete 30 min later. The increase in turbidity became sigmoidal above 0.4m urea and the time required for aggregation was much longer above 0.8 m urea. For 10 μm RecA, there was little increase in turbidity even after 200 min at a urea concentration above 1.0 m, as shown in Fig. 5 B(dotted line). These results suggest that the structural transition at approximately 1.0 m urea rendered RecA incapable of self-association. By contrast, when the protein concentration was increased to 40 μm, the turbidity increase occurred even in the presence of 1.0 m and 1.1 m urea (Fig. 5 B). The increases were sigmoidal and the time required for aggregation was more than 1 h. These results indicate that the deficiency in self-association was compensated for, to some extent, by raising the protein concentration. We also studied the ability of RecA to bind to ATP in the presence of urea by monitoring the CD spectra in the near-UV region (Fig.6 A). When ATP bound to RecA in the absence of urea, the CD signal at around 260 nm increased drastically, as shown in Fig. 6 A (inset) (21Watanabe R. Masui R. Mikawa T. Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When ATP was added to RecA with 0.8 m urea, a smaller increase in the signal amplitude was observed only at around 285 nm. With 1.0 m urea, the addition of ATP resulted in a slight increase in ellipticity above 275 nm. These spectral changes indicated binding of ATP to RecA since the spectra of the mixtures were much larger than the sum of the spectra for RecA alone and ATP alone. With 1.2 m urea, little significant increase in the ellipticity was observed, indicating almost no binding of ATP to the protein. Therefore, these results suggest that the presence of urea affects the ability of RecA to bind to ATP. This may rationalize the observation that the addition of adenine nucleotides had no effect on the transition curve in the far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 6 B). The study of urea denaturation indicated that the oligomeric state of RecA was reflected in the CD spectra. Since equilibrium of a variety of oligomeric forms depends on protein concentration as well as pH, ionic strength, and temperature (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we speculated that the CD spectrum of RecA varies with the protein concentration. To confirm the dependence of the oligomeric state of RecA on its concentration, we analyzed the oligomeric state of RecA by gel filtration. The elution profiles of RecA are shown at various concentrations ranging from 0.075 to 10 μm (Fig.7). As the protein concentration decreased, the average size of the protein molecules decreased. These profiles had no distinguishable peak or shoulder, suggesting a rapid equilibrium among the various forms of the oligomer. Even when RecA was applied at 0.075 μm, the main peak was eluted at a volume of approximately 14.0 ml, corresponding to a globular protein with a relative molecular mass of approximately 46,000. This value was significantly larger than the value of 38,000 calculated from its primary structure, but was considerably smaller than expected for a dimer of RecA. Although this discrepancy might reflect a non-globular shape of the RecA molecule, it appears that the equilibrium of oligomeric states of RecA was biased toward the monomeric state at extremely low protein concentrations. Next, we measured the far-UV CD spectrum of 0.065 μm RecA (Fig. 8 A, continuous line). This spectrum was clearly similar to that of Δ33RecA (dotted line). As shown in Fig. 8 B, the ellipticity at 222 nm depended on the protein concentration; it increased over the concentration range 0.5–5.0 μm, whereas below 0.5 μm and over 5.0 μm, it remained almost constant at the respective ellipticities. By contrast, the ellipticity at 208 nm was virtually unaltered in the region between 0.1 and 50 μm protein. These results indicate that the decrease in ellipticity at approximately 220 nm was related to the dissociation process, even though the dissociation was induced by lowering the protein concentration. According to this relationship, ellipticity at 222 nm can be considered to be an indication of an oligomeric state of RecA. The dependence of the oligomeric states, estimated from the ellipticity, on protein concentration seems similar to that obtained by electron microscopy (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an equilibrium constant for the interaction between RecA monomers can be estimated from the data shown in Fig.8 B, although there are several possible descriptions of this oligomerization process, which depend on the relative stabilities of distinct oligomers (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If the monomers (A) and hexamers (A6) are significantly populated states in the transition zone, the overall reaction will be described as a concerted reaction in the following manner. 6A⇌KdA6, REACTION1The dissociation constant (K d ) is defined as shown in Equation 1. Kd=[A]6/[A6].Equation 1 The brackets denote concentration. The total concentration (A0) of monomers and hexamers is related to the respective concentrations, as shown in Equation 2. [A0]=[A]+6[A6]Equation 2 The observed ellipticity (θobs) is expressed as shown in Equation 3. θobs=θA·[A]+θA6·[A6]Equation 3 θA and θA6 are the molar ellipticities of the monomers and hexamers, respectively. The values of θA and θA6 were determined from the data in Fig. 8 B. The parameter K d was determined by fitting Equation 3 to the observed ellipticities at various concentrations of A0. The determined value ofK d was approximately 0.1 μm. Thedotted line in Fig. 8 B indicates the theoretical curve constructed using this value. The CD amplitude was restored by concentrating the diluted RecA solution (data not shown). In addition, the CD spectra of the 5 μm RecA solution containing 1.0 m urea recovered after dialysis to approximately 90% of those seen in the absence of urea (data not shown). These results suggest that alterations to the secondary structure of RecA caused by lowering the protein concentration or by adding low concentrations of urea are reversible, and they also appear to support the notion that this transition is associated with the dissociation process. The properties of RecA at low concentrations of urea were similar to those of Δ33RecA, which lacks the first 33 amino acid residues (see “Discussion”). This similarity suggests that the partial unfolding upon dissociation of RecA oligomers occurs in the N-terminal region. To verify the involvement of the N-terminal region in the association/dissociation process, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to residues 1–33 of the wild-type protein, designated Rec33, and characterized its structural properties. The far-UV CD spectrum of Rec33 did not show any feature characteristic of an ordered structure, as depicted in Fig.9A (thick line). When Δ33RecA was added to this peptide, the ellipticity of the mixture showed an apparent increase in the regions centered at around 220 nm and 210 nm compared with the sum of the spectra of Rec33 and Δ33RecA. The difference between the spectrum of the mixture and that of Δ33RecA alone is shown in Fig. 9A (thin line). The difference spectrum appears to be characteristic of an α-helix, since it shows double maxima at around 210 and 220 nm. Furthermore, the spectrum of the mixture of Δ33RecA and Rec33 was similar to that of the wild-type protein, although the ellipticity of the former was slightly smaller than that of the latter (data not shown). These results indicate that some secondary structures including an α-helix were induced upon interaction between Δ33RecA and Rec33. Addition of Rec33 to RecA, even up to 10 times the amount of the wild-type protein (1–10 μm), resulted in little induction of α-helical content, as shown in Fig. 9 A(dotted line), indicating very weak interaction between them (K d > 1 mm). Therefore, the possibility that a nonspecific interaction between Rec33 and RecA had induced the conformational change was ruled out. As a control experiment, we replaced Δ33RecA with carbonic anhydrase, which is similar to RecA in size (M r approximately 30,000) and isoelectric point (5.4), and observed no additional increase in the spectrum of the mixture compared with the sum of the individual spectra (data not shown). This result excludes the possibility that Rec33 nonspecifically interacted with Δ33RecA. To analyze the functional interaction of these fragments, the effect of Rec33 binding to Δ33RecA was studied using an ssDNA-dependent ATPase assay. Δ33RecA showed no ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity, as reported previously (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Addition of Rec33, even up to 10 times the amount of Δ33RecA, induced no increase in the ATPase activity (data not shown). As RecA-mediated reactions require an active nucleoprotein filament, this result indicates that the Rec33-Δ33RecA complex failed to form a helical filament, which is directly related to the self-association process. This result also suggests the mode of interaction between Rec33 and Δ33RecA (see “Discussion”). In the absence of DNA and nucleotides, RecA exists in multiple oligomeric states in reversible equilibrium with the distribution depending on solution conditions. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation has indicated that monomers, trimers, hexamers, and dodecamers are the predominant oligomeric species (16Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford III, W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analyses also revealed four discrete aggregation states: monomers, rings, rods, and large bundles of rods (15Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among them, the rings are hexameric and most likely planar and the protein-protein interactions within the rings must be significantly different from those within the filaments (22Yu X. Angov E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Egelman E.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2728-2738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the filament structure observed in the crystalline form, the N-terminal domain directly contributes to the contacts between the proteins (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A.

We had previously studied Δ33RecA, a truncated RecA protein lacking the first 33 amino acid residues, and our results indicated that the N-terminal region of RecA plays an important role in protein-protein interaction not only in the filaments but also in smaller oligomeric forms (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Yu and Egelman (23Yu X. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) recently proposed a structure for the hexameric rings, in which the N-terminal domain is involved in protein-protein interactions but in a different manner from that within the filaments. In this study, we investigated further the self-association process using denaturation experiments, and our results indicate that partial unfolding and folding accompany the dissociation of RecA oligomers and the association of RecA monomers, respectively. Partial unfolding of the RecA molecule at low concentrations of urea or at an extremely low protein concentration can explain our inability to detect a compact monomer by gel filtration. Another possible explanation is that the RecA monomer exists in a molten globule state; however, the near-UV CD spectra obtained with 1.2 m urea showed that RecA retained an ordered tertiary structure, although it was different from that of the native state. In addition, no increase in the fluorescence intensity of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid was observed in the course of urea-induced denaturation of RecA (data not shown). These results exclude the possibility that the intermediate state corresponds to a molten globule state. Therefore, it is probable that unfolding upon dissociation occurs locally in a specific region of the molecule. The results also suggest the region at which the local unfolding occurs. RecA with low concentrations of urea showed some properties distinct from the intact protein: 1) compared with that of the intact protein, the CD amplitude centered at around 220 nm was reduced, as was that of the protein at an extremely low concentration without urea; 2) the near-UV CD spectrum was changed drastically and the CD signal centered at around 275 nm was altered from plus to minus; 3) the CD spectral change upon binding to ATP was much smaller than that for the native protein and a signal increase was observed only at around 285 nm; 4) RecA showed reduced self-association induced by MgCl2, but a higher protein concentration and longer incubation time than that used without urea enabled the protein to self-associate and aggregate in the presence of urea. All these biochemical properties closely resemble those of Δ33RecA (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, no transition was recognized in the denaturation curves of CD spectra for Δ33RecA in the region of low urea concentrations. Therefore, we conclude that a folding transition of the N-terminal domain occurs upon protein-protein interaction. The results of the present study, together with the crystal structure (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 23Yu X. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), yield a picture of the protein-protein interaction of RecA (Fig. 10). In the absence of urea, the N-terminal domain is unfolded at low protein concentrations and it folds into an α-helix upon self-association when the protein concentration is increased. In the presence of low concentrations of urea, the N-terminal domain is unfolded even at high protein concentrations, but self-association occurs to some extent. In addition, Δ33RecA self-associates only at high protein concentrations. Low concentrations of urea have no effect on Δ33RecA due to lack of the N-terminal domain. The preferred unfolding of the N-terminal domain in the presence of urea, even at a high protein concentration, may be ascribed to its protrusion from the molecule and also from the helical filament (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). To verify more directly that the N-terminal domain undergoes a conformational change upon self-association, we carried out a folding interaction experiment using Rec33 and Δ33RecA and detected an increase in the secondary structure upon the interaction of these two fragments. Based on the model proposed above, it is probable that the site on Δ33RecA that binds Rec33 is the region which, in the wild-type protein, would contact the N-terminal domain of an adjacent molecule, rather than being the region which its own N-terminal domain should occupy. Such reconstituted RecA molecules are composed of folded Rec33 and Δ33RecA fragments, but the mode of combination of those fragments is distinct from that of the wild-type protein. This “permuted” RecA protein inevitably lacks the ability to form a filament structure, which is essential for RecA-mediated reactions. Actually, the near-UV CD spectrum of the Δ33RecA-Rec33 mixture was similar to that of Δ33RecA, and the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Δ33RecA was not restored by the addition of Rec33 (data not shown), indicating the inability of these two fragments to reconstitute a protein capable of assembling into an active filament. We could speculate that Rec33 occupied the position on Δ33RecA corresponding to the N-terminal domain of the wild-type protein; however, the peptide could not adopt an α-helical conformation because the intrinsic conformation of the N-terminal domain in a monomeric state is in an unordered structure. Furthermore, based on the tertiary structure, it seems unlikely that Rec33 was located at the position corresponding to the N-terminal domain of the wild-type protein because the N-terminal domain protrudes from the RecA molecule (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The finding of a local folding transition of the N-terminal domain enabled us to investigate a primary reaction of the self-association process. By fitting the equation for an equilibrium between the monomers and hexamers to the observed ellipticities, the dissociation constant for the interaction between RecA monomers was determined to be approximately 0.1 μm. Such spectroscopic analyses will be useful for further investigations of the self-association processes of RecA. Another important aspect of the proposed model is that the N-terminal domain is involved in kinetic regulation of the self-association process. We suggested previously that the N-terminal region of RecA plays an important role not only in protein-protein interactions but also in kinetic regulation of the self-association process (17Mikawa T. Masui R. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since treatment with a low concentration of urea resulted in a slow rate of association/dissociation, it is probable that an energy barrier between oligomeric states of RecA is reduced by the unfolding of the N-terminal domain. It has been shown that the association/dissociation process of RecA is entropically driven and that a significant number of water molecules is required to facilitate association/dissociation (16Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford III, W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There are several well ordered water molecules largely buried in the interface between neighboring monomers (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Therefore, the absence or unfolding of the N-terminal domain, which constitutes one complementary face in the interface, should result in a decrease in the number of bound water molecules, leading to slow kinetics for interactions between RecA molecules. Although the intermediates in the self-association pathways, including nucleoprotein filament formation, have not been defined, it has been indicated that the oligomeric structure must disassemble into smaller oligomeric structures, probably monomers, prior to filament formation (16Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford III, W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As these processes necessarily include the dissociation/association processes, the folding transition of the N-terminal domain may have relevance to the oligomeric equilibrium of RecA. It has been reported that a peptide corresponding to the first 24 amino acid residues of RecA stoichiometrically binds to ssDNA, which is associated with a folding transition from an unordered structure to an α-helix (18Zlotnick A. Brenner S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 209: 447-457Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that induction of an α-helical conformation by the Rec33 occurs upon interaction not only with Δ33RecA but also with poly(dT) (Fig. 9 B). It is uncertain whether or not the N-terminal region is involved in binding to ssDNA, since the structure of the RecA-DNA complex has not been determined. The central and C-terminal regions, in addition to the N-terminal region, may be involved in protein-protein interactions and the accompanying structural changes. Near-UV CD spectra may help us to obtain information about these parts of the protein; these spectra are affected by alterations of the microenvironments of the aromatic residues and most of the aromatic residues are contained in those regions. The midpoint of the first phase on [θ]275 in urea denaturation of RecA was dependent on the protein concentration over the range 1–40 μm (Fig. 3 B). When 40 μm RecA was treated with 1.0–1.1 m urea, the ability of the protein to self-associate was retained to some extent (Fig. 5 B), even though the N-terminal domain was unfolded (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, the spectral change in the near-UV region is thought to be closely associated with the protein-protein interaction itself, whereas the far-UV region is related to the folding state of the N-terminal region. The E. coli RecA protein contains seven tyrosine and two tryptophan residues (7Story R.M. Weber I. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Tyr65 is situated in the center of the central domain. Tyr103 and Tyr218 are located on the surface of the interface between contiguous RecA molecules in the crystal structure and it seems likely that these residues contribute to the CD spectrum in the near-UV region. The other three tyrosine and both tryptophan residues are located in the C-terminal domain. The environment of the side chains of these residues may be altered upon association/dissociation. If this is the case, a dynamic movement or conformational change would be expected to occur in the C-terminal domain. We are grateful to Drs. M. Hoshino and Y. Goto (Osaka University) and N. Yumoto (Osaka National Research Institute, AIST, MIT) for their help with the synthesis of Rec33."

One of the earliest methods devised for the selective delivery of unmodified bioactive molecules into target cells used bispecific antibodies (1Raso V.A. Griffin T.

By virtue of their dual specificity (4Nisonoff A. Rivers M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 93: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), these agents can noncovalently bind an effector moiety and simultaneously attach to specific antigenic sites on the cell membrane. Those initial studies used the plant toxin ricin or its enzymatically active A chain, whereas subsequent work used saporin (5Glennie M.J. Brennard D.M. Bryden F. McBride H.M. Stirpe F. Worth A.T. Stevenson G.T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3662-3670PubMed Google Scholar) as a functional agent. Even though these complexes were internalized and ultimately killed target cells, neither the mechanism for antibody-toxin dissociation nor the intracellular compartment in which this release occured was known.Diphtheria toxin acts via a well defined intracellular pathway that culminates with an obligatory transfer of its toxic moiety from acidic endosomes to the cytosol (6Sandvig K.

That translocation is actuated by structural transitions in the toxin that are triggered in the pH 4.5–5.5 range (8Blewitt M.G. Chung L.A. London E.

These dynamic properties of DT have allowed us to design novel bispecific antibodies that not only accurately deliver toxin into target cells but also incorporate a precise mechanism for triggering its release upon entering endosomes, thereby exerting its full toxic potential.We have selected murine monoclonal antibodies that tightly bind DT at neutral pH but spontaneously release the toxin as it undergoes a conformational change at pH 4.5–5.5 (see preceding paper (37Raso V. Brown M. McGrath J. Liu S. Stafford W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27618-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar)). Those antibodies were covalently linked to a second, cell-reactive antibody or receptor ligand to form hybrid molecules with dual specificity. The hybrid reagent carries antibody-bound toxin and selectively attaches to the surface of cells bearing a chosen target site. Toxin is released in its lethal form when the bispecific antibody-toxin complex is taken into cells and encounters the low pH in endosomes.DISCUSSIONWe originally designed hybrid antibodies with dual specificity to deliver sensitive bioactive molecules into target cells in a nondestructive manner. These reagents used an antibody to hold the molecule reversibly within its combining site while the second antibody or ligand component accurately targeted the complex to selected cells (1Raso V.A. Griffin T. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2073-2078PubMed Google Scholar, 2Raso V.A. Immunol. Rev. 1982; 62: 93-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Raso V.A. Basala M. Gregoriadis G. Post G. Senior J. Trouet A. Receptor-mediated targeting of drugs. 82. North Atlantic Treaty Organization Advanced Studies Institute, New York1984: 119-138Google Scholar). This delivery method circumvents the potential steric inactivation of delicate molecules that may result from coupling to a carrier moiety by covalent linkage, using either chemical means or genetically engineered fusion. Subsequent enzymatic or chemical cleavage from the carrier to restore activity is obviated since dissociation from the antibody combining site leaves the molecule unchanged.In the present embodiment of this technology, we have incorporated a precise means of triggering the rapid release and full potency of the active molecule once it has reached its intracellular destination (Fig.4). A binding-defective CRM mutant served as an active agent with a readily detectable cytotoxic activity. Its spontaneous release inside of the cell is based upon using monoclonal antibodies that bind to acid-sensitive epitopes that are altered upon passage of the toxin into acidified subcellular compartments (37Raso V. Brown M. McGrath J. Liu S. Stafford W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27618-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Efficient transfer of toxin from these vesicles and into the cytosol of target cells is signaled by a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis.The acid-triggered bispecific antibodies were shown to mediate the cytotoxicity of CRM107 and CRM45, which are ordinarily inactive because they cannot bind to cells. These bispecific antibody-delivered CRMs killed most of the target cells within 2 h. When examined in more detail, the kinetics for inhibition of cellular protein synthesis was identical for the bispecific antibody·CRM107 combination and native DT, showing a t 1/2 = 20 min for the rapid phase. This indicated that CRM released quickly from the antibody carrier and that its transmembrane domain facilitated the translocation of its enzymatic domain into the cytosol in a normal manner. The effectiveness of the CRM45 deletion mutant is especially pertinent since this protein consists solely of those two domains. Previous reports showed that truncated molecules such as CRM45 did not possess full cytotoxic activity when covalently linked to monoclonal antibody or other binding moieties (27Youle R.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 39-45Google Scholar, 30Bacha P. Murphy J.R. Reichlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Colombatti M. Greenfield L. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3030-3035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such attenuation might be caused by steric encroachment of the closely coupled antibody on the translocation domain since our results revealed no inherent translocation deficiency in the CRM45 molecule.Target cells were protected from the toxic action of hybrid antibody-delivered CRM by using NH4Cl to raise endosomal pH. This perturbation precluded both the acid-triggered release of toxin from the antibody combining site and the pH-induced translocation step needed for efficient cytotoxicity. Moreover, CRM107 delivered into cells using acid-insensitive bispecific antibodies was inactive, even after prolonged incubation. These antibodies bind to toxin epitopes that do not undergo a conformational change at low pH, and the toxin therefore remains bound inside the endosome. Failure to release within endosomal vesicles may result in the re-routing of toxin to ensuing compartments like the golgi or to lysosomes where it is destroyed. These combined neutralization and acid-stable antibody results confirmed that CRM toxins must release from the antibody in acidified endosomes to function properly. Concomitantly, the system provides strong evidence for the acid-induced breakup of certain specific antigen-antibody complexes within the low pH vesicles of living cells.Treatment of target cells with hybrid antibodies carrying ricin A chain instead of CRM107 showed an extremely delayed cytotoxic response that was unaffected by neutralization of endosomal pH by NH4Cl (data not shown). This slow action was in sharp contrast to the rapid acting, pH-sensitive, DT-based system and prevailed even though delivery via the transferrin pathway in the same cells was mediated by an identical targeting antibody. Unlike the direct pH-dependent endosomal route taken by DT, many toxins like ricin, Shiga toxin, and Pseudomonas exotoxin apparently follow more intricate and time consuming pathways before reaching their targets in the cytosol. The point of egress for these toxins may be the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus rather then the endosome (32Seetharam S. Chaudhary V.K. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17376-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yoshida T. Chen C.C. Zhang M.S. Wu H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The bispecific antibody approach is very flexible since antibodies or ligands to virtually any membrane site can be easily coupled with the toxin-bearing, pH-sensitive antibody to form a variety of highly specific delivery agents. In addition to using the anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody to target cells, we have also disulfide-linked diferric transferrin (18Raso V.A. Basala M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1143-1149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to an acid-releasable anti-DT antibody, and this bifunctional construct also mediated CRM cytotoxicity via the same internalization pathway (data not shown). Endocytotic cycling though an acid compartment is required for cytotoxic effectiveness using these DT-based systems, but that condition seems to be the rule for surface receptor sites rather than the exception.Anthrax toxin operates through an acid-dependent mechanism that is similar to that used by DT (34Friedlander A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One component of anthrax toxin undergoes a pH-induced conformational change and oligomerization to assist the translocation of its effector portion out of the endosome and into the cytosol (35Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus this toxin or its components might also be targeted to cells and released inside by using an acid-triggered bispecific antibody approach analogous to the one developed for DT.Whereas the present study utilized bispecific antibodies formed by linking two whole antibodies, we have also made exclusively heterobispecific F(ab′)2 hybrid antibodies (36Brennan M. Davison P.F. Paulus H. Science. 1985; 229: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using the same targeting and acid-sensitive monoclonal antibodies described in this paper. These smaller F(ab′)2 reagents (∼100 kDa) have proven to be slightly superior delivery vehicles on a molar basis compared with the bivalent whole antibody constructs. Their effectiveness dispels the notion that cross-linking of two surface receptors is necessary for the cellular uptake of bispecific antibody-delivered toxins, since these reagents are monovalent for both the toxin and the cell surface epitope. The production of analogous bispecific single chain Fv reagents (∼50 kDa) for toxin delivery is feasible, and their use for therapeutic purposes might offer an advantage.By providing both the selective delivery to target cells and a pH-controlled intracellular release of biological agents, acid-triggered bispecific antibodies might offer some advantages for therapeutic use. Moreover, the hybrid antibody and active ligand could be administered either as separate components or as a single preloaded complex. However, to maintain a high occupancy of antibody combining sites in vivo, either high affinity antibodies or elevated levels of ligand would have to be used.The ability to deliver the individual functional domains of DT independently into the same cell using this bispecific antibody delivery system has opened an interesting prospect. The catalytic, transmembrane, and receptor binding domains of DT can be produced by genetic engineering, and separate acid-releasable hybrid antibodies that bind to these constituent domains have been produced. Therefore, we intend to test if those toxin components can cooperate to produce cytotoxicity when they are delivered into the cell as separate entities and are released within the same acidified endosome. One of the earliest methods devised for the selective delivery of unmodified bioactive molecules into target cells used bispecific antibodies (1Raso V.A. Griffin T.

Griffin T. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2073-2078PubMed Google Scholar, 2Raso V.A. Immunol. Rev. 1982; 62: 93-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Raso V.A. Basala M. Gregoriadis G. Post G. Senior J. Trouet A. Receptor-mediated targeting of drugs. 82. North Atlantic Treaty Organization Advanced Studies Institute, New York1984: 119-138Google Scholar). This delivery method circumvents the potential steric inactivation of delicate molecules that may result from coupling to a carrier moiety by covalent linkage, using either chemical means or genetically engineered fusion. Subsequent enzymatic or chemical cleavage from the carrier to restore activity is obviated since dissociation from the antibody combining site leaves the molecule unchanged.In the present embodiment of this technology, we have incorporated a precise means of triggering the rapid release and full potency of the active molecule once it has reached its intracellular destination (Fig.4). A binding-defective CRM mutant served as an active agent with a readily detectable cytotoxic activity. Its spontaneous release inside of the cell is based upon using monoclonal antibodies that bind to acid-sensitive epitopes that are altered upon passage of the toxin into acidified subcellular compartments (37Raso V. Brown M. McGrath J. Liu S. Stafford W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27618-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Efficient transfer of toxin from these vesicles and into the cytosol of target cells is signaled by a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis.The acid-triggered bispecific antibodies were shown to mediate the cytotoxicity of CRM107 and CRM45, which are ordinarily inactive because they cannot bind to cells. These bispecific antibody-delivered CRMs killed most of the target cells within 2 h. When examined in more detail, the kinetics for inhibition of cellular protein synthesis was identical for the bispecific antibody·CRM107 combination and native DT, showing a t 1/2 = 20 min for the rapid phase. This indicated that CRM released quickly from the antibody carrier and that its transmembrane domain facilitated the translocation of its enzymatic domain into the cytosol in a normal manner. The effectiveness of the CRM45 deletion mutant is especially pertinent since this protein consists solely of those two domains. Previous reports showed that truncated molecules such as CRM45 did not possess full cytotoxic activity when covalently linked to monoclonal antibody or other binding moieties (27Youle R.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 39-45Google Scholar, 30Bacha P. Murphy J.R. Reichlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Colombatti M. Greenfield L. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3030-3035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such attenuation might be caused by steric encroachment of the closely coupled antibody on the translocation domain since our results revealed no inherent translocation deficiency in the CRM45 molecule.Target cells were protected from the toxic action of hybrid antibody-delivered CRM by using NH4Cl to raise endosomal pH. This perturbation precluded both the acid-triggered release of toxin from the antibody combining site and the pH-induced translocation step needed for efficient cytotoxicity. Moreover, CRM107 delivered into cells using acid-insensitive bispecific antibodies was inactive, even after prolonged incubation. These antibodies bind to toxin epitopes that do not undergo a conformational change at low pH, and the toxin therefore remains bound inside the endosome. Failure to release within endosomal vesicles may result in the re-routing of toxin to ensuing compartments like the golgi or to lysosomes where it is destroyed. These combined neutralization and acid-stable antibody results confirmed that CRM toxins must release from the antibody in acidified endosomes to function properly. Concomitantly, the system provides strong evidence for the acid-induced breakup of certain specific antigen-antibody complexes within the low pH vesicles of living cells.Treatment of target cells with hybrid antibodies carrying ricin A chain instead of CRM107 showed an extremely delayed cytotoxic response that was unaffected by neutralization of endosomal pH by NH4Cl (data not shown). This slow action was in sharp contrast to the rapid acting, pH-sensitive, DT-based system and prevailed even though delivery via the transferrin pathway in the same cells was mediated by an identical targeting antibody. Unlike the direct pH-dependent endosomal route taken by DT, many toxins like ricin, Shiga toxin, and Pseudomonas exotoxin apparently follow more intricate and time consuming pathways before reaching their targets in the cytosol. The point of egress for these toxins may be the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus rather then the endosome (32Seetharam S. Chaudhary V.K. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17376-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yoshida T. Chen C.C. Zhang M.S. Wu H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The bispecific antibody approach is very flexible since antibodies or ligands to virtually any membrane site can be easily coupled with the toxin-bearing, pH-sensitive antibody to form a variety of highly specific delivery agents. In addition to using the anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody to target cells, we have also disulfide-linked diferric transferrin (18Raso V.A. Basala M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1143-1149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to an acid-releasable anti-DT antibody, and this bifunctional construct also mediated CRM cytotoxicity via the same internalization pathway (data not shown). Endocytotic cycling though an acid compartment is required for cytotoxic effectiveness using these DT-based systems, but that condition seems to be the rule for surface receptor sites rather than the exception.Anthrax toxin operates through an acid-dependent mechanism that is similar to that used by DT (34Friedlander A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One component of anthrax toxin undergoes a pH-induced conformational change and oligomerization to assist the translocation of its effector portion out of the endosome and into the cytosol (35Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus this toxin or its components might also be targeted to cells and released inside by using an acid-triggered bispecific antibody approach analogous to the one developed for DT.Whereas the present study utilized bispecific antibodies formed by linking two whole antibodies, we have also made exclusively heterobispecific F(ab′)2 hybrid antibodies (36Brennan M. Davison P.F. Paulus H. Science. 1985; 229: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using the same targeting and acid-sensitive monoclonal antibodies described in this paper. These smaller F(ab′)2 reagents (∼100 kDa) have proven to be slightly superior delivery vehicles on a molar basis compared with the bivalent whole antibody constructs. Their effectiveness dispels the notion that cross-linking of two surface receptors is necessary for the cellular uptake of bispecific antibody-delivered toxins, since these reagents are monovalent for both the toxin and the cell surface epitope. The production of analogous bispecific single chain Fv reagents (∼50 kDa) for toxin delivery is feasible, and their use for therapeutic purposes might offer an advantage.By providing both the selective delivery to target cells and a pH-controlled intracellular release of biological agents, acid-triggered bispecific antibodies might offer some advantages for therapeutic use. Moreover, the hybrid antibody and active ligand could be administered either as separate components or as a single preloaded complex. However, to maintain a high occupancy of antibody combining sites in vivo, either high affinity antibodies or elevated levels of ligand would have to be used.The ability to deliver the individual functional domains of DT independently into the same cell using this bispecific antibody delivery system has opened an interesting prospect. The catalytic, transmembrane, and receptor binding domains of DT can be produced by genetic engineering, and separate acid-releasable hybrid antibodies that bind to these constituent domains have been produced. Therefore, we intend to test if those toxin components can cooperate to produce cytotoxicity when they are delivered into the cell as separate entities and are released within the same acidified endosome.

https://openalex.org/W2001507734,"Diphtheria toxin (DT) undergoes a rapid conformational change in response to the acidity encountered within endosomes. That transition is integral to the passage of its catalytic domain into the cytosol and thus its lethal action. The importance of this translocation mechanism led us to develop several monoclonal antibodies that bind DT at neutral pH but spontaneously release the toxin when critical epitopes denature or unfold upon lowering the pH to 4.5–5.5. Hybridomas were selected using a microtiter plate assay that measured the pH-dependent detachment of antibody from immobilized toxin. The acid-sensitive epitopes involved were on the catalytic, transmembrane, and receptor binding domains of DT. This pH-induced disruption of the binding of toxin to these monoclonal antibodies was analyzed by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation. Antibody combining sites were fully occupied at pH 5.5, partially bound at pH 5.0, and totally empty at pH 4.5. It was estimated that the<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> for antibody-toxin binding was ∼1000-fold lower at pH 5.0 than at neutral pH. This novel acid-triggered release mechanism provides a basis for delivery of antibody-bound toxin into cells accompanied by its immediate dissociation as the complex enters acidic vesicles."
