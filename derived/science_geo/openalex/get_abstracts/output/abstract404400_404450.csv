Following binding to the plasma membrane of cholinergic motor nerve terminals, BoNTs are internalized into an endocytic compartment. Although several endocytic pathways have been characterized in neurons, the molecular mechanism underpinning the uptake of BoNTs at the presynaptic nerve terminal is still unclear. Here, a recombinant BoNT/A heavy chain binding domain (Hc) was used to unravel the internalization pathway by fluorescence and electron microscopy. BoNT/A-Hc initially enters cultured hippocampal neurons in an activity-dependent manner into synaptic vesicles and clathrin-coated vesicles before also entering endosomal structures and multivesicular bodies. We found that inhibiting dynamin with the novel potent Dynasore analog, Dyngo-4aTM, was sufficient to abolish BoNT/A-Hc internalization and BoNT/A-induced SNAP25 cleavage in hippocampal neurons. Dyngo-4a also interfered with BoNT/A-Hc internalization into motor nerve terminals. Furthermore, Dyngo-4a afforded protection against BoNT/A-induced paralysis at the rat hemidiaphragm. A significant delay of >30% in the onset of botulism was observed in mice injected with Dyngo-4a. Dynamin inhibition therefore provides a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of botulism and other diseases caused by pathogens sharing dynamin-dependent uptake mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W1984783217,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D that generates the bioactive lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). We and others have reported that ATX binds to integrins, but the function of ATX-integrin interactions is unknown. The recently reported crystal structure of ATX suggests a role for the solvent-exposed surface of the N-terminal tandem somatomedin B-like domains in binding to platelet integrin αIIbβ3. The opposite face of the somatomedin B-like domain interacts with the catalytic phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain to form a hydrophobic channel through which lysophospholipid substrates enter and leave the active site. Based on this structure, we hypothesize that integrin-bound ATX can access cell surface substrates and deliver LPA to cell surface receptors. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the integrin selectivity and signaling pathways that promote ATX binding to platelets. We report that both platelet β1 and β3 integrins interact in an activation-dependent manner with ATX via the SMB2 domain. ATX increases thrombin-stimulated LPA production by washed platelets ∼10-fold. When incubated under conditions to promote integrin activation, ATX generates LPA from CHO cells primed with bee venom phospholipase A2, and ATX-mediated LPA production is enhanced more than 2-fold by CHO cell overexpression of integrin β3. The effects of ATX on platelet and cell-associated LPA production, but not hydrolysis of small molecule or detergent-solubilized substrates, are attenuated by point mutations in the SMB2 that impair integrin binding. Integrin binding therefore localizes ATX activity to the cell surface, providing a mechanism to generate LPA in the vicinity of its receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2076269514,"The disordered tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP/p25) was found to be co-enriched in neuronal and glial inclusions with α-synuclein in Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy, respectively; however, co-occurrence of α-synuclein with β-amyloid (Aβ) in human brain inclusions has been recently reported, suggesting the existence of mixed type pathologies that could result in obstacles in the correct diagnosis and treatment. Here we identified TPPP/p25 as an interacting partner of the soluble Aβ oligomers as major risk factors for Alzheimer disease using ProtoArray human protein microarray. The interactions of oligomeric Aβ with proteins involved in the etiology of neurological disorders were characterized by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, pelleting experiments, and tubulin polymerization assay. We showed that the Aβ(42) tightly bound to TPPP/p25 (K(d) = 85 nm) and caused aberrant protein aggregation by inhibiting the physiologically relevant TPPP/p25-derived microtubule assembly. The pair-wise interactions of Aβ(42), α-synuclein, and tubulin were found to be relatively weak; however, these three components formed soluble ternary complex exclusively in the absence of TPPP/p25. The aggregation-facilitating activity of TPPP/p25 and its interaction with Aβ was monitored by electron microscopy with purified proteins by pelleting experiments with cell-free extracts as well as by confocal microscopy with CHO cells expressing TPPP/p25 or amyloid. The finding that the interaction of TPPP/p25 with Aβ can produce pathological-like aggregates is tightly coupled with unusual pathology of the Alzheimer disease revealed previously; that is, partial co-localization of Aβ and TPPP/p25 in the case of diffuse Lewy body disease with Alzheimer disease."

We demonstrate that CAMP mRNA and protein expression increase in epithelial cells (human primary keratinocytes, HaCaT keratinocytes, and HeLa cells), but not in myeloid (U937 and HL-60) cells, following ER stress generated by two mechanistically different, pharmacological stressors, thapsigargin or tunicamycin. The mechanism for increased CAMP following exposure to ER stress involves NF-κB activation leading to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) activation via MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, both increased CAMP secretion and its proteolytic processing to LL-37 are required for antimicrobial activities occur following ER stress. In addition, topical thapsigargin also increases production of the murine homologue of CAMP in mouse epidermis. Finally and paradoxically, ER stress instead suppresses the 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3-induced activation of VDR, but blockade of VDR activity does not alter ER stress-induced CAMP up-regulation.

Mammalian epithelial tissues, such as the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract, as well as mucosal epithelia and skin, are positioned at the interface with the environment, where they deploy multiple protective strategies that protect underlying tissues from exogenous microbial pathogens (1Elias P.M.

An important AMP, the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the cathelicidin antimicrobial protein (CAMP), comprises a 37-amino acid peptide (LL-37) that is not only an inducible but also a multifunctional modulator of cytokine secretion/production, angiogenesis, and adaptive immunity (5Nijnik A.

Although CAMP production potentially defends against pathogen-induced diseases in multiple epithelia (like many other AMPs, it is expressed only at low, constitutive levels in these epithelia), it is up-regulated in response to external perturbations, i.e. wounding, UV irradiation, and epidermal permeability barrier abrogation (6Méndez-Samperio P.

Numerous transcriptional regulatory elements exist on the 5′-upstream promoter region of CAMP, including a vitamin D receptor (VDR)-responsive element, and VDR activation increases CAMP expression in a variety of epithelial and non-epithelial cell types, including immune cells (13Gombart A.F. Borregaard N. Koeffler H.P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptor activation following bacterial challenges increases CYP27 expression, which generates a ligand for VDR, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, thereby inducing CAMP production (14Schauber J. Dorschner R.A. Coda A.B. Büchau A.S. Liu P.T. Kiken D. Helfrich Y.R. Kang S. Elalieh H.Z. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Bikle D.D. Modlin R.L. Gallo R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, whether this VDR-dependent mechanism is responsible for up-regulation CAMP in response to external perturbations remains unknown. The ER is a central organelle, where both protein and lipid synthesis largely occur and where numerous secretory and membrane proteins are folded by ER-resident, molecular chaperones. The ER also contains a substantial pool of intracellular Ca2+, which, when released from the ER, modulates numerous metabolic pathways (15Zhang K. Shen X. Wu J. Sakaki K. Saunders T. Rutkowski D.T. Back S.H. Kaufman R.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 587-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Alterations in ER calcium levels in response to exposure to various pathological/pharmacological stimuli lead to either accumulation of unfolded protein or overaccumulation of folded protein (16Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Nature. 2008; 454: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar), conditions that together are referred to as ER stress (15Zhang K. Shen X. Wu J. Sakaki K. Saunders T. Rutkowski D.T. Back S.H. Kaufman R.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 587-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although excessive ER stress can overwhelm these mechanisms, triggering apoptosis (16Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Nature. 2008; 454: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar), two key intracellular signal pathways, termed the unfolded protein response and the ER-overload response, restore normal ER functions (17Mera K. Kawahara K. Tada K. Kawai K. Hashiguchi T. Maruyama I. Kanekura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 397: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that epidermal permeability barrier perturbation generates ER stress (18Celli A. Mackenzie D.S. Crumrine D.S. Tu C.L. Hupe M. Bikle D.D. Elias P.M. Mauro T.M. Br. J. Dermatol. 2011; 164: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas other external stressors, e.g. UV irradiation (17Mera K. Kawahara K. Tada K. Kawai K. Hashiguchi T. Maruyama I.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), also initiate ER stress responses including downstream activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB (16Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Nature. 2008; 454: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Because several stressors also up-regulate CAMP expression and because ER stress/activation ubiquitously occurs in mammalian cells, we hypothesized here that ER stress-mediated signals could stimulate CAMP expression in epithelial cells exposed to external perturbations, thereby restoring or enhancing antimicrobial defense barrier(s). We investigated here the role of ER stress in stimulating production of CAMP/LL-37 and its murine homologue, CRAMP, utilizing human cultured KC, HeLa cells, and murine epidermis as our models of mammalian epithelial tissues. Our results demonstrate that ER stress stimulates synthesis of CAMP/LL-37 via a novel NF-κB-C/EBPα pathway, independent of the VDR, in epithelial cells such as KC and HeLa cells, but not in myeloid cells. As such, the insights from these studies could lead to the development of novel mechanism-based therapies for diseases with CAMP/LL-37 deficiency, as well as for improving antimicrobial defense. Normal human keratinocytes (KC) isolated from neonatal foreskins by a modification of the method of Pittelkow and Scott (21Pittelkow M.R. Scott R.E. Mayo Clin.

Cell toxicities, including apoptosis, were assessed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage as well as a trypan blue dye exclusion assay (24Uchida Y. Houben E. Park K. Douangpanya S. Lee Y.M.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using cDNA prepared from mRNA fractions of cell lysates, as we described previously (26Houben E. Holleran W.M. Yaginuma T.

Cell lysates, prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, were resolved by electrophoresis on 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared using extraction reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Resultant bands were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, probed with anti-human β-actin or anti-murine β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibody, anti-CAMP (hCAP18 (Abcam), anti-CRAMP, anti-human phospho-NF-κB p50 (Ser-337) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-human phospho-Ser-21 or anti-phospho Thr-222/226 C/EBPα (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), or anti-PARP (BD Biosciences), and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The intensity of bands was measured with a LAS-3000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Transcriptional activities of NF-κB, C/EBP, and VDR were assessed using their respective reporter kits (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). HaCaT KC were transfected with NF-κB-, C/EBP-, or VDR element-responsive luciferase constructs encoding the firefly luciferase reporter gene, as well as a constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase construct, using HilyMax (Dojindo, Rockville, MD). After transfection, cells were pretreated with or without 6-amino-4-quinazoline (QNZ, 100 nm) for 1 h and stimulated with Tg and/or QNZ and/or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (100 nm) for 18 h. Promoter activity was assessed using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). HaCaT KC were transfected with 20 nm siRNA for C/EBPα, C/EBPϵ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), VDR, or non-targeted, control siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using siLentFect (Bio-Rad), as described previously (27Schauber J. Oda Y. Büchau A.S. Yun Q.C. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Bikle D.D. Gallo R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 816-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Statistical comparisons were performed using an unpaired Student's t test. We first ascertained whether activation of an ER stress response occurs in primary human and HaCaT KC after exposure to Tg, previously shown to produce ER stress by inhibiting the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (28Inesi G. Wade R. Rogers T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ER stress in turn is indicated by the extent of activation of the transcriptional factor/ER stress marker, XBP1 (18Celli A. Mackenzie D.S. Crumrine D.S. Tu C.L. Hupe M. Bikle D.D. Elias P.M. Mauro T.M. Br. J. Dermatol. 2011; 164: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, exogenous Tg (100 nm) accelerated conversion of the precursor to the mature (spliced) form of XBP1 mRNA in both primary human and HaCaT KC (Fig. 1A). Notably, concentrations (≤200 nm) of Tg neither decreased cell viability nor did they induce apoptosis, assessed both by trypan blue dye exclusion and by PARP cleavage, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Because higher Tg concentrations (500 nm) slightly decreased cell viability (supplemental Fig. 1A), we employed Tg concentrations of ≤200 nm as the ER stressor for the studies described below. We next assessed whether Tg-mediated ER stress stimulates CAMP mRNA expression. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase in CAMP mRNA expression in both primary human KC and HaCaT KC following treatment with Tg (100 nm) (Fig. 1B). In addition, basal CAMP expression is significantly increased in differentiated primary human KC (induced by raising Ca2+ concentration in medium) versus undifferentiated KC (Fig. 1B), whereas similar to undifferentiated KC, differentiated KC show increased CAMP mRNA expression following ER stress (Fig. 1B). Therefore, ER stress likely stimulates CAMP expression in each epidermal layer (basal through granular). Although Tg is well known to provoke ER stress (29Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Mantovani R. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we further ascertained whether increased CAMP expression is due specifically to an ER stress response. When HaCaT KC were co-treated with Tg and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an inhibitor of ER stress (30Ozcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Görgün C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), the expected increases in XBP1 activation were attenuated significantly in comparison with cells treated with Tg alone; notably, TUDCA alone did not alter the extent of XBP1 activation (Fig. 1C). Finally, the Tg-induced increase in CAMP mRNA expression was diminished in KC treated with TUDCA (Fig. 1D), suggesting that CAMP up-regulation is driven by an ER stress signal, rather than by unrelated, nonspecific effects of Tg. To further ascertain whether increased CAMP mRNA expression is initiated by ER stress, HaCaT cells were incubated with Tm, another chemically and mechanistically unrelated ER stressor, which stimulates accumulation of proteins in ER through inhibition of glycosylation (31Lee A.S. Wells S. Kim K.S. Scheffler I.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1986; 129: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An increase in the mature (spliced) form of XBP1 mRNA again became evident in cells treated with Tm (Fig. 1A), whereas apoptosis did not occur at concentrations up to 960 nm (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, like Tg, Tm also significantly increased CAMP mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Together, these results indicate that ER stress stimulates CAMP mRNA production in human KC. We next investigated whether increases in CAMP mRNA occur ubiquitously in epithelial cells (using HeLa cells and KC as models for epithelial cells), but not in non-epithelial cells, i.e. myeloid cells (using promyelocytic cells (HL-60) and monocytes (U937)). In response to Tg treatment, XBP1 activation occurred in all tested cells (supplemental Fig. 2) without evidence of cell toxicity (not shown), but CAMP mRNA expression increased significantly only in HeLa cells (Table 1). These results suggest that ER stress appears to generate signals that stimulate CAMP expression in epithelial cells, but not in myeloid cells.TABLE 1CAMP mRNACell lineTreatmentRelative mRNA expression (vs. vehicle)HeLaVehicle1.00 ± 0.03Tg (100 nm)4.30 ± 0.14ap < 0.01 (n = 3) vs. vehicle.Tm (297 nm)3.15 ± 0.89ap < 0.01 (n = 3) vs. vehicle.HL-60Vehicle1.00 ± 0.12Tg (100 nm)1.19 ± 0.28Tm (119 nm)1.35 ± 0.23U937Vehicle1.00 ± 0.09Tg (100 nm)1.20 ± 0.15Tm (119 nm)1.08 ± 0.19a p < 0.01 (n = 3) vs. vehicle. Open table in a new tab CAMP must not only be synthesized but also secreted from cells and proteolytic hydrolysis must occur to generate the active antimicrobial peptide, LL-37. As shown by Western immunoblot analysis, increases in not only intracellular CAMP (cf. Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 5 versus lane 1) but also extracellular LL-37 (∼4.5 kDa) levels increase in conditioned cultured media from HaCaT KC exposed to ER stress (Fig. 2), revealing that ER stress increases not only formation but also secretion of fully functional CAMP in response to external stimuli.FIGURE 2ER stress-induced CAMP secretion and LL-37 production. HaCaT KC were exposed to ER stress as in Fig. 1. LL-37 was detected by Western immunoblot analysis. Results are from independent experiments. Cell lysates were combined from 3–5 individual treatment groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because increased mRNA expression is either due to transcriptional up-regulation or due to increased mRNA stability (extending half-life), we next addressed which mechanism may be responsible for ER stress-induced stimulation of CAMP expression. To assess total RNA levels, which reflect bulk amounts of RNA transcript being formed, we used intron primers (not spliced RNA) (32Elferink C.J. Reiners Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Gira A.K. Casper K.A. Otto K.B. Naik S.M. Caughman S.W. Swerlick R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). qPCR analysis reveals that total RNA levels are increased in HaCaT KC following Tg treatment, and blockade of ER stress by TUDCA diminished increases in total RNA levels similar to that observed using the mRNA CAMP primers (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that the ER stress stimulates CAMP expression at the transcriptional level rather than via increased stability of CAMP mRNA. Given the above results, we sought to further delineate the downstream mechanism(s) for the ER stress-dependent CAMP transcriptional up-regulation using HaCaT KC as the epithelial model. Because NF-κB-dependent gene expression is up-regulated in cells subjected to ER stress (34Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 442: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we investigated the potential role of NF-κB in the regulation of CAMP expression in KC subjected to ER stress. First, Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that NF-κB activation occurred in KC following ER stress, as assessed by phospho-NF-κB generation (Fig. 3A). Next, NF-κB transactivity, assessed by a reporter assay, was increased in HaCaT KC exposed to ER stress (Fig. 3B), in parallel with increased CAMP mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 3, C, D, and E, respectively). However, co-incubation of HaCaT KC with Tg or Tm, along with two chemically unrelated but specific NF-κB inhibitors, QNZ or BAY11–7082 (35Tobe M. Isobe Y. Tomizawa H. Nagasaki T. Takahashi H. Fukazawa T. Hayashi H. Bioorg Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), diminished the expected ER stress-induced up-regulation of CAMP mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). Notably, neither QNZ nor BAY11–7082 alone altered basal CAMP mRNA expression. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that these inhibitors alone did not significantly alter CAMP protein levels (Fig. 3, D and E). Together, these results indicate that the NF-κB pathway likely plays a key role in the up-regulation of CAMP expression in KC subjected to ER stress. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), but not NF-κB, regulatory elements exist on the promoter region of CAMP (13Gombart A.F. Borregaard N. Koeffler H.P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), and C/EBPα transactivity increases after either ER stress (36Oyadomari S. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Oyadomari M. Ron D. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 520-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) or NF-κB activation (37Wang D. Paz-Priel I. Friedman A.D. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 5757-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, bone marrow cells from C/EBPϵ−/− mouse do not express CRAMP, the murine homologue of CAMP (38Verbeek W. Lekstrom-Himes J. Park D.J. Dang P.M. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Babior B.M. Xanthopoulos K. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 94: 3141-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether C/EBP transactivation occurs following exposure of ER stress. Consistent with the prior studies noted above, total C/EBP transactivity significantly increased in HaCaT KC treated with Tg (Fig. 4A). To further identify the responsible C/EBP transcription factor(s), we next assessed ER stress-stimulated CAMP expression, using siRNA against C/EBPα in Tg-treated KC. C/EBPα mRNA expression was suppressed by ≥60% versus scrambled siRNA (p < 0.01) in HaCaT KC exposed to ER stress. Moreover, ER stress-induced CAMP mRNA expression significantly declined in cells transfected with C/EBPα siRNA (Fig. 4B). Western immunoblot analysis further demonstrated reduced CAMP protein production in C/EBPα siRNA-transfected KC exposed to ER stress (Fig. 4C). In contrast, when C/EBPϵ mRNA expression was suppressed with siRNA (i.e. by ∼50% versus scrambled siRNA) in HaCaT KC, ER stress-induced CAMP mRNA expression did not change (Fig. 4B). Because C/EBPα transactivity is also regulated by phosphorylation at both Ser-21 and Thr-222/226 (39Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 40Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S. Schaufele F. Tenen D.G. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we next assessed the levels of phosphorylated C/EBPα in HaCaT KC exposed to ER stress. Western immunoblot analysis revealed an increase in the levels of phosphorylated (both Ser-21 and Thr-222/226) C/EBPα in nuclear fractions from cells following Tg treatment (Fig. 5A). However, although phosphorylated Ser-21 returned to basal levels at 45–60 min, Thr-222/226 phosphorylated C/EBPα remained elevated in nuclear fractions at 60 min (Fig. 5A). Moreover, BAY11–7082, an inhibitor of NF-κB, significantly diminished the levels of ER stress-induced phosphorylated forms, whereas BAY11–7082 alone altered neither Ser-21 nor Thr-222/226-phospho-C/EBPα (Fig. 5B, upper panel). Additional studies were performed to ensure that the same pathway, i.e. ER stress-mediated NF-κB activation followed by increased C/EBPα phosphorylation, is also responsible for up-regulation of CAMP in primary human KC. As expected, we noted that significant increases in both Ser-21 and Thr-222/226-phospho-C/EBPα were evident following Tg treatment, whereas inhibition of NF-κB by Tg diminished these phosphorylation e"

https://openalex.org/W1995520063,"The aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn), the primary component of Lewy bodies, into high molecular weight assemblies is strongly associated with Parkinson disease. This event is believed to result from a conformational change within native α-Syn. Molecular chaperones exert critical housekeeping functions in vivo including refolding, maintaining in a soluble state, and/or pacifying protein aggregates. The influence of the stress-induced heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) on α-Syn aggregation has been notably investigated. The constitutively expressed chaperone Hsc70 acts as an antiaggregation barrier before cells are overwhelmed with α-Syn aggregates and Hsp70 expression induced. Here, we investigate the interaction between Hsc70 and α-Syn, the consequences of this interaction, and the role of nucleotides and co-chaperones Hdj1 and Hdj2 as modulators. We show that Hsc70 sequesters soluble α-Syn in an assembly incompetent complex in the absence of ATP. The affinity of Hsc70 for soluble α-Syn diminishes upon addition of ATP alone or together with its co-chaperones Hdj1 or Hdj2 allowing faster binding and release of client proteins thus abolishing α-Syn assembly inhibition by Hsc70. We show that Hsc70 binds α-Syn fibrils with a 5-fold tighter affinity compared with soluble α-Syn. This suggests that Hsc70 preferentially interacts with high molecular weight α-Syn assemblies in vivo. Hsc70 binding certainly has an impact on the physicochemical properties of α-Syn assemblies. We show a reduced cellular toxicity of α-Syn fibrils coated with Hsc70 compared with ""naked"" fibrils. Hsc70 may therefore significantly affect the cellular propagation of α-Syn aggregates and their spread throughout the central nervous system in Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020306031,"The terms ""proteolytic enzyme"" and ""peptidase"" have been treated as synonymous, and all proteolytic enzymes have been considered to be hydrolases (EC 3.4). However, the recent discovery of proteins that cleave themselves at asparagine residues indicates that not all peptide bond cleavage occurs by hydrolysis. These self-cleaving proteins include the Tsh protein precursor of Escherichia coli, in which the large C-terminal propeptide acts as an autotransporter; certain viral coat proteins; and proteins containing inteins. Proteolysis is the action of an amidine lyase (EC 4.3.2). These proteolytic enzymes are also the first in which the nucleophile is an asparagine, defining the seventh proteolytic catalytic type and the first to be discovered since 2004. We have assembled ten families based on sequence similarity in which cleavage is thought to be catalyzed by an asparagine."
https://openalex.org/W1995740954,"Gliomas are the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor in the central nervous system of adults. Glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs, WHO grade 4) have a dismal prognosis despite the use of the alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ), and even low grade gliomas (LGGs, WHO grade 2) eventually transform to malignant secondary GBMs. Although GBM patients benefit from promoter hypermethylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) that is the main determinant of resistance to TMZ, recent studies suggested that MGMT promoter methylation is of prognostic as well as predictive significance for the efficacy of TMZ. Glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) in the global genome was shown to be a significant predictor of improved survival in patients with GBM. Collectively, we hypothesized that MGMT promoter methylation might reflect global DNA methylation. Additionally in LGGs, the significance of MGMT promoter methylation is still undetermined. In the current study, we aimed to determine the correlation between clinical, genetic, and epigenetic profiles including LINE-1 and different cancer-related genes and the clinical outcome in newly diagnosed 57 LGG and 54 GBM patients. Here, we demonstrated that (1) IDH1/2 mutation is closely correlated with MGMT promoter methylation and 1p/19q codeletion in LGGs, (2) LINE-1 methylation levels in primary and secondary GBMs are lower than those in LGGs and normal brain tissues, (3) LINE-1 methylation is proportional to MGMT promoter methylation in gliomas, and (4) higher LINE-1 methylation is a favorable prognostic factor in primary GBMs, even compared to MGMT promoter methylation. As a global DNA methylation marker, LINE-1 may be a promising marker in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2102434475,"Inteins are internal protein sequences that post-translationally self-excise and splice together the flanking sequences, the so-called exteins. Natural and engineered inteins have been used in many practical applications. However, inteins are often inefficient or inactive when placed in a non-native host protein and may require the presence of several amino acid residues of the native exteins, which will then remain as a potential scar in the spliced protein. Thus, more general inteins that overcome these limitations are highly desirable. Here we report sequential directed evolution as a new approach to produce inteins with such properties. Random mutants of the Ssp (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) DnaB mini-intein were inserted into the protein conferring kanamycin resistance at a site where the parent intein was inactive for splicing. The mutants selected for splicing activity were further improved by iterating the procedure for two more cycles at different positions in the same protein. The resulting improved inteins showed high activity in the positions of the first rounds of selection, in multiple new insertion sites, and in different proteins. One of these inteins, the M86 mutant, which accumulated 8 amino acid substitutions, was also biochemically characterized in an artificially split form with a chemically synthesized N-terminal intein fragment consisting of 11 amino acids.

Implications on the intein structure-function, practical application, and evolution are discussed. Inteins are internal protein sequences that occur as in-frame insertions in the coding sequences of host proteins. Inteins post-translationally catalyze a protein-splicing reaction where the intein is precisely excised and the flanking sequences (N- and C-exteins) are joined by a peptide bond, producing a mature spliced protein (1Perler F.B.

The splicing pathway, directed by the intein plus the first residue of the C-extein, typically consists of four coordinated nucleophilic displacement reactions, resulting in cleavage of the N- and C-terminal intein-extein bonds and ligation of the N- and C-exteins (2Xu M.Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Uncoupling of these reactions, through site-directed mutations or intein placement in certain non-native host proteins, can result in N- or C-terminal cleavages without splicing. Inteins can be categorized into three types: bifunctional inteins, containing a splicing domain interrupted by a homing endonuclease domain; mini-inteins, containing only a splicing domain; and split inteins, consisting of separately encoded N- and C-inteins that can reassemble through structural complementation to catalyze trans-splicing (4Liu X.Q.

Intein-based protein splicing and cleavages have increasingly become useful tools in biological research and biotechnology.

Different inteins typically exhibit different specificities for the extein amino acid residues proximal to the intein, which can severely limit the general usefulness of intein-based methods. The intein sequence plus the first C-extein residue (invariably Ser, Cys, or Thr) generally contain all the necessary structural information for protein splicing, requiring no exogenous co-factors or energy sources. However, inteins tested outside of their native host proteins often showed inefficient splicing and/or uncoupling of the splicing reaction to yield cleavage products (24Amitai G. Callahan B.P.

However, in these examples, either the flanking amino acids at the splice junctions have been kept constant or only a single site was used.

In this study, we tested whether an intein could be made more general by subjecting it to a sequential directed evolution procedure at three different insertion sites in a genetically selectable host protein. The resulting mutant inteins, when compared with the wild type intein, showed significantly improved ability of splicing at multiple new insertion sites. For one of these inteins, we also found a highly improved activity in an artificially split form that is useful for protein semisynthesis. Unless otherwise specified, standard protocols were used. As selection markers, kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were applied. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Biolegio (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and Integrated DNA Technologies (Skokie, IL). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Reagents were purchased from Acros Organics (Nidderau, Germany), Applichem (Darmstadt, Germany), GE Healthcare (Munich, Germany), Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Germany), Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), or Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Restriction enzymes and markers were obtained from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). All reactions and assays were performed at least in duplicate. To generate the kanamycin resistance (KanR) plasmid vector, the pDrive plasmid (Qiagen) was modified by deletion of the LacZ α-peptide and multiple cloning site sequences and insertion of a His tag coding sequence at the start of the KanR gene. To facilitate intein insertion in the KanR gene, appropriate restriction sites were introduced through PCR and inverse PCR. For insertion site 1, restriction sites BspEI and SalI were inserted through silent mutations in the KanR sequence before and after the insertion site, with the corresponding amino acid sequence being -SG- and -VD-, respectively. For insertion site 2, restriction site SalI was inserted through silent mutations in the amino acid sequence -VD-, and the insertion of restriction site BglII resulted in an -SDF- to -SDL- mutation that did not prevent the KanR function. For insertion sites 3–10, restriction sites BspEI and BsrGI were inserted through silent mutations in the intein sequence, with BspEI corresponding to -SG- near the N terminus (residues 3–4) of the intein and with BsrGI corresponding to -IVH- immediately before the C terminus of the intein. Prior to directed evolution, the Ssp DnaB mini-intein coding sequence was initially amplified from pMST (35Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with the appropriate restriction sites, and inserted at site 1 in the KanR plasmid vector. The plasmid pCL20 for protein 1 (IC-Trx-His6) 5IC is a wild type Ssp DnaB intein (amino acids 12–154); ICM86 is the M86 mutant of the Ssp DnaB intein (amino acids 12–154); and IN is the Ssp DnaB intein (amino acids 1–11). was described previously (36Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For the expression plasmid pIT21 for construct 2 (ICM86-Trx-His6), the ICM86-encoding fragment was ordered as a synthetic gene from Mr. Gene (Regensburg, Germany). The DNA fragment was excised by NcoI and BamHI and ligated into a pET16b vector containing the IC-Trx-His6-encoding fragment from pCL20, in which the BamHI site between the Trx- and His6-encoding sequence was mutated to a SalI site, to give pIT21. Error-prone PCR was performed under conditions modified from Fromant et al. (37Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to amplify the intein along with ∼100 bp of flanking KanR sequence on each side of the intein. The flanking KanR sequences were included to facilitate easy purification of the intein fragment after restriction digestion of the PCR product (see below). Three sets of error-prone conditions were performed, varying by 0.25 mm Mg2+, 0.05 mm Mn2+, and 1000 μm of each dNTP in excess, 0.5 mm Mg2+, 0.1 mm Mn2+, and 1500 μm of each dNTP in excess, or 1.0 mm Mg2+, 0.2 mm Mn2+, and 2000 μm of each dNTP in excess (12 reactions in total). The PCR products were digested with a pair of restriction enzymes specified for each insertion site and separated on an agarose gel, and the extracted intein fragments were ligated into the KanR plasmid vector prepared with the same restriction enzymes. The ligation products were concentrated and purified with a Qiagen MinElute column before being used to transform Escherichia coli cells (ElectroMax cells from Invitrogen) by electroporation. The transformed cells were plated on agar plates containing 50, 75, or 150 μg/ml kanamycin for growth selection. A small aliquot of the transformed cells was plated on 50 μg/ml ampicillin to estimate the efficiency of the transformation (i.e. the size of the mutant library). Colonies grown on the kanamycin plates were collected and further grown in liquid cultures followed by analysis of protein splicing by Western blotting (Qiagen Penta-His HRP conjugate kit), determination of mutations by DNA sequencing (Macrogen Inc.) of the plasmids, or initiation of the next round of directed evolution from selected mutant intein(s). Protein expression and purification was performed as described previously (38Ludwig C. Schwarzer D. Mootz H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25264-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Elution fractions of the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography purification containing the desired protein were pooled and directly dialyzed against assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) with 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% (v/v) glycerin or anisotropy buffer (assay buffer with 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 20% (v/v) glycerin), shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Solid phase peptide synthesis of peptide 1 was performed using a Liberty peptide synthesizer (CEM, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany) on a Wang resin according to standard protocols based on the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protecting group strategy and with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate as the activation reagent. Peptide synthesis of peptides 2 and 3 as well as peptide purification and peptide analysis by MALDI-TOF MS were carried out as described previously (38Ludwig C. Schwarzer D. Mootz H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25264-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Splicing reaction analysis and fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed as described previously (38Ludwig C. Schwarzer D. Mootz H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25264-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To construct a genetic selection system for the directed evolution of an intein, a KanR protein, namely aminoglycoside-3′-phospho-transferase-I (APH(3′)-I), was chosen as the host protein. After intein insertion in the KanR protein through recombinant DNA techniques, efficient protein splicing is required to restore protein function and to confer kanamycin resistance to the host E. coli cell. The KanR protein contained an N-terminal His6 tag for easy detection on Western blots. The sequential directed evolution process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The intein coding sequence was initially inserted between two endonuclease restriction sites that were introduced at a first site in the KanR-encoding gene on a plasmid vector. For directed evolution, the intein coding sequence was amplified through error-prone PCR followed by restriction digest and re-insertion of the DNA fragments into the same site by ligation. Transformation of E. coli cells with the resulting plasmids created a library of random mutants. The mutants were then subjected to genetic selection on agar plates containing kanamycin (50–150 μg/ml), allowing only functional mutants (capable of protein splicing) to grow into colonies. The selected colonies were analyzed for the expected protein splicing through Western blotting, and their plasmid DNAs were analyzed to identify mutations in the intein coding sequence. A mutant intein that spliced efficiently at the first site was evolved the same way at two other sites in KanR, where it failed to splice or showed only little activity to yield the most improved inteins after three sequential cycles. A previously reported Ssp DnaB mini-intein was chosen for this directed evolution. This intein had been known to splice efficiently (100%) in a foreign protein context (the pMST construct) when 5 native extein residues were included on each side of the intein (35Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, when this wild type intein was inserted in the KanR protein without the 5 native extein residues, the intein was unable to splice in any of the 10 insertion sites tested (Table 1). These 10 insertion sites in the KanR protein were chosen to have a Ser residue at each insertion site, which was a known requirement for splicing. The insertion sites were also chosen to be located in a variety of structural elements (supplemental Fig. S1), based on the crystal structure of a KanR homologue (Protein Data Bank no. 1ND4), the aminoglycoside-3′-phospho-transferase-IIa (APH(3′)-IIa) protein (39Nurizzo D. Shewry S.C. Perlin M.H. Brown S.A. Dholakia J.N. Fuchs R.L. Deva T. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol.

The wild type Ssp DnaB mini-intein was subjected to two rounds of directed evolution at the first insertion site (site 1; Table 1) in the KanR protein. Two mutant inteins (M1 and M3) were selected with significantly improved splicing efficiencies. The M1 intein contained three mutations (K20R, D24G, and I58T) and showed a 73% splicing efficiency, which was defined as the percentage of the precursor protein that had spliced. The M3 intein showed a 36% splicing efficiency and contained two mutations (D24G and I58T). We then tested the M3 intein for splicing at the nine other insertion sites in the KanR protein that it was not selected for. It showed significant splicing at insertion site 4 in the KanR protein, in addition to retaining the high efficiency (100%) of splicing in the original pMST construct (Table 1). However, it did not show splicing at the eight other insertion sites in the KanR protein. The M3 intein was chosen as the starting point for further sequential rounds of directed evolution because the M1 intein was not tested at the different insertion sites in the KanR protein. A selection of mutants at the second insertion site (site 2; Table 1), where the M3 intein could not splice, yielded several new mutant inteins with a significant level of splicing, among which the M30 intein showed the highest level of splicing. Sequence determination of the M30 intein revealed four new mutations additional to those present in the M3 intein (Table 2). Unexpectedly, the amino acid residue immediately before the intein was also mutated from Ala to Gly (A[-1]G mutation). This was because the A(−1) codon was included with the intein on the SalI-BglII DNA fragment that underwent the random mutagenesis. The M30 intein showed splicing efficiencies of 98 and 71% with and without the A(−1)G mutation at insertion site 2, respectively (Table 3). The M30 intein was tested for splicing at the other insertion sites without the A(−1)G mutation. (Note: Site 4 naturally has Gly at the −1 position.) It showed significant levels (10–80%) of splicing at five other insertion sites where it had not undergone selection (Table 1). Furthermore, it retained efficient splicing in the pMST construct and at insertion site 1 in the KanR protein.TABLE 2List of mutations in the improved inteins produced through directed evolutionMutant inteinM1M3M30M86M89M907M913D24GD24GD24GD24GD24GD24GD24GI58TI58TI58TI58TI58TI58TI58TK20RS18PS18PS18PS18PS18PS107AS107AS107AS107AS107AS122PS122PS122PS122PS122PH143RH143RH143RH143RH143SS114PP142LP142LI30VH92R Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Contributions of individual mutations to the splicing efficiency at the insertion site 2 in the KanR proteinMutant inteinsMutationsaThe A(−1)G mutation is in the KanR sequence at the position immediately before the intein; all other mutations are relative to the wild type sequence of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein.Splicing efficiency%WT0 WT-1A(−1)G7M3D24GI58T0 M3-3A(−)GD24GI58T65M30A(−)GD24GI58TS18PS107AS122PH143R98 M30-6S18P0 M30-7S107A0 M30-8S122P0 M30-9H143R0 M30-1D24GI58TS18PS107AS122PH143R71 M30-2D24GI58TS18P22 M30-3D24GI58TH143R38 M30-4S18PS107AS122PH143R15 M30-5S107AS122PH143R6M86D24GI58TS18PS107AS122PH143RS114PP142L93 M86-1S18PS107AS122PH143RS114PP142L11 M86-2S107AS122PH143RS114PP142L20 M86-3D24GI58TH143RP142L0 M86-4D24GI58TS107AS114P0 M86-5D24GI58TS107A0 M86-6D24GI58TS114P0a The A(−1)G mutation is in the KanR sequence at the position immediately before the intein; all other mutations are relative to the wild type sequence of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein. Open table in a new tab In the next round of directed evolution, random mutagenesis libraries based on the M30 intein were selected for splicing at the third insertion site (site 7; Table 1) in the KanR protein (Fig. 1). Although the M30 intein already showed a low level splicing at this site, the host E. coli cell was still sensitive to a higher concentration of kanamycin. Eight selected mutant inteins showed improved splicing, of which the two most efficient ones (M86 and M89) were chosen for further analysis. The M86 intein showed 58% splicing and contained the two new mutations S114P and P142L, whereas the M89 intein displayed 54% splicing and contained two different new mutations (I30V and H92R; Table 2). In a parallel experiment, the M30 intein was also subjected to directed evolution at another insertion site (site 9; Table 1) in the KanR protein, which was one of the three remaining sites where it was unable to splice. One round of directed evolution produced the M907 and M913 inteins, with each showing 19% splicing. The M907 intein contained one new mutation (P142L), and the M913 intein had no new mutation but altered one of the seven mutations of the M30 intein, changing the H143R mutation to the H143S mutation (Table 2). Each of the improved inteins (M86, M89, M907, and M913) was tested for splicing in the other insertion sites in the KanR protein. They all acquired the ability to splice at insertion sites 8 and 9, although none could splice at the insertion site 10 (which has Pro at position −1, Table 1). They also retained the ability to splice at all the insertion sites where the M30 intein was able to splice, except that the M913 intein lost the ability to splice at insertion site 5 in KanR protein. Furthermore, these improved inteins showed significantly higher efficiencies of splicing at most of the insertion sites when compared with the M30 intein. The M86 intein performed the best, showing higher than 50% splicing efficiencies at most of the 10 insertion sites, with the exception of sites 8 and 10 (Table 1). These improved inteins all retained the high efficiency (nearly 100%) of splicing in the pMST construct. To test whether the M86 intein also performed better than the wild type Ssp DnaB mini-intein in a different host protein, the protein kinase GSK3b was chosen. The M86 intein was inserted before Ser-9 of the protein kinase, which resulted in the non-native N- and C-terminal flanking amino acids RPRTT and SFAES, respectively. The M86 intein showed efficient splicing in this new host protein, whereas the wild type Ssp DnaB mini-intein showed no detectable splicing at the same location (Fig. 2). We next addressed the individual contributions of the selected mutations to the activity of the improved inteins through site-directed mutagenesis. In the context of the insertion site 1 in the KanR protein, the D24G single mutation showed 11% splicing, the I58T single mutation showed 30% splicing, whereas the two mutations together (as in the M3 intein) showed 36% splicing (supplemental Table S1). The M1 intein, which had a K20R mutation additional to the D24G and I58T mutations, showed 73% splicing, although the K20R mutation alone showed only 8% splicing. The insertion site 2 in KanR protein was used to test the effect of individual mutations of the improved inteins (Table 3). The A(−1)G mutation, which first appeared with the M30 intein, is in the KanR sequence and positioned immediately before the intein. Through site-directed mutagenesis, the A(−1)G mutation was not only found to increase the splicing efficiency of the M30 intein from 71 to 98%, but also made the wild type and the M3 inteins (which were unable to splice at this site without this mutation) splice with 7 and 65% efficiencies, respectively (Table 3). These findings suggested that the intein mutants retained a preference for the native Gly residue at the −1 position, although they had also acquired the ability to splice with different amino acids at this position. For the remaining six mutations of the M30 intein, nine"

Chromatin modification enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases (HDACs), and chromatin remodeling factors have recently been reported to regulate MyoD activity during muscle differentiation. For example, the histone acetyltransferases p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetylate histones H3, H4, and MyoD, with both proteins synergistically activating the transcription of MyoD target genes via recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes. Before skeletal muscle differentiation, HDACs such as HDAC1 and Sir2 located on chromatin inhibit gene activation (13Sartorelli V. Caretti G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

These enzymes play roles as positive or negative regulators of MyoD and control MyoD activity by balancing epigenetic status through post-translational modifications (14Mal A. Sturniolo M.

SETD3 was expressed predominantly in muscle cells and exerted general transcriptional stimulatory effects deriving from H3K4 and H3K36 methylation. Accordingly, we suggest that SETD3 plays an important role in muscle differentiation by regulating muscle-specific factors, most notably myogenin, through interaction with MyoD. To identify a novel SET domain-harboring protein, we used the EnsMart protein mining program. We used the Pfam ID filter (00865) and the novel protein option. Candidate genes were blasted to the Pfam site to calculate the probabilities of the SET domain and other structures. The full-length open reading frame of SETD3 along with truncated SETD3 constructs (SETD3-N, SETD3-C) were PCR-amplified from a mouse cDNA library (Clontech). The PCR products were subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), pCMX-GAL4, or His/V5-tagged pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression vectors. The shRNA against mouse SETD3 (RMM1766-96884536) was purchased from OpenBiosystems. The full-length open reading frame of zebrafish SETD3 cDNA was also purchased from OpenBiosystems. The PCR products were subcloned into HA/myc/His-tagged pcDNA6 (Invitrogen). The siRNAs against mouse MyoD (sc-35991) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. NIH3T3 (mouse embryo fibroblast), H9c2 (rat cardiomyoblast), and C2C12 (mouse skeletal myoblast) cells were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Welgene) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), or 15% for C2C12 cells, in growth medium (GM) and then induced to differentiate in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum or 1% FBS (differentiation medium, DM). To establish the cell line stably expressing knocked down endogenous SETD3, C2C12 and H9c2 cells were transfected with sh-SETD3 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), after which the stably transfected clones were selected. HMTase assay was conducted overnight at 30 °C in a 35-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μg/μl core histones from calf thymus (Roche Applied Science) as a substrate for enzyme activity, 100 nCi of S-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]-l-methionine (SAM; Amersham Biosciences), GST-SETD3, and GST in 5 × HMTase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.25 m sucrose) (23Li B.

Peptides (H3N1 (ARTKQT), H3N2 (TARKST), H3N3 (AARKSA), H3N4 (STGGVK), and H4N1 (RHRKVA)) were synthesized based on the amino acid sequences of histones H3 and H4 (Peptron). Proteins/peptides were filtered with p81 filter paper (Millipore) and washed three times in cold 10% TCA and 95% ethanol for 5 min at room temperature. The filters were then air-dried, and 5 ml of Ultima Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added followed by quantification of [14C]SAM using a scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Synthetic peptides (H3N1, H3N2, and H3N4) were used as substrates in the HMTase assay with GST-SETD3. The reaction was halted by precipitation with 10% TCA followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The methylated peptides in the supernatants were analyzed via LC-MS at the Korea Basic Science Institute. The transfected cells were lysed and loaded onto 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed overnight with anti-H3K4-me2 (1:2000), anti-H3K9-me2 (1:2000), anti-H3K27-me2 (1:2000), and anti-H3K36-me2 (1:2000) antibodies (Millipore) at 4 °C. The blots were finally incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected using an ECL system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) along with MH100-GAL4-SV40-Luc (100 ng), pcDNA3.1-SETD3 (100 ng, 200 ng, 250 ng), pCMX-GAL4-SETD3 (100 ng, 200 ng, 250 ng), or sh-SETD3 (100 ng, 200 ng). Luciferase activity was measured by adding 20 μl of luciferin as a substrate to 80 μl of cell lysates using a Glomax luminescence luminometer (Promega). The level of β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration were used for normalization of reporter luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, respectively. Each value is the mean of quadruplicate determinations of a single assay. The results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. H9c2 and C2C12 cells were transfected with SETD3 or sh-SETD3, after which total RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa). The cDNA was generated using 1 μg of RNA with oligo(dT) and reverse transcriptase (Enzynomics). The primer sequences of the muscle genes are provided in Table 1. The amplification reaction was performed under the following conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 58 °C, and extension at 72 °C. Disassociation curves were generated after each PCR run to ensure that a single product of the appropriate length was amplified. The mean threshold cycle (Ct) ± S.E. were calculated from individual Ct values obtained from triplicates per stage. The normalized mean Ct was estimated as ΔCt by subtracting the mean Ct of GAPDH from that of the muscle genes. The value ΔΔCt was calculated as the difference between control ΔCt and values obtained for each sample. The n-fold change in gene expression relative to untreated control was calculated as 2−ΔΔCt.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for RT-PCRTarget mRNAOrganismPrimer sequenceaF, forward; R, reverse.SETD3Mus musculusF: 5′-GATGGGAAAAGAGAAGATTAC-3′R: 5′-ACTGTGGATCACAAACTCTGC-3′Rattus norvegicusF: 5′-AGTACATTGAGCGCCTACAGGCCTT-3′R: 5′-ACCCAGCCTGACAGACAATCTCAGTT-3′MyogeninMus musculusF: 5′-AGTACATTGAGCGCCTACAGGCCTT-3′R: 5′-ACCCAGCCTGACAGACAATCTCAGTT-3′Rattus norvegicusF: 5′-AGGAGAGAAAGATGGAGTCCAGAG-3′R: 5′-TAACAAAAGAAGTCACCCCAAGAG-3′MCKMus musculusF: 5′-CCGTTCGGCAACACCCACAACA-3′R: 5′-TCCAGGTCGTCTCCACCCTTGA-3′Rattus norvegicusF: 5′-ACTACAAGCCTCAGGAGGAGTA-3′R: 5′-CTTATCGCGAAGCTTATTGTAG-3′Myf6Mus musculusF: 5′-ACTAAAGAAAATCAACGAAGCCTTTGA-3′R: 5′-AAATACTGTCCACGATGGAAGAAA-3′Rattus norvegicusF: 5′-CTTAAGAAAATCAACGAAGCCTTTGA-3′R: 5′-AAATACTGTCCACGATGGAAGAAA-3′GAPDHMus musculusF: 5′-GCATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCT-3′R: 5′-CCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTCAT-3′Rattus norvegicusF: 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′R: 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′a F, forward; R, reverse. Open table in a new tab C2C12 cells were differentiated and harvested after 4 days. The resultant cells were then treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min in medium at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min at room temperature, after which the cells were scraped into SDS lysis buffer. The sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and subsequently recovered with protein A/G-agarose beads (GeneDEPOT). After reversing the cross-links, chromatin was subjected to proteinase K digestion and the DNA purified. Then, a 326-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides −227 to +109 of the mouse myogenin gene proximal promoter along with a 304-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides −2180 to −1876 of the mouse myogenin gene distal promoter were PCR-amplified. The primer sequences were as follows: myogenin gene promoter (forward, 5′-AGGGTGGGGTGGGGGCAAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGGGGCTCGAAGCCCTGAA-3′). Myogenin gene distal promoter region (forward, 5′-GCCTCAGTGTGTCCCAATTT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTGTCCTGCTATCCCTGCT-3′). The amplification reaction was performed under the following conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 58 °C, and extension at 72 °C. Disassociation curves were generated after each PCR run to ensure that a single product of appropriate length was amplified. The mean Ct ± S.E. were calculated from individual Ct values obtained from triplicate determinations per stage. The normalized mean Ct was estimated as ΔCt by subtracting the mean Ct of input from that of myogenin gene. For the MyoD interaction assays, the transfected cells were lysed for 1 h in lysis buffer at 4 °C. After the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-SETD3 antibodies overnight at 4 °C, protein A/G-agarose beads (GeneDEPOT) were added for 3 h with rotation at 4 °C. The bound proteins were then analyzed via immunoblotting with anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-MyoD (Millipore), and anti-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. To generate SETD3 rabbit polyclonal antibody, we used TFDGKREDYFPDL (amino acids 70–82 of mouse SETD3) as immunogens. For in vitro transcription and translation, 35S-labeled SETD3 proteins were constructed using a coupled transcription and translation (TNT) system (Promega). In brief, 1 μg of DNA was added directly to TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and then permitted to react for 2 h at 30 °C. GST and GST-MyoD purified proteins were incubated overnight with 10 μl of radioactive TNT reaction in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Beads were washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and resuspended, after which the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. C2C12 cells were seeded in 4-well chamber slides and transiently co-transfected with pEGFP-SETD3 and pcDNA6-MyoD. After 2 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 1% BSA, cells were incubated with anti-MyoD antibody, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Then slides were then mounted with GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda), and resulting images were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM5 Exiter). SETD3 was predicted to be located on the 14th chromosome in human (ENSG00000183576) and on the 12th chromosome in mouse (ENSMUSG00000056770). The predicted full-length SETD3 was 594 amino acids, and several shorter transcript isoforms were also predicted. In addition to the SET domain, SETD3 was shown to harbor the Rubis-subs-bind domain, also referred to as the Rubisco LSMT substrate binding domain (Fig. 1A). This structure plays an important role in binding to the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 (24Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). No other short variants included the Rubis-subs-bind domain, suggesting weaker substrate binding affinity compared with that of full-length SETD3. We cloned the full-length variant mouse SETD3, and SETD3 deletion mutants were constructed that lacked either a SET domain (SETD3-C) or Rubis-subs-bind domain (SETD3-N) (Fig. 1A). Initially, we evaluated the pattern of SETD3 expression in the tissues of 8-week-old mice using SETD3 antibodies. SETD3 was prominently expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles and was also detected weakly in the stomach, small intestine, and colon (Fig. 1B), thereby suggesting that SETD3 may perform a function in the muscle environment. Shorter isoforms were also detected in the lung and skeletal muscles, but the expression levels were relatively low. To determine whether or not SETD3 might have HMTase activity, we conducted an in vitro HMTase assay with GST-SETD3 protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, we were able to detect the HMTase activity of SETD3 on core histones; this activity was determined to be dose-dependent. The SET domain lacking SETD3-C completely lost HMTase activity. However, the Rubis-subs domain deletion mutant SETD3-N demonstrated weak HMTase activity, suggesting that the Rubis-subs-bind domain is required for HMTase activity (Fig. 2A). We next performed an HMTase assay with histone H3 and H4 peptides wherein each six amino acid-peptide harbored only one lysine residue. SETD3 demonstrated profound methylation activity toward the histone H3 peptides, H3N1 and H3N4, indicating that histones H3K4 and H3K36 are the primary methylation target residues (Fig. 2B). To further characterize the lysine specificity of SETD3, the histone peptides were analyzed via LC-MS spectrometry after in vitro HMTase assay. We detected mono- and dimethylated H3N1 peptides as well as mono- and dimethylated H3N4 peptides. The molecular mass of unmethylated H3N1 peptide was determined to be 775.3 Da, whereas the mono- and dimethylated peptides evidenced peaks at 791.1 and 806.2 Da, respectively. For the H3N4 peptides (532.2 Da), we observed both a monomethylated peak at 548.2 Da as well as a weak dimethylated peak at 563.1 Da (Fig. 2C). By way of contrast, the H3N2 (H3K9) peptides evidenced no peak changes (data not shown). We further evaluated the methylation specificity of SETD3 toward H3K4 and H3K36 in vivo by conducting Western blotting using specific antibodies in SETD3-overexpressing cells. Following SETD3 overexpression, the nucleosome extracts were probed with dimethylated lysine 4, 9, 27, and 36 H3 antibodies. Consistent with our mass spectrometry results, the dimethylation of H3K4 and H3K36 increased in the SETD3-overexpressing cells to a level relative to that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Deletion of the SET domain (SETD3-C) but not Rubis-subs-bind domain (SETD3-N) failed to dimethylate H3K4 and H3K36 (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that SETD3 exerts specific HMTase activity in the mono- and dimethylation of H3K4 and H3K36 under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. It was noted previously that histone H3K4 HMTase SMYD1 functions as a transcription activator, playing an essential role in myogenesis and cardiogenesis in different species (6Tan X. Rotllant J.

To determine whether or not methylation of H3K4 and H3K36 by SETD3 can be attributed to a general transcription activation effect similar to that of SMYD1, we conducted a transient transfection assay using the CMX-GAL4-SV40 reporter system. The transfection of pcDNA3.1-SETD3 into NIH3T3 and C2C12 skeletal myoblast cells resulted in the activation of luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, inducing up to a 3-fold increase in basal transcription (Fig. 3, A and C). A reduction in transcription with sh-SETD3 confirmed the role of SETD3 in SV40 transactivation (Fig. 3C). To evaluate the direct effects of SETD3 on transcriptional regulation, we fused SETD3 to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and conducted a transfection assay with a GAL4-dependent luciferase reporter. The GAL4-SETD3 fusion protein activated basal transcription of the reporter gene, showing that the direct recruitment of GAL4-SETD3 to the GAL4 binding site-containing promoter could mediate transcriptional activation (Figs. 3, B and D). These findings suggest that SETD3 may activate the transcription of target genes in muscle cell differentiation. Next, we attempted to investigate the in vivo function of SETD3 in muscle cells because SETD3 was expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle tissues (Fig. 1B). The differentiation of C2C12 cells was induced by incubation for 12 days with 1% FBS, and the level of SETD3 expression was monitored. SETD3 expression gradually increased for up to 12 days during muscle cell differentiation (Fig. 4A). To determine whether or not SETD3 activates known muscle cell differentiation markers, we transiently overexpressed SETD3 and analyzed gene expression via real-time PCR. When SETD3 was overexpressed under growth conditions, the levels of muscle differentiation markers such as myogenin, MCK, and Myf6 increased dramatically in H9c2 cells, and MCK was increased in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4B). To investigate further whether or not SETD3 affects muscle gene expression, we stably knocked down SETD3 using shRNA. Significant reduction in the expression of muscle differentiation marker genes (myogenin, MCK, Myf5, and Myf6) was observed when SETD3 was stably knocked down by shRNA in H9c2 and C2C12 cells (Fig. 4C). MyoD and Desmin gene expression was also decreased in SETD3-knocked down C2C12 cells (data not shown). Our findings demonstrate that SETD3 activates the transcription of muscle differentiation target genes and induces muscle differentiation. The endogenous role of SETD3 was further corroborated by the observation that three independent sh-SETD3 clones all blocked muscle differentiation (Fig. 4D). The morphology of sh-SETD3-treated cells showed no indication of cell elongation, which is the result of myoblast fusion and multinucleation (data not shown). This suggests that SETD3 knockdown-mediated inhibition of myogenesis is partly due to the blockage of myoblast fusion. MyoD functions as a myogenesis regulator and controls the expression of muscle cell differentiation marker genes. To determine whether or not SETD3 can regulate the transcription of a target gene, myogenin, we examined its promoter activity using a luciferase reporter system. First, we co-transfected the myogenin promoter reporter gene and SETD3 into C2C12 cells. As the concentration of SETD3 increased, the luciferase activity increased up to a level of 2.5-fold (Fig. 5A). Previous research suggested that MyoD regulates myogenesis via interaction with HMTase Suv39h1 by methylating H3K9 on the myogenin gene promoter (16Mal A.K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to test the interaction of SETD3 with MyoD during muscle differentiation. Initially, we evaluated the interaction between SETD3 and MyoD via immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. We overexpressed FLAG-SETD3 and GFP-MyoD in C2C12 cells and conducted IPs using anti-SETD3 antibodies. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies confirmed the interaction between SETD3 and MyoD (Fig. 5B). To confirm further the direct interaction between SETD3 and MyoD, in vitro transcription was conducted, after which translated SETD3 was incubated with purified GST-MyoD. As anticipated, SETD3 interacted with GST-MyoD but not with GST, further verifying direct interaction between SETD3 and MyoD (Fig. 5C). We further analyzed the association between endogenous MyoD and SETD3 upon induction of muscle differentiation. Physical interaction of endogenous SETD3 and MyoD was confirmed in differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 5D). To determine whether or not SETD3 localized to the nucleus, we monitored SETD3 and MyoD expression by immunofluorescence analysis. As expected, overexpressed SETD3 and MyoD were present predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 5E). To establish further the mechanism underlying SETD3-mediated transcriptional activation of the myogenin gene promoter, we conducted ChIP analysis with real-time PCR and investigated the occupancy of the myogenin gene promoter region. IP was conducted on both undifferentiated (GM) and differentiated cells (DM). The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were amplified via real-time PCR from the promoter region (positions −227 to +109; E-box containing) and distal promoter region (positions −2180 to −1876) of the myogenin gene. Compared with the results under GM conditions, recruitment of MyoD and SETD3 to the myogenin gene promoter region increased under DM conditions (Fig. 5F). The depletion of MyoD by si-MyoD in C2C12 cells also resulted in failed recruitment of SETD3 and MyoD to the myogenin gene promoter under DM conditions (Fig. 5G). Additionally, the levels of dimethylated H3K4 and dimethylated H3K36 increased up to 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively, under DM conditions, whereas the level of dimethylated H3K9 did not increase (Fig. 5H). On the contrary, no changes were detected in MyoD and SETD3 recruitment, and hence histone methylation in the distal promoter region of the myogenin gene remained the same (Fig. 5, F, G, and H). Our findings collectively indicate that SETD3 elevates the transcription of myogenin via interaction with MyoD, and recruitment of SETD3 to the myogenin promoter further modifies the methylation status of H3K4 and K36.FIGURE 5SETD3 interacts with MyoD and is recruited to myogenin gene promoter. A, C2C12 cells were transfected with the pGL3-myogenin promoter (100 ng) or pcDNA3.1-SETD3 (none, 100, 300 ng). B, C2C12 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged SETD3 and GFP-tagged MyoD constructs as indicated, and SETD3 immunoprecipitates were analyzed via immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies. C, SETD3 was in vitro transcribed/translated and then incubated with purified GST-MyoD and GST bound to beads. GST and GST-MyoD were incubated without 35S-labeled SETD3 (second and third lanes). Amounts of GST-MyoD proteins were determined via Coomassie staining. Pulled-down proteins were analyzed via SDS-PAGE with a PhosphorImager. D, physical interaction of endogenous proteins in C2C12 cells under GM and DM conditions is shown. E, C2C12 cells co-transfected with pEGFP-SETD3 and pcDNA6-MyoD were immunostained with antibodies against MyoD. DAPI staining represents nucleus. F, schematic diagram shows primer pairs in ChIP assay and real-time PCR analysis (upper panel). ChIP analyses were conducted using control IgG, anti-SETD3, and anti-MyoD antibodies prior to or after 48 h of differentiation of C2C12 cells. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were amplified via real-time PCR from the myogenin gene promoter region. Recruitment of MyoD and SETD3 to the myogenin promoter region and distal promoter region was normalized to input. G, recruitment of MyoD and SETD3 to the myogenin promoter and distal region was analyzed via ChIP assay and real-time PCR using si-MyoD-treated C2C12 cells. H, ChIP assay and real-time PCR were used to measure the methylation status of histones H3K4-me2, H3K9-me2, H3K27-me2, and H3K36-me2 in the myogenin promoter region and distal promoter region prior to and after 48 h of differentiation of C2C12 cells under DM conditions.

SETD3 is highly expressed in mouse muscle tissues, which suggests that it may have muscle-related functions in vivo. Because a variety of histone methylations have been identified as important regulatory markers for gene expression, we next attempted to identify the specific HMTase activity of SETD3 and evaluate its effects on the transcriptional regulation of target genes. Using different in vitro and in vivo HMTase assays, we determined that SETD3 evidences H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferase activity. The methylation of H3K4 and H3K36 is linked with transcriptional activation (28Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of other studies, H3K4 and H3K36-methylating SETD3 was found to activate the basal transcription of reporter genes. Skeletal myogenesis is a developmental process that requires delicate balance between transcriptional activation and repression. It has been reported in previous studies that H3K4 HMTase SMYD1 performs a critical function in heart and skeletal muscle development (6Tan X. Rotllant J. Li H. De Deyne P. Du S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2713-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims R.J. Yamagishi H. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In particular, the results of SMYD1 knockdown studies using zebrafish embryos suggest that HMTase activity is required for myofiber maturation (6Tan X. Rotllant J. Li H. De Deyne P. Du S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2713-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Gottlieb P.D. Pierce S.A. Sims R.J. Yamagishi H. Weihe E.K. Harriss J.V. Maika S.D. Kuziel W.A. King H.L. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. Srivastava D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). SETD3 overexpression induces muscle cell differentiation as well as the expression of muscle-specific genes such as MCK, myogenin, and Myf6. Consistent results were obtained when we evaluated the regulatory role of SETD3 in the transcription of the MyoD target gene, myogenin. Per the results, the H3K4- and H3K36-methylating activity of SETD3 induced activation of the muscle-specific marker myogenin as well as muscle cell differentiation. We further determined that SETD3 and MyoD interacted each other, synergistically activating myogenin expression after recruitment to the target gene promoter. A recent report suggesting that SMYD1 expression is regulated by serum response factor as well as myogenin further suggests the role of a complex transcriptional network in myogenesis (26Li D. Niu Z. Yu W. Qian Y. Wang Q. Li Q. Yi Z. Luo J. Wu X. Wang Y. Schwartz R.J. Liu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment between SMYD1 and SETD3 SET domains shows very low similarity (15%) between these two methyltransferases. Further research will therefore be necessary to identify the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of SETD3 in myogenesis. Collectively, our findings provide evidence demonstrating that HMTase SETD3 plays a role in muscle differentiation via interaction with MyoD and recruitment to the target gene myogenin promoter. Our results linking H3K4/K36 methylation by SETD3 with muscle cell differentiation provide insights into yet another role of histone modification-mediated transcriptional regulation in muscle development.

https://openalex.org/W1994618474,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immunity against invading pathogens. Although TLR signaling has been indicated to protect cells from infection of several viruses, the role of TLRs in Dengue virus (DENV) replication is still unclear. In the present study, we examined the replication of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) by challenging hepatoma cells HepG2 with different TLR ligands. Activation of TLR3 showed an antiviral effect, while pretreatment of other TLR ligands (including TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, TLR5 or TLR7/8) did not show a significant effect. TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) treatment prior to viral infection or simultaneously, but not post-treatment, significantly down-regulated virus replication. Pretreatment with poly(I:C) reduced viral mRNA expression and viral staining positive cells, accompanying an induction of the type I interferon (IFN-β) and type III IFN (IL-28A/B). Intriguingly, neutralization of IFN-β alone successfully restored the poly(I:C)-inhibited replication of DENV2. The poly(I:C)-mediated effects, including IFN induction and DENV2 suppression, were significantly reversed by IKK inhibitor, further suggesting that IFN-β is the dominant factor involved in the poly(I:C) mediated antiviral effect. Our study presented the first evidence to show that activation of TLR3 is effective in blocking DENV2 replication via IFN-β, providing an experimental clue that poly(I:C) may be a promising immunomodulatory agent against DENV infection and might be applicable for clinical prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2107254624,"The human ghrelin gene, which encodes the ghrelin and obestatin peptides, contains 5 exons (Ex), with Ex1-Ex4 encoding a 117 amino-acid (aa) preproprotein that is known to be processed to yield a 28-aa (ghrelin) and/or a 23-aa (obestatin) mature peptides, which possess biological activities in multiple tissues. However, the ghrelin gene also encodes additional peptides through alternative splicing or post-translational modifications. Indeed, we previously identified a spliced mRNA ghrelin variant in mouse (In2-ghrelin-variant), which is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner by metabolic status and may thus be of biological relevance. Here, we have characterized a new human ghrelin variant that contains Ex0-1, intron (In) 1, and Ex2 and lacks Ex3-4. This human In1-ghrelin variant would encode a new prepropeptide that conserves the first 12aa of native-ghrelin (including the Ser3-potential octanoylation site) but has a different C-terminal tail. Expression of In1-variant was detected in 22 human tissues and its levels were positively correlated with those of ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT; p = 0.0001) but not with native-ghrelin expression, suggesting that In1-ghrelin could be a primary substrate for GOAT in human tissues. Interestingly, levels of In1-ghrelin variant expression in breast cancer samples were 8-times higher than those of normal mammary tissue, and showed a strong correlation in breast tumors with GOAT (p = 0.0001), ghrelin receptor-type 1b (GHSR1b; p = 0.049) and cyclin-D3 (a cell-cycle inducer/proliferation marker; p = 0.009), but not with native-ghrelin or GHSR1a expression. Interestingly, In1-ghrelin variant overexpression increased basal proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results provide evidence that In1-ghrelin is a novel element of the ghrelin family with a potential pathophysiological role in breast cancer."

In mice placed on a 3-day high fat diet, we find augmented eIF2α signaling, together with hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. To clarify the role of the liver ER stress-dependent phospho-eIF2α (eIF2α-P) pathway in response to acute caloric excess on liver and muscle glucose and lipid metabolism, we studied transgenic mice in which the hepatic ER stress-dependent eIF2α-P pathway was inhibited by overexpressing a constitutively active C-terminal fragment of GADD34/PPP1R15a, a regulatory subunit of phosphatase that terminates ER stress signaling by phospho-eIF2α. Inhibition of the eIF2α-P signaling in liver led to a decrease in hepatic glucose production in the basal and clamped state, which could be attributed to reduced gluconeogenic gene expression, resulting in reduced basal plasma glucose concentrations. Surprisingly, hepatic eIF2α inhibition also impaired insulin-stimulated muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. This latter effect could be attributed at least in part by an increase in circulating IGFBP-3 levels in the transgenic animals. In addition, infusion of insulin during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp induced conspicuous ER stress in the 3-day high fat diet-fed mice, which was aggravated through continuous dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Together, these data imply that the hepatic ER stress eIF2α signaling pathway affects hepatic glucose production without altering hepatic insulin sensitivity. Moreover, hepatic ER stress-dependent eIF2α-P signaling is implicated in an unanticipated cross-talk between the liver and peripheral organs to influence insulin sensitivity, probably via IGFBP-3.

https://openalex.org/W1971826305,"Proper vessel maturation, remodeling of endothelial junctions, and recruitment of perivascular cells is crucial for establishing and maintaining vessel functions. In proliferative retinopathies, hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is associated with disruption of the vascular barrier, edema, and vision loss. Therefore, identifying factors that regulate vascular maturation is critical to target pathological angiogenesis. Given the conflicting role of angiopoietin-like-4 (ANGPTL4) reported in the current literature using gain of function systems both in vitro and in vivo, the goal of this study was to characterize angiogenesis, focusing on perinatal retinal vascularization and pathological circumstances in angpl4-deficient mice. We report altered organization of endothelial junctions and pericyte coverage, both leading to impaired angiogenesis and increased vascular leakage that were eventually caught up, suggesting a delay in vessel maturation. In a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, pathological neovascularization, which results from tissue hypoxia, was also strongly inhibited in angptl4-deficient mice.

Angiopoietins have been described as critical factors in vessel maturation.

In this study, we sought to investigate the function of ANGPTL4 during both developmental and pathological retinal angiogenesis. We show here that ANGPTL4 is expressed in retinal endothelial cells in a developmentally regulated manner. Using angptl4-deficient mice, we here characterize a defect in sprouting and branching during developmental angiogenesis, a delay in the maturation of the retinal vasculature as shown by alterations in endothelial cell junctions and defects in pericyte coverage, and increased vascular leakage. Furthermore, pathological neovascularization, which results from tissue hypoxia, is impaired in angptl4-deficient mice in a model of retinopathy of prematurity. Altogether, these results provide genetic evidence that loss of ANGPTL4 impairs sprouting angiogenesis resulting from tissue hypoxia, both in developmental and in pathological conditions, and delays maturation of blood vessels and acquisition of vascular barrier properties. The experiments were performed in accordance with the official regulations set forth by the French Ministry of Agriculture and the European Union Council Directives (86/609/EEC). This study conforms to the standards of INSERM (the French National Institute of Health) regarding the care and use of laboratory animals. Genotype was determined by PCR of tail DNA under the following conditions: Denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 56 °C for 0.75 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.15 min, 30 cycles. The following primers pairs were used: angptl4, 5′-AAGGAGCAAAGGGTGCGAGAGAGTTG-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGAAACATTGGTGGC-3′; and LacZ, 5′-CGAAAACCCAAACTGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTCATTCCCCAGCGACCAGATG-3′. P6 and P7 pups were sacrificed and the eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Retinas were dissected, and immunostaining was performed as described previously (17Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar). For LacZ staining, retinas where washed three times in PBS and incubated at 37 °C in a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) solution. For staining, retinas were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20). After three washes of 20 min in Pblec buffer (PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2), retinas were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies and/or isolectin B4 (IB4) in Pblec buffer. After three PBS washes, retinas were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies in incubation buffer (PBS, 0.25% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Retinal flat mounts were then prepared in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and visualized using a Leica (Deerfield, IL) TCS SP5 microscope using a ×10/0.3 numerical aperture, ×20/0.7 numerical aperture, ×40/1.25 numerical aperture, or ×63/1.4 numerical aperture objective. For Ve-cadherin (VE-CAD) immunostaining, mice were perfused with 1% paraformaldehyde, and retinas were processed using Ca2+-Mg2+ PBS (CaCl2 1 mm, MgCl2 1 mm). Retinas were immunostained using biotinylated IB4 (1:50, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), anti-chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2, 1:40, Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (1:75, DAKO), anti-caveolin 1 (CAV-1, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1, 1:100, Invitrogen), and anti-VE-CAD (BV-13, gift from E. Dejana, Institute of Molecular Oncology Foundation Milano). The corresponding streptavidin conjugate and secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). P7 pups were sacrificed, the eyes were enucleated, and retinas were dissected. Proteins were extracted on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 2.5 mm Na pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-CAV-1, anti-actin (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, UK) and appropriate phosphatase alkaline-coupled secondary antibodies were used. The signal was revealed by Attophos chemiluminescence (Promega) and band intensity was quantified by Quantity One 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad). P7 pups were sacrificed, the eyes were enucleated, and retinas were dissected. Total RNA was isolated by extraction using a commercial kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany, Nucleospin RNA II). Reverse transcription, real-time quantitative PCR (in triplicate) and analysis were performed as described previously (18Xu Y. Yuan L. Mak J. Pardanaud L. Caunt M. Kasman I. Larrivée B. Del Toro R. Suchting S. Medvinsky A. Silva J. Yang J. Thomas J.L. Koch A.W. Alitalo K. Eichmann A. Bagri A. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Vegfa, vegfr2, and Cav-1 genes were detected using QuantiTect primer assays (Qiagen). The mRNA expression level was normalized to the housekeeping gene encoding gapdh. Fold changes were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method. Images of whole mount retinas were acquired on a Leica DM LB microscope using a ×20/0.4 NA objective and captured using a QImaging Fast1394 camera through Qcapture software version 2.98.2 (Quantitative Imaging Corp., Surrey, British Columbia, Canada). The number of branch points per field was quantified with the Biologic CMM analyzer software (Centre de Morphologie Mathematiques-ARMINES, France) (19Jones E.A. Yuan L. Breant C. Watts R.J. Eichmann A. Development. 2008; 135: 2479-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Vessel diameter and filopodia bursts were counted manually. Using ImageJ software, images were filtered and converted to binary images. The total vessel area was assessed by counting the number of white versus black pixels in the binary images. Quantifications were performed on six to eight images per retina (n = 8 per group). Evans Blue (10 mg/ml) was injected into the tail vein of P7 angptl4LacZ/LacZ and angptl4+/LacZ control mice. Thirty minutes later, mice were sacrificed, and an intracardiac perfusion was performed with citrate buffer (pH 4) to remove intravenous Evans Blue. Eyes were enucleated and retinas dissected and then weighed. Evans Blue was then eluted from retinas in 0.5 ml of formamide for 18 h at 70 °C. After centrifugation, the absorbance was measured at 620 nm using a spectrophotometer (Biomate 3, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Extravated Evans blue (ng) was determined from a standard curve and normalized to retinal weight (g). FITC beads (Duke Scientific Corp., Palo Alto, CA) were diluted 1:10 in physiological serum, and 20 μl were injected into the tail vein in anesthetized pups. The vasculature was then perfused with 5 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde. Retina whole mounts were imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 microscope using a ×63/1.4 NA oil immersion objective. An increment of 0.117 μm between each section was used. Deconvolution of the stacks of pictures was made using the Amira deconvolution module. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the different structures was obtained using the labelvoxel and surfacegen modules in the Amira 5.2.1 software (Visage Imaging GmbH). P7 pups, along with nursing mothers, were placed in 75% oxygen for 5 days and then returned to room air. The oxygen concentration was maintained by a Pro-OX oxygen controller (BioSpherix, NY). Pups were sacrificed at different time points: P12 and P17. Eyes were enucleated and fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunostaining was performed as described above. Retinal flat mounts were generated, and confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope with a ×20/0.7 NA oil immersion objective. Photomerge was performed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). The vaso-obliterated area was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess the statistical differences between measurements (GraphPad Prism 4, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Histograms represent mean ± S.E. and ns, p > 0.05. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.001. We first sought to investigate the function of ANGPTL4 during developmental angiogenesis using a genetic mouse model in which the angptl4 gene was replaced by a knockin LacZ cassette (20Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Frendewey D. Gale N.W. Economides A.N. Auerbach W. Poueymirou W.T. Adams N.C. Rojas J. Yasenchak J. Chernomorsky R. Boucher M. Elsasser A.L. Esau L. Zheng J. Griffiths J.A. Wang X. Su H. Xue Y. Dominguez M.G. Noguera I. Torres R. Macdonald L.E. Stewart A.F. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), thereby generating angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice. Some lethality was observed during development, but surviving angptl4LacZ/LacZ neonates were obtained at approximately 6% (compared with the 25% expected frequency, supplemental Fig. 1) that were viable and fertile and did not exhibit obvious defects. β-gal staining in angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice on whole mount retinas showed expression in endothelial cells in the capillary plexus as well as in veins and arteries of the developing retina at critical time points during development, i.e. P7, P12, and P17 (Fig. 1, A–C). We then addressed whether ANGPTL4 could play a role during development of the retinal vasculature. We compared IB4-stained P6 retinal flat whole mounts from angptl4LacZ/LacZ and angptl4+/LacZ pups (Fig. 1, D and G) used as controls, as they did not exhibit any difference with wild-type mice (data not shown). First, we focused our attention on sprouting at the vascular front. The mean number of filopodia bursts in the vascular front was quantified as described above (supplemental Fig. 2B) and was found to be significantly decreased in angptl4LacZ/LacZ pups (Fig. 1J). Expansion of the retinal blood vessel network was similar in both genotypes (data not shown). Using confocal images of IB4-stained retinas, we then manually quantified artery, vein, and capillary diameters in retinas of angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice versus control mice. Veins and capillaries from angptl4LacZ/LacZ were larger (15 and 8%, respectively) than their angptl4+/LacZ counterparts (Fig. 1K), whereas artery thickness was similar. Also, an increase in vascular density (that corresponds to the ratio between IB4-positive (IB4+) area and total retina area) and a decrease in number of branch points (quantified as described in the previous section and in supplemental Fig. 2B), were quantified in retinas from angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice (Fig. 1, L and M, respectively). The astrocytic network is known to guide vascular expansion in the retina (21Fruttiger M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 522-527PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore next examined both its network density and branch points in avascular and vascular areas (Fig. 1, N and O, respectively) using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody in both angptl4LacZ/LacZ and angptl4+/LacZ pups (Fig. 1, E, F, H, and I). No difference was observed both in the vascular and avascular areas between both genotypes. Furthermore, no difference was observed in retina vegfa mRNA expression (Fig. 1P) between angptl4LacZ/LacZ and angptl4+/LacZ retinas, suggesting that astrocytes in angptl4-deficient mice also function normally by producing equal levels of vegfa mRNA. As a control, we also show that vegfr2 mRNA expression levels in retinal endothelial cells are not differentially expressed between both genotypes. Altogether, these results suggest that astrocytes are not likely to be involved in regulating the defects of the developing vascular network in angptl4LacZ/LacZ pups. Altogether, these data show that sprouting and branching as well as maturation of blood vessels are affected during developmental angiogenesis of the retinas in angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice. We then further examined the developing vascular network of the retina, thereby allowing to distinguish three distinct regions: Area 1, mature vascular plexus, close to the optic nerve, with differentiated veins and arteries (α-smooth muscle actin positive cell coverage) and thin capillaries; area 2, immature vascular plexus undergoing remodeling, characterized by capillaries with larger diameters; and finally, area 3, the vascular front, where tip and stalk cells are located (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). We used immunostaining of CAV-1, an important regulator of blood vessel maturation (22Frank P.G. Woodman S.E. Park D.S. Lisanti M.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), to distinguish the mature network (area 1) from the outgrowing, immature vascular plexus (areas 2/3) in P6 control retinas (supplemental Fig. 2, C–F). To avoid any bias in the analysis of CAV-1 staining because of differences in vessel density between vascular areas or between mouse strains, we normalized the CAV-1+ area to the total vessel area (IB4+). Quantification of the ratio of CAV-1+ surface and endothelial cell surface (IB4 + vessels) was performed in both areas (supplemental Fig. 2, E and F), showing a 37.4% decrease in immature areas 2/3 when compared with mature area 1. This ratio was then quantified in P6 retinas from angptl4LacZ/LacZ and control mice (Fig. 2, A–J), thereby revealing a decrease in both areas of angptl4LacZ/LacZ pups (−40% and −56% in areas 1 and 2/3, respectively) (Fig. 2, C and H). To investigate whether these findings could result from a different basal expression level, we performed real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. No differences were observed in both mRNA and proteins levels of CAV-1 from angptl4LacZ/LacZ and angptl4+/LacZ P7 retinal extracts (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). These results therefore suggest an overall defect in vessel maturation in the retina of angptl4-deficient pups, which is more pronounced in the yet immature vascular plexus. We next investigated the distribution of endothelial cell junction molecules, as their organization is also associated with vessel maturation. Distribution of VE-CAD and ZO-1, principal components of adherent and tight junctions respectively, was studied in P7 retinas of angptl4LacZ/LacZ and control mice. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, we analyzed VE-CAD and ZO-1 stainings at different depths within the retina covering the full thickness of the vessel network using confocal microscopy. Although intercellular junctions of the endothelium had continuous and elaborate junctions in control mice (Fig. 3, C and E), VE-CAD and ZO-1 were found to be more heterogeneously distributed in mutant pups (Fig. 3, D and F). Using a schematic representation of interendothelial cell junctions (Fig. 3, G and H), which allowed better appreciation of organization defects, endothelial junctions appeared disorganized and tortuous in angptl4LacZ/LacZ retinal vessels (Fig. 3, D, F and H). In the mature vascular plexus (area 1), endothelial cell tight junctions were continuous and properly organized in angptl4+/LacZ pups (supplemental Fig. 4, A and C), whereas they remained loosely organized in angptl4 LacZ/LacZ (supplemental Fig. 4, B and D). In contrast, in the vascular front (area 3), endothelial cell tight junctions showed a similar degree of immaturity in both groups (supplemental Fig. 4, E and H). We recently published that ANGPTL4 binds to extracellular matrix components (11Chomel C. Cazes A. Faye C. Bignon M. Gomez E. Ardidie-Robouant C. Barret A. Ricard-Blum S. Muller L. Germain S. Monnot C.

We then sought to investigate whether ANGPTL4 modulates pericyte recruitment and spreading during vessel maturation of newly formed vessels. At P7, retinas were double-stained with the pericyte marker NG2 and IB4 as an endothelial marker. Pericyte recruitment was not perturbed because areas of pericyte-free capillaries were never observed in angptl4LacZ/LacZ retinas. Nevertheless, in contrast to control mice (Fig. 4, A and C), pericytes failed to spread and flatten on endothelial cells, showing a prominent cellular body and well marked filopodia in areas 2/3 of angptl4 LacZ/LacZ retinas (Fig. 4, B and D). Pericyte coverage was then determined as the surface ratio of NG2+ pericytes normalized to IB4+ endothelial cells. This ratio was significantly diminished in angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice compared with control mice (19% decrease, Fig. 4E). In the vascular plexus close to the optic nerve, which had already undergone remodeling (area 1), pericyte coverage was not affected in angptl4LacZ/LacZ pups at P7 (supplemental Fig. 5). In addition, pericyte coverage of the superficial layer was unaffected at P21 (data not shown). Thus, angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice exhibit a delay in pericyte spreading on newly formed capillaries, which is eventually caught up at later stages of the maturation process. Having shown that angptl4LacZ/LacZ retinas have a delay in vascular network maturation during postnatal development, we then analyzed whether vascular permeability might be affected using two complementary methods. We first used a modified Miles assay to quantify global vascular leakage in P7 retinas. Evans Blue leakage was more prominent from angptl4LacZ/LacZ retinal vessels (Fig. 5A) compared with controls (3.5-fold increase). Moreover, we showed that FITC-coupled microspheres did not extravasate from control angptl4+/LacZ P7 pups (Fig. 5, D and F), whereas they did from angptl4LacZ/LacZ vessels (Fig. 5, E and G). As expected, deconvolution of confocal Z-stacks and three-dimensional reconstruction analyses confirmed bona fide extravasation of FITC-coupled microspheres from immature vessels of areas 1 and 2 in angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice (Fig. 5, B and C). Because pathological retinal neovascularization is typically the result of local tissue hypoxia, we also investigated the role of ANGPTL4 in the modulation of revascularization during oxygen-induced retinopathy that mimics ischemia-induced angiogenesis observed in retinopathy of prematurity. Angptl4 expression was first investigated using β-gal staining of angptl4LacZ/LacZ whole mount retinas, showing expression in endothelial cells in the capillary plexus and in the vascular tufts as well as in veins and arteries at critical time points during oxygen-induced retinopathy, i.e. P12 and P17 (supplemental Fig. 6, A and B). Oxygen-induced retinal vessel loss (from P7 to P12), was unaffected at P12 in angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice when compared with control mice (Figs. 6, A–C). In contrast, neovascularization was strongly altered because an increased vaso-obliterated area was observed in angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice at P17, when neovascularization should be maximal (60% increase in angptl4LacZ/LacZ when compared with controls, Fig. 6, D–F). In addition, a significant decrease of pericyte coverage was measured at P17 in angptl4LacZ/LacZ veins, which are the major site of sprouting angiogenesis (32.5% decrease, Fig. 6, G–I). Altogether, these data show that hypoxia-driven pathological neovascularization was compromised in the retina of angptl4LacZ/LacZ mice. This study reports the first genetic evidence of the role of ANGPTL4 on retina angiogenesis during development as well as in pathological conditions. The principal findings of this study are as follows: angptl4 is expressed in retinal endothelial cells during development and oxygen-induced retinopathy. Loss of ANGPTL4 inhibits pathological angiogenesis in ischemic ocular diseases. During development, we observed altered expression of endothelial cell maturation markers such as caveolin-1 and junction molecules, diminished pericyte coverage, and increased vascular permeability, which altogether characterize a delayed vascular maturation in angptl4-deficient pups. These defects were eventually caught up at later stages, suggesting that ANGPTL4 acts during a critical developmental period. Indeed, expression of ANGPTL4 is dynamically induced by hypoxia, whose role in the regulation of retina vascular development (25Kubota Y. Suda T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2009; 19: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and neovascularization in pathological conditions is well established in ocular diseases (26Pe'er J. Shweiki D. Itin A. Hemo I.

The present study provides new insights into the characterization of vessel maturation and acquisition of vascular barrier features (such as control of vascular permeability). Indeed, we here describe different areas, according to maturation state of retinal blood vessels, through the study of their morphology and the analysis of endothelial cell maturation markers: Area 1, close to the optic nerve is characterized by a clear capillary-free zone, fully differentiated arteries, and thin capillaries that display continuous endothelial junctions; area 2, in which vessel remodeling and pruning are ongoing pro"
https://openalex.org/W2074319812,"The insertion of tail-anchored transmembrane (TA) proteins into the appropriate membrane is a post-translational event that requires stabilization of the transmembrane domain and targeting to the proper destination. Sgt2 is a heat-shock protein cognate (HSC) co-chaperone that preferentially binds endoplasmic reticulum-destined TA proteins and directs them to the GET pathway via Get4 and Get5. Here, we present the crystal structure from a fungal Sgt2 homolog of the tetratrico-repeat (TPR) domain and part of the linker that connects to the C-terminal domain. The linker extends into the two-carboxylate clamp of the TPR domain from a symmetry-related molecule mimicking the binding to HSCs. Based on this structure, we provide biochemical evidence that the Sgt2 TPR domain has the ability to directly bind multiple HSC family members. The structure allows us to propose features involved in this lower specificity relative to other TPR containing co-chaperones. We further show that a dimer of Sgt2 binds a single Get5 and use small angle x-ray scattering to characterize the domain arrangement of Sgt2 in solution. These results allow us to present a structural model of the Sgt2-Get4/Get5-HSC complex."

Schistosoma mansoni cathepsin B1 (SmCB1) is a gut-associated peptidase that digests host blood proteins as a source of nutrients. It is under investigation as a drug target. To further this goal, we report three crystal structures of SmCB1 complexed with peptidomimetic inhibitors as follows: the epoxide CA074 at 1.3 Å resolution and the vinyl sulfones K11017 and K11777 at 1.8 and 2.5 Å resolutions, respectively. Interactions of the inhibitors with the subsites of the active-site cleft were evaluated by quantum chemical calculations. These data and inhibition profiling with a panel of vinyl sulfone derivatives identify key binding interactions and provide insight into the specificity of SmCB1 inhibition. Furthermore, hydrolysis profiling of SmCB1 using synthetic peptides and the natural substrate hemoglobin revealed that carboxydipeptidase activity predominates over endopeptidolysis, thereby demonstrating the contribution of the occluding loop that restricts access to the active-site cleft. Critically, the severity of phenotypes induced in the parasite by vinyl sulfone inhibitors correlated with enzyme inhibition, providing support that SmCB1 is a valuable drug target. The present structure and inhibitor interaction data provide a footing for the rational design of anti-schistosomal inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2144009447,"Subunit a of the vacuolar H+-ATPases plays an important role in proton transport. This membrane-integral 100-kDa subunit is thought to form or contribute to proton-conducting hemichannels that allow protons to gain access to and leave buried carboxyl groups on the proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) during proton translocation. We previously demonstrated that subunit a contains a large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a C-terminal domain containing eight transmembrane (TM) helices. TM7 contains a buried arginine residue (Arg-735) that is essential for proton transport and is located on a helical face that interacts with the proteolipid ring. To further define the topology of the C-terminal domain, the accessibility of 30 unique cysteine residues to the membrane-permeant reagent N-ethylmaleimide and the membrane-impermeant reagent polyethyleneglycol maleimide was determined. The results further define the borders of transmembrane segments in subunit a. To identify additional buried polar and charged residues important in proton transport, 25 sites were individually mutated to hydrophobic amino acids, and the effect on proton transport was determined. These and previous results identify a set of residues important for proton transport located on the cytoplasmic half of TM7 and TM8 and the lumenal half of TM3, TM4, and TM7. Based upon these data, we propose a tentative model in which the cytoplasmic hemichannel is located at the interface of TM7 and TM8 of subunit a and the proteolipid ring, whereas the lumenal hemichannel is located within subunit a at the interface of TM3, TM4, and TM7.

The integral V0 domain (in yeast) contains subunits a, c, c′, c″, d, and e and transports protons from the cytoplasm to the lumen. The proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) form a ring in which each subunit contains a single buried glutamic acid residue that undergoes reversible protonation during proton transport (10Hirata R.

ATP hydrolysis in the V1 domain drives rotation of a central rotary complex that includes the ring of proteolipid subunits, which rotates relative to subunit a (part of the stator complex) (11Imamura H.

We have identified a number of buried polar and charged residues in the C-terminal domain of subunit a whose mutation leads to partial or complete loss of proton transport (17Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The idea of proton-conducting hemichannels was first proposed as a mechanism of proton translocation through the integral F0 domain of the F1F0 ATP synthase (21Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the V-ATPases, a proton is thought to first enter the membrane through a cytoplasmically oriented hemichannel that allows the proton to reach the buried carboxyl group on one of the proteolipid subunits (2Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Following protonation of this carboxylate, ATP-driven rotation of the proteolipid ring brings the protonated carboxyl group into contact with the lumenally oriented hemichannel. Interaction between the carboxyl group on the proteolipid subunit and a buried arginine residue in subunit a displaces the proton into the lumenal hemichannel, thereby creating a deprotonated carboxylate available to bind another proton. In support of this model, we have shown that TM7 of subunit a containing the critical arginine residue comes into close proximity to TM4 of subunit c′ and TM3 of subunit c″ that each contain a buried glutamic acid residue essential for proton transport (24Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41908-41913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Although previous mutagenesis studies have identified several buried polar and charged residues in subunit a that have been postulated to contribute to the proton-conducting hemichannels in V0 (17Kawasaki-Nishi S.

To elucidate the structure of the proton-conducting hemichannels in V0, we have first carried out a more comprehensive mutagenesis scan of buried polar and charged residues in subunit a. The results have identified four additional residues whose mutation causes a dramatic (>70%) loss of both proton transport and ATPase activity and an additional three residues where mutation causes substantial (50–70%) loss of activity. In order to place these and previously identified residues at the appropriate depth within the membrane, we have also further defined the cytoplasmic and lumenal borders of transmembrane helices in the C-terminal domain of subunit a using accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to membrane-permeant and -impermeant reagents (16Wang Y. Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20696-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results are combined to construct a first working model of the proton-conducting hemichannels in the integral domain of the V-ATPases. Zymolase 20T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. and MP Biochemicals, LLC. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Applied Science.

Polyethyleneglycol maleimide (PEG-Mal, 5 kDa) was purchased from SunBio Inc. 9-Amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine was purchased from Molecular Probes. Yeast strain MM112 (MATa Δvph1::LEU2 Δstv1::LYS2 his3-Δ200 leu2 lys2 ura3-52) lacking the endogenous Vph1p and Stv1p subunit a isoforms was used to study all Vph1p mutants (26Manolson M.F. Wu B.

Yeast cells were grown in Ura− S.D. minimal medium or YEPD medium buffered to pH 5.5 with 50 mm succinate/phosphate. Site-directed mutants of Vph1p in the pRS316 plasmid were constructed using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by sequencing the entire length of subcloned DNA. Single cysteine mutations were introduced into the Cys-less form of Vph1p, in which the six endogenous cysteines were replaced by serine (13Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol.

The constructed plasmids were transformed into yeast strain MM112 using the lithium acetate method (27Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

The growth phenotype was studied by growing mutant strains on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm phosphate/succinate to either pH 7.5 or 5.5 (16Wang Y. Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient acrylamide gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar). The presence of Vph1p (subunit a, 100 kDa) or Vma2p (subunit B, 60 kDa) was detected by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibodies 10D7 and 13D11, respectively, from Molecular Probes, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Blots were developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting analysis system from GE Healthcare. 3 μg of vacuolar membrane vesicles were diluted into 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 137 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 15.3 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4, and then incubated with 1 mm PEG-Mal for 1 h at 23 °C. Samples were quenched with a buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with the monoclonal antibody against Vph1p (10D7). Reaction of an accessible single cysteine residue on Vph1p with PEG-Mal shifts the apparent mobility of the protein by 10–25 kDa (16Wang Y. Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol.

The accessibility of cysteine residues to NEM was detected indirectly by PEG-Mal modification in the presence of SDS following NEM treatment. 12.5 μg of vacuolar membrane vesicles were diluted into 200 μl of PBS buffer, incubated with 1 mm NEM for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. Pellets were washed by sedimentation with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The samples were suspended in 50 μl of PBS and then incubated with 2% SDS and 1 mm PEG-Mal for 1 h at 23 °C. Samples were quenched with sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed as described above. ATP hydrolysis was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay as described previously (30Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Vacuolar membranes were incubated with DMSO or 1 μm concanamycin A (in DMSO) for 5 min prior to measurement of ATPase activity. ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by the initial rate of ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching using the fluorescence dye 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine, as described previously (30Vasilyeva E.

In order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the buried polar and charged residues in subunit a that are important for proton transport by the V-ATPase, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a total of 25 sites within the C-terminal domain of Vph1p that encodes one of the two isoforms of subunit a in yeast. These mutant constructs were then expressed in a strain disrupted in both Vph1p and Stv1p (the second a subunit isoform in yeast). Residues were mutated to either alanine or phenylalanine or both to determine the importance of the presence of a charged or polar side chain at that position. Each mutant strain was first tested for its growth phenotype. Yeast strains expressing V-ATPase complexes possessing activity that is substantially lower than wild type (<20%) are unable to grow at pH 7.5 but are able to grow at pH 5.5 (referred to as a vma− phenotype) (32Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, most mutant strains showed normal growth at pH 7.5, suggesting that the V-ATPase complexes in these strains possessed substantial activity relative to complexes containing wild type Vph1p. Preliminary measurements of concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport on vacuolar membranes isolated from each mutant strain confirmed that for most of the mutants, the V-ATPase possessed at least 50% of the wild type level of activity (data not shown). Mutations at a number of predicted transmembrane sites, however, led to either a severe or mild vma− growth phenotype, including Asn-480, Asp-481, and Ser-484 in TM3 and Ser-792, His-796, and His-801 in TM8.TABLE 1Growth phenotypes of subunit a mutants containing mutations in buried polar and charged residuesStrainGrowth at pH 7.5StrainGrowth at pH 7.5Wild type++Q580A++Vector−S587F++N480F−H655F++N480A++K657F++D481F−N725A++D481A−S732F++S484F+Y733F++S484A++S740F++K485F++S740A++S534F++T770F++S534A++T791F++Y535F++S792F+K536F++S792A+K536A++H796F−T549F++H796A−Y550F++S797F++S551F++H801F+Y552A++H801A++ Open table in a new tab In order to obtain a more precise picture of how the introduced mutations affected V-ATPase activity, V-ATPase assembly was assessed for each strain showing either a vma− phenotype or a greater than 50% loss of activity. Vacuolar membranes were isolated, and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against both Vph1p and subunit B. Because subunit B is part of the V1 domain, its presence on vacuolar membranes is a measure of the degree of assembly of the mutants relative to wild type complexes. As can be seen in Fig. 1, two mutations (N480F and S484F) cause loss of stability of Vph1p or its ability to assemble into stable complexes. These mutants were not further pursued. For mutations that affect assembly, it is not possible to determine the role of the corresponding residue in activity. It should be noted, however, that alanine substitutions of Asn-480 and Ser-484 are without effect on assembly (Fig. 1) or activity (data not shown). This suggests that polar residues at these positions are not required for transport. A more complete analysis of the concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and proton transport was then performed on the remaining mutants. As shown in Fig. 2, six mutations dramatically reduced proton transport and ATP hydrolysis (activity is <30% of wild type) while having little or no effect on V-ATPase assembly, including D481F, D481A, S792F, H796F, H796A, and H801F. In addition, three mutations caused a substantial loss of activity (retaining 30–50% of wild type), including S534F, K536F, and S740F. These results suggest that these seven residues are important for proton transport by the V-ATPase. Our results, together with those obtained from previous studies, are summarized in the model of subunit a shown in Fig. 3.FIGURE 2Effect of phenylalanine and alanine mutations in Vph1p on concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport. Vacuolar membranes were isolated from the yeast strain MM112 (disrupted in the endogenous VPH1 and STV1 genes) expressing either a wild-type form of Vph1p (WT) or the indicated single mutant forms of Vph1p. ATPase activity (black bars) was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay, and ATP-dependent proton transport (open bars) was measured as the initial rate of quenching of the fluorescence of the pH-sensitive dye ACMA in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity for wild-type vacuolar membranes was 0.57 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein. All values are normalized to the wild type. Values of mutants represent the average of at least two measurements on each of two independent vacuolar preparations, with the error bars corresponding to the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Model of transmembrane topology of the C-terminal domain of subunit a and the effect of mutations on V-ATPase activity and assembly.

Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20696-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the borders of most of the transmembrane helices remain poorly defined. In order to better localize the transmembrane helix borders in subunit a, we have employed accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to membrane-permeant and -impermeant sulfhydryl reagents. As a membrane-permeant reagent, we have used NEM, whereas as a membrane-impermeant reagent, we have used PEG-Mal (16Wang Y. Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20696-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protocol used in these experiments is described in detail below. Thirty unique cysteine residues were introduced into a Cys-less form of Vph1p and expressed in the strain MM112. We have previously shown that the Cys-less form of Vph1p gives rise to V-ATPase complexes possessing nearly wild type levels of both ATPase activity and proton transport (16Wang Y. Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20696-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We first tested the growth phenotype of the mutants at pH 5.5 and 7.5. As shown in Table 2, most of the 30 mutants showed normal growth at pH 7.5, indicating the ability of the mutant Vph1p to form V-ATPase complexes having substantial (>20%) activity. Three of the cysteine mutants (K536C, E721C, and A742C) showed a mild vma− growth phenotype, suggesting that these complexes possessed activity close to the limit of that required for wild type growth at neutral pH. We next assessed the effect of the mutations on assembly of the V-ATPase complex as described above. As shown in Fig. 4, all of the mutants show significant levels of both subunits on isolated vacuoles compared with wild type, suggesting substantial assembly of V-ATPase complexes. Note that the growth phenotype and assembly competence of mutants analyzed as described below (see Fig. 6) but not shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4 (including G602C, G620C, L638C, L648C, S670C, D710C, C723, L734C, and A744C) were previously reported (16Wang Y.

https://openalex.org/W1966811134,"Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates a wide variety of biological activities in holometabolous insects, ranging from vitellogenesis and caste determination in adults to the timing of metamorphosis in larvae. The mechanism of JH signaling in such a diverse array of processes remains either unknown or contentious. We previously found that the nuclear receptor gene E75A is activated in S2 cells as a primary response to JH. Here, by expressing an intracellular form of JH esterase, we demonstrate that JH must enter the cell in order to activate E75A. To find intracellular receptors involved in the JH response, we performed an RNAi screen against nuclear receptor genes expressed in this cell line and identified the orphan receptor FTZ-F1. Removal of FTZ-F1 prevents JH activation of E75A, whereas overexpression enhances activation, implicating FTZ-F1 as a critical component of the JH response. FTZ-F1 is bound in vivo to multiple enhancers upstream of E75A, suggesting that it participates in direct JH-mediated gene activation. To better define the role of FTZ-F1 in JH signaling, we investigated interactions with candidate JH receptors and found that the bHLH-PAS proteins MET and GCE both interact with FTZ-F1 and can activate transcription through the FTZ-F1 response element. Removal of endogenous GCE, but not MET, prevents JH activation of E75A. We propose that FTZ-F1 functions as a competence factor by loading JH signaling components to the promoter, thus facilitating the direct regulation of E75A gene expression by JH.

The life cycle of holometabolous insects is governed by two hormone signals that trigger developmental changes: the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) 3The abbreviations used are: ecdysone20-hydroxyecdysonebHLHbasic-helix-loop-helixPASPer-AhR/Arnt-SimJHjuvenile hormoneJHEJH esteraseJHREjuvenile hormone response elementF1REFTZ-F1 response elementS2Drosophila Schneider 2 cell lineTSStranscription start siteAF-2activation function 2H12helix 12. and the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH). Ecdysone is produced in the prothoracic gland and released in pulses that initiate developmental transitions, and JH is secreted from the corpora allata and is thought to determine the outcome of each transition. High JH titer results in a simple cuticle shedding during larval molts, whereas the absence of JH initiates a complete restructuring of the body plan during metamorphosis. 20-hydroxyecdysone basic-helix-loop-helix Per-AhR/Arnt-Sim juvenile hormone JH esterase juvenile hormone response element FTZ-F1 response element Drosophila Schneider 2 cell line transcription start site activation function 2 helix 12. The titer of JH is tightly regulated during development through both biosynthesis and degradation. One of the major pathways of JH degradation occurs through juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), which converts JH to JH acid by methyl ester hydrolysis (1Kamita S.G. Hammock B.D. J. Pestic. Sci. 2010; 35: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role as a major regulator of JH titer, JHE exhibits an exceptionally high binding affinity for JH, allowing the protein to dramatically reduce the concentration of JH circulating through insect hemolymph (2Campbell P.M. Oakeshott J.G. Healy M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Hinton A.C. Hammock B.D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Manipulation of JHE activity has been used to alter development in several insect species. Chemical inhibition of JHE in dipteran, lepidopteran, and coleopteran species delays pupariation (4Sparks T.C. Hammock B.D. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 14: 290-302Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of JHE in lepidopteran species mediates anti-JH activity, manifested as developmental defects in larval molting (5Hammock B.D. Bonning B.C. Possee R.D. Hanzlik T.N. Maeda S. Nature. 1990; 344: 458-461Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These experiments have shown that JHE plays a crucial role in regulating insect development and is a powerful tool for altering the concentration of JH in vivo. JH participates not only in developmental regulation but in various aspects of insect adult life as well. In Drosophila females, JH initiates yolk protein synthesis both in the fat body and ovary and regulates its uptake into a growing oocyte (6Bownes M. J. Insect Physiol. 1989; 35: 409-413Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Giorgi F. Lucchesi P. Morelli A. Bownes M. Development. 1993; 117: 319-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Soller M. Bownes M. Kubli E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In males, JH stimulates the synthesis of accessory gland proteins (9Yamamoto K. Chadarevian A. Pellegrini M. Science. 1988; 239: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Wolfner M.F. Partridge L. Lewin S. Kalb J.M. Chapman T. Herndon L.A. J. Insect Physiol. 1997; 43: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and controls courtship behavior and sexually dimorphic locomotor activity (11Belgacem Y.H. Martin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15154-15158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to reproduction, in many species JH has been implicated in a wide range of other biological processes, such as pheromone production, caste determination, diapause, migration, etc. (12Wyatt G.R. Davey K.G. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1996; 26: 1-155Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic nature of JH is one of the reasons why the mode of its action is still debatable (13Jones G. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Davey K.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Wheeler D.E. Nijhout H.F. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There is a strong case that some JH-induced signaling events exemplify a rapid “non-genomic” biological response. In Drosophila, treatment of larval salivary glands with JH causes ultrastructural changes of mitochondria known as swelling, which are transcription- and translation-independent (16Farkas R. Sut'áková G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). When JH is applied in vitro to the ovary of Locusta migratoria, Tenebrio molitor, or Rhodnius prolixus, it creates spaces in the follicular epithelium by reducing the volume of the follicle cells, thus allowing vitellogenin access to the growing oocyte (12Wyatt G.R. Davey K.G. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1996; 26: 1-155Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Davey K.G. Invert. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 30: 249-254Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The development of these spaces, termed patency, is mediated by JH binding to the plasma membrane and activation of a downstream regulatory cascade that involves protein kinase C (PKC) and Na+/K+ ATPase. On the other hand, it is widely accepted that JH could act by regulating gene expression. A number of nuclear proteins (USP, MET, GCE, FKBP39, Chd64, Kr-h1, and FISC) have been identified as critical for JH transcriptional regulation (18Fang F. Xu Y. Jones D. Jones G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Zhang Z. Robinson G.E. Palli S.R. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), although there is no complete understanding of the mechanism (23Riddiford L.M. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Palli S.R. Ishaaaya I. Horowitz A.R. Biorational Control of Arthropod Pests. Springer, New York2009: 111-129Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that some actions of JH are mediated by plasma membrane receptors that activate the PKC signaling pathway, as is the case in Drosophila males, where JH stimulates protein synthesis in the accessory glands (9Yamamoto K. Chadarevian A. Pellegrini M. Science. 1988; 239: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Another role for PKC in regulating gene expression was proposed in studies of JH signaling in L. migratoria and Choristoneura fumiferana (25Zhou S. Zhang J. Hirai M. Chinzei Y. Kayser H. Wyatt G.R. Walker V.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Kethidi D.R. Li Y. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 247: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this case, PKC-mediated phosphorylation reduced the binding of corresponding transcription factors to putative JH response elements, resulting in suppression of JH action. Another set of studies provides strong evidence that JH modulates gene expression by acting through intracellular receptors, essentially following the paradigm established by steroid hormones, such as ecdysone. Steroid hormones pass through the plasma membrane and bind to nuclear receptors, a superfamily of proteins responsible for regulating major developmental, reproductive, and metabolic processes in all eukaryotic organisms. Nuclear receptors bind to DNA and directly alter gene expression by recruiting co-activators through distinct ligand-dependent and ligand-independent transactivation domains (27King-Jones K. Thummel C.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome encodes 18 nuclear receptors, although ligands have only been identified for four of them: ecdysone receptor (EcR), E75, DHR96, and ultraspiracle (USP). Most notable is ecdysone, whose receptor EcR directly regulates gene expression as a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, USP (28Riddiford L.M. Cherbas P. Truman J.W. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 60: 1-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although none of the nuclear receptors has been implicated in JH signaling so far, recent evidence suggests that some functions of JH utilize methoprene-tolerant (MET), a member the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors (29Ashok M. Turner C. Wilson T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, MET is required for JH antimetamorphic activity because RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Met expression prompts the early stage beetle larvae to undergo premature pupariation and renders the beetle pupae resistant to ectopic JH (30Konopova B. Jindra M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10488-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Parthasarathy R. Tan A. Palli S.R. Mech. Dev. 2008; 125: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Apparently, MET mediates the antimetamorphic action at the level of gene expression, activating an early JH target, Kr-h1, whose function is to inhibit premature metamorphosis (32Minakuchi C. Namiki T. Shinoda T. Dev. Biol. 2009; 325: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Many aspects of JH-stimulated reproductive maturation of female mosquitoes are believed to be mediated by MET. In newly emerged adult females, expression of some JH-responsive genes depends on MET, which forms a functional complex with its partner FISC, binds JHRE, and activates transcription in the presence of JH (22Li M. Mead E.A. Zhu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homolog of MET produced in vitro can bind JHIII (a natural form of JH found in most insect species) with nanomolar affinity, and when fused to Gal4 DBD, it displays JH-dependent transcriptional activation of a reporter gene (33Miura K. Oda M. Makita S. Chinzei Y. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In vivo, JH and MET orchestrate the timing of certain differentiation events because either JH deprivation or MET knock-out causes heterochronic phenotypes in the developing visual system during Drosophila metamorphosis (34Riddiford L.M. Truman J.W. Mirth C.K. Shen Y.C. Development. 2010; 137: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the fact that Met-knock-out flies are viable indicates that there is more than one receptor for JH. Recently, a paralog protein encoded by the Drosophila gene germ-cell expressed (gce) was identified and proposed to perform as an intracellular receptor for JH that can functionally substitute for MET (35Wang S. Baumann A. Wilson T.G. J. Insect Physiol. 2007; 53: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, ectopic GCE can rescue some of MET preadult functions (e.g. restore sensitivity of Met knock-out animals to methoprene, a synthetic analog of JH) (21Baumann A. Barry J. Wang S. Fujiwara Y. Wilson T.G. Genetics. 2010; 185: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the redundancy of GCE and MET is not complete but rather stage- and tissue-specific. These observations demonstrate that much information is missing with regard to the nature and number of signaling pathways utilized by JH to regulate diverse biological functions. In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying JH signaling, we previously conducted a search for JH-regulated genes in Drosophila (36Dubrovsky E.B. Dubrovskaya V.A. Bilderback A.L. Berger E.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that in S2 cells, JH can activate the E75A nuclear receptor gene (37Dubrovsky E.B. Dubrovskaya V.A. Berger E.M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which plays a critical role during larval development and at the onset of metamorphosis (38Bialecki M. Shilton A. Fichtenberg C. Segraves W.A. Thummel C.S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The activation occurs within 30 min of hormone administration; it is specific and does not require protein synthesis. In this report, we have investigated the molecular pathway of JH signaling for E75A and found that JH must enter the cell to activate this gene. We also provide evidence that the orphan nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 is an essential component of JH signaling that interacts with the candidate JH receptors MET and GCE. FTZ-F1 directly binds to the regulatory regions of E75A and could function as a competence factor to facilitate the direct regulation of gene expression by JH. The pAc5.1/V5-His and pMt/V5-His vectors (Invitrogen) were both used for the expression of proteins described in the transfection assays. Coding regions for Manduca sexta JH esterase and Drosophila melanogaster FTZ-F1, MET, and GCE were amplified by PCR using corresponding cDNA clones as templates and inserted into the expression vector. The JHE cDNA was a gift from Dr. B. Hammock (University of California, Davis), and the FTZ-F1 cDNA was acquired from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (expressed sequence tag clone RE02257). Mutant forms of MsJHE were created with the mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's manual. All inserts were verified by DNA sequencing, and correct expression was confirmed in a Western blot with anti-V5 antibody (1:10,000 dilution). Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 25 °C. JH III (a natural form of JH; Sigma) and methoprene (a synthetic analog of JH) were dissolved in ethanol, and 1 × 10−1 m stock solutions were kept at −20 °C. If not otherwise stated, hormones were added to a 1 × 10−6 m final concentration. Control cells were treated with an equal volume of ethanol. Transient transfection of S2 cells with expression plasmids was performed by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (39Bernardo T.J. Dubrovskaya V.A. Jannat H. Maughan B. Dubrovsky E.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 794-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In each transfection, pAc-GFP or pAc-lacZ expression construct was included as a control of transfection efficiency. FTZ-F1, MET, and GCE expression constructs were transfected in S2 cells along with the F1REx3-Tk-Luc reporter construct (a gift from Dr. H. Ueda at Okayama University) and pAc-lacZ (Invitrogen). Protein extracts from S2 cells were quantified using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and standardized by diluting with 1× reporter lysis buffer to yield equivalent amounts of total protein. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and Glomax 20/20 luminometer according to the manufacturer's manual. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified using the β-galactosidase assay system (Promega) by measuring absorbance at A420 every 60 s for 10 min. Total RNA was isolated from S2 cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). All RNAs were quantified by optical measurements, and 10 μg of each sample was fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (MSI). Blots were prehybridized at 68 °C for 60 min in a buffer composed of 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSC, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml shared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). Blots were hybridized with specific 32P-labeled probes (2–10 × 105 cpm/ml) at 68 °C for 16–24 h in the same buffer supplemented with 10% dextran sulfate. Probes were labeled by PCR using primers listed in Table 1. After hybridization, blots were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed at −80 °C with Kodak BioMax MS film.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for PCR-mediated labeling of Northern probesGene nameFlyBase IDForward primerReverse primerProbe sizeExpression in S2 cellsbpdERRFBgn0035849AGATGAAGCTTCTCCAGGTGACTTCATCGCGTGCAATTCC440YesdHNF-4FBgn0004914GAATTCGCTTGCATCAAGGCGAGTCCAGAGAGGAGTTAAC395YesDHR3FBgn0000448TAGATTCGCAGCAGGACCTGGTTTCGGTTCTCTACGAAGC410NoDHR4FBgn0023546CGGAGATTAGCGAGAAACTGTCAAGCAGGTTTGCAGTGTG360NoDHR38FBgn0014859ATCCCTCGTGCCTGGACTACTCAGGGTTAGGGCACAGAGG380NoDHR39FBgn0261239TAGAGCATCTGTGGCAGTACAGCCATTTGATTTGGCCTGC420YesDHR51FBgn0034012AATGGTCGATTGCTGAGCTGCTCACCGATAAATGAGTTTCC250NoDHR78FBgn0015239TGGAGCACATGGAACTAGACGGTGAGATTTGCCATCTTCG425YesDHR83FBgn0037436GAACTGTGTGGTGGACAAGGAGTTGAGTTCCAGGACGTCG450NoDHR96FBgn0015240ATCTGCGTGCAATTCGTGAGTGACCACAGTGATGTC395YesdsfFBgn0015381CCAGTGGCTTTCACCTGACGGCTCGAGATGGACTGGATGG410NoE75FBgn0000568AACACTGCAGTGGGACCATCAGACTTCTGTGATCTGCAGC380YesE78FBgn0004865TTGTCAACGCCTTGCTGAACGCTACGTTGCTTAAGCCTAC460NoEcRFBgn0000546TAACCGCACCTGGTTCCTTGATGCAGTCGTCGAGTGCTCC300YesFTZ-F1FBgn0001078GGACCTGAAATTCGATATGGTACGGAATTCTGCTGTATCC430YessvpFBgn0003651TGTTCAACGTGGACGCGTACAGATGCGGATGTGGTCCATG460NotllFBgn0003720GTACAAGGATGCCATGATGGACGCTCTTGATCCAGTTGAC380NouspFBgn0003964CAATAGCGTGTCCAGGGATTTACGAGAAGCTCTGGTTGAG420YesMetFBgn0002723AATGGAGACGGAGGAACACATAGGGTTCTGGCTGTCTG520YesgceFBgn0261703ATGGCCACATACTGCTGATCCGAAAACTGCGTCTATCCTC260Yes Open table in a new tab To produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for RNAi, individual DNA fragments containing protein coding sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned in both orientations into the pGM-T Easy cloning vector (Promega). The following primer sets were used: dERR (5′-CTT GCA CAT CAA ACA GGA GG-3′ and 5′-CAA TGA CGC TGA CCA ATT CC-3′); dHNF-4 (5′-ATC GGA GAG CCA CAT AAT GC-3′ and 5′-CCA GTT CAT CGA TGA TAC GG-3′); DHR39 (5′-AGA TGC CAA ACA TGT CCA GC-3′ and 5′-AGT CCA TAC TCA GGT TCT GC-3′); DHR78 (5′-GCG TTA AGG TTG AGA CGT TC-3′ and 5′-TAC CAT TTC GCT CCA GTT GG-3′); DHR96 (5′-GGA GGA CAA GCT GAT CAA GC-3′ and 5′-GGT ACT CAA TGC GGA TCA CC-3′); EcR (5′-ATG AGA ACG AGA GCC AAA CGG-3′ and 5′-AGC TGT GGC TGT GGT TGA ATC-3′); FTZ-F1 (5′-GGA AGT TGC AAG TGA TGC GG-3′ and 5′-TGC AGC TTG TTC TGC AGC TC-3′); USP (5′-TAA AGT GCG CTG CTC CAT CG-3′ and 5′-GAA GTC ATC AGA ACC GTT GC-3′); MET (5′-TGA GCG AAG GAG AGT GAG CG-3′ and 5′-TCC TCC TCC AGA TCA CTG CC-3′); GCE (5′-AGT TCA TAT GGC GAG TCC AC-3′ and 5′-ATT CCG ATC CGA ATC CGA TG-3′). Generated clones were used as templates to synthesize sense and antisense single-stranded RNA using the T7 MEGAscript Kit (Ambion). Equal amounts of complementary strands of RNA were resuspended in H2O and annealed by a heating/cooling cycle to yield a dsRNA. RNAi knockdown of gene expression in S2 cells was performed according to the protocol developed by Clemens et al. (40Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–3 × 106 Drosophila tissue culture cells were plated into a 25-cm2 flask (Corning Glass) and cultured at 25 °C until becoming about 70% confluent. Then FBS-containing medium was replaced with 2 ml of serum-free medium, and 40 μg of dsRNA was added and mixed by gentle swirling. After a 30-min incubation, 4 ml of medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was added. Three days later, cells were subjected to hormonal treatment, and RNA samples were extracted and tested by Northern blot hybridization. GST pull-down assays were performed as described by Godlewski et al. (41Godlewski J. Wang S. Wilson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST-MET or GST-GCE fusion proteins (a kind gift of Dr. T. Wilson (Ohio State University)) were co-transfected with the V5-tagged FTZ-F1 construct in S2 cells. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated for 15 min with methoprene or an equivalent volume of solvent ethanol and then subjected to lysis in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice, cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads from 3 h to overnight at 4 °C. Then beads were washed five times with the lysis buffer, all at 4 °C, and bound proteins were recovered by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western hybridization, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBST buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBST, 5% milk with anti-V5 (1:10,000) or anti-GST (1:2500) antibody. Proteins were revealed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked DNA from S2 cells was performed as described (39Bernardo T.J. Dubrovskaya V.A. Jannat H. Maughan B. Dubrovsky E.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 794-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 95–100% confluent cells were treated with either ethanol or 1 × 10−6 m methoprene for 1 h. Cells were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by quenching with 0.125 m glycine. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, and plasma membranes were lysed with swelling buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus added before use 1 mm DTT, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). Nuclei were resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS plus protease inhibitors) and sonicated to yield average DNA fragments of 200–1000 bp. After centrifugation to remove cell debris (25 min at 5000 rpm), chromatin concentration was quantified by A260 and equalized among samples with sonication buffer. Chromatin was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose beads (Millipore) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either nonspecific IgG (goat anti-rabbit, Jackson Immunoresearch) or anti-FTZ-F1 antibodies, which were kindly provided as a gift by Dr. C. Wu (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Immunoprecipitated protein-DNA complexes were retrieved with Protein A-agarose, washed, and then recovered from the beads with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Cross-linking was reversed overnight at 65 °C, followed by RNase and proteinase K treatment. DNA was purified with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA pellets were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and used for real-time PCR analysis. Conservation analysis upstream of the E75A transcription start site was performed with the EvoPrinterHD server (42Yavatkar A.S. Lin Y. Ross J. Fann Y. Brody T. Odenwald W.F. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). EvoPrinterHD takes as input a genomic query sequence from D. melanogaster, and reference sequences are assembled from the available genomes of 11 other Drosophila species. Each reference sequence is broken into fragments three different ways (two staggered sets of 11-mers and a set of 9-mers) and aligned to the query sequence. All reference/query alignments are then overlapped into a composite alignment showing conservation among the 12 species. The composite alignment shows the query sequence with absolutely conserved nucleotides highlighted and nucleotides conserved in 11 of 12 species colored according to the species lacking the sequence. For E75A analysis, the first 32 kb of upstream non-coding region containing five experimentally identified enhancers was submitted to EvoPrinterHD. By extracting discrete sequences (≥9 nucleotides long) conserved in at least 11 Drosophila species, we generated a data base of highly conserved elements (supplemental Table S1). Putative FTZ-F1 recognition elements (F1REs) were identified and mapped using the Pattern Locator server, which allows for direct screening of any chosen nucleotide pattern (43Mrázek J. Xie S. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3099-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a query sequence, we used a consensus compiled from a set of experimentally determined F1REs (44Bowler T. Kosman D. Licht J.D. Pick L. Dev. Biol. 2006; 299: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Only the first nine nucleotides of this consensus, (C/G/T)(C/G)AAGG(A/C/T)(C/T)(A/G), were used in the search because the remaining three nucleotides at the 3′-end have a negligible impact on FTZ-F1 binding (45Ueda H. Hirose S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3689-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The query pattern was searched against the database of highly conserved nucleotides that we generated for sequences upstream of the E75A transcription start site (see above). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with FastStart Universal SYBR Green PCR Mix (Qiagen) using 300 μm primers. Thermocycling (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min) was performed for 40 cycles using the Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system. For quantitative PCR following chromatin immunoprecipitation, enrichment was measured as a percentage of input DNA taken prior to immunoprecipitation using the comparative Ct method (46Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17273) Google Scholar). For quantitative RT-PCR following FTZ-F1 transient transfection assays, RNA was reverse transcribed with Transcriptor (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's manual, and cDNA levels were quantified by quantitative PCR using the comparative Ct method. Amplicon specificity was confirmed using dissociation curves and separation of post-PCR samples on 2% agarose gel. Primer sequences are available upon request. JH esterase is naturally designed to efficiently metabolize and inactivate juvenile hormone. To determine whether JHE can block hormonal activation of E75A, we ectopically expressed JHE in S2 cells by transfecting an expression plasmid bearing the V5-tagged JHE open reading frame under a constitutive actin promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2017349971,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is intrinsically cross-resistant to virtually all β-lactam antibiotics. The central determinant for the MRSA phenotype is the mecA gene, whose transcriptional control may be mediated by a repressor (mecI) and a sensor/inducer (mecR1). The mecI-mecR1-mediated induction of mecA takes several hours rendering the strains phenotypically susceptible in spite of the presence of the resistance gene. Therefore, it has been proposed that the full resistance to β-lactams observed in many contemporary clinical MRSA strains requires a non-functional mecI-mecR1 regulatory system. The mecA gene is embedded in a large chromosomal cassette (the SCCmec element) for which several structural types have been described. Some epidemic MRSA clones, typically expressing full β-lactam resistance, carry SCCmec elements that contain an intact mecI-mecR1 locus (e.g. SCCmec types II and III). We have addressed this apparent contradiction by first sequencing the mecI coding region and mecA promoter sequences in a collection of prototype MRSA strains characterized by different SCCmec types. A conserved non-sense mutation within mecI was detected in all SCCmec type III strains tested, presumably responsible for a non-functional truncated MecI protein and, therefore, explaining the full resistance phenotype. In SCCmec type II strains no conserved mutations were found. We next transformed a collection of prototype MRSA epidemic strains with a recombinant plasmid overexpressing a wild-type copy of mecI. Surprisingly, for the great majority of the strains no significant alterations in the phenotypic expression of β-lactam resistance could be detected. These findings were confirmed and further explored, challenging the currently accepted mechanism of mecA transcriptional control. Our observations suggest the existence of yet unidentified additional determinants involved in the transcriptional control of mecA gene and point to a revision of the mecA regulatory mechanism in contemporary MRSA strains."
https://openalex.org/W2023915513,"The adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), connects pathogen/danger sensors such as NLRP3 and NLRC4 with caspases and is involved in inflammation and cell death. We have found that ASC activation induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis or CA-074Me (cathepsin B inhibitor)-inhibitable necrosis depending on the cell type. Unlike necroptosis, another necrotic cell death, ASC-mediated necrosis, was neither RIP3-dependent nor necrostatin-1-inhibitable. Although acetyl–YVAD–chloromethylketone (Ac-YVAD-CMK) (caspase-1 inhibitor) did not inhibit ASC-mediated necrosis, comprehensive gene expression analyses indicated that caspase-1 expression coincided with the necrosis type. Furthermore, caspase-1 knockdown converted necrosis-type cells to apoptosis-type cells, whereas exogenous expression of either wild-type or catalytically inactive caspase-1 did the opposite. Knockdown of caspase-1, but not Ac-YVAD-CMK, suppressed the monocyte necrosis induced by Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas infection. Thus, the catalytic activity of caspase-1 is dispensable for necrosis induction. Intriguingly, a short period of caspase-1 knockdown inhibited IL-1β production but not necrosis, although longer knockdown suppressed both responses.

Immunol. 2009; 10: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). These pattern recognition receptors directly or indirectly recognize microbial molecular patterns (e.g. microbial RNA and flagellin) and/or danger signals from injured cells (e.g. ATP and uric acid), and then, together with ASC, they serve as platforms for the proteolytic maturation of caspase-1, which in turn catalyzes the proteolytic maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Accordingly, ASC-deficient macrophages are severely defective in secreting these cytokines in response to microbial infection (3Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P.

ASC also plays an important role in the monocyte and macrophage cell death induced by microbial infection. For instance, infection by an intracellular bacterium such as Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Listeria monocytogenes induces caspase-1-mediated cell death called “pyroptosis” (7Brennan M.A. Cookson B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 8Franchi L. Stoolman J. Kanneganti T.D. Verma A. Ramphal R. Núñez G. Eur. J.

It has been described that pyroptosis has characteristics of both necrosis (e.g. cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture) and apoptosis (nuclear shrinkage) (10Bergsbaken T. Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). As expected from the fact that ASC plays an important role in caspase-1 activation, recent studies have demonstrated that ASC also plays an important role in pyroptosis (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 12Sauer J.D. Witte C.E. Zemansky J. Hanson B. Lauer P. Portnoy D.A. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 412-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that the expression of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome-associated NLRP3 mutants or the activation of endogenous NLRP3 by Shigella flexneri infection induces necrotic cell death in the THP-1 human monocytic cell line and/or mouse macrophages (13Fujisawa A. Kambe N. Saito M. Nishikomori R. Tanizaki H. Kanazawa N. Adachi S. Heike T. Sagara J. Suda T. Nakahata T. Miyachi Y.

Deshmukh M. Hoffman H.M. Ting J.P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This necrotic cell death is also mediated by ASC; however, it is inhibited by a cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, but not by a caspase-1 inhibitor. Thus, this type of necrotic cell death has been considered to be distinct from pyroptosis, and it was named “pyronecrosis” (14Willingham S.B. Bergstralh D.T. O'Connor W. Morrison A.C. Taxman D.J.

Another line of studies demonstrated that ASC has the potential to induce apoptosis. ASC was originally identified as a protein that forms large aggregates in apoptotic human leukemia cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents (15Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and as the product of a gene that is silenced in human cancer tissues by DNA methylation (16Conway K.E. McConnell B.B. Bowring C.E. Donald C.D. Warren S.T. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6236-6242PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated that ASC expression is induced by the p53 tumor suppressor and is involved in etoposide-induced apoptosis (17Ohtsuka T. Ryu H. Minamishima Y.A. Macip S. Sagara J. Nakayama K.I. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, ASC-mediated apoptosis seems to be important for tumor suppression and for cancer cell chemosensitivity. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that transplanted human tumors in nude mice were completely eradicated by ASC activation in the tumor cells (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, ASC is a promising molecular target for cancer therapy. We previously showed that oligomerization of ASC using an NLRC4 mimicry system induced caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in five human cancer cell lines, including the NUGC-4 gastric cancer cell line (19Hasegawa M. Kawase K. Inohara N. Imamura R. Yeh W.C. Kinoshita T. Suda T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). More recently, we found that ASC activation using the NLRC4 mimicry system or a cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome-associated mutant of NLRP3 induced necrotic cell death in the COLO205 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mode of cell death induced by NLRC4 mimicry in six other ASC-expressing tumor cell lines and found that they were separated into apoptosis and necrosis type. We next sought to identify the molecular determinant of the mode of ASC-mediated cell death. We found that ASC activation induced necrosis in cells expressing caspase-1, but it induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in cells lacking caspase-1. Intriguingly, caspase-1, but not its catalytic activity, was essential for the ASC-mediated necrosis. The same was true for the ASC-dependent necrosis of the NOMO-1 human monocytic cell line induced by bacterial infection. An anti-human ASC mAb was prepared as described previously (20Imamura R.

Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To generate lentiviral vectors expressing GFP, FLAG-C12N2, caspase-1, and the caspase-1-C285S mutant, these cDNAs were inserted into pLenti6/V5-DEST (Invitrogen). To generate a plasmid expressing the GFP-caspase-1 fusion protein (pEGFP-Casp1), the caspase-1 cDNA was cloned into a pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). To generate lentiviral vectors expressing control and caspsae-1-targeting shRNA, oligonucleotide DNAs, including the corresponding sequences (5′-CTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCTAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTTAG-3′ and 5′-ACACGTCTTGCTCTCATTATCTCGAGATAATGAGAGCAAGACGTGT-3′, respectively) were cloned into the pLKO.1-TRC vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). The NUC12N2 and CLC12N2 cell lines were described previously (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NUGC-4, COLO205, KLM-1, and MIAPaca2 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University (Sendai, Miyagi, Japan). The C32TG, G-361, HMV-II, SK-MEL-28, and KU812 cell lines were obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Tsukuba, Japan). The NOMO-1 cell line was obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). The THP-1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). To generate NOMO1-shCont and NOMO1-shCasp1 stable cell lines, NOMO-1 cells were transduced with a pLKO.1 lentiviral vector expressing control shRNA or caspase-1-targeting shRNA. The transduced cells were selected under puromycin treatment. The NU-GFP-Casp1 cell line was generated as follows. NUC12N2 cells were transfected with pEGFP-Casp1 using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen), and GFP-expressing cells were sorted by flow cytometry. To generate the NU-Casp1WT and NU-Casp1C285S cell lines, NUC12N2 cells were transduced with pLenti6/V5-DEST expressing the wild type or C285S mutant of caspase-1. To generate the SKC12N2 cell line, SK-MEL-28 cells were transduced with pLenti6/V5-DEST expressing FLAG-C12N2. The transduced cells were selected by blasticidin. The mode of cell death (apoptosis or necrosis) was determined primarily by the morphology of the dying cells. The proportions of apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide (PI) and Cy5-annexin V as described previously (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PI(+)Cy5(−) cells and PI(−)Cy5(+) cells were considered necrotic and early apoptotic cells, respectively. PI(+)Cy5(+) cells were considered necrotic when increased PI staining preceded or occurred simultaneously with increased Cy5-annexin V staining, whereas increased Cy5-annexin V staining that preceded PI staining was considered to be an indication of the secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells. Otherwise, the proportions of apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined in situ after Hoechst 33342 and PI staining, as described previously (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A cell with a pyknotic nucleus without PI staining was considered apoptotic, whereas a PI(+) cell without profound nuclear condensation was considered necrotic. In some experiments, the proportion of necrosis was assessed by the release of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase into culture supernatants using the CytoTox 96 kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, cell death was assessed by WST1 assay, as described previously (24Fukui M. Imamura R. Umemura M. Kawabe T. Suda T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Microarray analyses were performed using the Agilent whole human genome microarray kit (G4100F, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was purified from CLC12N2 subclones (CLC12N2-Nec and CLC12N2-Apo) or from COLO205 and NUGC-4 cells using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNAs were prepared using the Agilent Quick Amp labeling kit, two-color (Agilent). Hybridization and analysis were performed as described previously (25Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Motani K. Nishiuchi T. Matsumoto N. Kinoshita T. Suda T. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 7655-7662Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The following primers were used for PCR: ACTB, 5′-TCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGA-3′ and 5′-AAAGCCATGCCAATCTCATC-3′; RIPK3, 5′-TTTGGCCTGTCCACATTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GGTTGGCAACTCAACTTCTCT-3′; NLRP3, 5′-TCTCATGGATTGGTGAACAGC-3′ and 5′-GGTCCCCCAGAGAATTGTCA-3′; ASC (PYCARD), 5′-CTGGAGCCATGGGGCGCGCG-3′ and 5′-CGGAGTGTTGCTGGGAAGGAG-3′; NLRC4, 5′-CAGCAAGTTGAATAAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-ATCCTGTCGATCAGTTCATG-3′. Real-time PCR was performed using the THUNDERBIRD SYBR quantitative PCR mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The following primer sequences obtained from PrimerBank were used for real-time PCR: CASP1, 5′-TCCAATAATGGACAAGTCAAGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTGTACCCCAGATTTTGTAGCA-3′; ACTB, 5′-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3′. Viral transduction was performed as described previously (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CLC12N2 or NOMO-1 cells were transfected with siRNA (20 nm) using the Neon transfection system. The ASC-targeting (HSS147064), NLRP3-targeting (HSS132811), and NLRC4-targeting (HSS126850) siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. The caspase-1-targeting siRNA (L-004401-00) was purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). The amount of human IL-1β in culture supernatants was determined using the OptEIA ELISA kit (BD Pharmingen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Staphylococcus aureus (strain Smith, kindly provided by Dr. Nakanishi, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan) and P. aeruginosa (JCM14847, RIKEN BioResource Center, Wako, Saitama, Japan) in the log phase were used for infection. NOMO-1 and THP-1 cells were infected with these bacteria in antibiotic-free medium in 96-well plates. The plates were briefly centrifuged to improve the interaction between cells and bacteria. One hour after the infection, gentamycin (50 μg/ml) was added to kill the extracellular bacteria. To investigate the functions of ASC, we previously established an experimental system in which a chimeric protein (C12N2) consisting of the caspase recruitment domain from NLRC4 and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain and leucine-rich repeats from NOD2 (also called NLRC2), a sensor for MDP, was expressed in cells (20Imamura R. Wang Y. Kinoshita T. Suzuki M. Noda T. Sagara J. Taniguchi S. Okamoto H. Suda T. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 5874-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this system, the simple addition of MDP to the culture medium induces ASC-dependent responses in the cells. Hereafter, this system is termed NLRC4 mimicry. Using this system, we previously showed that ASC activation induces apoptosis in the NUGC-4 human stomach cancer cell line but induces necrosis in the COLO205 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further investigated whether ASC activation induces apoptosis or necrosis in another 10 tumor cell lines, including leukemia cell lines, melanomas, and pancreatic cancers. Among them, six expressed substantial amounts of ASC (Fig. 1A). These 10 lines were transfected with C12N2 and treated with MDP. Among the six ASC-expressing lines, four (two monocytic leukemia cell lines, one melanoma, and one pancreatic cancer) exhibited necrosis, whereas two (melanomas) showed apoptosis (Fig. 1, B–E, and see supplemental Fig. S1). MDP treatment without C12N2 transfection induced neither necrosis nor apoptosis in these cell lines (data not shown). Consistent with our previous findings (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Hasegawa M. Kawase K. Inohara N. Imamura R. Yeh W.C. Kinoshita T. Suda T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the NLRC4 mimicry-induced cell death of both apoptosis-type cells and necrosis-type cells was inhibited by ASC knockdown using siRNA (data not shown). The remaining cell lines, which expressed little or no ASC, were resistant to this procedure, confirming that the cell death induced by this procedure is ASC-dependent. These results indicate that ASC activation induces apoptosis or necrosis in ASC-expressing tumor cells of various tissue origins. We previously demonstrated that the ASC-mediated apoptosis of NUGC-4 cells was inhibited by a caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, whereas the ASC-mediated necrosis in COLO205 cells was inhibited by a cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, ASC has been implicated in pyroptosis that is inhibited by a caspase-1 inhibitor. Therefore, to further classify the type of cell death, we investigated the effect of these protease inhibitors. Consistent with our previous results, ASC-mediated cell death of all the apoptosis type was inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK but not by CA-074Me (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the ASC-mediated cell death of necrosis-type cells was inhibited by CA-074Me, whereas neither Ac-YVAD-CMK nor Z-IETD-FMK inhibited it (Fig. 2B). These characteristics of ASC-mediated necrosis are shared with pyronecrosis. Death receptors that normally induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis can elicit necrotic cell death (necroptosis), especially when caspases are inhibited. Necroptosis requires the expression of RIP1 and RIP3 (26Hitomi J. Christofferson D.E. Ng A. Yao J. Degterev A. Xavier R.J. Yuan J.

To investigate the involvement of RIP3 in ASC-mediated necrosis, we examined the RIP3 expression in tumor cell lines. RIP3 expression coincides with neither necrosis-type cells nor apoptosis-type cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, necrostatin-1 did not inhibit the NLRC4 mimicry-induced necrosis in THP-1 cells, whereas it inhibited the necroptosis induced by TNF-α plus Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) in the same cell line (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that ASC-mediated necrosis is distinct from necroptosis. The stable transfectants of COLO205 cells expressing C12N2 (CLC12N2) exhibit necrosis in response to MDP stimulation (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By limiting dilution, we obtained one subclone of CLC12N2 cells that exhibited necrosis (CLC12N2-Nec) just like the parental CLC12N2 cells and another subclone that exhibited apoptosis (CLC12N2-Apo) upon ASC activation (Fig. 4A and see supplemental Movie S1 and Movie S2). Consistent with our previous conclusion that ASC-mediated apoptosis is caspase-8-dependent (19Hasegawa M. Kawase K. Inohara N. Imamura R. Yeh W.C. Kinoshita T. Suda T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Z-IETD-FMK inhibited the cell death of CLC12N2-Apo but not CLC12N2-Nec cells (Fig. 4B). To identify what determines the mode of ASC-mediated cell death, we compared the gene expression profiles between CLC12N2-Nec and CLC12N2-Apo cells and between the original COLO205 (necrosis type) and NUGC-4 cells (apoptosis type). We first selected those genes that expressed either more or less consistently in CLC12N2-Nec when compared with CLC12-Apo cells and in COLO205 cells when compared with NUGC-4 cells. Among them, the top 10 genes with the greatest difference in expression between the CLC12N2-Nec and CLC12-Apo cells are shown in Fig. 4C. Using real-time PCR, we examined the expression of these 20 genes in other tumor cell lines. To our surprise, CASP1 was the only gene that completely coincided with the necrosis-type cell lines (Fig. 4D and see supplemental Fig. S2; supplemental Table S1 shows primer sequences used in supplemental Figs. S2 and S4). Although CARD16 expression had a weak correlation with the necrosis type, CARD16 knockdown did not inhibit the MDP-induced necrosis of CLC12N2-Nec cells (see supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that CARD16 is not required for ASC-mediated necrosis. No gene completely coincided with the apoptotic phenotype (see supplemental Fig. S4). Western blot analyses confirmed that substantial amounts of caspase-1 protein were expressed in the necrosis-type but not apoptosis-type cell lines (Fig. 4E). We previously reported that NLRC4 mimicry induces apoptosis in four gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, including NUGC-4, and one lung cancer cell line (19Hasegawa M. Kawase K. Inohara N. Imamura R. Yeh W.C. Kinoshita T. Suda T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with the above results, all of these cell lines expressed no caspase-1 (see supplemental Fig. S5). Therefore, caspase-1 is a novel cellular factor determining the mode of cell death. To investigate whether caspase-1 is required for ASC-mediated necrosis, caspase-1 expression in CLC12N2-Nec cells was down-regulated using siRNA. Although the one-time transfection of caspase-1-targeting siRNA but not control siRNA severely reduced the expression of caspase-1 protein, the NLRC4 mimicry-induced necrosis was only slightly suppressed by the caspase-1-targeting siRNA (Fig. 5A). However, after a 6- or 9-day culture with repetitive siRNA transfection, the necrosis was reduced and, interestingly, apoptosis gradually increased. These results suggest that a special caspase-1 with a long half-life is involved in ASC-mediated necrosis. To confirm the role of caspase-1 in ASC-mediated necrosis, we introduced a GFP-caspase-1 fusion gene into NUC12N2 cells (C12N2-expressing NUGC-4 cells) and thereby established NU-GFP-Casp1 cells. MDP stimulation induced apoptosis in NUC12N2 cells but induced necrosis in NU-GFP-Casp1 cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, exogenous caspase-1 expression converted apoptosis-type cells to necrosis-type cells. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome-associated NLRP3 mutants induce necrotic cell death in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 (13Fujisawa A. Kambe N. Saito M. Nishikomori R. Tanizaki H.

Morrison A.C. Taxman D.J. Duncan J.A. Barnoy S. Venkatesan M.M. Flavell R.A. Deshmukh M. Hoffman H.M. Ting J.P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Here we found that one such mutant, NLRP3-Y570C, but not the wild-type NLRP3, induced necrosis in another human monocytic cell line, NOMO-1. Consistent with the NLRC4 mimicry-induced necrosis of CLC12N2 cells, the NLRP3-Y570C-induced necrosis was suppressed by ASC-targeting siRNA (Fig. 5C) and stable expression of caspase-1-targeting shRNA (Fig. 5D), whose target sequence was completely different from that of the caspase-1-targeting siRNA used above. Furthermore, the NLRP3-Y570C-induced necrosis was converted to apoptosis by suppressing caspase-1 expression (Fig. 5, E and F). Z-IETD-FMK inhibited the apoptosis observed in caspase-1-deficient cells, but not the necrosis observed in the caspase-1-sufficient cells (Fig. 5F), indicating that ASC activation induces caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in cells lacking caspase-1. Because Ac-YVAD-CMK did not inhibit the NLRC4 mimicry-induced cell death of necrosis-type cell lines (Fig. 2B), we next investigated whether the catalytic activity of caspase-1 is involved in ASC-mediated necrosis. When SK-MEL-28 (SKC12N2) cells expressing C12N2 were treated with MDP, a fragment (p20) of mature caspase-1 was detected in the cell lysate and culture supernatant (Fig. 6A). Treatment with 40 μm Ac-YVAD-CMK completely inhibited the caspase-1 processing, but did not inhibit the ASC-mediated necrosis of SKC12N2 cells (Fig. 6B), supporting the notion that the caspase-1 catalytic activity is not required for ASC-mediated necrosis. To further confirm this notion, wild-type caspase-1, the catalytically inactive caspase-1-C285S mutant, or GFP was transduced into NUC12N2 cells using a lentiviral vector. The exogenous caspase-1 expression levels were comparable with those of endogenous caspase-1 in COLO205 and SK-MEL-28 cells (Fig. 6C and see supplemental Fig. S6A). Both the wild type and the C285S mutant of caspase-1 converted the mode of NLRC4 mimicry-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis, but GFP did not (Fig. 6D and see supplemental Fig. S6B). These cells were further transfected with an expression plasmid for pro-IL-1β and then stimulated with MDP. Importantly, cells expressing the wild-type caspase-1, but not the mutant caspase-1, secreted IL-1β (Fig. 6E), confirming that the C285S mutant was catalytically inactive. These results indicate that the catalytic activity of caspase-1 is not required for ASC-mediated necrosis. S. aureus α-hemolysin induces NLRP3- and ASC-dependent pyronecrosis in THP-1 cells (31Craven R.R. Gao X. Allen I.C. Gris D. Bubeck Wardenburg J. McElvania-Tekippe E. Ting J.P. Duncan J.A. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This necrotic cell death was reported to be caspase-1-independent because it was not inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK. Therefore, we next investigated the role of caspase-1 and its catalytic activity in the S. aureus-induced death of NOMO-1 cells. Consistent with the previous study (31Craven R.R. Gao X. Allen I.C. Gris D. Bubeck Wardenburg J. McElvania-Tekippe E. Ting J.P. Duncan J.A. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the S. aureus-induced cell death exhibited a necrotic morphology (Fig. 7A), and this necrosis was inhibited by siRNAs for ASC and NLRP3 but not for NLRC4 (Fig. 7B). Similar to NLRC4 mimicry-induced necrosis, the S. aureus-induced necrosis was inhibited by CA-074Me, but not by Z-IETD-FMK (Fig. 7C). In addition, a caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, did not inhibit the S. aureus-induced necrosis, indicating that caspase-3, the executioner of apoptosis, was not involved in this cell death (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, Ac-YVAD-CMK that was sufficient to inhibit IL-1β production did not inhibit the S. aureus-induced necrosis (Fig. 7D). Similar results were obtained using THP-1 cells (see supplemental Fig. S7). Nonetheless, the S. aureus-induced necrosis was suppressed by caspase-1 knockdown (Fig. 7E). These results indicate that the S. aureus-induced necrosis requires caspase-1 but not its catalytic activity. Consistent with our observations in NLRC4 mimicry-induced necrosis, a short period of caspase-1 knockdown inhibited the S. aureus-induced IL-1β production but not necrosis, whereas longer knockdown suppressed both responses (Fig. 7F). However, S. aureus-induced necrosis was not inhibited even after a 7- or 12-day exposure of NOMO-1 cells to Ac-YVAD-CMK (see supplemental Fig. S8), further supporting that the catalytic activity of caspase-1 is not required for the ASC-mediated necrosis. It was reported that P. aeruginosa infection induces NLRC4- and caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in macrophages (32Sutterwala F.S. Mijares L.A. Li L. Ogura Y. Kazmierczak B.I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 3235-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Consistent with this study, we observed that P. aeruginosa induced necrosis in NOMO-1 cells (Fig. 7G), and this necrosis was inhibited by NLRC4-targeting siRNA but not by ASC- or NLRP3-targeting siRNA (Fig. 7H), although the necrosis observed after P. aeruginosa infection at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) was strongly suppressed by both NLRC4-targeting and ASC-targeting siRNAs (data not shown). Consistent with the above S. aureus infection model, the P. aeruginosa-induced necrosis was suppressed in NOMO-1 cells carrying the caspase-1-targeting shRNA (Fig. 7I). However, Ac-YVAD-CMK that was sufficient to inhibit IL-1β production did not inhibit the P. aeruginosa-induced necrosis (Fig. 7J). Thus, the caspase-1 catalytic activity is also dispensable for NLRC4-mediated pyroptosis. In this study, we discovered that activation of ASC induces necrosis when cells express caspase-1; otherwise, the same conditions without caspase-1 expression induce apoptosis. Thus, caspase-1 is a novel molecular determinant of cell death modes. Intriguingly, we found that ASC-mediated necrosis does require caspase-1 expression, but not its catalytic activity. This conclusion was confirmed by experiments using a caspase-1 inhibitor and a catalytically inactive caspase-1 mutant. This is the first report of a catalytic activity-independent function of caspase-1. A caveat is that our results do not exclude the possibility that there are caspase-1 catalytic activity-dependent mechanisms of pyroptosis in addition to the catalytic activity-independent one. This concern is analogous to the fact that caspase-dependent DNase, which causes DNA degradation during apoptosis and hence would cause cell death, is not essential for the cell death itself (33McIlroy D. Sakahira H. Talanian R.V. Nagata S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4401-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to our conclusion described above, it has been thought that pyroptosis of human monocytes requires caspase-1 catalytic activity. This conclusion has been drawn from experiments using high concentrations (50–200 μm) of Z-VAD-FMK or Ac-YVAD-CMK (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 34Kelk P. Johansson A. Claesson R. Hänström L. Kalfas S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such high concentrations of these inhibitors could non-specifically inhibit other proteases including cathepsin B (35Schotte P. Declercq W. Van Huffel S. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement of caspase-1 catalytic activity in pyroptosis of human macrophages should be re-evaluated using a lower dose of Ac-YVAD-CMK. Recently, Broz et al. (36Broz P. von Moltke J. Jones J.W. Vance R.E. Monack D.M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) demonstrated that autoproteolysis of caspase-1 is required for IL-1β processing but not for pyroptosis of mouse macrophages infected by Salmonella or Legionella, although the proteolytic activity of caspase-1 was required for both responses. In addition, they demonstrated that formation of a large focus of ASC was required for IL-1β production, whereas formation of NLRC4-caspase1 complexes was sufficient and ASC was not required for the cell death. The results of Broz et al. (36Broz P. von Moltke J. Jones J.W. Vance R.E. Monack D.M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and our results are similar in that both indicate that the use of caspase-1 in IL-1β processing and cell death is somewhat different. However, they were different from each other in the requirement of the proteolytic activity of caspase-1 for cell death. This difference may be species-specific. Actually, our preliminary experiments using mouse peritoneal macrophages showed that low concentrations (2–10 μm) of Ac-YVAD-CMK significantly inhibited S. typhimurium- and P. aeruginosa-induced cell death, albeit less efficiently than they inhibited IL-1β release under the same conditions (see supplemental Fig. S9). In the experimental system used by Broz et al. (36Broz P. von Moltke J. Jones J.W. Vance R.E. Monack D.M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), macrophages were killed in an ASC-independent manner. In contrast, we mainly investigated ASC-dependent necrosis in this study. However, the difference in ASC dependence is unlikely to be a reason for the different requirement in terms of the caspase-1 proteolytic activity for necrosis because ASC-independent necrosis of P. aeruginosa-infected NOMO-1 cells was not inhibited by Ac-YVAD-CMK (Fig. 7J). On the other hand, pyronecrosis has been mainly characterized using THP-1 cells infected with S. flexneri, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or adenovirus or treated with S. aureus α-hemolysin (14Willingham S.B.

Pyronecrosis has been concluded to be caspase-1-independent, mainly because these cases of cell death were not inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK or Ac-YVAD-CMK at relatively low concentrations sufficient to inhibit caspase-1-mediated IL-1β secretion. Whether macrophages from caspase-1-deficient mice are resistant to Shigella-induced cell death has been controversial (14Willingham S.B. Bergstralh D.T. O'Connor W. Morrison A.C. Taxman D.J.

In other experimental systems of pyronecrosis, the requirement for caspase-1 expression has not been examined. Thus, the requirement for caspase-1 in the pyronecrosis observed in the above experimental systems needs to be re-examined. Both pyroptosis and pyronecrosis are mediated by NLRs and ASC and are accompanied by IL-1β production. Morphologically, both modes of cell death are characterized by rapid cell swelling followed by plasma membrane rupture. Nuclear shrinkage has been observed for pyroptosis. However, it has not been clearly described whether pyronecrosis is also accompanied by nuclear shrinkage. Therefore, one cannot distinguish pyroptosis and pyronecrosis solely by the morphology of the dying cells. We observed nuclear shrinkage in some cells undergoing ASC-mediated necrosis. We found that all the instances of ASC-mediated necrosis examined in our study were inhibited by CA-074Me. This is a characteristic of pyronecrosis. However, it was recently reported that pyroptosis is also inhibited by CA-074Me (40Averette K.M. Pratt M.R. Yang Y. Bassilian S. Whitelegge J.P. Loo J.A. Muir T.W. Bradley K.A. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The sole factor that clearly discriminated the two modes of cell death was that caspase-1 was essential for pyroptosis, but not pyronecrosis. However, this distinction is now questionable as described above. Based on our results presented here, it is likely that pyroptosis and pyronecrosis are the same mode of cell death. The molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis and pyronecrosis have not been well understood. Our finding that caspase-1 is capable of inducing necrosis independently of its catalytic activity may provide important insight into the molecular mechanism of these necrotic cell death modes. ASC-mediated necrosis induced by NLRC4 mimicry in CLC12N2 cells and by the NLRP3-Y570C mutant in NOMO-1 cells was converted to apoptosis when caspase-1 expression was suppressed by RNA interference. However, the ASC-mediated necrosis induced by S. aureus infection in NOMO-1 cells was merely suppressed, not converted to apoptosis, by reduced caspase-1 expression. One possible explanation for these distinctive outcomes by different stimuli in the same cell line is that the host cells or microbes in S. aureus-infected NOMO-1 cells might produce something that inhibits caspase-8 activation. Further study is required to clarify this point. Although CA-074Me, the well known cathepsin B inhibitor, abrogated ASC-mediated necrosis, there was no correlation between cathepsin B expression and the mode of ASC-mediated cell death (see supplemental Fig. S10A). It should be noted that whether cathepsin B plays an essential role in this type of cell death is not clear because we previously found that knockdown of cathepsin B expression using siRNA failed to inhibit the MDP-induced cell death of CLC12N2 cells (18Motani K. Kawase K. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kushiyama H. Suda T. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistently, knockdown of cathepsin B in NOMO1-C12N2 cells also failed to inhibit the MDP-induced cell death (see supplemental Fig. S10B). Thus, further experiments are required to determine the target of CA-074Me in the inhibition of ASC-mediated necrosis. Here we found that a short term knockdown of caspase-1 abrogated IL-1β production but not ASC-mediated necrosis, whereas its long term knockdown diminished both responses. Thus, the caspase-1 involved in necrosis might have a longer half-life when compared with that involved in IL-1β secretion. Alternatively, the absence of caspase-1 might result in gradual decrease of the amount and/or activity of another molecule that was essential for the ASC-mediated necrosis. Further study aiming to explain this interesting phenomenon may provide a clue to the molecular mechanism of caspase-1-meidated necrosis. Download .zip (4.78 MB) Help with zip files"

The exact mechanism(s) underlying this down-regulation of c-Myc remains incompletely understood. Here we report the identification of miR-185-3p as a novel feedback regulator of c-Myc. This microRNA (miRNA) was initially identified as one of the c-Myc target miRNA transcripts through analysis of RNA samples isolated from cells prior to and after serum stimulation and further verified by real-time PCR, luciferase reporter, and ChIP assays. Interestingly, overexpression of wild type, but not mutant, miR-185-3p decreased the protein, but not mRNA, level of c-Myc in a dose-dependent fashion and also drastically abated the serum induction of c-Myc level in human cancer cells by targeting the coding sequence of c-Myc mRNA, consequently suppressing c-Myc-mediated proliferation. A miR-185-3p inhibitor rescued the inhibition of c-Myc expression by endogenous miR-185-3p. Thus, our results unveil miR-185-3p as the first miRNA that monitors c-Myc levels via an autoregulatory feedback mechanism in response to serum stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2080468120,"This study aims to investigate the strength of various sources of phylogenetic information that led to recent seemingly robust conclusions about higher-level arthropod phylogeny and to assess the role of excluding or downweighting synonymous change for arriving at those conclusions.The current study analyzes DNA sequences from 68 gene segments of 62 distinct protein-coding nuclear genes for 80 species. Gene segments analyzed individually support numerous nodes recovered in combined-gene analyses, but few of the higher-level nodes of greatest current interest. However, neither is there support for conflicting alternatives to these higher-level nodes. Gene segments with higher rates of nonsynonymous change tend to be more informative overall, but those with lower rates tend to provide stronger support for deeper nodes. Higher-level nodes with bootstrap values in the 80% - 99% range for the complete data matrix are markedly more sensitive to substantial drops in their bootstrap percentages after character subsampling than those with 100% bootstrap, suggesting that these nodes are likely not to have been strongly supported with many fewer data than in the full matrix. Data set partitioning of total data by (mostly) synonymous and (mostly) nonsynonymous change improves overall node support, but the result remains much inferior to analysis of (unpartitioned) nonsynonymous change alone. Clusters of genes with similar nonsynonymous rate properties (e.g., faster vs. slower) show some distinct patterns of node support but few conflicts. Synonymous change is shown to contribute little, if any, phylogenetic signal to the support of higher-level nodes, but it does contribute nonphylogenetic signal, probably through its underlying heterogeneous nucleotide composition. Analysis of seemingly conservative indels does not prove useful.Generating a robust molecular higher-level phylogeny of Arthropoda is currently possible with large amounts of data and an exclusive reliance on nonsynonymous change."

This study characterized structural and molecular remodeling in mesenteric resistance arteries (MRAs) in diabetic (db/db) and control (Db/db) mice.Structural properties were assessed in isolated MRAs from 12 and 16 wk-old db/db and Db/db mice by pressure myography. Matrix regulatory proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. Mean arterial pressure and superior mesenteric blood flow were measured in 12 wk-old mice by telemetry and a Doppler flow nanoprobe, respectively.Blood pressure was similar between groups. Lumen diameter and medial cross-sectional area were significantly increased in 16 wk-old db/db MRA compared to control, indicating outward hypertrophic remodeling. Moreover, wall stress and cross-sectional compliance were significantly larger in diabetic arteries. These remodeling indices were associated with increased expression of matrix regulatory proteins matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-12, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in db/db arteries. Finally, superior mesenteric artery blood flow was increased by 46% in 12 wk-old db/db mice, a finding that preceded mesenteric resistance artery remodeling.These data suggest that flow-induced hemodynamic changes may supersede the local neurohormonal and metabolic milieu to culminate in hypertrophic outward remodeling of type 2 DM mesenteric resistance arteries."

Following internalization, EGFR is either recycled back to the cell surface or transported to the late endosome/lysosome for degradation. Currently, the molecular machinery that regulates this sorting pathway is only partially defined. Eps15 (EGFR pathway substrate 15) is an endocytic adaptor protein that is well known to support clathrin-mediated internalization of EGFR at the plasma membrane. Using RT-PCR, we have identified a novel short form of Eps15 (Eps15S) from rat liver that lacks the 111 C-terminal amino acids present in the traditional Eps15 form. The goal of this study was to define the functional role of the novel Eps15S form in EGFR trafficking. Overexpression of a mutant form of Eps15S (Eps15S ΔEH2/EH3) did not block EGFR internalization but reduced its recycling to the cell surface. After knockdown of all Eps15 forms, re-expression of Eps15S significantly reduced EGFR degradation while promoting recycling back to the cell surface. In contrast, re-expression of Eps15 did not potentiate receptor recycling. Furthermore, overexpression of the mutant Eps15S substantially reduced cell proliferation, linking EGFR recycling to downstream mitogenic effects. Finally, we found that Eps15S is localized to the Rab11-positive recycling endosome that is disrupted in cells expressing the Eps15S mutant, leading to an accumulation of the EGFR in early endosomes.

Here, we report the clinical, genetic, and functional characterization of four TNNC1 rare variants (Y5H, M103I, D145E, and I148V), all previously reported by us in association with DCM (Hershberger, R. E., Norton, N., Morales, A., Li, D., Siegfried, J. D., and Gonzalez-Quintana, J. (2010) Circ. Cardiovasc. Genet. 3, 155-161); in the previous study, two variants (Y5H and D145E) were identified in subjects who also carried MYH7 and MYBPC3 rare variants, respectively. Functional studies using the recombinant human mutant cTnC proteins reconstituted into porcine papillary skinned fibers showed decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development (Y5H and M103I). Furthermore, the cTnC mutants diminished (Y5H and I148V) or abolished (M103I) the effects of PKA phosphorylation on Ca(2+) sensitivity. Only M103I decreased the troponin activation properties of the actomyosin ATPase when Ca(2+) was present. CD spectroscopic studies of apo (absence of divalent cations)-, Mg(2+)-, and Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-bound states indicated that all of the cTnC mutants (except I148V in the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) condition) decreased the α-helical content. These results suggest that each mutation alters the function/ability of the myofilament to bind Ca(2+) as a result of modifications in cTnC structure. One variant (D145E) that was previously reported in association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that produced results in vivo in this study consistent with prior hypertrophic cardiomyopathy functional studies was found associated with the MYBPC3 P910T rare variant, likely contributing to the observed DCM phenotype. We conclude that these rare variants alter the regulation of contraction in some way, and the combined clinical, molecular, genetic, and functional data reinforce the importance of TNNC1 rare variants in the pathogenesis of DCM."

The thylakoid membrane protein Alb3 of Arabidopsis chloroplasts belongs to the evolutionarily conserved YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 protein family; the members of this family facilitate the insertion, folding, and assembly of membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Here, we analyzed the interaction sites of full-length Alb3 with the cpSRP pathway component cpSRP43 by using in vitro and in vivo studies. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and Alb3 proteoliposome studies showed that the interaction of cpSRP43 is dependent on a binding domain in the C terminus of Alb3 as well as an additional membrane-embedded binding site in the fifth transmembrane domain (TMD5) of Alb3. The C-terminal binding domain was mapped to residues 374-388, and the binding domain within TMD5 was mapped to residues 314-318 located close to the luminal end of TMD5. A direct binding between cpSRP43 and these binding motifs was shown by pepspot analysis. Further studies using blue-native gel electrophoresis revealed that full-length Alb3 is able to form dimers. This finding and the identification of a membrane-embedded cpSRP43 binding site in Alb3 support a model in which cpSRP43 inserts into a dimeric Alb3 translocation pore during cpSRP-dependent delivery of light-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteins."

Candida species are the leading cause of disseminated fungal infections, with Candida albicans being the most prevalent species. Candida glabrata, the second/third most common cause of candidemia, shows reduced susceptibility to a widely used antifungal drug fluconazole. Here, we present findings from a screen of 9134 C. glabrata Tn7 insertion mutants for altered survival profiles in the presence of fluconazole. We have identified two components of RNA polymerase II mediator complex, three players of Rho GTPase-mediated signaling cascade, and two proteins implicated in actin cytoskeleton biogenesis and ergosterol biosynthesis that are required to sustain viability during fluconazole stress. We show that exposure to fluconazole leads to activation of the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated cell wall integrity pathway in C. glabrata. Our data demonstrate that disruption of a RhoGAP (GTPase activating protein) domain-containing protein, CgBem2, results in bud-emergence defects, azole susceptibility, and constitutive activation of CgRho1-regulated CgPkc1 signaling cascade and cell wall-related phenotypes. The viability loss of Cgbem2Δ mutant upon fluconazole treatment could be partially rescued by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. Additionally, we present evidence that CgBEM2 is required for the transcriptional activation of genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps in response to fluconazole exposure.

To verify this finding in an animal model, we inserted three stop codons at the corresponding Asp-1904 in the murine CaV1.2 gene. Mice homozygous for the Stop mutation (Stop/Stop mice)were born at a Mendelian ratio but died after birth. Stop/Stop hearts showed reduced beating frequencies and contractions.Surprisingly, Stop/Stop cardiomyocytes displayed reduced IBa and a minor expression of the CaV1.2Stop protein. In contrast,expression of the CaV1.2Stop protein was normal in pooled smooth muscle samples from Stop/Stop embryos. As the CaV1.2 channel exists in a cardiac and smooth muscle splice variant, HK1 and LK1, respectively, we analyzed the consequences of the deletion of the carboxyl terminus in the respective splice variant using the rabbit CaV1.2 clone expressed in HEK293 cells.HEK293 cells transfected with the HK1Stop channel showed a reduced IBa and CaV1.2 expression. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors increased the expression of HK1Stop protein and IBa in HEK293 cells and in Stop/Stop cardiomyocytes indicating that truncation of CaV1.2 containing the cardiac exon 1a amino terminus results in proteasomal degradation of the translated protein. In contrast, HEK293 cells transfected with the LK1Stop channel had normal IBa and CaV1.2 expression.

We asked whether nocturnally active A. russatus will respond to moon phase and whether this response will be obtained also in diurnally active individuals. We studied giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial foraging patches and fecal cortisol metabolite levels. Both species exhibited elevated fecal cortisol metabolite levels and foraged to higher GUDs in full moon nights; thus A. russatus retains physiological response and behavioral patterns that correlate with full moon conditions, as can be expected in nocturnal rodents, in spite of its diurnal activity.

Mucin gene expression can be affected by inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin (PG) D(2,) an inflammatory mediator synthesized by hematopoietic PGD synthase (H-PGDS). PGD(2) binds to either D-prostanoid receptor (DP1) or chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on T-helper type 2 cells (CRTH2). We investigated the mechanisms by which PGD(2) induces MUC5B gene expression in airway epithelial cells. Western blot analysis showed that H-PGDS was highly expressed in nasal polyps. Similar results were obtained for PGD(2) expression. In addition, we could clearly detect the expressions of both H-PGDS and DP1 in nasal epithelial cells but not CRTH2. We demonstrated that PGD(2) increased MUC5B gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial cells as well as in NCI-H292 cells in vitro. S5751, a DP1 antagonist, inhibited PGD(2)-induced MUC5B expression, whereas a CRTH2 antagonist (OC0459) did not. These data suggest that PGD(2) induced MUC5B expression via DP1. Pretreatment with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (PD98059) blocked both PGD(2)-induced ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and MUC5B expression. Proximity ligation assays showed direct interaction between RSK1 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Stimulation with PGD(2) caused an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, whereas intracellular Ca(2+) did not have such an effect. PGD(2)-induced MUC5B mRNA levels were regulated by CREB via direct interaction with two cAMP-response element sites (-921/-914 and -900/-893). Finally, we demonstrated that PGD(2) can induce MUC5B overproduction via ERK MAPK/RSK1/CREB signaling and that DP1 receptor may have suppressive effects in controlling MUC5B overproduction in the airway."
https://openalex.org/W2154945604,"Na/H exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1) is a cytoplasmic PDZ (postsynaptic density 95/disc large/zona occludens) protein that assembles macromolecular complexes and determines the localization, trafficking, and signaling of select G protein-coupled receptors and other membrane-delimited proteins. The parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), which regulates mineral ion homeostasis and bone turnover, is a G protein-coupled receptor harboring a PDZ-binding motif that enables association with NHERF1 and tethering to the actin cytoskeleton. NHERF1 interactions with the PTHR modify its trafficking and signaling. Here, we characterized by live cell imaging the mechanism whereby NHERF1 coordinates the interactions of multiple proteins, as well as the fate of NHERF1 itself upon receptor activation. Upon PTHR stimulation, NHERF1 rapidly dissociates from the receptor and induces receptor aggregation in long lasting clusters that are enriched with the actin-binding protein ezrin and with clathrin. After NHERF1 dissociates from the PTHR, ezrin then directly interacts with the PTHR to stabilize the PTHR at the cell membrane. Recruitment of β-arrestins to the PTHR is delayed until NHERF1 dissociates from the receptor, which is then trafficked to clathrin for internalization. The ability of NHERF to interact dynamically with the PTHR and cognate adapter proteins regulates receptor trafficking and signaling in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. Na/H exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1) is a cytoplasmic PDZ (postsynaptic density 95/disc large/zona occludens) protein that assembles macromolecular complexes and determines the localization, trafficking, and signaling of select G protein-coupled receptors and other membrane-delimited proteins. The parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), which regulates mineral ion homeostasis and bone turnover, is a G protein-coupled receptor harboring a PDZ-binding motif that enables association with NHERF1 and tethering to the actin cytoskeleton. NHERF1 interactions with the PTHR modify its trafficking and signaling.

The ER membrane-anchored Ubx domain proteins, Ubx2p in yeast and erasin/UbxD2 and/or UbxD8 in mammalian cells, have been shown to recruit p97/Cdc48 to the ER for retrotranslocation (34Neuber O.

ERAD substrates retrotranslocated by p97/Cdc48p are then subjected to deglycosylation and ubiquitin chain editing before being shuttled to the proteasome for degradation (40Park H. Suzuki T.

PLoS Biol. 2011; 8: e1000605Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).To identify additional factors involved in ERAD, we searched for proteins that bind to the p97 receptor VIMP. Through this approach, we identified importin β as a new protein involved in ERAD. Importin β (also known as karyopherin β1 or kap95 in budding yeast) is a multifunctional protein that is known to mediate nuclear import of numerous proteins, act as a cytoplasmic chaperone that prevents aggregation for some proteins, and negatively regulate mitotic spindle assembly, nuclear membrane fusion, and nuclear pore complex formation (44Harel A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). During nuclear import, importin β binds cargo directly or utilizes importin α as an adaptor to bind its cargo proteins bearing a classical nuclear localization signal. The importin β-cargo complex is transported through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus where RanGTP binds to importin β to induce cargo release. The importin β-RanGTP complex is then recycled back to the cytoplasm where RanGTP is dissociated from importin β and converted to RanGDP (45Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). RanGDP is imported into the nucleus by NTF2 (nuclear transport factor 2) and then converted to RanGTP by RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1) (46Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 47Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The process results in RanGTP predominantly in the nucleus and RanGDP mainly in the cytoplasm (45Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for a novel function of importin β in promoting ERAD. We show that importin β is an important component of a retrotranslocation machinery involved in ERAD and that it cooperates with Ran GTPase to promote ubiquitination and degradation of the luminal ERAD substrate, the null Hong Kong variant of α-1-antitrypsin (NHK).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate a surprising connection between ERAD and importin β, a well known regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Our in vivo and in vitro studies support the conclusion that importin β is required for ubiquitination of the luminal soluble ERAD substrate NHK. We demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of importin β reduces NHK ubiquitination. This phenotype can be recapitulated in an in vitro assay in which importin β is biochemically depleted from the cytosol and readdition of recombinant importin β to importin β-depleted cytosol restores the ubiquitination of NHK. By contrast, ubiquitination of the membrane ERAD substrate CD3δ increased in importin β knockdown cells. Importin β knockdown stabilizes both NHK and CD3δ. Therefore, diminished NHK ubiquitination is not likely to be resulted from a defect in the ubiquitin conjugating/deconjugating systems associated with the ER membrane. Otherwise, both luminal and membrane substrates should be affected in a similar way. Importin β is likely to act in a step required for the degradation of both substrates but only required for the ubiquitination of NHK. As a luminal ERAD substrate, NHK must first be retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the ER for ubiquitination because all known E3s involved in ERAD have their catalytic domains located in the cytosolic side. Thus, the ubiquitination levels of an ER luminal substrate, such as NHK, can be a faithful indicator of retrotranslocation when proteasomal degradation is inhibited. On the other hand, the membrane-bound substrates that contain cytosolically exposed domains, such as CD3δ, may be ubiquitinated directly on their cytosolic residues without the need of retrotranslocation. We propose that importin β may have a function in NHK retrotranslocation. Importin β may act first to promote extrusion of NHK into the cytosol for ubiquitination, after which p97 binds to the ubiquitin conjugates on NHK and extracts it from the translocation site for subsequent proteasomal degradation. Our data showed that importin β does not interact with p97, suggesting that they may not need physical interaction to cooperate in ERAD. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that importin β and p97 have weak or transient interaction during ERAD. Our study reveals association of importin β with several ERAD components in a retrotranslocation complex, including VIMP, Derlin-1, gp78, and Hrd1. Among these proteins, at least VIMP binds importin β directly. These interactions may recruit importin β to the ER and enable the latter to directly participate in retrotranslocation. In support of this possibility, a mutant of importin β (N297) that inhibits importin β association with the ER-enriched microsomes also inhibits ERAD of NHK.Structural studies show that in the absence of protein binding, importin β adopts an extended S-shaped superhelical architecture formed by HEAT repeats that consist of pairs of anti-parallel α-helices. The spring-like superhelical structure enables importin β to adapt its geometry to fit cargos of different sizes and shapes. When importin β binds to its cargo or the regulators Ran and importin α, it undergoes a drastic conformational change, which converts it to a compact spring-like form. This compact conformation stores energy, which is used for nuclear transport (67Zachariae U. Grubmüller H. Structure. 2008; 16: 906-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By analogy, importin β might alter between the two different energy states at the site of retrotranslocation, which could provide the necessary energy for protein retrotranslocation. Our results suggest that importin β interacts with RanGDP to facilitate ERAD, whereas RanGTP and importin α inhibit ERAD. We speculate that RanGDP is easier to be dissociated from importin β because of its weak affinity to the latter, and hence importin β in complex with RanGDP is easier to switch from the compact conformation to the extended conformation and release energy. It is conceivable that the conformational change in importin β, if it occurs within a retrotranslocation complex, may generate a localized force to regulate the gating of a retrotranslocation channel. By contrast, the high affinity binding of RanGTP or importin α to importin β may keep importin β in the compact conformation, which results in a blockage of retrotranslocation.Cytosolic localization of RanGDP and importin α may be pivotal to regulate the ERAD capacity. Previous studies reported that a significant amount of Ran was distributed to the cytoplasm from the nucleus in response to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 (68Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Yamashita J. Yasuda Y. Kotera I. Shibata S. Shigeta M. Hiraoka Y. Haraguchi T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 69Yasuda Y. Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, H2O2-induced stress accumulates importin α, a potential inhibitor of ERAD, in the nucleus (68Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Yamashita J. Yasuda Y. Kotera I. Shibata S. Shigeta M. Hiraoka Y. Haraguchi T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is known to cause overproduction of misfolded proteins in the ER. Therefore, the relocation of Ran and importin α under oxidative stress induced by H2O2 may represent a novel strategy to cope with cellular stress. Clearly, the unexpected interaction of importin β with ERAD machinery reveals a new layer of complexity for the regulation of ER quality control system in mammalian cells.

IntroductionSialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid or Neu5Ac) are a family of nine carbon keto sugars, which participate in various biologically important processes, including cellular recognition, microbial infection, and tumor metastasis (7Angata T.

Microbiology. 2007; 153: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In mammals, sialic acids typically exist as terminal residues on the outermost cell surface glycoconjugates (13Varki A.

For example, gangliosides located predominantly on vertebrate nerve cell surfaces are complex glycosphingolipids composed of oligosaccharide chains containing one or more terminal sialic acids (15Vyas A.A. Schnaar R.L. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sialic acids also have been found as terminal residues on the surface of a number of pathogenic bacteria and shown to play important roles during infection (11Sáez-Llorens X. McCracken Jr., G.H.

A recent study of the human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni revealed that a sialylated variant of this bacterium showed significantly higher invasion levels of epithelial cells compared with unsialylated versions (17Louwen R.

This organism has been shown to express variable outer core structures of lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), 7The abbreviations used are: LOSlipo-oligosaccharideCMP-3FNeu5AcCMP-3-fluoro-N-acetylneuraminic acidFCHASE6-(fluorescein-5-carbaxamido)hexanoic acid. which mimic the carbohydrate moieties of human gangliosides.

In addition, the carbohydrate mimicry between LOS outer core structures of C. jejuni and human gangliosides has been suggested to trigger the development of autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (5Endtz H.P.

Oligosaccharides found in the outer core region of the LOS of various C. jejuni strains contain terminal sialic acid residues, which provide the diversity in these structures (3Gilbert M.

Bacterial sialyltransferases are mainly categorized into four distinct families (GT-38, GT-42, GT-52, and GT-80) with polysialyltransferases located in GT-38.The GT-42 enzyme Cst-II from C. jejuni OH4384 is a bifunctional sialyltransferase, transferring sialic acid to the terminal galactose moiety of the lipo-oligosaccharide with an α-2,3-linkage and subsequently transferring another sialic acid to the initially formed sialoside with an α-2,8-linkage (20Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of Cst-II in complex with the inert donor analog CMP-3FNeu5Ac7 revealed a structure that was a significant variation of the GT-A fold (21Chiu C.P. Watts A.G.

Structural and mechanistic analyses of Cst-II supported a catalytic mechanism involving a conserved histidine residue as general base (His-188) that deprotonates the acceptor hydroxyl group during its attack on the anomeric carbon (C-2) of the donor substrate (CMP-Neu5Ac) (21Chiu C.P.

Although the previously reported structure of Cst-II provided valuable information on donor binding, the lack of structural information on the acceptor sugar binding mode has hampered our ability to understand the molecular basis of acceptor binding specificity. Likewise, a detailed kinetic characterization that encompasses the dual acceptor specificity of this important class of glycosyltransferase has not been performed.Here, we report the structure of Cst-II in complex with the donor analog, CMP, and the terminal trisaccharide of its natural acceptor, Neu5Ac-α-2,3-Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc, along with a detailed analysis of its kinetic mechanism. In addition, the roles of residues that bind to the sialic acid moiety of the acceptor are examined through structural and kinetic analyses of mutants. This work provides a mechanistic and structural basis for understanding acceptor binding during the LOS sialylation of C. jejuni and significantly improves our general understanding of the substrate specificity and mechanistic features of bacterial sialyltransferases.DISCUSSIONOf the few glycosyltransferases that have been subjected to detailed kinetic analysis, to date the majority have been shown to catalyze their respective reactions using an ordered Bi Bi (GnTII (45Bendiak B.

J. 1999; 16: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) mechanism involving the obligate binding of the nucleotide sugar donor substrate prior to the association of the acceptor. This finding has been rationalized on the basis of obtained three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of glycosyltransferases with bound donor substrates. Upon binding the donor substrate, a conformational change occurs in which a flexible loop closes over the donor substrate and forms a significant portion of the acceptor substrate binding site, consistent with the observed ordered kinetic mechanisms. An exception to this general observation is the case of a polypeptide GalNAc transferase, which was found to undergo a rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi mechanism using erythropoietin and erythropoietin-like peptides as acceptors and dead-end acceptor analogs (54Wragg S. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16947-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike most glycosyltransferases that demonstrate a much higher affinity for their donor substrates than their acceptors, the apparent binding affinities of the donor and acceptor substrates for polypeptide GalNAc transferase were found to be comparable.In the steady-state random Bi Bi mechanism, binding of substrates and release of products does not occur in a defined order but does contribute to the overall observed rate of reaction. Very few examples of the steady-state random mechanism have been reported. The most frequently quoted example, yeast hexokinase, required years of argument and reports of seemingly contrasting data before an authoritative study by Rudolf and Fromm (55Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6611-6619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided significant irrefutable evidence. This mechanism is very difficult to unambiguously identify for several reasons. The rate equation is painfully complex, making the derivation of expected modes of inhibition very difficult to predict. The initial rate data for this mechanism should in theory be nonhyperbolic, although there are several reasons why obtained data can appear hyperbolic (41Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behaviour and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 560-656Google Scholar), which can lead to erroneous interpretations of data. Unfortunately, for reasons described above, in the case of Cst-II initial rates cannot be measured under truly saturating concentrations of donor substrate, and thus curve fitting to nonhyperbolic equations cannot be used to support this mechanism. An additional complexity of the steady-state random mechanism comes from the fact that certain portions of the mechanism can be in rapid equilibrium, although others contribute to the overall rate, further complicating the derivation of the actual rate equation and the prediction of modes of inhibition.The steady-state iso-ordered Bi Bi mechanism requires an obligate order of substrate binding and product release but also involves an isomerization between two stable enzyme forms that contributes to the overall observed rate of reaction (41Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behaviour and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 560-656Google Scholar). In such a mechanism, product Q will be a mixed inhibitor with respect to substrate A, as was found to be the case with Cst-II, if the two can bind to different stable forms of the enzyme (Fig. 5).Although we cannot rule out the steady-state random Bi Bi, we favor the steady-state iso-ordered Bi Bi mechanism. Indeed, as Cst-II is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing two distinct sialyl transfer reactions, it seems quite reasonable that the enzyme could exist in two distinct stable forms, one in which the acceptor site binds sialyl-lactose or equivalents (e.g. Neu5Ac-α-2,3-Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc) and one in which it binds lactose or an equivalent (e.g. Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc). Product CMP could bind to either of these enzyme forms during the product inhibition study, giving the observed mixed inhibition pattern with respect to CMP-Neu5Ac. The existence of two stable enzyme forms of Cst-II is also consistent with the fact that CMP-3FNeu5Ac acts as a mixed inhibitor with respect to CMP-Neu5Ac.It was of considerable interest to observe these two separate binding modes structurally, hence efforts to derive ternary complex structures with CMP in the donor site and disaccharide (Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc) or (sialyl)trisaccharide (Neu5Ac-α-2,3-Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc) in the acceptor site. Earlier attempts to obtain the acceptor complex of Cst-IIΔ32 by using both cocrystallization and soaking with various acceptor analogs, including lactose, 3′-deoxylactose, and sialyllactose in the presence and absence of the donor analog CMP-3FNeu5Ac, were unsuccessful (21Chiu C.P. Watts A.G. Lairson L.L. Gilbert M. Lim D. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, in our hands, we find that the ternary complex structure can only be obtained by cocrystallization with CMP and at least the terminal trisaccharide of its natural acceptor Neu5Ac-α-2,3-Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc.Inspection of the resulting structure reveals that interactions between the N-acetamide group of the sialic acid moiety of the trisaccharide acceptor and several conserved residues (Asn-51, Tyr-81, and Arg-129) appear crucial for proper binding. Furthermore, our ensemble of structures suggests the GalNAc moiety of the natural acceptor used here is poised by the nature of its β1,3-linkage to interact with the flexible lid domain (residues 155–188) for proper orientation of the acceptor substrate during the catalytic reaction. Structural superimposition of the current ternary complex and the previously reported donor complex suggests that the side chain of Tyr-185 (Fig. 1C), in the lid domain, is a feasible candidate to interact with the GalNAc N-acetamide group of our bound acceptor. These results also help to explain the inability to trap previously attempted acceptor analogs such as lactose and 3′-deoxylactose analogs (in isolation and in longer variants with β1,4-linkages to downstream galactose or glucose sugars), which would lack the analogous N-acetamide moieties that we observe to be so critical to binding of the physiological acceptor used here.The importance of residues Asn-51, Tyr-81, and Arg-129 localized in the observed acceptor-binding site was further validated by structural and kinetic analysis of mutants, which showed a complete absence of the trisaccharide acceptor in those active sites as well as a dramatic reduction of the specificity constants (Table 2). Interestingly, kinetic analysis of the Y81F mutant revealed rate constants comparable with the wild type enzyme (Table 2). Structural analysis of the acceptor-binding site identifies that the carbonyl of the N-acetamide group of the sialic acid moiety in the trisaccharide acceptor interacts with Tyr-81 as well as an ordered water molecule. This water in turn directly interacts with the carbonyl of Ile-130 in the enzyme and the C-7 hydroxyl group of the acceptor to further stabilize acceptor binding, which we believe potentially minimizes the adverse effects on acceptor binding imposed by loss of hydrogen bonding in the Y81F mutant form of Cst-II.Extensive attempts to obtain the complex structure with the disaccharide acceptor (Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc) have been unsuccessful probably due to its weak binding affinity. Previously reported kinetic parameters of wild type Cst-IIΔ32 with lactose-based acceptor analogs demonstrated that lactose, which mimics the disaccharide acceptor, showed a 10-fold higher Km value than that of the 3′-sialyllactose, an analog of the trisaccharide acceptor substrate (21Chiu C.P.

Similar kinetic behavior regarding acceptor binding was observed here, where the disaccharide acceptor shows 5-fold lower binding affinity compared with that of the trisaccharide.The superimposition of the acceptor-bound ternary complex of Cst-IIΔ32 coupled with the previous binary complex (Protein Data Bank code 1RO7) provides valuable insights into the catalytic mechanism of α-2,8-sialyl transfer catalyzed by Cst-II. The closure of the flexible lid protects the active site of the enzyme from bulk solvent, favoring electrostatic interactions in the complex and minimizing undesirable hydrolysis of the donor substrate. Our data show that the C-8 carbon of the acceptor sialic acid is ∼4 Å away from both the imidazole side chain of His-188 and the anomeric carbon (C-2) of the sialic acid moiety of the donor substrate. Furthermore, analysis of our structure indicates that the acceptor O-8 hydroxyl group is free to rotate even closer toward the His-188 side chain (∼3 Å). As such, His-188 is suitably located to deprotonate the O-8 hydroxyl group of the sialic acid moiety of the trisaccharide acceptor substrate. At the pH optimum of Cst-II activity, pH 8 (22Chan P.H. Lairson L.L. Lee H.J. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11220-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), His-188 is deprotonated, facilitating this general base role. The activated acceptor sugar in turn is localized for direct attack on the anomeric carbon (C-2) of the sialic acid of the donor substrate, generating the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state aided by interactions with Tyr-156 and Tyr-162 (Fig. 1D).Further features of the additional α-2,3-sialyl transfer of the bifunctional Cst-II can be rationally proposed by structural comparisons of the ternary complex we present here with the structure of Cst-I, a monofunctional α-2,3-sialyltransferase (34Chiu C.P. Lairson L.L. Gilbert M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7196-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These sialyltransferases share significant sequence and structural similarities (50% sequence identity, with a root mean square deviation of 0.77 Å on 235 C-α atoms) (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4A). In particular, essential residues in the acceptor binding site of the bifunctional Cst-II show high structural and sequence similarity to corresponding residues of the monofunctional Cst-I. For example, Asn-51, Ser-79, and Arg-129 residues in Cst-II are conserved in Cst-I as Asn-66, Ser-94, and Arg-144, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, Arg-144 is oriented ∼1.4 Å closer to the acceptor-binding site in the Cst-I structure as compared with its Cst-II Arg-129 counterpart, effectively creating a smaller active site pocket to accommodate its smaller disaccharide acceptor (Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc) (supplemental Fig. S4B). We suggest this arginine residue also plays a role to ensure the proper orientation of the disaccharide acceptor for the α-2,3-sialyl transfer reaction catalyzed by Cst-I and by analogy may play a similar role in acceptor site modulation in accommodating the smaller disaccharide acceptor in the α-2,3-sialyl transfer step of the bifunctional Cst-II. In Cst-I, the disaccharide acceptor can be further stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network involving Asn-66 and the carbonyl of Ser-94, and again by analogy via residues Asn-51 and Ser-79 in Cst-II. Conversely, in the trisaccharide acceptor complex of Cst-II, Tyr-81 specifically interacts with the N-acetamide group of the sialic acid moiety. The corresponding amino acid (Phe-96) of Cst-I is unable to form an analogous direct interaction with the acceptor substrate suggesting that this position is not critical to α-2,3-sialyl transfer in either Cst-I or by analogy, Cst-II.The electrostatic surface map of Cst-II clearly shows the charge complementarity between substrates and the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 6A). In the structure of bacterial LOS, the terminal oligosaccharide consists of a number of negatively charged sugar residues, including sialic acid. The positively charged cluster we observe near the identified acceptor-binding site of Cst-II highlights the potential of the enzyme in recognizing this negatively charged inner core oligosaccharide region of the LOS. Our structural analysis also suggests how the physiological tetrameric form of Cst-II (observed in our structures and in solution) binds to core oligosaccharides of membrane-localized C. jejuni LOS to allow access and transfer of sialic acid to specific acceptor saccharide units therein. The truncated C-terminal region of Cst-II is composed of 32 amino acids, which likely forms a membrane-spanning helix as predicted strongly by various sequence-based algorithms (56Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-W201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic C-terminal region acts as a membrane anchor to appropriately localize and orient the positively charged Cst-II acceptor sites (which all align on one face of the tetramer) to access the growing membrane-anchored lipo-oligosaccharide chains for the sialyl transfer reaction (Fig. 6B).Our structural and kinetic analysis of the ternary complex of sialyltransferase Cst-II with the donor analog and natural trisaccharide acceptor provides detailed acceptor binding features and further insights into the catalytic mechanism of this class of enzyme, thereby assisting the design of novel therapeutic agents to inhibit the sialylation of pathogenic bacteria. IntroductionSialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid or Neu5Ac) are a family of nine carbon keto sugars, which participate in various biologically important processes, including cellular recognition, microbial infection, and tumor metastasis (7Angata T.

Microbiology. 2007; 153: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In mammals, sialic acids typically exist as terminal residues on the outermost cell surface glycoconjugates (13Varki A.

For example, gangliosides located predominantly on vertebrate nerve cell surfaces are complex glycosphingolipids composed of oligosaccharide chains containing one or more terminal sialic acids (15Vyas A.A. Schnaar R.L. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sialic acids also have been found as terminal residues on the surface of a number of pathogenic bacteria and shown to play important roles during infection (11Sáez-Llorens X. McCracken Jr., G.H.

A recent study of the human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni revealed that a sialylated variant of this bacterium showed significantly higher invasion levels of epithelial cells compared with unsialylated versions (17Louwen R.

In addition, the carbohydrate mimicry between LOS outer core structures of C. jejuni and human gangliosides has been suggested to trigger the development of autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (5Endtz H.P.

Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). They are classified into several glycosyltransferase families in the CAZy data base, according to sequence similarities. Bacterial sialyltransferases are mainly categorized into four distinct families (GT-38, GT-42, GT-52, and GT-80) with polysialyltransferases located in GT-38.The GT-42 enzyme Cst-II from C. jejuni OH4384 is a bifunctional sialyltransferase, transferring sialic acid to the terminal galactose moiety of the lipo-oligosaccharide with an α-2,3-linkage and subsequently transferring another sialic acid to the initially formed sialoside with an α-2,8-linkage (20Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of Cst-II in complex with the inert donor analog CMP-3FNeu5Ac7 revealed a structure that was a significant variation of the GT-A fold (21Chiu C.P. Watts A.G.

Structural and mechanistic analyses of Cst-II supported a catalytic mechanism involving a conserved histidine residue as general base (His-188) that deprotonates the acceptor hydroxyl group during its attack on the anomeric carbon (C-2) of the donor substrate (CMP-Neu5Ac) (21Chiu C.P.

Although the previously reported structure of Cst-II provided valuable information on donor binding, the lack of structural information on the acceptor sugar binding mode has hampered our ability to understand the molecular basis of acceptor binding specificity. Likewise, a detailed kinetic characterization that encompasses the dual acceptor specificity of this important class of glycosyltransferase has not been performed.Here, we report the structure of Cst-II in complex with the donor analog, CMP, and the terminal trisaccharide of its natural acceptor, Neu5Ac-α-2,3-Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc, along with a detailed analysis of its kinetic mechanism. In addition, the roles of residues that bind to the sialic acid moiety of the acceptor are examined through structural and kinetic analyses of mutants. This work provides a mechanistic and structural basis for understanding acceptor binding during the LOS sialylation of C. jejuni and significantly improves our general understanding of the substrate specificity and mechanistic features of bacterial sialyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2047698679,"In recent years, Hsp90 is found to interact with several telomeric proteins at various phases of cell cycle. The Hsp90 chaperone system controls assembly and disassembly of telomere structures and thus maintains the dynamic state of telomere. Here, for the first time we report that the activity of another telomeric protein Sir2p is modulated by Hsp82, the ortholog of Hsp90 from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In a temperature sensitive Hsp90 deficient yeast strain (iG170Dhsp82), less abundant Sir2p is observed, resulting in de-repression of telomere silencing and a complete loss of mating type silencing. Intriguingly, over expression of Hsp90, either by exposing cells to heat shock or by introducing HSP82 overexpression plasmid also yields reduced level of Sir2p, with a consequential loss of telomere silencing. Thus, Hsp90 homeostasis maintains the cellular pool of Sir2p and thereby controls the reversible nature of telomere silencing. Interestingly, such regulation is independent of one of its major co-chaperones Sba1 (human ortholog of p23)."
https://openalex.org/W2081691266,"Activation of G protein-coupled receptors at the cell surface leads to the activation or inhibition of intracellular effector enzymes, which include various Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). RhoGEFs activate small molecular weight GTPases at the plasma membrane (PM). Many of the known G protein-coupled receptor-regulated RhoGEFs are found in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells, and PM recruitment is a critical aspect of their regulation. In contrast, p63RhoGEF, a Gαq-regulated RhoGEF, appears to be constitutively localized to the PM. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the localization of p63RhoGEF and the impact of its subcellular localization on its regulation by Gαq. Herein, we show that the pleckstrin homology domain of p63RhoGEF is not involved in its PM targeting. Instead, a conserved string of cysteines (Cys-23/25/26) at the N terminus of the enzyme is palmitoylated and required for membrane localization and full basal activity in cells. Conversion of these residues to serine relocates p63RhoGEF from the PM to the cytoplasm, diminishes its basal activity, and eliminates palmitoylation. The activity of palmitoylation-deficient p63RhoGEF can be rescued by targeting to the PM by fusion with tandem phospholipase C-δ1 pleckstrin homology domains or by co-expression with wild-type Gαq but not with palmitoylation-deficient Gαq. Our data suggest that p63RhoGEF is regulated chiefly through allosteric control by Gαq, as opposed to other known Gα-regulated RhoGEFs, which are instead sequestered in the cytoplasm, perhaps because of their high basal activity.

A second mechanism is to directly bind and allosterically activate the RhoGEFs. The relative contribution of these mechanisms to the regulation of Gα-regulated RhoGEFs in vivo is poorly understood. In resting cells, RH-RhoGEFs are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells and translocate to the PM upon activation of Gα12 or Gα13 subunits (19Meyer B.H. Freuler F. Guerini D.

This would be consistent with their high basal activity (23Jaiswal M. Gremer L. Dvorsky R. Haeusler L.C. Cirstea I.C. Uhlenbrock K. Ahmadian M.R. J. Biol.

Thus, it seems that p63RhoGEF and, by extension, the homologous domains in Trio and Duet are regulated by Gαq primarily through an allosteric mechanism that involves release of PH domain-mediated autoinhibition (25Shankaranarayanan A.

However, in cells, it is also possible that Gαq recruits p63RhoGEF to specific locales on the PM (26Crouthamel M. Abankwa D. Zhang L. DiLizio C. Manning D.R. Hancock J.F. Wedegaertner P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or repositions the RhoGEF at the membrane so that it can more productively interact with its substrate RhoA. Herein we demonstrate that p63RhoGEF is anchored to the PM via palmitoylation at a cluster of conserved cysteines at the N terminus of the protein. Disruption of these palmitoylation sites not only redistributes p63RhoGEF to the cytoplasm but also greatly reduces its basal activity in cells. Targeting palmitoylation-defective mutants of p63RhoGEF to the PM by fusion with PLC-δ1 PH domains restores their basal activity. We show that wild-type Gαq, but not its palmitoylation-deficient (palm−) C9S/C10S mutant, can recruit palm− p63RhoGEF to the PM. Palm− Gαq is unable to activate p63RhoGEF in cells, indicating that Gαq must be targeted to the cell membrane to promote full activation of p63RhoGEF. Because wild-type Gαq can achieve levels of activation comparable with deletion of the p63RhoGEF PH domain, even in the case of palm− p63RhoGEF, the chief mechanism regulating p63RhoGEF activity seems to be allosteric and probably does not involve localization to specific locales on the membrane surface or reorientation of p63RhoGEF for more optimal interactions with RhoA. The cloning of p63RhoGEF into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was described previously (25Shankaranarayanan A. Boguth C.A. Lutz S. Vettel C. Uhlemann F. Aittaleb M. Wieland T. Tesmer J.J. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Vectors encoding all p63RhoGEF truncations were constructed by cloning the corresponding PCR fragment into pEGFP-C1 using the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. The truncations correspond to residues 149–580 (ΔN), 1–492 (ΔC), 1–338/492–580 (ΔPH), 1–338 (ΔPH/C), 149–492 (DH/PH), 149–338 (DH), and N-terminal fragments corresponding to residues 1–148, 1–114, and 1–75. Cys to Ser mutations were introduced using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) and EGFP-p63RhoGEF as the template. For constructs of p63RhoGEF C-terminally fused to EGFP, we cloned PCR fragments into the pEGFP-N3 plasmid (Clontech) using the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. The construction of EGFP-p63RhoGEF-2xPLCδ1PH was described previously (25Shankaranarayanan A. Boguth C.A. Lutz S. Vettel C. Uhlemann F. Aittaleb M. Wieland T. Tesmer J.J. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this plasmid was used as template to create Cys to Ser mutations. For detection of palmitoylation, we used N-terminal c-Myc-tagged p63RhoGEF cloned into the pCMV-Tag3B plasmid (13Lutz S. Shankaranarayanan A. Coco C. Ridilla M. Nance M.R. Vettel C. Baltus D. Evelyn C.R. Neubig R.R. Wieland T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2007; 318: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and created Cys to Ser mutants in this construct. Wild-type pCMV-Gαq, a gift from Dr. T. Kozasa (University of Illinois), was used as template to create the Gαq-C9S/C10S double mutant, and these two constructs were used as templates to generate wild-type and C9S/C10S Gαq fragments, respectively, for cloning into mRFP-C1 (Clontech). SRE.L firefly luciferase and pRL-thymidine kinase Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids were described previously (27Aittaleb M. Gao G. Evelyn C.R. Neubig R.R. Tesmer J.J. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were then switched to antibiotic-free medium before transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter assay was conducted using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In this assay, HEK293 cells were seeded into 96-well plates 24 h before transfection. In antibiotic-free medium, cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids (EGFP fusion constructs), pSRE.L, pRL-TK, and EGFP (to adjust total DNA amount to 240 ng/well). One day after transfection, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with freshly diluted 1× Lysis Buffer (Promega). Lysed cells were transferred to a white polystyrene 96-well reading plate (Corning Costar) and assayed for luciferase activity. Luminescence was read on a Victor plate reader with dual injectors (PerkinElmer). Firefly activities were measured in triplicate for each transfection mix and then normalized to Renilla activities, and the results are reported as -fold activation over the basal level, corresponding to the activity of the empty EGFP vector. HEK293 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-precoated coverslips in 12-well plates. After attachment, cells were transfected with 250 ng/well of the indicated plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For localization studies in HEK293T, coverslips were directly mounted on glass slides using Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using an Olympus FluoView 500 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America, Inc.) with a ×60 oil immersion objective (Nikon, Japan) and processed with Adobe Photoshop. After transfection of HEK293 cells on coverslips, the medium was switched to fresh medium supplemented with 100 μm 2BP (Sigma) and incubated for at least 12 h. Treated HEK293 cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before analysis by confocal microscopy. HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type or C23S/C25S/C26S p63RhoGEF using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 42 h. Cells were then incubated in fresh medium supplemented with 100 μm 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) or palmitic acid (PA) for 6 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (3 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (ABM) and Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 4 h. The resins were washed three times with lysis buffer and suspended in 94 μl of PBS and 6 μl of freshly premixed click chemistry reagent (final 10 μm Alexa Fluor® 488-azide (Invitrogen), 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 100 μm tris-(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine, and 1 mm CuSO4) (28Martin B.R. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 29Charron G. Zhang M.M. Yount J.S. Wilson J. Raghavan A.S. Shamir E. Hang H.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the resins were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and treated with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Alexa488-labeled proteins were detected by in-gel fluorescence. SRE.L luciferase activities are representative of at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, and are presented as mean ± S.D. Data are compared by two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-tests, using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). To identify the region responsible for targeting p63RhoGEF to the PM (Fig. 2A), we designed a series of truncation and deletion mutants with an N-terminal EGFP fusion (Fig. 1) and examined their subcellular localization by confocal microscopy. Although PH domains are widely recognized for their ability to interact with phospholipid headgroups (30Lemmon M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 31Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), deletion of the PH domain did not disrupt PM localization of p63RhoGEF (Fig. 2B). Because the EGFP-p63RhoGEF DH/PH truncation (residues 149–492) was cytoplasmic (Fig. 2C), we individually deleted the N- and C-terminal extensions of the DH/PH tandem domains. Deletion of the N-terminal region (residues 1–148) clearly redistributed p63RhoGEF from the PM to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D), whereas deletion of the C-terminal region (residues 493–580) had no effect (Fig. 2E). The N-terminal region (residues 1–148) was able to localize the DH domain (residues 149–338) to the PM (Fig. 2F), which on its own was cytoplasmic (Fig. 2G) and also targeted EGFP to the PM (Fig. 2H). Together these data show that the N-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for PM targeting of p63RhoGEF. Next, we determined if there is a correlation between the subcellular localization of p63RhoGEF and its activity in cells (Fig. 2I). Both ΔN and DH/PH, which localized to the cytoplasm, lost most of their ability to activate RhoA in cells. Likewise, the basal activity of the cytoplasmic DH domain was less than that of the full-length enzyme and either ΔPH or ΔPH/C, despite the loss of the autoinhibitory PH domain. In contrast, PM-localized ΔC retained wild-type basal activity, and PM-localized ΔPH and ΔPH/C had the highest activity of all, consistent with loss of the PH domain. Thus, there are motifs within the N-terminal region that are responsible for PM localization and enhance basal activity in cells.FIGURE 1Schematic representation of EGFP-p63RhoGEF variants used to test subcellular localization of p63RhoGEF and its ability to activate RhoA in HEK293 cells. p63RhoGEF is composed of central tandem DH and PH domains, bracketed by N-terminal (N-ter) and C-terminal (C-ter) extensions with relatively low sequence complexity. The DH domain is the catalytic center of the enzyme and represents the primary RhoA binding site, whereas the PH domain is the primary binding site of Gαq. For visualization with confocal microscopy, EGFP was fused to the N terminus of each p63RhoGEF variant (shown only for wild-type p63RhoGEF).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The most obvious conserved feature in the N-terminal region is an unusual hydrophobic 121LTLLTTLL128 cluster (Fig. 3A). For many proteins, di-Leu-based motifs are known to play a role in trafficking and PM targeting (32Carrel D. Hamon M. Darmon M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4276-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Steenhuis P. Herder S. Gelis S. Braulke T. Storch S. Traffic. 2010; 11: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, deletion of this motif in p63RhoGEF did not perturb PM localization (Fig. 3B) or RhoGEF activity in cells (Fig. 3C). Because there were no other regions of strong sequence conservation among p63RhoGEF family members, we made additional N-terminal truncations of p63RhoGEF to further delimit the region(s) responsible for membrane targeting. Deletion of either the first 114 or the first 75 amino acids also resulted in loss of both PM localization and basal GEF activity (data not shown). These results indicate that the determinants for PM targeting reside within the first 75 amino acids of p63RhoGEF. At the N terminus of p63RhoGEF, there are two Cys strings (Cys-10/12 and Cys-23/25/26) that are highly conserved in p63RhoGEF orthologs from most higher eukaryotes but not in Trio or Duet (Fig. 4A). Because these residues are candidates for palmitoylation, we mutated either Cys string to serine residues. The C10S/C12S double mutant had no detectable effect on PM localization as measured by confocal microscopy. However, the C23S/C25S/C26S triple mutant was cytoplasmic (Fig. 4B), indicating that the second Cys string is the primary determinant of PM targeting. Elimination of both Cys strings (C10S/C12S/C23S/C25S/C26S) also relocated EGFP-p63RhoGEF to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, the basal activities of C23S/C25S/C26S and C10S/C12S/C23S/C25S/C26S were significantly decreased (***, p < 0.001), whereas the C10S/C12S mutant had only slightly reduced activity (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the data obtained for the N-terminal EGFP fusions, C-terminal EGFP fusions of wild-type and C10S/C12S retained their PM association and basal activity, whereas the C23S/C25S/C26S mutant relocated to the cytoplasm and showed abolished basal activity (data not shown). Therefore, placement of the EGFP fusion does not affect PM localization or activity. To identify which individual Cys residues were most important for membrane targeting, we examined the localization of the C23S, C23S/C25S, C25S, and C26S mutants of EGFP-p63RhoGEF with confocal microscopy. The C23S, C25S/C26S, and C26S mutations disrupted PM association of EGFP-p63RhoGEF, whereas C25S disrupted PM localization of ∼40% of transfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that all of the cysteine residues in the second Cys string contribute to PM localization of EGFP-p63RhoGEF but that Cys-23 and Cys-26 are the most dominant. To test if palmitoylation contributes to PM targeting of p63RhoGEF, we treated HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type p63RhoGEF with 2BP, a commonly used inhibitor of palmitoylation (36Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of palmitoylation in promoting recruitment to the PM, p63RhoGEF partially redistributed to the cytoplasm in 2BP-treated cells (Fig. 4D). We therefore hypothesized that palmitoylation of the Cys-23/25/26 string is responsible for PM localization and that this localization is important for p63RhoGEF basal activity. To unambiguously confirm that p63RhoGEF is palmitoylated, we performed a cell-based palmitoylation assay by testing the ability of p63RhoGEF to incorporate the PA analog 17-ODYA, which can be detected using “click chemistry” on immunoprecipitated protein (28Martin B.R. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Click chemistry is an efficient and selective Cu2+-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne group, in this case in 17-ODYA, and an azide, in this case in Alexa Fluor® 488-azide (28Martin B.R. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 29Charron G. Zhang M.M. Yount J.S. Wilson J. Raghavan A.S. Shamir E. Hang H.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As opposed to its analog 17-ODYA, PA cannot be modified and is therefore not detectable via in-gel fluorescence of Alexa Fluor® 488. Similar to their equivalent EGFP fusions (Fig. 4C), wild-type Myc-p63RhoGEF, but not the C23S/C25S/C26S mutant, was able to activate RhoA in cells (data not shown). Both wild-type and C23S/C25S/C26S Myc-p63RhoGEF were similarly expressed (Fig. 5A, top), and both could be immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 5A, middle). Wild-type but not C23S/C25S/C26S Myc-p63RhoGEF could be modified with 17-ODYA, as visualized by in-gel fluorescence of samples resolved on an SDS denaturing gel (Fig. 5A, bottom). Labeling with Alexa Fluor® 488 was dependent on the addition of 17-ODYA but not of PA, which cannot be modified via click chemistry. Consistent with thioester linkage of 17-ODYA to Cys residues, pretreatment of the gel with 1 m hydroxylamine resulted in loss of fluorescence from wild-type Myc-p63RhoGEF. In contrast, pretreatment of the gel with 1 m Tris did not prevent detection of 17-ODYA incorporated into wild-type Myc-p63RhoGEF (Fig. 5B). The fact that 17-ODYA incorporation was completely eliminated in the C23S/C25S/C26S mutant (Fig. 5A, bottom) also indicates that the Cys-10/12 string does not represent a significant palmitoylation site, consistent with PM localization of p63RhoGEF-C10S/C12S (Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that p63RhoGEF is palmitoylated in cells at Cys-23, Cys-25, and/or Cys-26, and that modification with palmitate is responsible for its PM association. To determine whether loss of the ability to activate RhoA by C23S/C25S/C26S (palm−) p63RhoGEF is due to disruption of PM association or to loss of palmitoylation, we targeted palm− p63RhoGEF to the PM by fusion with two tandem PH domains of PLCδ1 and analyzed its subcellular localization and GEF activity. Our data show that this fusion was recruited to the PM (Fig. 6A) and that this recruitment partially rescued the activity of palm− p63RhoGEF (Fig. 6B). As expected, wild-type p63RhoGEF, which was already localized to the PM, did not show significant differences in activity upon fusion with the two tandem PH domains of PLCδ1 (2xPH) (Fig. 6B). Thus, PM targeting is sufficient for the observed basal activity of exogenously expressed p63RhoGEF in cells, and the loss of activity in palm− p63RhoGEF is due to the loss of PM association and not explicitly to the loss of palmitoylation. We next tested if the ability of p63RhoGEF to be activated by Gαq is affected by palmitoylation. Gαq binds to the PH domain of p63RhoGEF and relieves its autoinhibition in vitro (13Lutz S. Shankaranarayanan A. Coco C. Ridilla M. Nance M.R. Vettel C. Baltus D. Evelyn C.R. Neubig R.R. Wieland T. Tesmer J.J.

Signal. 2010; 22: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Gαq itself is targeted to the PM via palmitoylation at Cys-9 and Cys-10, and mutation of these residues to Ser relocates Gαq-GFP to the cytoplasm (37Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 265: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 38Hughes T.E. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol.

Thus, exogenous expression of Gαq should be able to recruit the palm− mutant of p63RhoGEF to the PM and potentially rescue activity. Indeed, palm− EGFP-p63RhoGEF was partially recruited to the PM when co-expressed with wild-type mRFP-Gαq in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7A, top panels) but retained its cytoplasmic distribution when co-expressed with palm− mRFP-Gαq (Fig. 7A, middle panels), confirming that palmitoylation of"

Although the regulation of antizyme (Az) synthesis by polyamines and the ability of Az to regulate cellular polyamine levels suggest the centrality of polyamine metabolism to its antiproliferative function, recent studies have suggested that antizymes might also regulate cell proliferation by targeting to degradation proteins that do not belong to the cellular polyamine metabolic pathway. Using a co-degradation assay, we show here that, although they efficiently stimulated the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), Az1 and Az2 did not affect or had a negligible effect on the degradation of cyclin D1, Aurora-A, and a p73 variant lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain whose degradation was reported recently to be stimulated by Az1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, although Az1 and Az2 could not be constitutively expressed in transfected cells, they could be stably expressed in cells that express trypanosome ODC, a form of ODC that does not bind Az and therefore maintains a constant level of cellular polyamines. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that Az1 and Az2 affect cell proliferation and viability solely by modulating cellular polyamine metabolism."

Calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 are critical components of protein quality control responsible for proper folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Here, using confocal microscopy, we show that cell surface targeting of P0 and PMP22 is not affected in the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones. However, the folding and function (adhesiveness) of PMP22 and P0, measured using the adhesion assay, are affected significantly in the absence of calnexin but not in the absence of calreticulin. Deficiency in oxidoreductase ERp57 results in impaired folding and function of P0, a disulfide bond-containing protein, but does not have any effect on folding or function of PMP22 (a protein that does not contain a disulfide bond). We concluded that calnexin and ERp57, but not calreticulin, play an important role in the biology of peripheral myelin proteins PMP22 and P0, and, consequently, these chaperones may contribute to the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies and the diversity of these neurological disorders."

The present study describes the unexpectedly strong activity of 11β against the AR-negative HeLa cells, both in cell culture and tumor xenografts, and uncovers a new mechanism of action that likely explains this activity. Cellular fractionation experiments indicated that mitochondria are the major intracellular sink for 11β; flow cytometry studies showed that 11β exposure rapidly induced oxidative stress, mitochondria being an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, 11β inhibited oxygen consumption both in intact HeLa cells and in isolated mitochondria. Specifically, 11β blocked uncoupled oxygen consumption when mitochondria were incubated with complex I substrates, but it had no effect on oxygen consumption driven by substrates acting downstream of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Moreover, 11β enhanced ROS generation in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that complex I inhibition is responsible for ROS production. At the cellular level, the presence of antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine or vitamin E) significantly reduced the toxicity of 11β, implicating ROS production as an important contributor to cytotoxicity. Collectively, our findings establish complex I inhibition and ROS generation as a new mechanism of action for 11β, which supplements conventional DNA adduct formation to promote cancer cell death.

Cellular fractionation experiments indicated that mitochondria are the major intracellular sink for 11β; flow cytometry studies showed that 11β exposure rapidly induced oxidative stress, mitochondria being an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, 11β inhibited oxygen consumption both in intact HeLa cells and in isolated mitochondria. Specifically, 11β blocked uncoupled oxygen consumption when mitochondria were incubated with complex I substrates, but it had no effect on oxygen consumption driven by substrates acting downstream of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Moreover, 11β enhanced ROS generation in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that complex I inhibition is responsible for ROS production. At the cellular level, the presence of antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine or vitamin E) significantly reduced the toxicity of 11β, implicating ROS production as an important contributor to cytotoxicity. Collectively, our findings establish complex I inhibition and ROS generation as a new mechanism of action for 11β, which supplements conventional DNA adduct formation to promote cancer cell death. Adaptive responses to hypoxia and oxidative stress allow tumor cells to exist and grow under adverse conditions and to acquire therapeutic resistance, contributing to the failure of chemotherapy for prostate and other cancers (1Ruan K. Song G. Ouyang G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 107: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Strategies to overcome resistance include development of agents with multiple cytotoxic mechanisms; such strategies could include a primary toxicity mechanism (e.g. DNA damage) that is complemented by a secondary stressor, such as the intentional generation of oxidative stress or the inhibition of natural antioxidant enzymes (2Ozben T. J. Pharm. Sci. 2007; 96: 2181-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In fact, many clinically useful drugs have more than one mechanism of toxicity.

The small molecule anticancer agent 11β (see Fig. 1A) was designed to kill androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cells by targeting both DNA replication (via its aniline mustard moiety, which forms DNA adducts) and the expression of steroid-responsive genes (via its steroid ligand). The structure of 11β features the DNA-reactive p-N,N-bis-(2-chloroethly)aminophenyl group linked to an estradien-3-one ligand (see Fig. 1A), which has a high affinity for the AR (7Marquis J.C.

It was originally proposed that the DNA adducts formed by 11β could bind the AR and potentially disrupt tumor cell biology by two nonmutually exclusive mechanisms: (i) antagonism of AR-regulated gene expression and (ii) obstruction of the DNA repair process. Recent studies demonstrate that 11β induces apoptosis in AR+ prostate cancer cells, is stable in vivo, and effectively prevents the growth of AR+ LNCaP tumors as xenografts in mice (7Marquis J.C.

Although very effective against AR+ cells and tumors, 11β has surprisingly potent activity against AR− cells and tumors, leading to reconsideration of the role of the AR in the process leading to cell death. The present study is the result of the search for AR-independent mechanisms of 11β toxicity. Previous studies (7Marquis J.C. Hillier S.M. Dinaut A.N. Rodrigues D. Mitra K. Essigmann J.M. Croy R.G. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 779-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) revealed that 11β induces apoptosis at lower exposure levels and much more rapidly than DNA-damaging aniline mustard drugs such as chlorambucil (see Fig. 1A), which contains the same alkylating group. Within 6 h of treatment with >5 μm 11β, LNCaP cells undergo cytoplasmic contraction and detachment from the culture dish, whereas treatment with similar or even higher concentrations of chlorambucil has little effect on cell morphology and does not induce apoptosis (7Marquis J.C.

In addition, 11β-dim, a DNA-unreactive analog of 11β (see Fig. 1A), produces similar morphological changes but does not induce apoptosis in the same concentration range (7Marquis J.C. Hillier S.M. Dinaut A.N. Rodrigues D. Mitra K. Essigmann J.M. Croy R.G. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 779-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), further suggesting the possibility of additional mechanisms of cytotoxicity. The current study demonstrated that 11β potently induced apoptosis in AR-negative HeLa cells both in vitro and when grown as xenograft tumors in mice. Furthermore, both 11β and its analog, 11β-dim generated a burst of intracellular ROS, whereas in the same dose ranges, chlorambucil or the steroid moiety of 11β alone (estradien-3-one) did not. The functional role of ROS was evidenced by co-treatment with antioxidants, which reduced ROS formation and suppressed the cytotoxicity of both 11β and 11β-dim. Additional experiments indicated that mitochondria were the main intracellular sink for 11β and an important source of the ROS, which were produced due to the specific inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Together, these findings established ROS production and complex I inhibition as new, DNA adduct-independent mechanisms of 11β that supplemented the ability of the compound to kill tumor cells by covalent DNA damage. The data also suggested that 11β could be active against a wide range of tumors, including those that do not express the AR and added support to the growing body of evidence that oxidative stress may synergize with conventional DNA adducts to promote cancer cell death. The compounds 11β and 11β-dim were synthesized as previously reported (7Marquis J.C. Hillier S.M. Dinaut A.N. Rodrigues D. Mitra K. Essigmann J.M. Croy R.G. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 779-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). [14C]11β was prepared as described in Ref. 8Hillier S.M. Marquis J.C. Zayas B. Wishnok J.S. Liberman R.G.

Stock solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and stored at −80 °C. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. 17β-Hydroxy-estra-4(5),9(10)dien-3-one (estradien-3-one) was obtained from Brighton Co., Chang Sha, Hunan, China. CM-H2DCFDA, CM-DCFDA, MitoSOX, and JC-1 molecular dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes. All cell media, media supplements, PBS and HBSS were from Invitrogen. CellTiter-Blue (CTB) reagent was purchased from Promega. HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 1 mm GlutaMAX, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), in a humidified 5% CO2/air atmosphere at 37 °C. Clonogenic survival assays were performed by seeding 1 × 103 HeLa cells/well in 6-well plates, followed by growth for 24 h to allow cell attachment. Test compounds dissolved in DMSO were added to growth medium for 24 h, replaced with fresh medium, and growth was continued for 3–5 days until colonies were clearly visible. Colonies were fixed with water:methanol:acetic acid (4:5:1), stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and counted manually. The surviving fraction was calculated as the ratio of the number of colonies in treated wells to the number in untreated wells. Cell viability was estimated using the CTB assay as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.5 × 103 cells/well were seeded in black/clear-bottom 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and incubated for 24 h. Medium was then replaced with fresh drug-containing medium for the indicated times. CTB reagent was then added for 2–4 h after which fluorescence (ex/em: 555/585 nm) was measured. Cell viability was calculated as the ratio between the average background corrected signal in the treated wells and the untreated control wells. Whole cell extracts of HeLa cells were prepared by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay solution (RIPA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies anti-caspase-3 (9665), anti-caspase-9 (9502), anti-PARP (9542), and secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (7074). All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Detection of antibody complexes was achieved by PicoWest chemoluminescence reagent (Pierce). Intracellular ROS levels were measured with fluorometric dyes. 1 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. After the cells were exposed to test compounds for the indicated times, and the cells were washed with PBS and exposed to a molecular probe solution in HBSS at 37 °C. The molecular probes and their final concentrations were: CM-H2DCFDA (2.5 μm), CM-DCFDA (2.5 μm), and MitoSOX (2 μm). After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed, trypsinized, resuspended in HBSS, and analyzed on the FL1 channel (CM-H2DCFDA, CM-DCFDA) or the FL2 channel (MitoSOX) of a Becton Dickinson FACSCanto II flow cytometer. The results were analyzed with FACSDiva 6.0 software (BD Biosciences). Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm) was estimated using the mitochondria-specific dye JC-1 according to a published flow cytometry protocol (9Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, cells were incubated at 37 °C with a solution of JC-1 in medium without phenol red for 30 min, then trypsinized, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer. The mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated by the ratio between the red (FL2) and green (FL1) fluorescence. The results were analyzed with FACSDiva 6.0 software (BD Biosciences). Cellular levels of H2O2 were measured using the Quantichrom Peroxide Assay (Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipid peroxidation was monitored using the OxiSelect TBARS assay (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular NADPH content was measured using the EnzyChrom NADP/NADPH assay (BioAssay Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all assays, the results were normalized for protein content, determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips, in 6-well plates. The seeding and treatment with test compounds were performed identically to the viability assay. After treatment, the cells were stained for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 μm MitoSOX and 5 μm Hoechst 33342 in HBSS, washed three times in fresh HBSS, and imaged with a Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope. The protocol was adapted from Ref. 10Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar with modifications. All steps were performed at 4 °C. 3 × 107 HeLa cells were detached by scraping, washed in cold PBS, and resuspended in 3 ml of isolation buffer (buffer IB: 10 mm Tris-MOPS, 1 mm EGTA-Tris, 200 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). The cells were disrupted with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer, on ice (30 strokes). The homogenate was sedimented at 800 × g for 10 min to yield a nuclear pellet. The supernatant was further sedimented at 8000 × g for 10 min to yield the mitochondrial pellet. Finally, the postmitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g (Beckmann Ultracentrifuge) for 1 h to separate the microsomal fraction (pellet) from the cytosol (supernatant). For oxygen consumption studies, rat liver mitochondria were isolated using a similar protocol (10Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Mitochondria isolated from fresh rat liver were kept on ice and used the same day. Total mitochondrial protein was determined by hydrolyzing mitochondrial aliquots in 0.5 m NaOH and then using the Bradford method. To determine the cellular distribution of 11β, HeLa cells were treated with [14C]11β for 6 h, then subjected to fractionation. Aliquots of each fraction were suspended in scintillation fluid (EcoScint H), and radioactivity was measured using a Beckmann LS 6500 scintillation counter. Oxygen consumption was measured with a PreSens Fibox 3 (Precision Sensing, Regensburg, Germany) oxygen minisensor, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All measurements were done at room temperature. For cellular oxygen consumptions, HeLa cells were washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in cell culture medium at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured as described (10Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) using the substrates for complex I (5 mm glutamate/2.5 mm malate) complex II (5 mm succinate) or cytochrome c/complex IV (6 mm ascorbate/300 μm TMPD). Mitochondria were suspended in experimental buffer (buffer EB: 12.5 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, 0.1 mm EGTA-Tris, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), at a concentration of 2 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. To measure NADH-driven oxygen consumption, mitochondria were permeabilized to NADH using three freeze-thaw cycles. Rat liver mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml protein concentration) were incubated at 37 °C in EB, supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 5 mm glutamate, 2.5 mm malate, 0.05 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and 10 μm Amplex Red reagent, in the presence of DMSO (control) or test compound, with or without 2000 units/ml bovine liver catalase (Roche Applied Science). After 20 min in the dark, the fluorescence of the resorufin generated by Amplex Red was monitored for 20 min in a SpectraMax M3 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The amount of H2O2 generated was calculated from a H2O2 standard curve obtained in similar conditions. Complex I activity was measured by using the synthetic electron acceptor decylubiquinone (Sigma) and monitoring the rate of NADH disappearance (11Estornell E. Fato R. Pallotti F. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria were permeabilized to NADH with three freeze-thaw cycles, diluted to 0.25 mg/ml (total mitochondrial protein) in potassium phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.4) and supplemented with 0.35% BSA, 1 μm antimycin, 1 mm KCN, and 70 μm decylubiquinone. NADH (0.1 mm) and the test compound (or DMSO control) were added last. After a brief and thorough mixing, the drop in the absorbance difference A340–A380 was monitored in a quartz cuvette on a Beckmann Coulter DU730 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Complex I activity was then calculated using ϵNADH for A340–A380 as 5.5 mm−1 cm−1 (11Estornell E. Fato R. Pallotti F. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (6 × 106) suspended in 50% PBS/50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of 6-week-old NIH Swiss nu/nu female mice. Mice developing subcutaneous tumors within 2 weeks were randomized to treatment and control groups. Administration of test compound dissolved in cremophore EL, saline, ethanol (43:30:27) was begun when established tumors reached ∼7-mm diameter. Tumor measurements were obtained with vernier calipers and tumor volumes estimated using the formula (width2 × length × 3.14)/6. Experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the MIT Animal Care Committee. All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. (error bars). The significance of the difference between two populations was calculated using Student's two-tailed t test for unpaired data sets with unequal variances. p values <0.05 were considered significant. The LC50 and EC50 values were calculated from the dose-response curves by using a four variable logistic curve fitting function in Prism 3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Our investigations sought to uncover mechanisms of toxicity that were unrelated to the affinity of 11β for the AR. HeLa cells, which do not express the AR (12Nelson-Rees W.A. Hunter L. Darlington G.J. O'Brien S.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1980; 27: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were chosen to assess the respective contributions of the steroid and alkylating portions of the compound (Fig. 1). Chlorambucil was used as a model of the reactive alkylating portion of 11β because both molecules share the p-N, N-bis-(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl group that can form a reactive aziridine capable of covalent modification of DNA and other cellular molecules. To investigate the noncovalent interactions of 11β, an analog, 11β-dim (Fig. 1A) was prepared. This compound was unreactive toward the model nucleophile 4-(4-nitro-benzyl)-pyridine (supplemental data and Fig. S1), indicating that it lacked the ability to modify DNA covalently. It was thus expected that any observed 11β-dim toxicity would arise only from noncovalent interactions with cellular targets. Cell viability analysis, performed using the CTB assay (Fig. 1B), revealed a steep dose response to concentrations of 11β > 5 μm, and a similar steep response was observed at higher concentrations (>12 μm) with 11β-dim. By contrast, neither chlorambucil nor estradiene-3-one at 20 μm decreased the CTB signal by >25% (Fig. 1B). Both 11β and 11β-dim exhibited a threshold effect above which cell viability rapidly decreased; such an effect was not observed with either chlorambucil or estradiene-3-one. Given the striking decrease in viability that was observed after a 24-h treatment with 11β, it was of interest to determine the effect of shorter exposure times on cell viability. HeLa cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 11β for 3, 6, or 24 h, and cell viability was measured at 24 h. Comparable toxicities were achieved for 6- or 24-h exposures to 11β (6 h, EC50 = 5.3 ± 0.3 μm; 24 h, EC50 = 4.9 ± 0.3 μm), whereas a 3-h exposure period resulted in lower levels of toxicity (Fig. 1C). Together, these data suggested that a 6-h exposure was sufficient for achieving maximum toxicity of 11β for most doses. Therefore, subsequent mechanistic experiments focused on cellular changes that occur during the initial 6 h. Activation of apoptotic pathways by 11β was observed previously in LNCaP cells (7Marquis J.C. Hillier S.M. Dinaut A.N. Rodrigues D. Mitra K. Essigmann J.M. Croy R.G. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 779-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis was also the mechanism of cell death in HeLa cells, the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP were investigated. Western blot analysis with corresponding antibodies revealed that a 6-h treatment with 7.5 μm or 10 μm 11β induced cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP (Fig. 1D). To understand better the putative targets of 11β, an intracellular localization study was performed. HeLa cells were treated with 5 μm 14C-labeled 11β for 6 h, isolated, and subjected to subcellular fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”). By measuring the radioactivity associated with the medium and the cell pellet, it was found that a significant portion of the total compound (>30%) becomes associated with the cells in 6 h (Fig. 2A). Subcellular fractionation revealed that 50 ± 2% of the radioactive compound is found in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas the rest is distributed among the nucleus, microsomes, and cytosol (Fig. 2B). The radioactivity measurements also allowed the estimation of the local concentration of 11β (Fig. 2C), the compound being most concentrated in the mitochondria (9.9 ± 0.4 pmol/μg protein) and the microsomes (8.5 ± 0.5 pmol/μg protein). By assuming the volume of a HeLa cell of 4.2 pl (measured average diameter = 20 μm), the molar concentration of 11β in the cell after 6 h was estimated to be ∼300 μm, a 60-fold increase from the 5 μm concentration in the medium. Moreover, using the published value for the mitochondrial volume of 1.6 μl/mg mitochondrial protein (13Petronilli V. Pietrobon D. Zoratti M. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the molar concentration of 11β in the mitochondria was estimated to be ∼6 mm, which is more than 1000-fold increase from the medium concentration of 11β. These findings suggest that mitochondria might be one of the targets of the compound. The observation that the DNA-unreactive 11β-dim is nevertheless toxic (Fig. 1B) indicated that 11β may be employing several mechanisms of toxicity. Given the rapid activation of the apoptotic pathway (Fig. 1C) and the mitochondrial localization of 11β (Fig. 2B), we hypothesized that one such mechanism may involve direct mitochondrial toxicity. One of the hallmarks of mitochondrial dysregulation is the generation of ROS and oxidative stress (14Ott M. Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 15Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6170) Google Scholar). Generation of ROS in HeLa cells was monitored using the molecular probe CM-H2DCFDA, which can detect most ROS at a cellular level (16Jakubowski W. Bartosz G. Cell Biol. Int. 2000; 24: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Once inside a cell, this probe is deacetylated by cellular esterases, and, when oxidized, it becomes the fluorescent compound CM-DCF, which can be detected in the FL1 channel of a flow cytometer. Fig. 3A is a fluorescence histogram showing that treatment of HeLa cells for 6 h with 3 or 5 μm 11β resulted in a notable increase in CM-DCF fluorescence intensity (right shift) compared with DMSO (vehicle)-treated cells. The possibility that increased fluorescence was due to increased uptake of the probe was ruled out by use of a related molecular probe, CM-DCFDA, which does not require oxidation to become fluorescent. When using CM-DCFDA, no significant increase in CM-DCF fluorescence was detected in the treated cells compared with controls, indicating that cellular uptake of the dye was unaffected by 11β. These findings together established that 11β treatment triggered a significant production of ROS. To determine whether the production of ROS required the ability of 11β to modify cellular molecules covalently, ROS levels were compared between cells treated for 6 h with 11β (5 μm), 11β-dim (10 μm), chlorambucil (10 μm), or estradien-3-one (10 μm) (Fig. 3B); antimycin A, a known ROS inducer, was included as a comparative control. The data revealed that both 11β compounds were potent inducers of ROS, whereas chlorambucil and estradien-3-one were not. Several other doses of each compound were investigated, revealing a dose-response dependence for 11β and 11β-dim (supplemental data and Fig. S2). Thus, neither the ability to form covalent adducts (characteristic of 11β and chlorambucil) nor the presence of the steroid group (11β, 11β-dim, and estradien-3-one) correlates with the ability to induce ROS. The operative structural feature responsible for the ROS induction appears to be the entire molecular framework of 11β or 11β-dim. To investigate the kinetics of intracellular ROS generation, a time course of ROS levels was measured in HeLa cells treated with 5 μm 11β. Increased levels of ROS were detected as early as 30 min after the addition of 11β to culture media, and then the levels continued to increase in the first 6 h of exposure (Fig. 3C), suggesting that 11β caused both rapid-onset and sustained ROS generation. Several markers of oxidative stress in 11β-treated cells were also increased, including levels of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3D) and the secondary oxidation product, malondialdehyde (Fig. 3E). Additionally, the cellular levels of NADPH, the principal cellular reducing co-factor, decreased rapidly during the same time interval (Fig. 3F). These findings are consistent with the rapid formation of ROS in HeLa cells exposed to 11β, suggesting that ROS and generalized oxidative stress may contribute to 11β cytotoxicity. To establish a link between ROS production and the toxicity of 11β, HeLa cells were treated with 11β in the presence of antioxidants. A significantly lower level of ROS (p < 0.01) was observed when HeLa cells were exposed to 5 μm 11β for 6 h in the presence of antioxidants N-acetyl-"
https://openalex.org/W2062804795,"Maturation of dendritic cells (DC) is characterized by expression of CD83, a surface protein that appears to be necessary for the effective activation of naïve T-cells and T-helper cells by DC. Lately it was shown that CD83 expression is regulated on the posttranscriptional level by interaction of the shuttle protein HuR with a novel posttranscriptional regulatory RNA element (PRE), which is located in the coding region of the CD83 transcript. Interestingly, this interaction commits the CD83 mRNA to efficient nuclear export via the CRM1 pathway. To date, however, the structural basis of this interaction, which potentially involves three distinct RNA recognition motifs (RRM1–3) in HuR and a complex three-pronged RNA stem-loop element in CD83 mRNA, has not been investigated in detail. In the present work we analyzed this interaction in vitro and in vivo using various HuR- and CD83 mRNA mutants. We are able to demonstrate that both, RRM1 and RRM2 are crucial for binding, whereas RRM3 as well as the HuR hinge region contributed only marginally to this protein∶RNA interaction. Furthermore, mutation of uridine rich patches within the PRE did not disturb HuR:CD83 mRNA complex formation while, in contrast, the deletion of specific PRE subfragments from the CD83 mRNA prevented HuR binding in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the observed inhibition of HuR binding to CD83 mRNA does not lead to a nuclear trapping of the transcript but rather redirected this transcript from the CRM1- towards the NXF1/TAP-specific nuclear export pathway. Thus, the presence of a functional PRE permits nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the CD83 transcript via the CRM1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2030890569,"Shiga toxins (Stx) play an important role in the pathogenesis of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening renal sequela of human intestinal infection caused by specific Escherichia coli strains. Stx target a restricted subset of human endothelial cells that possess the globotriaosylceramide receptor, like that in renal glomeruli. The toxins, composed of five B chains and a single enzymatic A chain, by removing adenines from ribosomes and DNA, trigger apoptosis and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in target cells. Because bacteria are confined to the gut, the toxins move to the kidney through the circulation. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been indicated as the carriers that “piggyback” shuttle toxins to the kidney. However, there is no consensus on this topic, because not all laboratories have been able to reproduce the Stx/PMN interaction. Here, we demonstrate that conformational changes of Shiga toxin 1, with reduction of α-helix content and exposition to solvent of hydrophobic tryptophan residues, cause a loss of PMN binding activity. The partially unfolded toxin was found to express both enzymatic and globotriaosylceramide binding activities being fully active in intoxicating human endothelial cells; this suggests the presence of a distinct PMN-binding domain. By reviewing functional and structural data, we suggest that A chain moieties close to Trp-203 are recognized by PMN. Our findings could help explain the conflicting results regarding Stx/PMN interactions, especially as the groups reporting positive results obtained Stx by single-step affinity chromatography, which could have preserved the correct folding of Stx with respect to more complicated multi-step purification methods.

https://openalex.org/W2055244413,"The respiratory complex I couples the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with a translocation of protons across the membrane. Its nucleotide-binding site is made up of a unique Rossmann fold to accommodate the binding of the substrate NADH and of the primary electron acceptor flavin mononucleotide. Binding of NADH includes interactions of the hydroxyl groups of the adenosine ribose with a conserved glutamic acid residue. Structural analysis revealed that due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, this residue most likely prevents the binding of NADPH, which is a poor substrate of the complex. We produced several variants with mutations at this position exhibiting up to 200-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency with NADPH. The reaction of the variants with NAD(P)H is coupled with proton translocation in an inhibitor-sensitive manner. Thus, we have created an energy-converting NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, an activity so far not found in nature. Remarkably, the oxidation of NAD(P)H by the variants leads to an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W2074884534,"We previously demonstrated that CRAM (CRMP5)-associated GTPase (CRAG), a short splicing variant of centaurin-γ3/AGAP3, facilitated degradation of expanded polyglutamine protein (polyQ) via the nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Taking advantage of this feature, we also showed that lentivirus-mediated CRAG expression in the Purkinje cells of mice expressing polyQ resulted in clearance of the polyQ aggregates and rescue from ataxia. However, the molecular basis of the function of CRAG in cell survival against polyQ remains unclear. Here we report that CRAG, but not centaurin-γ3, induces transcriptional activation of c-Fos-dependent activator protein-1 (AP-1) via serum response factor (SRF). Mutation analysis indicated that the nuclear localization signal and both the N- and C-terminal regions of CRAG are critical for SRF-dependent c-Fos activation. CRAG knockdown by siRNA or expression of a dominant negative mutant of CRAG significantly attenuated the c-Fos activation triggered by either polyQ or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Importantly, c-Fos expression partially rescued the enhanced cytotoxicity of CRAG knockdown in polyQ-expressing or MG132-treated cells. Finally, we suggest the possible involvement of CRAG in the sulfiredoxin-mediated antioxidant pathway via AP-1. Taken together, these results demonstrated that CRAG enhances the cell survival signal against the accumulation of unfolded proteins, including polyQ, through not only proteasome activation, but also the activation of c-Fos-dependent AP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2105318310,"Invasive cancers use pericellular proteolysis to breach the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers and invade the surrounding tissue. Proinvasive membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is the primary mediator of proteolytic events on the cancer cell surface. MT1-MMP is synthesized as a zymogen. The latency of MT1-MMP is maintained by its N-terminal inhibitory prodomain. In the course of MT1-MMP activation, the R(108)RKR(111) ↓ Y(112) prodomain sequence is processed by furin. The intact prodomain released by furin alone, however, is a potent inhibitor of the emerging MT1-MMP enzyme. Evidence suggests that the prodomain undergoes intradomain cleavage at the PGD ↓ L(50) site followed by the release of the degraded prodomain by furin cleavage that finalizes the two-step activation event. These cleavages, only if combined, cause the activation of MT1-MMP. The significance of the intradomain cleavage in the protumorigenic program of MT1-MMP, however, remained unidentified. To identify this important parameter, in our current study, we used the cells that expressed the wild-type prodomain-based fluorescent biosensor and the mutant biosensor with the inactivated PGD↓L(50) cleavage site (L50D mutant) and also the cells with the enforced expression of the wild-type and L50D mutant MT1-MMP. Using cell-based tests, orthotopic breast cancer xenografts in mice, and genome-wide transcriptional profiling of cultured cells and tumor xenografts, we demonstrated that the intradomain cleavage of the PGD ↓ L(50) sequence of the prodomain is essential for the protumorigenic function of MT1-MMP. Our results emphasize the importance of the intradomain cleavages resulting in the inactivation of the respective inhibitory prodomains not only for MT1-MMP but also for other MMP family members."
https://openalex.org/W2151141913,"DnaA protein, a member of the AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family, initiates DNA synthesis at the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) and regulates the transcription of several genes, including its own. The assembly of DnaA complexes at chromosomal recognition sequences is affected by the tight binding of ATP or ADP by DnaA. DnaA with a point mutation in its membrane-binding amphipathic helix, DnaA(L366K), previously described for its ability to support growth in cells with altered phospholipid content, has biochemical characteristics similar to those of the wild-type protein. Yet DnaA(L366K) fails to initiate in vitro or in vivo replication from oriC. We found here, through in vitro dimethyl sulfate footprinting and gel mobility shift assays, that DnaA(L366K) in either nucleotide state was unable to assemble into productive prereplication complexes. In contrast, at the dnaA promoter, both the ATP and the ADP form of DnaA(L366K) generated active nucleoprotein complexes that efficiently repressed transcription in a manner similar to wild-type ATP-DnaA. Thus, it appears that unlike wild-type DnaA protein DnaA(L366K) can adopt architectures that are independent of its bound nucleotide, and instead the locus determines the functionality of the higher order DnaA(L366K)-DNA complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2049710761,"Development of tumor-specific probes for imaging by positron emission tomography has broad implications in clinical oncology, such as diagnosis, staging, and monitoring therapeutic responses in patients, as well as in biomedical research. Thymidylate synthase (TSase)-based de novo biosynthesis of DNA is an important target for drug development. Increased DNA replication in proliferating cancerous cells requires TSase activity, which catalyzes the reductive methylation of dUMP to dTMP using (R)-N(5),N(10)-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF) as a cofactor. In principle, radiolabeled MTHF can be used as a substrate for this reaction to identify rapidly dividing cells. In this proof-of-principle study, actively growing (log phase) breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and hTERT-HME1), normal breast (human mammary epithelial and MCF10A), colon cancer (HT-29), and normal colon (FHC) cells were incubated with [(14)C]MTHF in culture medium from 30 min to 2 h, and uptake of radiotracer was measured. Cancerous cell lines incorporated significantly more radioactivity than their normal counterparts. The uptake of radioactively labeled MTHF depended upon a combination of cell doubling time, folate receptor status, S phase percentage, and TSase expression in the cells. These findings suggest that the recently synthesized [(11)C]MTHF may serve as a new positron emission tomography tracer for cancer imaging."
