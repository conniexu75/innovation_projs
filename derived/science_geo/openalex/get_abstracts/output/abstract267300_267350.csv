https://openalex.org/W2092665385,"Incubation of forest soils containing sulfate labeled with sulfur-35 showed rapid conversion of the added sulfate to organic sulfur forms by microbial populations. Activity rates were highest in the forest floor, but significant activity was observed throughout the soil profile. The annual potential sulfur incorporation for forest floor and soil combined is estimated to be 30 kilograms per hectare. The metabolism of inorganic sulfate to organic forms can be a major process in the sulfur cycle, influencing sulfate accumulation and mobility in forest ecosystems."

Chlorpromazine, a calmodulin inhibitor, reduced calcium-promoted phosphorylation, suggesting that the phosphorylation was modulated by calmodulin. This is evidence for the role of calcium in protein phosphorylation in plants and could serve as an experimental approach to understanding the molecular mechanism by which calcium modulates various physiological processes in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1980459367,Application of simultaneous inversion of seismic P-wave arrival time data to the investigation of the crust beneath Kilauea Volcano yields a detailed picture of the volcano's heterogeneous structure. Zones of anomalously high seismic velocity are found associated with the volcano's rift zones. A low-velocity zone at shallow depth directly beneath the caldera coincides with an aseismic region interpreted as being the locus of Kilauea's summit magma complex.

https://openalex.org/W2048913371,"Iridium concentrations have been measured in samples taken across two Late Cambrian biomere boundaries (crisis zones) in search of evidence for possible elemental abundance anomalies similar to the one observed at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Sampling was performed in uplifted marine limestone deposits in the House Range of western Utah. Although the two trilobite-brachiopod extinction boundaries could be assigned to ±4 millimeters of vertical section by laboratory examination of the rocks, only background amounts of iridium (2 × 10-12 to 17 × 10-12 gram per gram of whole rock) were observed."
