https://openalex.org/W2910480975,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are associated with loss of nuclear transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Here we identify that TDP-43 regulates expression of the neuronal growth-associated factor stathmin-2. Lowered TDP-43 levels, which reduce its binding to sites within the first intron of stathmin-2 pre-messenger RNA, uncover a cryptic polyadenylation site whose utilization produces a truncated, non-functional mRNA. Reduced stathmin-2 expression is found in neurons trans-differentiated from patient fibroblasts expressing an ALS-causing TDP-43 mutation, in motor cortex and spinal motor neurons from patients with sporadic ALS and familial ALS with GGGGCC repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons depleted of TDP-43. Remarkably, while reduction in TDP-43 is shown to inhibit axonal regeneration of iPSC-derived motor neurons, rescue of stathmin-2 expression restores axonal regenerative capacity. Thus, premature polyadenylation-mediated reduction in stathmin-2 is a hallmark of ALS-FTD that functionally links reduced nuclear TDP-43 function to enhanced neuronal vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2963174546,"Many real-world systems can be studied in terms of pattern recognition tasks, so that proper use (and understanding) of machine learning methods in practical applications becomes essential. While many classification methods have been proposed, there is no consensus on which methods are more suitable for a given dataset. As a consequence, it is important to comprehensively compare methods in many possible scenarios. In this context, we performed a systematic comparison of 9 well-known clustering methods available in the R language assuming normally distributed data. In order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes, separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach tended to present particularly good performance. We also found that the default configuration of the adopted implementations was not always accurate. In these cases, a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2910569384,"Individuals with autism and individuals with dyslexia both show reduced use of previous sensory information (stimuli statistics) in perceptual tasks, even though these are very different neurodevelopmental disorders. To better understand how past sensory information influences the perceptual experience in these disorders, we first investigated the trial-by-trial performance of neurotypical participants in a serial discrimination task. Neurotypical participants overweighted recent stimuli, revealing fast updating of internal sensory models, which is adaptive in changing environments. They also weighted the detailed stimuli distribution inferred by longer-term accumulation of stimuli statistics, which is adaptive in stable environments. Compared to neurotypical participants, individuals with dyslexia weighted earlier stimuli less heavily, whereas individuals with autism spectrum disorder weighted recent stimuli less heavily. Investigating the dynamics of perceptual inference reveals that individuals with dyslexia rely more on information about the immediate past, whereas perception in individuals with autism is dominated by longer-term statistics."
https://openalex.org/W4252498982,"Many proteins must translocate through the protein-conducting Sec61 channel in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the SecY channel in the prokaryotic plasma membrane1,2. Proteins with highly hydrophobic signal sequences are first recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP)3,4 and then moved co-translationally through the Sec61 or SecY channel by the associated translating ribosome. Substrates with less hydrophobic signal sequences bypass the SRP and are moved through the channel post-translationally5,6. In eukaryotic cells, post-translational translocation is mediated by the association of the Sec61 channel with another membrane protein complex, the Sec62-Sec63 complex7-9, and substrates are moved through the channel by the luminal BiP ATPase9. How the Sec62-Sec63 complex activates the Sec61 channel for post-translational translocation is not known. Here we report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of the Sec complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of the Sec61 channel and the Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 and Sec72 proteins. Sec63 causes wide opening of the lateral gate of the Sec61 channel, priming it for the passage of low-hydrophobicity signal sequences into the lipid phase, without displacing the channel's plug domain. Lateral channel opening is triggered by Sec63 interacting both with cytosolic loops in the C-terminal half of Sec61 and transmembrane segments in the N-terminal half of the Sec61 channel. The cytosolic Brl domain of Sec63 blocks ribosome binding to the channel and recruits Sec71 and Sec72, positioning them for the capture of polypeptides associated with cytosolic Hsp7010. Our structure shows how the Sec61 channel is activated for post-translational protein translocation."

https://openalex.org/W2910040357,"Several lines of evidence imply changes in inhibitory interneuron connectivity and subsequent alterations in oscillatory network activities in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recently, we provided evidence for an increased immunoreactivity of both the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin and the GABAA receptor γ2-subunit in the hippocampus of young (1 and 3 months of age), APPPS1 mice. These mice represent a well-established model of cerebral amyloidosis, which is a hallmark of human AD. In this study, we demonstrate a robust increase of parvalbumin immunoreactivity and accentuated projections of parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons, which target perisomatic regions of pyramidal cells within the hippocampal subregions CA1 and CA3 of 3-month-old APPPS1 mice. Colocalisation studies confirmed a significant increase in the density of PV+ projections labeled with antibodies against a presynaptic (vesicular GABA transporter) and a postsynaptic marker (gephyrin) of inhibitory synapses within the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 and CA3. As perisomatic inhibition by PV+-interneurons is crucial for the generation of hippocampal network oscillations involved in spatial processing, learning and memory formation we investigated the impact of the putative enhanced perisomatic inhibition on two types of fast neuronal network oscillations in acute hippocampal slices: 1. spontaneously occurring sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-R), and 2. cholinergic γ-oscillations. Interestingly, both network patterns were generally preserved in APPPS1 mice similar to WT mice. However, the comparison of simultaneous CA3 and CA1 recordings revealed that the incidence and amplitude of SPW-Rs were significantly lower in CA1 vs CA3 in APPPS1 slices, whereas the power of γ-oscillations was significantly higher in CA3 vs CA1 in WT-slices indicating an impaired communication between the CA3 and CA1 network activities in APPPS1 mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate an increased GABAergic synaptic output of PV+ interneurons impinging on pyramidal cells of CA1 and CA3, which might limit the coordinated cross-talk between these two hippocampal areas in young APPPS1 mice and mediate long-term changes in synaptic inhibition during progression of amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2909798293,"Gut fungi may influence the course of Clostridium difficile infection either positively or negatively for the host. Fungi are not prominent in the mouse gut, and C. albicans, the major human gastrointestinal commensal yeast, is in low abundance or absent in mice. Bifidobacterium is one of the probiotics that may attenuate the severity of C. difficile infection. Inflammatory synergy between C. albicans and C. difficile, in gut, may provide a state that more closely resembles human infection and be more suitable for testing probiotic effects. We performed fecal mycobiota analysis and administered C. albicans at 1 day prior to C. difficile dosing. Fecal eukaryotic 18S rDNA analysis demonstrated the presence of Ascomycota, specifically, Candida spp., after oral antibiotics, despite negative fecal fungal culture. C. albicans administration enhanced the severity of the C. difficile infection model as determined by mortality rate, weight loss, gut leakage (FITC-dextran assay), and serum and intestinal tissue cytokines. This occurred without increased fecal C. difficile or bacteremia, in comparison with C. difficile gavage alone. Candida lysate with C. difficile increased IL-8 production from HT-29 and Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cell-lines. Bifidobacterium attenuated the disease severity of the C. difficile plus Candida model. The reduced severity was associated with decreased Candida burdens in feces. In conclusion, gut C. albicans worsened C. difficile infection, possibly through exacerbation of inflammation. Hence, a mouse model of Clostridium difficile infection with C. albicans present in the gut may better model the human patient condition. Gut fungal mycobiome investigation in patients with C. difficile is warranted and may suggest therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2949575039,"Despite strong interest over many years, the usage of quantitative trait loci in plant breeding has often failed to live up to expectations. A key weak point in the utilisation of QTLs is the “quality” of markers used during marker-assisted selection (MAS): unreliable markers result in variable outcomes, leading to a perception that MAS products fail to achieve reliable improvement. Most reports of markers used for MAS focus on markers derived from the mapping population. There are very few studies that examine the reliability of these markers in other genetic backgrounds, and critically, no metrics exist to describe and quantify this reliability. To improve the MAS process, this work proposes five core metrics that fully describe the reliability of a marker. These metrics give a comprehensive and quantitative measure of the ability of a marker to correctly classify germplasm as QTL[+]/[–], particularly against a background of high allelic diversity. Markers that score well on these metrics will have far higher reliability in breeding, and deficiencies in specific metrics give information on circumstances under which a marker may not be reliable. The metrics are applicable across different marker types and platforms, allowing an objective comparison of the performance of different markers irrespective of the platform. Evaluating markers using these metrics demonstrates that trait-specific markers consistently out-perform markers designed for other purposes. These metrics also provide a superb set of criteria for designing superior marker systems for a target QTL, enabling the selection of an optimal marker set before committing to design."
https://openalex.org/W2909451643,"Dementia is a neurological and cognitive condition that affects millions of people around the world. At any given time in the United Kingdom, 1 in 4 hospital beds are occupied by a person with dementia, while about 22% of these hospital admissions are due to preventable causes. In this paper we discuss using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and in-home sensory devices in combination with machine learning techniques to monitor health and well-being of people with dementia. This will allow us to provide more effective and preventative care and reduce preventable hospital admissions. One of the unique aspects of this work is combining environmental data with physiological data collected via low cost in-home sensory devices to extract actionable information regarding the health and well-being of people with dementia in their own home environment. We have worked with clinicians to design our machine learning algorithms where we focused on developing solutions for real-world settings. In our solutions, we avoid generating too many alerts/alarms to prevent increasing the monitoring and support workload. We have designed an algorithm to detect Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) which is one of the top five reasons of hospital admissions for people with dementia (around 9% of hospital admissions for people with dementia in the UK). To develop the UTI detection algorithm, we have used a Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) technique to extract latent factors from raw observation and use them for clustering and identifying the possible UTI cases. In addition, we have designed an algorithm for detecting changes in activity patterns to identify early symptoms of cognitive decline or health decline in order to provide personalised and preventative care services. For this purpose, we have used an Isolation Forest (iForest) technique to create a holistic view of the daily activity patterns. This paper describes the algorithms and discusses the evaluation of the work using a large set of real-world data collected from a trial with people with dementia and their caregivers."

https://openalex.org/W2910030584,"Metabolic models can estimate intrinsic product yields for microbial factories, but such frameworks struggle to predict cell performance (including product titer or rate) under suboptimal metabolism and complex bioprocess conditions. On the other hand, machine learning, complementary to metabolic modeling necessitates large amounts of data. Building such a database for metabolic engineering designs requires significant manpower and is prone to human errors and bias. We propose an approach to integrate data-driven methods with genome scale metabolic model for assessment of microbial bio-production (yield, titer and rate). Using engineered E. coli as an example, we manually extracted and curated a data set comprising about 1200 experimentally realized cell factories from ~100 papers. We furthermore augmented the key design features (e.g., genetic modifications and bioprocess variables) extracted from literature with additional features derived from running the genome-scale metabolic model iML1515 simulations with constraints that match the experimental data. Then, data augmentation and ensemble learning (e.g., support vector machines, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks in a stacked regressor model) are employed to alleviate the challenges of sparse, non-standardized, and incomplete data sets, while multiple correspondence analysis/principal component analysis are used to rank influential factors on bio-production. The hybrid framework demonstrates a reasonably high cross-validation accuracy for prediction of E.coli factory performance metrics under presumed bioprocess and pathway conditions (Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.8 and 0.93 on new data not seen by the model)."
https://openalex.org/W2910059733,"Benthic—pelagic coupling plays a pivotal role in aquatic ecosystems but the effects of fishery driven interactions on its functioning has been largely overlooked. Disentangling the benthic—pelagic links including effects of mixed fisheries, however, needs sketching a whole description of ecosystem interactions using quantitative tools. A holistic food web model has been here developed in order to understand the interplay between the benthic-pelagic coupling and mixed fisheries in a Mediterranean system such as the Strait of Sicily. The reconstruction of the food web required review and integration of a vast set of local and regional biological information from bacteria to large pelagic species that were aggregated into 72 functional groups. Fisheries were described by 18 fleet segments resulting from combination of fishing gears and fishing vessel size. The input-output analysis on the food web of energy pathways allowed identifying effects of biological and fishery components. Results showed that the structure of the Strait of Sicily food web is complex. Similarly to other Mediterranean areas, the food web of the Strait of Sicily encompasses 4.5 trophic levels (TLs) with the highest TLs reached by bluefin tuna, swordfish and large hake and largely impacted by bottom trawling and large longline. Importantly, benthic-pelagic coupling is affected by direct and indirect impacts among groups of species, fleets and fleets-species through the whole trophic spectrum of the food web. Moreover, functional groups able to move on large spatial scales or life history of which is spent between shelf and slope domains play a key role in linking subsystems together and mediate interactions in the Mediterranean mixed fisheries."

https://openalex.org/W2909430967,"Jellyfish are a prominent component of the plankton community. They frequently form conspicuous blooms which may interfere with different human enterprises. Among the aspects that remain understudied are jellyfish associations with microorganisms having potentially important implications for organic matter cycling. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the bacterial community associated with live moon jellyfish (Aurelia solida, Scyohozoa) in the Adriatic Sea. Using 16S rRNA clone libraries and culture-based methods, we have analyzed the bacterial community composition of different body parts: the exumbrella surface, oral arms, and gastric cavity, and investigated possible differences in medusa-associated bacterial community structure at the time of the jellyfish population peak, and during the senescent phase at the end of bloom. Microbiota associated with moon jellyfish was different from ambient seawater bacterial assemblage and varied between different body parts. Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderia, Cupriavidus and Achromobacter) dominated community in the gastral cavity of medusa, while Alphaproteobacteria (Phaeobacter, Ruegeria) and Gammaproteobacteria (Stenotrophomonas, Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio) prevailed on ‘outer’ body parts. Bacterial community structure changed during senescent phase, at the end of the jellyfish bloom, showing an increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, exclusively Vibrio. The results of cultured bacterial isolates showed the dominance of Gammaproeteobacteria, especially Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas in all body parts. Our results suggest that jellyfish associated bacterial community might have an important role for the host, and that anthropogenic pollution in the Gulf of Trieste might affect their community structure."
https://openalex.org/W2909526089,"Floating objects drifting in the surface of tropical waters, also known as drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs), attract hundreds of marine species, including tuna and non-tuna species. Industrial tropical purse seiners have been increasingly deploying artificial man-made DFADs equipped with satellite linked echo-sounder buoys, which provide fishers with information on the accurate geo-location of the object and rough estimates of the biomass aggregated underneath, to facilitate the catch of tuna. Although several hypotheses are under consideration to explain the aggregation and retention processes of pelagic species around DFADs, the reasons driving this associative behavior are uncertain. This study uses information from 962 echo-sounder buoys attached to virgin (i.e. newly deployed) DFADs deployed in the Western Indian Ocean between 2012 and 2015 by the Spanish fleet (42,322 days observations) to determine the first detection day of tuna and non-tuna species at DFAD and to model the aggregation processes of both species group using Generalize Additive Mixed Models. Moreover, different seasons, areas and depths of the DFAD underwater structure were considered in the analysis to account for potential spatio-temporal and structure differences. Results show that tuna species arrive at DFADs before non-tuna species (13.5±8.4 and 21.7±15.1 days, respectively), and provide evidence of the significant relationship between DFAD depth and detection time for tuna, suggesting faster tuna colonization in deeper objects. For non-tuna species, this relationship appeared to be not significant. The study also reveals both seasonal and spatial differences in the aggregation patterns for different species groups, suggesting that tuna and non-tuna species may have different aggregative behaviors depending on the spatio-temporal dynamic of DFADs. This work will contribute to the understanding of the fine and mesoscale ecology and behavior of target and non-target species around DFADs and will assist managers on the sustainability of exploited resources, helping to design spatio-temporal conservation management measures for tuna and non-tuna species."

At present, the pedagogy focuses on the application of e-learning and team-based learning to enhance learners’ engagement and learning effectiveness. Objectives This study applied the flipped classroom approach to conduct evidence-based nursing (EBN) teaching. The aim of this study is to elevate the learning effectiveness of the flipped classroom group to the traditional teaching group in terms of knowledge and self-efficacy in practice. Design A pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group with a quasi-experimental quantitative design. Methods The study recruited 151 nurses, of whom 75 were in the control group and 76 were in the experimental group. During the EBN course, the control group received training via traditional pedagogy while the experimental group engaged the flipped classroom approach. The learning effectiveness of EBN knowledge and self-efficacy in practice were evaluated across the three time points: pre-course, post-course, and one month after the course. Results In both group the scores of the EBN knowledge and self-efficacy in practice improved after training. The scores of the experimental group increased significantly than in the control group. However, the scores declined in both groups one month after the course. Even so, the experimental group’s score of self-efficacy in practice was still higher than that of the control group. Conclusion The implementation of the flipped classroom approach and team-based learning effectively enhanced the learners EBN knowledge accumulation and self-efficacy in practice. The research results can be used as an important reference for improving clinical nursing teaching quality."
https://openalex.org/W2951818190,"Sickle Cell Disease and ß-thalassemia, which are caused by defective or deficient adult ß-globin (HBB) respectively, are the most common serious genetic blood diseases in the world. Persistent expression of the fetal ß-like globin, also known as 훾-globin, can ameliorate both disorders by serving in place of the adult ß-globin as a part of the fetal hemoglobin tetramer (HbF). Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to explore a potential 훾-globin silencer region upstream of the δ-globin gene identified by comparison of naturally-occurring deletion mutations associated with up-regulated 훾-globin. We find that deletion of a 1.7 kb consensus element or select 350 bp sub-regions from bulk populations of cells increases levels of HbF. Screening of individual sgRNAs in one sub-region revealed three single guides that caused increases in 훾-globin expression. Deletion of the 1.7 kb region in HUDEP-2 clonal sublines, and in colonies derived from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), does not cause significant up-regulation of 훾-globin. These data suggest that the 1.7 kb region is not an autonomous 훾-globin silencer, and thus by itself is not a suitable therapeutic target for gene editing treatment of ß-hemoglobinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2908540145,"Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death worldwide and is a major cause of acquired disability in adults. However, there is still a need for an effective drug for its treatment. Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, has long been used clinically to aid neurological recovery after stroke. To establish potential clinical indicators of BHD efficacy in stroke treatment and prognosis, we conducted a combined proteomic and metabolomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in a mouse stroke model. CSF samples were obtained from male mice with acute ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (CI/R) injury, some of which were then treated with BHD. Label-free quantitative proteomics was conducted using nano-LC-MS/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap mass and metabolomic analysis was performed using nanoprobe NMR and UHPLC-QTOF-MS. The results showed that several proteins and metabolites were present at significantly different concentrations in the CSF samples from mice with CI/R alone and those treated with BHD. These belonged to pathways related to energy demand, inflammatory signaling, cytoskeletal regulation, Wnt signaling, and neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, our in silico data suggest that BHD treatment is not only protective but can also ameliorate defects in pathways affected by neurological disorders. These data shed light on the mechanism whereby BHD may be effective in the treatment and prevention of stroke-related neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2910600372,"Background We investigated the recent 10-year trends in the number of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in relation to prescription patterns of antithrombotic therapy. Methods We analyzed the annual prevalence of PCI and patterns of antithrombotic therapy after PCI, including antiplatelets and oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [NOACs]), in patients with AF between 2006 and 2015 by using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Independent factors associated with triple therapy (oral anticoagulant plus dual antiplatelet) prescription were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results The number of patients with AF undergoing PCI increased gradually from 2006 (n = 2,140) to 2015 (n = 3,631) (ptrend<0.001). In 2006, only 22.7% of patients received triple therapy after PCI although 96.2% of them were indicated for anticoagulation (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2). The prescription rate of triple therapy increased to 38.3% in 2015 (ptrend<0.001), which was mainly attributed to a recent increment of NOAC-based triple therapy from 2013 (17.5% in 2015). Previous ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, old age, hypertension, and congestive heart failure were significantly associated with a higher triple therapy prescription rate, whereas previous myocardial infarction, PCI, and peripheral arterial disease were associated with triple therapy underuse. Conclusions From 2006 to 2015, the number of patients with AF undergoing PCI and the prescription rate of triple therapy increased gradually with a recent increment of NOAC-based antithrombotic therapy from 2013. Previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, and PCI were associated with underuse of triple therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2910836738,"Cone photoreceptors are essential for vision under moderate to high illuminance and allow color discrimination. Their fast dark adaptation rate and resistance to saturation are believed to depend in part on an intraretinal visual cycle that supplies 11-cis-retinaldehyde to cone opsins. Candidate enzymes of this pathway have been reported, but their physiologic contribution to cone photoresponses remains unknown. Here, we evaluate the role of a candidate retinol isomerase of this pathway, sphingolipid δ4 desaturase 1 (Des1). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed Des1 expression not only in Müller glia but also throughout the retina and in the retinal pigment epithelium. We assessed cone functional dependence on Müller cell-expressed Des1 through a conditional knockout approach. Floxed Des1 mice, on a guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit α transducin 1 knockout (Gnat1−/−) background to allow isolated recording of cone-driven photoresponses, were bred with platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (Pdgfrα)-Cre mice to delete Des1 in Müller cells. Conditional knockout of Des1 expression, as shown by tissue-selective Des1 gene recombination and reduced Des1 catalytic activity, caused no gross changes in the retinal structure and had no effect on cone sensitivity or dark adaptation but did slightly accelerate the rate of cone phototransduction termination. These results indicate that Des1 expression in Müller cells is not required for cone visual pigment regeneration in the mouse.—Kiser, P. D., Kolesnikov, A. V., Kiser, J.

As such, gene co-expression networks allowed the comparison of different stages and parts of the brain contributing to an integrated view of genetic variation. Two methods based on co-expression networks presents appealing results: Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Network-Medicine Relative Importance (NERI). By selecting two different gene expression databases related to schizophrenia, we evaluated the biological modules selected by both WGCNA and NERI along these databases as well combining both WGCNA and NERI results (WGCNA-NERI). Also we conducted a enrichment analysis for the identification of partial biological function of each result (as well a replication analysis). To appraise the accuracy of whether both algorithms (as well our approach, WGCNA-NERI) were pointing to genes related to schizophrenia and its complex genetic architecture we conducted the MSET analysis, based on a reference gene list of schizophrenia database (SZDB) related to DNA Methylation, Exome, GWAS as well as copy number variation mutation studies. The WGCNA results were more associated with inflammatory pathways and immune system response; NERI obtained genes related with cellular regulation, embryological pathways e cellular growth factors. Only NERI were able to provide a statistical meaningful results to the MSET analysis (for Methylation and de novo mutations data). However, combining WGCNA and NERI provided a much more larger overlap in these two categories and additionally on Transcriptome database.

https://openalex.org/W2908716001,"In the recent years matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a useful tool to characterize arthropod species and their different stages of development. It was reported for sand flies and mosquitoes at immature stages and also assumed for ticks that geographic location can have a subtle influence on MALDI-TOF mass spectra which allows the discrimination of animals with specific local variations of the MALDI-TOF MS phenotype. It is so far uncertain, however, if these mass-spectrometric differences are based on genetic variation or on spectral features which depend on environmental or temporal features. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the geographic location, environmental factors and the season of the year on the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of Ixodes (I.) ricinus nymphs and if spectral variation would allow to draw conclusions with respect to the tick’s provenience or conditions that influence the tick life cycle. Application of multivariate statistical models on spectra of ticks collected in different seasons and different habitats and locations within Germany showed that the impact of the location seemed to be small while season and habitat seemed to have stronger impact on the MALDI-TOF mass spectra.

https://openalex.org/W2909395860,"Background The health economic evidence about the value and optimal targeting of genetic testing in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events has remained limited and ambiguous. The objective of this study is to optimize the population-level use and targeting of genetic testing alongside traditional risk factors in the prevention of CHD events and, thereby, to assess the cost-benefit of genetic testing. Methods and findings We compare several strategies for using traditional and genetic testing in the prevention of CHD through statin therapy. The targeting of tests to different patient segments within these strategies is optimized by using a decision-analytic model, in which a patient’s estimated risk of CHD is updated based on test results using Bayesian methods. We adopt the perspective of healthcare sector. The data for the model is exceptionally wide and combined from national healthcare registers, the Finnish Institute for Molecular Medicine, and published literature. Our results suggest that targeting genetic testing in an optimal way to those patients about which traditional risk factors do not provide sufficiently accurate information results in the highest expected net benefit. In particular, compared to the use of traditional risk factors only, the optimal use of genetic testing would decrease the expected costs of an average patient aged 45 years or more by 2.54€ in a 10-year follow-up period while maintaining the level of the expected health outcome. Thus, genetic testing is found to be a part of a cost-beneficial testing strategy alongside traditional risk factors. This conclusion is robust to reasonable changes in model inputs. Conclusions If targeted optimally, the use of genetic testing alongside traditional risk factors is cost-beneficial in the prevention of CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2909228536,"A recent global trend toward retirement of farmland presents opportunities to reclaim habitat for threatened and endangered species. We examine habitat restoration opportunities in one of the world's most converted landscapes, California's San Joaquin Desert (SJD). Despite the presence of 35 threatened and endangered species, agricultural expansion continues to drive habitat loss in the SJD, even as marginal farmland is retired. Over the next decades a combination of factors, including salinization, climate change, and historical groundwater overdraft, are projected to lead to the retirement of more than 2,000 km2 of farmland in the SJD. To promote strategic habitat protection and restoration, we conducted a quantitative assessment of habitat loss and fragmentation, habitat suitability, climatic niche stability, climate change impacts, habitat protection, and reintroduction opportunities for an umbrella species of the SJD, the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila). We use our suitability models, in conjunction with modern and historical land use maps, to estimate the historical and modern rate of habitat loss to development. The estimated amount of habitat lost since the species became protected under endangered species law in 1967 is greater than the total amount of habitat currently protected through public ownership and conservation easement. We document climatic niche contraction and associated range contraction away from the more mesic margins of the species' historical distribution, driven by the anthropogenic introduction of exotic grasses and forbs. The impact of exotic species on G. sila range dynamics appears to be still unfolding. Finally, we use NASA fallowed area maps to identify 610 km2 of fallowed or retired agricultural land with high potential to again serve as habitat. We discuss conservation strategies in light of the potential for habitat restoration and multiple drivers of ongoing and historical habitat loss."
https://openalex.org/W2910411234,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oxidative stress on the instrumental and sensory quality of Nile tilapia fillets. The experiment was conducted in a 2x2 factorial arrangement, evaluating densities (60 and 300 kg m-3) and depuration times (1 and 24 hours) in a total of four treatments. The serum levels of cortisol and gene expression levels of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) as well as the pH, color, tenderness, water-holding capacity and sensory analysis of the fillets were evaluated. High density (300 kg m-3) resulted in higher mean cortisol levels, lower expression of CAT and GPx enzymes as well as higher expression of HSP70. Fish under this treatment also exhibited fillets with greater tenderness, higher lightness, lower redness and lower sensory acceptance. The longer depuration time (24 hours) resulted in lower expression of the CAT and GPx enzymes and fillets with higher lightness. The water-holding capacity was not affected by the different treatments. Therefore, low density and longer depuration times are recommended for decreased stress and improved quality of fillets."
https://openalex.org/W2909773398,"Objectives HIV infection has been associated with an impaired lung function in high-income countries, but the association between HIV infection and pulmonary function in Sub-Saharan Africa remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the relation between HIV infection and pulmonary function in a rural African population. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults in a rural area in South Africa, as part of the Ndlovu Cohort Study. A respiratory questionnaire and post-bronchodilator spirometry were performed. Multivariable regression analysis was used to investigate whether HIV was independently associated with a decrease in post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio considering age, sex, body mass index, respiratory risk factors and a history of a pulmonary infection (tuberculosis (TB) or a pneumonia). Possible mediation by a history of pulmonary infection was tested by removing this variable from the final model. Results Two hundred and one consecutive participants were enrolled in the study in 2016, 84 (41.8%) were HIV-positive (82.1% on ART). The median age was 38 (IQR 29–51) years. Following multivariable analysis HIV was not significantly associated to a decline in post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio (β -0.017, p 0.18). However, upon removal of a history of a pulmonary infection from the final model HIV was significantly related to post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio, β -0.026, p 0.03. Conclusions Pulmonary function is affected by HIV infection which most likely results from co-infection with TB or other pneumonia. Further research should focus on the influence of a pulmonary infection, most notably TB, on pulmonary function, especially as the incidence of TB is high in HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2910023708,"Background Using a cross-sectional design, we assessed the relationship between the time schools provide for physical activity and the proportion of students achieving a healthy aerobic capacity or body mass index. Methods In 2013–2014, physical education and grade-level teachers from 905 of 1,244 Georgia elementary schools provided survey data about the frequency and duration of physical activity opportunities offered before, during, and after school. Log-binomial models related the weekly physical activity minutes provided by schools to the proportion of children in the FitnessGram healthy fitness zone for aerobic capacity or body mass index while adjusting for school characteristics and demographics. Results During-school physical activity time was not associated with student fitness, but schools with before-school physical activity programs had a moderately higher prevalence of healthy aerobic capacity (prevalence ratio among girls: 1.06; 99% confidence interval: 1.00–1.13; prevalence ratio among boys: 1.03; 99% confidence interval: 0.99–1.08). Each additional 30 minutes of recess per week was associated with no more than a 3%-higher proportion of students with healthy body mass indexes (prevalence ratio among girls: 1.01; 99% confidence interval: 1.00–1.03; prevalence ratio among boys: 1.01; 99% confidence interval: 0.99–1.03). Conclusions The amount of physical activity time provided by schools is not strongly associated with school-aggregated student fitness. Future studies should be designed to assess the importance of school-based physical activity time on student fitness, relative to physical activity type and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2909301167,"Metagenomes often convey novel biological activities and therefore have gained considerable attention for use in biotechnological applications. Recently, metagenome-derived EstDL136 was found to possess chloramphenicol (Cm)-metabolizing features. Sequence analysis showed EstDL136 to be a member of the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) family with an Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad and a notable substrate specificity. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of EstDL136 and in a complex with Cm. Consistent with the high sequence similarity, the structure of EstDL136 is homologous to that of the HSL family. The active site of EstDL136 is a relatively shallow pocket that could accommodate Cm as a substrate as opposed to the long acyl chain substrates typical of the HSL family. Mutational analyses further suggested that several residues in the vicinity of the active site play roles in the Cm-binding of EstDL136. These results provide structural and functional insights into a metagenome-derived EstDL136."
https://openalex.org/W2910683597,"Land transformation into agricultural areas and the intensification of management practices represent two of the most devastating threats to biodiversity worldwide. Within this study, we investigated the effect of intensively managed agroecosystems on bat activity and species composition within two focal areas differing in landscape structure. We sampled bats via acoustic monitoring and insects with flight interception traps in banana and pineapple monoculture plantations and two nearby protected forested areas within the area of Sarapiquí, Costa Rica. Our results revealed that general occurrence and feeding activity of bats was higher above plantations compared to forested areas. We also recorded higher species richness at recording sites in plantations. This trend was especially strong within a fragmented landscape, with only four species recorded in forests, but 12 above pineapple plantations. Several bat species, however, occurred only once or twice above plantations, and forest specialist species such as Centronycteris centralis, Myotis riparius and Pteronotus mesoamericanus were only recorded at forest sites. Our results indicated, that mostly mobile open space and edge foraging bat species can use plantations as potential foraging habitat and might even take advantage of temporal insect outbreaks. However, forests are vital refugia for several species, including slower flying forest specialists, and thus a prerequisite to safeguard bat diversity within agricultural dominated landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2908580739,"The visual color-word Stroop task is widely used in clinical and research settings as a measure of cognitive control. Numerous neuroimaging studies have used color-word Stroop tasks to investigate the neural resources supporting cognitive control, but to our knowledge all have used unimodal (typically visual) Stroop paradigms. Thus, it is possible that this classic measure of cognitive control is not capturing the resources involved in multisensory cognitive control. The audiovisual integration and crossmodal correspondence literatures identify regions sensitive to congruency of auditory and visual stimuli, but it is unclear how these regions relate to the unimodal cognitive control literature. In this study we aimed to identify brain regions engaged by crossmodal cognitive control during an audiovisual color-word Stroop task, and how they relate to previous unimodal Stroop and audiovisual integration findings. First, we replicated previous behavioral audiovisual Stroop findings in an fMRI-adapted audiovisual Stroop paradigm: incongruent visual information increased reaction time towards an auditory stimulus and congruent visual information decreased reaction time. Second, we investigated the brain regions supporting cognitive control during an audiovisual color-word Stroop task using fMRI. Similar to unimodal cognitive control tasks, a left superior parietal region exhibited an interference effect of visual information on the auditory stimulus. This superior parietal region was also identified using a standard audiovisual integration localizing procedure, indicating that audiovisual integration resources are sensitive to cognitive control demands. Facilitation of the auditory stimulus by congruent visual information was found in posterior superior temporal cortex, including in the posterior STS which has been found to support audiovisual integration. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, often implicated in unimodal Stroop tasks, was not modulated by the audiovisual Stroop task. Overall the findings indicate that an audiovisual color-word Stroop task engages overlapping resources with audiovisual integration and overlapping but distinct resources compared to unimodal Stroop tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2908842124,"There is growing concern that online information searchers are overconfident and therefore largely search for information which reinforces their prior attitudes, blinded by confirmation bias. This study tests if this effect can be reduced in content aggregation platforms, when social tag clouds show popular topics among experts. We manipulated (1) confidence in prior attitudes, and (2) the credibility of the expert community that tagged the content. We found that both factors influence navigation in different ways. First, attitude confidence moderated the influence of prior attitudes when choosing how much attitude-consistent content in blog posts to read. When attitude confidence was high, prior attitudes were positively associated with selection of blog posts, when low, not positively associated. After navigation, when confidence was high, the content of attitude-consistent blog posts was more favourably evaluated, whereas when confidence was low, attitude inconsistent blog posts were more favourably evaluated. Second, source credibility moderated the influence of prior attitudes on tag selection. When source credibility was low, prior attitudes did guide tag selection, when high, they did not. With low source credibility, people selected more attitude-consistent content. The findings advance social tagging theories by showing that not only semantic associations, but also attitudes play a role when people select and process tags and related content. The findings also show that credibility and confidence have a different impact on different stages of information selection and evaluation. Whereas credibility is more important when switching among pages, attitude confidence is more important when reading and evaluating the content of one page."
https://openalex.org/W2908996293,"Background During intubation with a blind technique, a left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT) can be misdirected into the right bronchus even though its curved tip of the bronchial lumen turns to the left. This right bronchial misplacement may be associated with the tip angle of DLTs. We thus performed a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that the DLT with an acute tip angle enters the right bronchus less frequently than the tube with an obtuse tip angle. Methods We randomized surgical patients (n = 1427) receiving a polyvinyl chloride left-sided DLT. Before intubation, the curved tip was further bent to an angle of 135° and kept with a stylet inside in the curved-tip group, but not in the control group. After the tip was inserted into the glottis under direct or video laryngoscopy, the stylet was removed and the DLT was advanced into the bronchus with its tip turning to the left. We checked which bronchus was intubated, and the time and number of attempts for intubation. After surgery, we assessed airway injury, sore throat, and hoarseness. The primary outcome was the incidence of right bronchial misplacement of the DLT. Results DLTs were misdirected into the right bronchus more frequently in the control group than in the curved-tip group: 57/715 (8.0%) vs 17/712 (2.4%), risk ratio (95% CI) 3.3 (2.0–5.7), P < 0.001. The difference was significant in the use of 32 (P = 0.003), 35 (P = 0.007), and 37 (P = 0.012) Fr DLTs. Intubation required longer time (P < 0.001) and more attempts (P = 0.002) in the control group. No differences were found in postoperative airway injury, sore throat and hoarseness. Conclusions Before intubation of left-sided DLTs, augmentation of the curved DLT tip reduced the right bronchial misplacement and facilitated intubation without aggravating airway injury."
https://openalex.org/W2909102980,"Antisense molecules used as antibiotics offer the potential to keep up with acquired resistance, by redesigning the sequence of an antisense. Once bacteria acquire resistance by mutating the targeted sequence, new antisense can readily be designed by using sequence information of a target gene. However, antisense molecules require additional delivery vehicles to get into bacteria and be protected from degradation. Based on progress in the last few years it appears that, while redesigning or finding new delivery vehicle will be more difficult than redesigning the antisense cargo, it will perhaps be less difficult than finding new conventional small molecule antibiotics. In this study we propose a protocol that maximizes the combined advantages of engineered delivery vehicle and antisense cargo by decreasing the immediate growth advantage to the pathogen of mutating the entry mechanisms and increasing the advantage to the pathogen of antisense target mutations. Using this protocol, we show by computer simulation an appropriately designed antisense therapy can potentially be effective many times longer than conventional antibiotics before succumbing to resistance. While the simulations describe an in-vitro situation, based on comparison with other in-vitro studies on acquired resistance we believe the advantages of the combination antisense strategy have the potential to provide much more sustainability in vivo than conventional antibiotic therapy."

In this paper, we focus on the influence of infiltration feedback of surface runoff on the formation and characteristics of banded vegetation pattern on hillsides of semiarid area. Firstly, it is shown that the infiltration feedback of surface runoff is an important formation mechanics of the banded vegetation pattern in semiarid area. Then it is found that the patterns formed within the reasonable parameter space are periodic both in space and time and the wave speed of the periodic vegetation stripes become larger with the increase of the infiltration feedback strength, while the wavelength is negatively correlated with the infiltration feedback strength. At last, it is shown that the mean productivity of grass pattern is lower than that of homogeneous steady state when the infiltration feedback is weak and it is larger than that with stronger infiltration feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2910723464,"Despite the high clinical and epidemiological relevance of persistent depression, little is known about its specific psychopathology and whether it is distinct from recurrent depression. Depression in general has been associated with blunted affective reactivity but the evidence from previous studies is inconsistent. Here, we asked whether affective reactivity might differ between persistent and recurrent depression.Twenty patients with persistent depression, 20 patients with recurrent depression and 20 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Both patient groups showed moderate symptom severity. All participants underwent a sad mood induction procedure. Affective reactivity was assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) before and after mood induction.We found a striking difference in affective reactivity between patient groups. While the persistent group showed blunted reactivity to mood induction, the recurrent group demonstrated an affective response that was comparable to HC, with an increase in negative and a decrease in positive affect. Blunted affective reactivity was thus specifically associated with persistent in contrast to recurrent depression.These results highlight affective reactivity as an important psychopathological feature that differs between the two patient groups. Preserved affective reactivity to emotional stimuli in the recurrent group might reflect a resilience factor against persistence of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2911038963,"Objective Better biomarkers are needed in order to identify patients with endometrial carcinoma at risk of recurrence and who may profit from a more aggressive treatment regimen. Our objective was to explore the applicability of plasma growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) as a marker for recurrent disease, as well as a marker for poor prognosis and lymph node metastases. Methods EDTA-blood samples were obtained from 235 patients with endometrial cancer before primary surgery. For 36 of these patients, matching blood samples were collected at time of recurrence. Blood samples were also collected from 78 patients with endometrial hyperplasia. Plasma GDF-15 was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Preoperative pelvic MRI scans for 141 patients were investigated in parallel for imaging variables. Results Preoperative plasma level of GDF-15 was significantly higher for patients who experienced recurrence (1780 ng/L; 95% CI; 518–9475 ng/L) than for patients who did not develop recurrent disease (1236 ng/L; 95% CI; 307–7030 ng/L) (p<0.001). Plasma levels of GDF-15 at recurrence (2818 ng/L, 95% CI 2088–3548 ng/L) were significantly higher than plasma levels of GDF-15 measured at time of primary diagnosis (1857 ng/L, 95% CI; 1317–2398 ng/L) (p = 0.001). High plasma level GDF-15 independently predicts recurrent disease (OR = 3.14; 95% CI 2.10–4.76) and lymph node metastases (OR = 2.64; 95% CI 1.52–4.61). Patients with high plasma level of GDF-15 had significantly larger tumor volume (p = 0.008). Conclusion Elevated plasma level of GDF-15 is associated with aggressive disease and lymph node metastasis in endometrial carcinoma. GDF-15 may be helpful in indicating recurrent disease."
https://openalex.org/W2908954919,"Over the past several decades there have been dramatic shifts in demographic patterns pertaining to family formation, with declining and delayed marriage and childbearing, and increased cohabitation in the United States and other Western industrialized nations. These trends in family demography have been predominantly studied using large-scale datasets, which have identified total population and subgroup trends over time, including differences by age, gender, racial/ethnic, economic, educational, religious, and other characteristics. However, there is limited knowledge and understanding of how individuals across different levels of social position, as well as other important characteristics, make decisions around forming families. This lack of qualitative data on contemporary attitudes regarding family formation has hampered our ability to more completely understand the factors driving behaviors pertaining to the large-scale (ie, international) shifts in demographic trends. The Social Position and Family Formation (SPAFF) project is an in-depth interview study that used quantitative data to guide recruitment of a large sample for qualitative interview data collection on factors influencing different aspects of family formation among heterosexual females and males (18-35 years) in the context of individuals' social position. This methodological paper describes the use of a 'quantitatively-informed' purposive sampling approach in a large metropolitan area to collect qualitative data (through in-depth interviews) from a large sample (n = 200), utilizing web-based tools for successful community-based recruitment and project management."

Because methods for the analysis of multiple cldn interaction are limited, we have established the heterologous Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system for TJ protein assembly and interaction analysis. Oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding human cldn-1, -2, or -3 or with a combination of these and were incubated in pairs for interaction analysis. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed, and membrane contact areas were analyzed morphometrically and by freeze fracture electron microscopy. Cldns were specifically detected in membranes of expressing oocytes, and coincubation of oocytes resulted in adhesive contact areas that increased with incubation time. Adjacent membrane areas revealed specific cldn signals, including “kissing-point”–like structures representing homophilic trans-interactions of cldns. Contact areas of oocytes expressing a combination markedly exceeded those expressing single cldns, indicating effects on adhesion. Ultra-structural analysis revealed a self-assembly of TJ strands and a cldn-specific strand morphology.—Vitzthum, C., Stein, L., Brunner, N., Knittel, R., Fallier-Becker, P., Amasheh, S.

https://openalex.org/W2909261074,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is a key element of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing and presentation pathway. Nonfunctional TAP complexes impair the translocation of cytosol-derived proteolytic peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. This drastic reduction in the available peptide repertoire leads to a significant decrease in MHC class I cell surface expression. Using mass spectrometry, different studies have analyzed the cellular MHC class I ligandome from TAP-deficient cells, but the analysis of the parental proteins, the source of these ligands, still deserves an in-depth analysis. In the present report, several bioinformatics protocols were applied to investigate the nature of parental proteins for the previously identified TAP-independent MHC class I ligands. Antigen processing in TAP-deficient cells mainly focused on small, abundant or highly integral transmembrane proteins of the cellular proteome. This process involved abundant proteins of the central RNA metabolism. In addition, TAP-independent ligands were preferentially cleaved from the N- and C-terminal ends with respect to the central regions of the parental proteins. The abundance of glycine, proline and aromatic residues in the C-terminal sequences from TAP-independently processed proteins allows the accessibility and specificity required for the proteolytic activities that generates the TAP-independent ligandome. This limited proteolytic activity towards a set of preferred proteins in a TAP-negative environment would therefore suffice to promote the survival of TAP-deficient individuals."

The establishment of intestinal microflora is affected by a variety of factors such as species, environmental factors, developmental stage, organizational structure and physiological characteristics of various parts of the digestive tract. Gene editing technology such as ZFN has recently been used as a new approach to replace the traditional transgenic technology and to make genetic modifications in animals. However, it is not known if genetic modification by gene editing technology will have any impact on gut microbiota. In this study, by sequencing 16S rRNA collected from rectum, we investigated the effects of ZFN-mediated myostatin (MSTN) loss-of-function mutation (MSTN-/-) on gut microbiota in Meishan pigs. Our results showed that the fecal microbial composition is very similar between MSTN-/- Meishan pigs and wild type Meishan pigs. Although significant differences in certain individual strains were observed, all the dominant microorganism species are basically the same between MSTN-/- and wild type pigs. However, these differences do not adversely affect MSTN-/- Meishan pigs. Thus, it is concluded that ZFN-mediated MSTN loss-of-function mutation did not have any adverse effect on the gut microbiota in Meishan pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2909945473,"Plant oil utilization in aquafeeds is still the most practical option, although it decreases the content of the nutritionally highly valuable omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) in fish. Phytoestrogens and their metabolites are putatively able to affect genes encoding proteins centrally involved in the biosynthesis of EPA and DHA due to their estrogenic potential. Thus, the aim of the study was to screen the potential of the phytoestrogens to stimulate the biosynthesis of EPA and DHA in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Additionally, the potential effects on growth performance, nutrient composition and hepatic lipid metabolism in rainbow trout were investigated. For that, a vegetable oil based diet served as a control diet (C) and was supplemented with 15 g/kg dry matter of biochanin A (BA), daidzein (DA), genistein (G) and equol (EQ), respectively. These five diets were fed to rainbow trout (initial body weight 83.3 ± 0.4 g) for 52 days. Growth performance and nutrient composition of whole body homogenates were not affected by the dietary treatments. Furthermore, feeding EQ to rainbow trout significantly increased DHA levels by +8% in whole body homogenates compared to samples of fish fed the diet C. A tendency towards increased DHA levels in whole body homogenates was found for fish fed the diet G. Fish fed diets BA and DA lacked these effects. Moreover, EQ and G fed fish showed significantly decreased hepatic mRNA steady state levels for fatty acyl desaturase 2a (delta-6) (fads2a(d6)). In contrast, carnitine palmitoyl transferases 1 (cpt1) hepatic mRNA steady state levels and hepatic Fads2a(d6) protein contents were not affected by the dietary treatment. In conclusion, when combined with dietary vegetable oils, equol and genistein seem to stimulate the biosynthesis of DHA and thereby increase tissue DHA levels in rainbow trout, however, only to a moderate extent."

One hundred twelve participants underwent binocular vision assessment by evaluating horizontal heterophoria, horizontal and vertical fusional vergence ranges and vergence facility. The subjects were classified into two groups: binocular anomalies and normal binocular function. Neck complaints were measured with the Neck Disability Index, visual analogue scale, cervical range of motion, deep-flexor muscle activation score (AS) and performance index (PI). Our results showed that participants with low AS had significantly altered values of lateral phoria (near) (mean = -6.99 SD ± 6.96 PD) and PFV (near) blur (mean = 9.49 SD ± 5.45 PD) against those who presented normal AS (lateral phoria (near) mean = -3.64 SD ± 6.37 PD; PFV (near) blur mean = 12.84 SD ± 6.20 PD). In addition, participants with NFV (near) recovery outside the norm had a significantly lower right side-bending (mean = 35.63 SD ± 8.35 PD) than those within the standard (mean = 39.64 SD ± 9 PD). The subjects with binocular vision impairment showed a diminished response to the deep cervical musculature, with low AS and PI, as well as a tendency to suffer from cervicalgia of more than three months’ evolution and a lower range of motion."

The growth and reproduction of crabs are closely related to the photoperiod. However, as of yet, there are still no transcriptomic reports of eyestalk ganglions treated under different photoperiods in the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), which is a benthonic crab with high commercial value in Asia. In this study, we collected the eyestalk ganglions of crabs that were reared under different photoperiods, including a control group (L: D = 12 h: 12 h, named CC), a constant light group (L: D = 24 h: 0 h, named LL) and a constant darkness group (L: D = 0 h: 24 h, named DD). RNA sequencing was performed on these tissues in order to examine the effects of different photoperiods. The total numbers of clean reads from the CC, LL and DD groups were 48,772,584 bp, 53,943,281 bp and 53,815,178 bp, respectively. After de novo assembly, 161,380 unigenes were obtained and were matched with different databases. The DEGs were significantly enriched in phototransduction and energy metabolism pathways. Results from RT-qPCR showed that TRP channel protein (TRP) in the phototransduction pathway had a significantly higher level of expression in LL and DD groups than in the CC group. We found that the downregulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) gene and the upregulation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PPC) gene were involved in energy metabolism processes in LL or DD. In addition, we also found that the upregulation of the expression level of the genes Gαq, pyruvate kinase (PK), NADH peroxidase (NADH) and ATPase is involved in phototransduction and energy metabolism. These results may shed some light on the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of photoperiod in physiological activity of E. sinensis."
https://openalex.org/W2908745892,"There has been a significant rise in global antibiotic use in recent years. Development of resistance has been linked to easy accessibility, lack of regulation of sale, increased tendency to self-medicate and the lack of public knowledge. The increase in antibiotic misuse, including self-medication, has not been well documented in developing countries. Antibiotic use prior to visiting health facilities has been found to be prevalent in developing countries. It has been identified by some studies to increase the likelihood of missed diagnoses and influence the outcome of bacteriological tests. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence of prior antibiotic use through a cross-sectional survey of patients undergoing laboratory tests at two health facilities in Ghana. Face-to-face questionnaires were used to interview 261 individuals chosen by random sampling of patients visiting the bacteriology laboratory of the hospitals within a two-month period. The questionnaire investigated participant demographic characteristics, knowledge about antibiotics and the nature of antibiotic use. Antibiotic property detection bioassay was performed on patient’s urine sample using a disk diffusion method to accurately determine antibiotic use within 72 hours. Culture results were used as an index to evaluate the effect of prior antibiotic use on bacteriological tests. Out of a 261 participants enrolled, 19.9% (95% CI, 14.9–24.9) acknowledged using antibiotics prior to their visit to the laboratory during the study period. On the contrary, 31.4% (95% CI, 25.7–37.5) of participants’ urine samples were positive for antimicrobial activity. Participants within the age ranges of 20–30, 31–40 and 41–50 years had significantly lower odds of urine antimicrobial activity. Participants who had urine antimicrobial activity were more likely to have no growth on their culture plates than participants who had no urine antimicrobial activity [OR 2.39(1.37–4.18), p = 0.002]. The most commonly used antibiotics were the penicillins, fluoroquinolones and metronidazole. Although, majority of the participant (54.8%) had knowledge of antibiotics, most of them had inadequate information on their proper use. The commonest indications for antibiotic use were aches and pains (30.3%), diarrhoea (43.3%) and urinary tract infections (28.0%). Prior antibiotic use was found to increase the likelihood of obtaining a culture negative result and can affect the outcome of bacteriological tests."
https://openalex.org/W2910885161,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may contribute to ischemia-induced angiogenesis in atherosclerotic diseases. The protein kinase C (PKC) family is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, however the role of PKCα in EPCs during angiogenesis is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PKCα in EPCs during angiogenesis. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a PKCα activator, significantly increased the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -2 and -9 in human (late outgrowth) EPCs in vitro. The MMPs promoted the migratory function and vascular formation of EPCs, which then contributed to neovascularization in a mouse hindlimb-ischemia model. Reactive oxygen species derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enhanced the expression of MMPs to increase the bioactivity of EPCs during angiogenesis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway was associated with the activation of NADPH oxidase. PMA extensively activated the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk) signal pathway to increase the expression of MMP-9. PMA also activated the p38, Erk, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signal pathways to increase the expression of MMP-2. PMA-stimulated EPCs enhanced neovascularization in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia via nuclear factor-κB translocation to up-regulation of the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. PMA could activate PKCα and promote the angiogenesis capacity of human EPCs via NADPH oxidase-mediated, redox-related, MMP-2 and MMP-9 pathways. The PKCα-activated, NADPH oxidase-mediated, redox-related MMP pathways could contribute to the function of human EPCs for ischemia-induced neovascularization, which may provide novel insights into the potential modification of EPCs for therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2908615484,"β-alanine is the rate-limiting point for the endogenous synthesis of carnosine in skeletal muscle. Carnosine has a wide range of implications for health, normal function and exercise performance. Whilst the physiological relevance of carnosine to different tissues remains enigmatic, β-alanine administration is a useful strategy to investigate the physiological roles of carnosine in humans. Intravenous administration of β-alanine is an interesting approach to study carnosine metabolism. However, sterilisation is mandatory due to the nature of the administration route. We evaluated whether sterilising doses of gamma radiation damages the molecular structure and leads to the loss of functional characteristics of β-alanine. Pure β-alanine was sterilised by gamma radiation in sealed glass vials using a 60Co multipurpose irradiator at a dose rate of 8.5 kGy.hour-1 totalising 10, 20, 25 30 and 40 kGy. The molecular integrity was assessed by X-ray Diffraction and changes in content were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UV-HPLC) and Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (HPLC/MS-MS). Sterility assurance was evaluated by inoculation assay. To examine whether functional properties were preserved, β-alanine was infused in one participant, who rated the level of paraesthesia on the skin using a 0-3 scale. Urinary β-alanine was quantified before and 24-h following β-alanine infusion using HPLC-ESI+-MS/MS. Irradiation resulted in no change in the crystal structure of β-alanine, no degradation, and no new peaks were identified in the dose range assayed. The inoculation assay showed the absence of viable microorganisms in all β-alanine samples, including those that did not undergo irradiation. Intravenous infusion of β-alanine resulted in paraesthesia and it detected in the urine as per normal. We conclude that gamma radiation is a suitable technique for the sterilisation of β-alanine. It does not lead to degradation, damage to the β-alanine structure, content or loss of function within the evaluated irradiation conditions."

The independent-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA analysis and Bonferroni and Tamhane T3 post-hoc test, the stepwise multivariate regression analysis were adopted by IBM SPSS, version 22.0.226 serum samples met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The mean LTG serum concentration was 5.48±3.83 μg/mL. There were no gender differences (P = 0.64), and there were no significant effects by age on LTG serum concentration after age stratification (3-14 years old, 14-45 years old, 45-59 years old) (P = 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that the daily LTG dose and co-administration of other AEDs significantly affected LTG serum concentrations. Combination with enzyme-inducer AEDs, the mean steady-state LTG concentration could be decreased by 30.73% compared with LTG monotherapy. Among enzyme-inducer AEDs, particularly strong inducer Carbamazepine (CBZ) could decrease the mean LTG concentration by 53.65%, but weak inducer AEDs such as Oxcarbazepine (OXC) and Topiramate (TPM) had no effect, Valproic acid (VPA) could increase the mean LTG concentration by 93.95%, and the inducer only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of VPA in triple combination.There were no significant gender and age effects, but the LTG daily dose and co-administration of other AEDs significantly affected LTG serum concentration. Combination with enzyme-inducer AEDs, especially CBZ could significantly decrease LTG serum concentrations, VPA could significantly increase LTG serum concentrations, and the inducer only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of VPA in triple combination. In the clinical setting, these findings can help to estimate LTG concentrations and adjust dosage and evaluate adverse drug reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2910653961,"In this paper, a novel unequal error protection (UEP) technique is proposed for video streaming over multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Based on the concept of hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) UEP and multi-antenna UEP, the proposed technique combines the relative protection levels (PLs) of constellation symbols and the differentiated PLs of the transmit antennas. In the proposed technique, standard square quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations are used instead of HQAM so that the QAM mapper at the transmitter side and the soft decision calculation at the receiver side remain unchanged, but the UEP benefit of HQAM is retained. The superior performance of the proposed technique is explained by the improved connections between data with various priorities and data paths with various PLs. The assumed video compression method is H.264/AVC, which is known to be commercially successful. The IEEE802.16m system is adopted as a data transmission system. With the aid of realistic simulations in strict accordance with the standards of IEEE802.16m systems and H.264/AVC video compression systems, the proposed technique HQAM-multi-antenna UEP is shown to improve the video quality significantly for a given average bit error rate when compared with previous techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2910268302,"We study the optimal interventions of a regulator (a central bank or government) on the illiquidity default contagion process in a large, heterogeneous, unsecured interbank lending market. The regulator has only partial information on the interbank connections and aims to minimize the fraction of final defaults with minimal interventions. We derive the analytical results of the asymptotic optimal intervention policy and the asymptotic magnitude of default contagion in terms of the network characteristics. We extend the results of Amini, Cont and Minca's work to incorporate interventions and adopt the dynamics of Amini, Minca and Sulem's model to build heterogeneous networks with degree sequences and initial equity levels drawn from arbitrary distributions. Our results generate insights that the optimal intervention policy is ""monotonic"" in terms of the intervention cost, the closeness to invulnerability and connectivity. The regulator should prioritize interventions on banks that are systematically important or close to invulnerability. Moreover, the regulator should keep intervening on a bank once having intervened on it. Our simulation results show a good agreement with the theoretical results."
