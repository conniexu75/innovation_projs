https://openalex.org/W1969979508,"The mutant human cell line 11.1 is unresponsive to interferon alpha. Here we describe the genetic complementation of this mutant and the identification and cloning of the wild-type gene that corrects the defect. Using transfection with genomic DNA in conjunction with a powerful back-selection, we isolated a cosmid that reverts the mutant phenotype of 11.1 cells. The cosmid encodes a single message whose level is greatly reduced in mutant cells. Complementary DNAs were cloned and found to be virtually identical to tyk2, a human mRNA encoding a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase of previously unknown function. This finding shows that tyk2 links the interferon alpha/beta receptor to the cytoplasmic transcription factor that mediates activation of interferon-responsive genes."

https://openalex.org/W1564202134,"To test directly whether mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) protects the lung epithelium from oxygen-induced injury, transgenic mice were produced in which the expression of human Mn-SOD mRNA was directly by transcriptional elements from the human pulmonary surfactant protein C gene. Human Mn-SOD mRNA was expressed in a lung-specific manner, and increased Mn-SOD protein was detected within mitochondria of alveolar Type II and nonciliated bronchiolar cells of the distal respiratory epithelium of the transgenic mice. The activity of Mn-SOD, but not catalase, CuZn-SOD, or glutathione peroxidase, was increased in lungs of transgenic mice. Transgenic mice were highly protected from lung injury during exposure to 95% oxygen, surviving significantly longer than nontransgenic littermates. Pulmonary pathology demonstrated decreased hemorrhage, hyaline membrane formation, and alveolar and interstitial edema in transgenic animals. The finding that increased Mn-SOD in distal respiratory epithelial cells confers protection from oxygen injury provides a basis for novel therapies to protect lung from injury during oxygen therapy of acute and chronic lung diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1521031916,"It is not known whether one or both of the interleukin 1 (IL1) receptors mediates the induction of the DNA-binding protein NF-kappa B. Nuclear extracts of the murine lines EL4.NOB.1 and 70Z/3, which bear the type I (80 kDa) and type II (67 kDa) IL1 receptor, respectively, were analyzed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A 265-base pair sequence of the human serum amyloid A gene or a synthetic oligonucleotide each containing the NF-kappa B site were used as the DNA probes. IL1 induction of NF-kappa B was rapid (optimal at 15-30 min) and transient in both cell types. The IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra), which binds strongly to the type I receptor, inhibited the NF-kappa B response in both cell lines. IL1ra did not bind to the type II receptor on 70Z/3 cells as judged by competition for binding with 125I-IL1 alpha. When 125I-IL1ra binding to 70Z/3 cells was measured, a small number (10/cell) of high affinity sites (Kd = 5 x 10(-12) M) were detected. These were likely to have been type I receptor because an antibody to this inhibited the NF-kappa B induction in 70Z/3 cells (as well as EL4). Potential signal transduction mechanisms involving protein kinase C or oxygen radicals were studied. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced NF-kappa B with a similar time course to IL1 in 70Z/3 but only after 4 h in EL4.IL1 was unaffected by a protein kinase C inhibitor (staurosporine). H2O2 did not mimic IL1, and IL1 was not inhibited by an antioxidant. The type I receptor mediates the induction of NF-kappa B in response to IL1 via a signaling mechanism that still remains to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1536183747,"Recoverin is a recently identified Ca(2+)-binding protein that imparts Ca2+ sensitivity to vertebrate photoreceptor guanylate cyclase. In response to photo-induced depletion of intracellular cGMP and Ca2+, recoverin stimulates resynthesis of cGMP. Bovine retinal recoverin has now been analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for post-translational modifications that might influence its activity. Heterogeneous acylation was detected at the NH2 terminus of bovine retinal recoverin. The NH2-terminal glycine of each retinal recoverin molecule is linked to one of four different types of acyl groups. The most abundant is myristoleate (14:1), but 14:0, 14:2, and 12:0 acyl residues are also present."
https://openalex.org/W1506213416,"Phototransduction results from a cascade of reactions that culminate in a neuronal signal. Photoisomerization of rhodopsin's chromophore, 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, leads to the formation of the activated photoproduct metarhodopsin II (Meta II). Subsequently, Meta II initiates the excitation events by activating many copies of the rod cell-specific G-proteins (Gt or transducin). To terminate the signal, the long-lived Meta II must be quenched. Deactivation of Meta II involves phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase followed by the binding of arrestin. In order to recycle rhodopsin for phototransduction, arrestin must dissociate, and the chromophore must be replaced. In this study, we show that the reduction of the photolyzed chromophore all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol is essential for recycling photoactivated rhodopsin. Once this reduction has occurred, the arrestin blockade of the receptor is removed, the chromophore site becomes accessible for regeneration, and the phosphates can be hydrolyzed. If the reduction does not occur, we demonstrate that free all-trans-retinal can react with the apoprotein to form pseudo-photoproducts that are spectrally identical to the photoinduced metarhodopsin species (Meta I/II/III). The Meta II-like product, M380, interacts tightly with arrestin and kinase, however, it does not measurably interact with Gt. The persistent blockade by arrestin and the low affinity for Gt together prevent activation of the visual cascade. Therefore, any insufficiency in the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol may lead to the accumulation of M380-arrestin in situ, which may effect adaptational processes."
https://openalex.org/W1602373369,"SecA protein, a principal component of the protein export machinery of Escherichia coli, is found both in the cytoplasm and inner membrane of cells. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the interaction of SecA with the inner membrane requires the presence of physiological levels of anionic (acidic) phospholipids. In this report the degree of SecA insertion into model membranes and the conformational changes associated with this event have been examined. The extent of association of SecA with model membranes was determined by photolabeling with a hydrophobic reagent, and the depth of insertion of the protein into the phospholipid bilayer was determined by the amount of quenching of SecA fluorescence by both brominated and spin-labeled phospholipids. These methods demonstrated that SecA penetrates deep within the acyl chain region of the phospholipid bilayer. It was also found that SecA penetration into vesicles was associated with a major conformational change in the protein. This change can be induced by higher temperatures and involves a partial unfolding event as judged by differential scanning calorimetry, SecA fluorescence and increased sensitivity to proteolysis. These properties suggest the induction of a molten-globule-like conformation in a portion of the SecA polypeptide. This change was also induced at lower temperatures by the presence of membranes containing a physiological amount of the anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol. The partial unfolding and concomitant deep insertion of SecA into membranes may aid in the insertion of precursor proteins into the inner membrane and may influence possible interactions between SecA and the integral membrane export machinery components."
https://openalex.org/W1546215558,"We have investigated the volume-activated transport of organic solutes in flounder erythrocytes. Osmotic swelling of cells suspended in a Na(+)-free medium led to increased membrane transport of taurine, glucose, and uridine. For each compound there was a significant lag period (1-2 min at 10 degrees C) between cell swelling and activation of the flux. The volume-activated fluxes of each of the substrates increased in parallel with increasing cell volume, and those of taurine and uridine increased linearly with concentration (up to 19 mM). The volume-activated fluxes of each of the three compounds showed similar sensitivities to a number of anion-selective channel blockers (5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid > 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid approximately MK-196 > niflumic acid > furosemide); the IC50 for the inhibition of the volume-activated fluxes by NPPB was around 12 microM. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the volume-activated transport of organic osmolytes is via a pathway with the characteristics of a volume-activated chloride channel. This raises the question of whether the transport of organic substrates might represent a physiological role for such channels in other cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2070314562,"Isolated plasma membranes attached to a solid substratum at 4 degrees C have numerous clathrin-coated pits. These pits initially are flat but become deeply invaginated after warming to 37 degrees C. The pits remain tethered to the membrane in this rounded condition unless supplied with ATP, Ca2+, and cytosol. We now show that when cytosol is treated to remove the Ca(2+)-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein annexin VI, coated pit budding no longer takes place. Addition of purified annexin VI back to the annexin VI-depleted cytosol restores budding activity to normal. Purified annexin VI alone shows only a modest budding activity, suggesting that the cytosol contains a factor(s) in addition to annexin VI that is required for full activity. Cytosol-dependent activation of annexin VI requires both ATP and Ca2+. Annexin VI appears to be not only an active component in the detachment of coated pits from the membrane but also a site for regulating the formation of coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1597644488,"Caldesmon is an actin-binding protein present in smooth muscle cells that also inhibits actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. To assess the possible role of caldesmon in the regulation of smooth contraction, we investigated the effects of synthetic peptides on force directly recorded from single hyperpermeable smooth muscle cells of ferret aorta and portal vein. GS17C, a peptide that contains the residues from Gly651 to Ser667 of the caldesmon sequence plus an added cysteine at the C terminus, binds calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and also binds to F-actin but does not inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity (Zhan, Q., Wong, S.S., and Wang, C.-L.A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21810-21814). In cells in which Ca2+ was clamped at pCa 7.0, GS17C induced a dose-dependent contraction (EC50 = 0.92 microM) in aorta cells, whereas it evoked little or no contraction in portal vein cells. The GS17C-induced contraction in aorta cells was inhibited at higher Ca2+ concentrations (above pCa 6.6) and by pretreatment with calmodulin. Another peptide, C16AA, which contains the residues from Ala594 to Ala609 and does not bind actin or calmodulin, did not induce contraction. Our results strongly suggest that GS17C induces contraction by the displacement of the inhibitory region of endogenous caldesmon and, furthermore, that caldesmon present in these smooth muscle cells regulates contraction by providing a basal resting inhibition of vascular tone."
https://openalex.org/W1484122498,"The mechanism of action of prolactin (PRL) has remained obscure despite the unveiling of the primary structure of PRL receptors. The present study demonstrates rapid PRL receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of at least three cellular proteins, designated p120, p97, and p40, in a rat T-lymphoma (Nb2-11C) as revealed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. One of the phosphotyrosyl proteins, p120, co-purified with activated PRL receptor complexes obtained using either anti-ligand or anti-receptor antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro incubation of affinity-purified PRL receptor complexes from PRL-stimulated cells with ATP in the presence of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, resulted in a 10-15-fold increase in the phosphotyrosine content of p120, as revealed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Parallel experiments utilizing [gamma-32P]ATP confirmed a rapid and time-dependent incorporation of phosphate into p120 in the same affinity-purified PRL receptor complexes. These data provide strong evidence for the involvement of a tyrosine kinase in PRL signal transduction and suggest the presence of a tyrosine kinase within the activated PRL receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1528776288,"An approximately 64-kDa cytoplasmic protein is rapidly phosphorylated in tyrosine in the response of macrophages to colony stimulating factor-1. To identify this protein, BAC1.2F5 macrophages were incubated with or without colony stimulating factor-1, the phosphotyrosine-containing portion of their cytosolic fractions subjected to size exclusion chromatography, and the 45-70-kDa fraction further fractionated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Tryptic peptides of pooled RP-HPLC fractions from stimulated cells (containing the approximately 64-kDa protein and an approximately 54-kDa protein) and from unstimulated cells (containing the approximately 54-kDa protein alone), were sequenced directly. All seven readable sequences of 8 sequenceable peptides present uniquely in the stimulated fraction were present in the sequence of the src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1C (PTP-1C). The identity of the approximately 64-kDa protein was confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody raised to a PTP-1C peptide. The rapid, growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP-1C suggests that it may be involved in very early events in growth factor signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1898589556,"Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is an ubiquitous protein that functions in peptide elongation during mRNA translation. We previously reported the isolation of a rat S1 protein that is antigenically related to statin, a nonproliferation-specific protein; this S1 gene shares a high degree of homology to EF-1 alpha. We constructed specific riboprobes to the two genes, based on the difference in the 3' noncoding regions of both S1 and EF-1 alpha mRNAs. Northern analysis and RNase protection assays have revealed that S1 mRNA is present only in brain, heart, and muscle, while EF-1 alpha mRNA has been detected in all tissues surveyed so far. The same tissue specificity has been observed in mouse, suggesting that S1 expression is conserved between these two mammalian species. S1 transcript was detected in late brain embryogenesis (day 20), but in lower amounts than in 3-month-old adult brain. We show that the relative levels of both S1 and EF-1 alpha transcripts and their respective tissue abundances remain unchanged during the aging process. The function of S1 is not yet known; but these results suggest that it may be involved in specific control mechanisms for protein synthesis in tissues where cells (i.e. neurons and myocytes) are permanently locked in a state of nonproliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2057629508,"retinal degeneration slow (rds) is a semidominant mutation of mice with the phenotype of abnormal development of rod and cone photoreceptors, followed by their slow degeneration. The rds gene has been putatively cloned and its novel protein product initially characterized biochemically. In the present study we undertook to correct in vivo the retinal phenotype of mice with the rds mutation. We assembled a transgene containing a regulatory segment of the opsin gene positioned upstream of the wild-type rds coding region. Mice from three transgenic lines, homozygous for the rds mutation, were analyzed for expression of the transgene and for their retinal phenotypes. In two high expressing lines, we observed complete reversion to wild-type retinal morphology. In a third, low expressing line, we observed a retinal phenotype intermediate between wild type and rds/rds, suggesting partial rescue of the mutation. These results constitute formal proof that we have cloned the rds gene."
https://openalex.org/W1562277283,"p11, a member of the S100 protein family, forms a stable heterotetrameric complex with annexin II. The p11-binding site of annexin II resides in the N-terminal 14 residues, which form an amphiphatic alpha-helix with the hydrophobic face representing the contact site for p11 (Johnsson, N., Marriott, G., and Weber, K. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 2435-2442). We show that a corresponding peptide can be used to purify recombinant p11 by affinity chromatography. To map the annexin II-binding site on p11, we have produced progressively truncated p11 derivatives by site-directed mutagenesis. Our analysis reveals that a highly hydrophobic region between residues 85 and 91 is indispensable for annexin II-binding. It is located in the C-terminal extension, following the second distorted EF-hand. Using a series of single amino acid replacements, we have identified individual hydrophobic residues, which seem to represent contact points for annexin II. Most notably, substitution of tyrosine 85 or phenylalanine 86 by alanine drastically reduces the affinity of p11 for annexin II, whereas replacement of these residues by tryptophan has no or only a marginal effect. Thus, hydrophobic side chains on both annexin II and p11 are involved in complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1518838479,"Abstract In this study, we report that sphingosine is a potent inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release. Evidence is presented demonstrating a direct effect of sphingosine on the SR ryanodine receptor. Calcium release from rabbit skeletal muscle fibers and isolated junctional SR derived from the terminal cisternae (TC) was measured in response to caffeine, doxorubicin, 5'-adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate or calcium. Sphingosine inhibited caffeine-induced release in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.1 microM for the single muscle fibers and 0.5 microM for the isolated TC vesicles. Near complete blockage of TC calcium release rate was observed with 3 microM sphingosine. Neither sphingomyelin nor sphingosylphosphorylcholine had any effect at the 3 microM level, suggesting that the sphingosine effect was specific. Doxorubicin-induced calcium release and spontaneous calcium release were also blocked by sphingosine. Sphingosine was also capable of stimulating calcium transport in the isolated TC vesicles without an effect on Ca-ATPase activity. Ruthenium red was not capable of substantial additional stimulation of calcium transport nor inhibition of calcium release beyond the action of sphingosine. Sphingosine's blockage of calcium release was not reversed by the protein kinase inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2- methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, suggesting that the action of sphingosine on calcium release was not dependent on ryanodine receptor phosphorylation. Sphingosine significantly increased (8-fold) the Kd for specific [3H]ryanodine binding to TC membranes and decreased the Bmax with a dose dependence similar to the inhibition of calcium release, but sphingosine did not affect the pCa tension relationship of skinned skeletal muscle fibers. These data are consistent with a direct effect of submicromolar sphingosine on the ryanodine receptor. Substantially higher concentrations of sphingosine (30-50 microM) or sphingosylphosphorylcholine (10-20 microM) were capable of inducing calcium release by themselves. Preliminary data indicate that the transverse tubule and not the SR contain substantial sphingomyelinase activity consistent with a transverse tubule source of sphingosine production. Considering that sphingosine is found in micromolar concentrations in some cells, our data indicate that sphingosine generated by the transverse tubule membranes may be a physiologically relevant mechanism for modulating SR calcium release."
https://openalex.org/W1994926732,"Mutations in rpsB that reduce the levels of the ribosomal protein S2 enhance the translation of cl in lambda lysogens. Two features of the cl transcript are required for enhanced translation: the absence of a leader and the presence of a downstream box, a sequence within the cl coding region that is complementary to the 16S rRNA. 30S ribosomal subunits deficient in S2 form ternary complexes with the cl transcript more efficiently than wild-type subunits. The absence of S2 may change the structure of the 16S rRNA, improving contacts with the cl downstream box."
https://openalex.org/W1554508620,"We previously observed a peak in parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) mRNA expression in preterm rat myometrium and found that this peak was dependent on intrauterine occupancy. We explored the possibility that mechanotransduction might control PTHrP gene expression in the uterus. This was done by developing an intrauterine balloon system that allowed us to reproduce experimentally the mechanical effects of the fetal pup in utero. An increase in PTHrP mRNA in the unoccupied horn of a unilaterally pregnant rat could be elicited as rapidly as 1 h after balloon inflation and was maintained for up to 72 h. The same response was seen in uterine horns from virgin animals and could be reproduced by three different methods of imposing a physical stretch. Balloon-induced stretch also increased mRNA expression in a muscle bath system in vitro. Mechanotransduction appears to be largely, if not entirely, responsible for the preterm peak in PTHrP mRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W1483854545,"Glycoprotein CD45, a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase of leukocytes, is topographically similar to the epidermal growth factor receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase. Since the latter is thought to be allosterically regulated through conversion between monomeric and dimeric forms, we sought to determine whether CD45 undergoes similar oligomerization. Our analysis, employing a thiol-cleavable and homobifunctional chemical cross-linker, dithiobis succinimidyl propionate, revealed that CD45 indeed formed homodimers. In addition, a protein of molecular mass 30,000 daltons (30 kDa) was found to be associated with both the CD45 monomer and dimer. The 30-kDa protein was phosphorylated and was not labeled by cell surface radioiodination. Distinct differences in protein tyrosine phosphatase activity were detected among the various populations of CD45 separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. However, the differences observed could not be explained simply by dimerization and instead suggest the presence of other factor(s) involved in the regulation of CD45 enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1541127944,"Angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of vascular wall abnormalities. Since aberrant extracellular matrix deposition contributes to the pathogenesis of vessel wall disease, we examined the potential involvement of angiotensin II in the regulation of extracellular matrix synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells. Immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized matrix proteins showed that, under serum-free conditions, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells constitutively produced high levels of fibronectin, small amounts of laminin, and a barely detectable amount of tenascin. Angiotensin II treatment increased synthesis of a 230-kDa tenascin glycoprotein by 9-fold and fibronectin synthesis by only 30-40% during a 24-h treatment period, without stimulating laminin production or a general increase in the synthesis of secreted proteins. Concomitant treatment with saralasin, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II, prevented the stimulation observed with angiotensin II. The stimulation of immunoprecipitable tenascin was preceded by an increase in tenascin mRNA. Levels of tenascin transcripts (8.4 and 7.0 kilobase) were significantly increased within 2 h after angiotensin II treatment, reached a maximum (10- to 12-fold) by 4 h, and remained elevated after 18 h. The induction was completely blocked by actinomycin D. Serum also induced tenascin mRNA, but with a different time course. Serum induction of tenascin mRNA was also evident at 2 h, maximal at 4 h, but declined to control levels at 8 h. These results indicate that angiotensin II exerts a rapid and selective stimulation of tenascin biosynthesis, at least in part at a transcriptional level. This suggests that angiotensin II may alter the composition of the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall by stimulating synthesis of the antiadhesive protein tenascin."
https://openalex.org/W1635347857,"Chromosomal genes for two mouse homologous beta subunits (AIC2A and AIC2B) of the interleukin-3, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-5 receptors were characterized. Both AIC2A and AIC2B genes were present on a 250-kilobase MluI restriction fragment and were mapped on murine chromosome 15 (these loci were provisionally designated as Il3rb-1 (AIC2A) and Il3rb-2 (AIC2B)), closely linked to the c-sis locus. Both genes consist of 14 exons and span about 28 kb each. The major transcription initiation sites of both genes were mapped at 194 bp from the initiation codon. These genes are 95% identical up to 700 bp from the transcription initiation sites. Potential recognition sequences for hemopoietic transcription factors including GATA-1 and PU.1 in addition to a TATA-like sequence are present in the 5'-flanking region. A stretch of 20 bp including the initiation site is homologous to the corresponding region of the erythropoietin receptor and the interleukin-7 receptor genes and to the initiator sequence of the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter, suggesting a possible role in transcription initiation. Comparison of the exon/intron boundaries of AIC2A and AIC2B genes with those of other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily reveals a conserved evolutionary structure. Isolation of various forms of AIC2 cDNAs reveals differential splicing of the transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1529383168,"The mechanisms of generation of second messengers after binding of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) to its receptor remain unknown. We have studied the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the IFN alpha receptor, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody IFNa receptor 3. Immunoblotting experiments showed that IFN alpha induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit in the IFN alpha-sensitive H-929, U-266, and Daudi cell lines. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with 32P-labeled cells showed that the alpha subunit is phosphorylated before IFN alpha treatment and that the level of phosphorylation increases after IFN alpha stimulation. Phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed the IFN alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and demonstrated that the base-line phosphorylation corresponded to serine phosphorylation that increased 50% upon IFN alpha treatment. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit was time- and dose-dependent, further demonstrating the specificity of the process. Phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the receptor occurred rapidly after IFN alpha binding, both at 37 and 4 degrees C. Exposure of the cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocked the IFN alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of this subunit of the IFN alpha receptor. In contrast H7, a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, and acute and chronic exposure to phorbol esters had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that protein kinase C does not regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the IFN alpha receptor. No IFN alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the IFN alpha-resistant U-937 cell line that expresses a variant IFN alpha receptor. Altogether these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit may play a role in the signal transduction pathway of IFN alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1567257037,"The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), a nuclear phosphoprotein, functions as a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in retinoblastoma and other malignancies. The hypophosphorylated forms of Rb are observed in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the hyperphosphorylated forms predominate in S and G2/M phases, suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Rb may regulate progression through the growth cycle. However, little is known about the intracellular signals that regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Rb. We show that D-erythro-sphingosine potently induces early dephosphorylation of Rb. Initial dephosphorylation was observed as early as 1 h after treatment of hematopoietic cells with sphingosine, whereas complete shift to the dephosphorylated form was seen 4 h after treatment. These effects occurred at concentrations of sphingosine as low as 100-500 nM, with maximal effects observed at 1-2.5 microM. These effects were specific to sphingosine, inasmuch as other lipids, amphiphiles, and long chain amino bases, as well as structural analogs of sphingosine, failed to induce dephosphorylation of Rb. Also, activation of second messenger systems including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinases, and calcium ionophores, as well as inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, failed to induce dephosphorylation of Rb. Induction of Rb dephosphorylation by sphingosine preceded inhibition of growth and a specific arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. These studies, for the first time, identify an intracellular activator of Rb."

https://openalex.org/W1630348734,"A synthetic nonapeptide, Val-Leu-Ile-Arg-Ile-Met-Val-Ser-Arg, corresponding to residues 286-294 of annexin-II tetramer (A-IIt), was shown to completely inhibit the Ca(2+)-dependent bundling of F-actin by this protein. The inhibitory effect of the nonapeptide required preincubation with F-actin and was reversed by the addition of excess A-IIt. Kinetic analysis suggested that the nonapeptide reduced the K(0.5) but not the Vmax of F-actin bundling. In contrast, addition of excess nonapeptide to A-IIt-bundled F-actin did not reverse F-actin bundle formation. Although the nonapeptide produced a dose-dependent inhibition of A-IIt-dependent F-actin bundling, the binding of A-IIt to F-actin was not affected. These results identify a domain of A-IIt that is involved in the bundling activity of the protein and suggest that this domain binds transiently with F-actin, resulting in activation of the bundling activity of A-IIt."
https://openalex.org/W1953919449,"Huntington's disease represents the first disorder for which positional cloning techniques successfully localized an autosomal gene--in 1983. Events since that time have proved the gene recalcitrant to identification and characterization. Since 1986, presymptomatic and prenatal testing for Huntington's disease has been available internationally, although on a limited basis. Testing for Huntington's disease provides an excellent model for designing service programs for genetic testing for late-onset, fatal disorders, particularly when the gene is not yet in hand and no therapeutic intervention is possible. Special training and precautions must be in place before presymptomatic genetic testing should be offered."
https://openalex.org/W1604043183,"Abstract Four copies of the coding sequence for a voltage-dependent potassium channel (RBK1, rat Kv1.1) were ligated contiguously and transcribed in vitro. The resulting RNA encodes four covalently linked subunit domains ([4]RBK1). Injection of this RNA into Xenopus oocytes resulted in the expression of voltage-dependent potassium currents. A single amino acid substitution, Tyr-->Val, located within the outer mouth of the pore, introduced into the equivalent position of any of the four domains, reduced affinity for external tetraethylammonium by approximately the same amount. In constructs containing 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 Tyr residues the free energy of binding tetraethylammonium was linearly related to the number of Tyr residues. A different amino acid substitution, Leu-->Ile, located in the S4 region, was made in the equivalent position of one, two, three, or four domains. The depolarization required for channel activation increased approximately linearly with the number of Ile residues, whereas models of independent gating of each domain predict marked nonlinearity. Expression of this concatenated channel provides direct evidence that voltage-dependent potassium channels have four subunits positioned symmetrically around a central permeation pathway and that these subunits interact cooperatively during channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W1508276685,"RNAs that function in mitochondria are typically encoded by the mitochondrial DNA. However, the mitochondrial tRNAs of Trypanosoma brucei are encoded by the nuclear DNA and therefore must be imported into the mitochondrion. It is becoming evident that RNA import into mitochondria is phylogenetically widespread and is essential for cellular processes, but virtually nothing is known about the mechanism of RNA import. We have identified and characterized mitochondrial precursor tRNAs in T. brucei. The identification of mitochondrially located precursor tRNAs clearly indicates that mitochondrial tRNAs are imported as precursors. The mitochondrial precursor tRNAs hybridize to cloned nuclear tRNA genes, label with [alpha-32P]CTP using yeast tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and in isolated mitochondria via an endogenous nucleotidyltransferase-like activity, and are processed to mature tRNAs by Escherichia coli and yeast mitochondrial RNase P. We show that T. brucei mitochondrial extract contains an RNase P activity capable of processing a prokaryotic tRNA precursor as well as the T. brucei tRNA precursors. Precursors for tRNA(Asn) and tRNA(Leu) were detected on Northern blots of mitochondrial RNA, and the 5' ends of these RNAs were characterized by primer extension analysis. The structure of the precursor tRNAs and the significance of nuclear encoded precursor tRNAs within the mitochondrion are discussed."

This PtdIns kinase is not the PtdIns 3-kinase that associates with activated protein tyrosine kinases in fibroblasts, since Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies specific for the p85 alpha subunit of the PtdIns 3-kinase indicate that this polypeptide is not immunoprecipitated by the 4G10 mAb from TCR.CD3-activated Jurkat cells. Moreover, immunoprecipitated PtdIns 3-kinase isolated from T cells with p85 antibodies is inhibited when PtdIns is presented in Nonidet P-40, whereas the PtdIns kinase activity present in 4G10 mAb phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates is enhanced in the presence of Nonidet P-40. In vitro kinase assays of PtdIns 3-kinase immunoprecipitated with p85 antibodies from T cells indicate that it associates with a serine kinase that can phosphorylate a p85 polypeptide. However, no protein tyrosine kinase activity capable of tyrosine phosphorylating p85 in vitro associates with p85 alpha immunoprecipitates in quiescent or TCR.CD3-activated T cells. These data suggest that the TCR.CD3 complex does not regulate PtdIns 3-kinase activity by a mechanism that involves protein tyrosine kinases."

We now report the identification and purification of a protein from bovine kidney cytosol that inhibits both ATPase activity and proton translocating activity of vacuolar H(+)-ATPases. Its relative molecular weight (M(r)) is 6300, similar to that for protein inhibitors of the mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase. The newly identified cytosolic inhibitor protein may participate in the physiologic regulation of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase by suppressing activity directly."
https://openalex.org/W1482542904,"We have examined the signal transduction pathways of a number of cytokines that interact with receptors that are members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. A 97-kDa protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to stimulation of appropriate target cells with interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, or erythropoietin. These data suggest that a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein represents a point of convergence for signal transduction by a number of growth factor receptors that do not have homology with any known protein tyrosine kinase. To address the possibility that p97 may represent a tyrosine kinase involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, we tested the capacity of this protein to bind a tyrosine kinase substrate or ATP. Indeed, a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein purified from IL-2-stimulated lymphoid cells as well as granulocyte-macrophage-CSF-stimulated myeloid cells bound to a polymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine which is a tyrosine kinase substrate. Further, a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein present in both lineages also bound 8-azido-ATP. These data indicate that a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein with properties consistent with those of a protein tyrosine kinase is involved in the signal transduction pathways of certain members of the newly identified hematopoietin receptor superfamily and may represent an early point of convergence in the stimulus-response coupling of multiple cytokine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1546804351,"Earlier studies from our laboratory (Dembo, M., Sirotnak F. M., and Moccio, D. M. (1984) J. Membr. Biol. 78, 9-17) suggested that methotrexate (MTX) efflux from L1210 cells was mediated predominantly by an ATP-dependent, outwardly directed, mechanism. To examine this process further, we utilized predominantly (74%) inside-out plasma membrane vesicle preparations derived from an L1210 cell variant (L1210/R24) with 15-fold reduced Vmax for [3H]MTX influx. Efflux of [3H]MTX, under nonionic buffer conditions, in these inside-out membrane vesicles was temperature and ATP dependent (apparent Km = 0.40 +/- 0.06 mM), osmotically sensitive, and unaffected by protonophores. The presence of K+, Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- at their physiological concentrations had no effect on [3H]MTX efflux. Other triphosphonucleotides (GTP and CTP), but not a nonhydrolyzable analogue, adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), could also stimulate efflux, but to a lesser extent. Also, ATP gamma S and orthovanadate were potent inhibitors of ATP-dependent efflux of [3H]MTX. Other experiments revealed a system with low saturability for [3H]MTX during efflux (apparent Km = 46 +/- 7 microM), but extremely high capacity (106 +/- 15 pmol/min/mg protein), and a pH optimum in the range of 5.5-6. However, appreciable efflux was measured in the physiological range of pH 6.7-6.9. A number of inhibitors or copermeants for ATP-dependent [3H]MTX efflux in intact L1210 cells were inhibitors of ATP-dependent efflux in inside-out plasma membrane vesicles, including, cholate, bromosulfophthalein, verapamil, quinidine, and reserpine. These findings and other results showing that bromosulfophthalein will completely inhibit efflux are consistent with a role for an ATPase in [3H]MTX efflux, and suggest that the process under study is the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive, ATP-dependent route responsible for the majority of [3H]MTX efflux in intact L1210 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1549630000,"The role of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCA) in the regulation of cell proliferation by Ca2+ was investigated by testing the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on cultured pig aorta smooth muscle cells. For this purpose, the PDGF-mediated rise in the Ca2+ concentration was first examined for its ability to induce the formation of prostaglandins from the specific membrane enzyme, cyclooxygenase. In parallel experiments, similar conditions (10 ng/ml PDGF for 24 h) were used to investigate the smooth muscle cell membrane SERCA2 isoforms. Total SERCA2 activity rose by 472% as reflected by their specific formation of phosphorylated intermediate (E approximately P). This rise correlated with an increase in the amount of SERCA2 proteins (100 kDa) as shown by Western blotting. With isoform-specific anti-SERCA2-a and anti-SERCA2-b antibodies, we demonstrated that the increase in total SERCA2 proteins concerned the minor isoform SERCA2-a, which rose 10-fold, whereas SERCA2-b proteins were not affected. Lastly, Northern blotting using riboprobes showed that PDGF treatment increased the SERCA2-a mRNA species by 82%, and concomitantly decreased the SERCA2-b mRNA by 28%, as a result of isoform switching. We conclude that up-regulation of the SERCA2-type Ca(2+)-ATPases occurs in PDGF-treated smooth muscle cells, which suggests that this enzymatic system plays an essential part in cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1566196370,"Cleavage of caldesmon with chymotrypsin yields a series of fragments which bind both calmodulin and actin and inhibit the binding of myosin subfragments to actin and the subsequent stimulation of ATPase activity. Several of these fragments have been purified by cation exchange chromatography and their amino-terminal sequences determined. The smallest fragment has a molecular mass of about 7.3 kDa and extends from Leu597 to Phe665. This polypeptide inhibits the actin-activated ATPase of myosin S-1; this inhibition is augmented by smooth muscle tropomyosin and relieved by Ca(2+)-calmodulin. The binding of the 7.3-kDa fragment to actin is competitive with the binding of S-1 to actin. Thus, this polypeptide has several of the important features characteristic of intact caldesmon. However, although an intact caldesmon molecule covers between six and nine actin monomers, the 7.3-kDa fragment binds to actin in a 1:1 complex. Comparison of this fragment with others suggests that a small region of caldesmon is responsible for at least part of the interaction with both calmodulin and actin."
https://openalex.org/W1480909761,"In order to locate the promoter region of the human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor gene we used RNase protection analysis and antisense RNA probes to map the cap site of the alpha 2 transcripts. Prior sequence analysis has shown two potential TATA box motifs in the human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor gene, TATATAT and TATAAAA, located 427 and 1037 base pairs (bp), respectively, upstream of the protein coding region. RNase protection experiments and primer extension show that transcription starts downstream of the distal TATAAAA, indicating that the 5'-untranslated region is approximately 1 kilobase in length. We have used the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transient transfection into HT29, a human adenocarcinoma cell line that expresses the alpha 2A receptor, to show that as little as 150 bp upstream of the cap site can direct transcription. Sequence analysis shows that although this region contains the TATA box motif it lacks a CCAAT box motif. DNase I footprint analysis of a fragment from -17 to -193 (where +1 is the transcription initiation site), using nuclear extracts from HT29, showed hypersensitive sites (-68/-69) and two protected regions: -70 to -87, which includes a 10-bp palindrome, and -92 to -105, which includes a GC box, a common motif for Sp1 nuclear factor binding. Gel mobility shift assays indicate that Sp1 or a related factor may bind to this GC box. Deletion of the GC box and the palindrome from chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs abolishes transcription. We propose that these cis sequences may function in lieu of a CCAAT box to regulate transcription of the human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1550612495,"The reactive thiol Cys-697 (SH2) in myosin ATPase was labeled with a fluorescent analog of maleimide, 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS) (Hiratsuka, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14941-14948). Although the tryptophan fluorescence of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) was slightly affected by incorporation of the MIANS fluorophore, the tryptophan fluorescence of the resultant S-1 derivative (MIANS-S-1) was enhanced by ATP in a manner similar to that of unlabeled S-1. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of MIANS-S-1 was shown to result from a transfer of the excitation energy from tryptophanyl residue(s) to the MIANS fluorophore attached to SH2, which absorbed and fluoresced maximally at 325 and 418 nm, respectively. The energy transfer measurements were performed in the presence of acrylamide and compared to those performed in the absence of the quencher. The energy transfer efficiencies were found to be unaltered by acrylamide, indicating that the observed fluorescence energy transfer is originated exclusively from the tryptophanyl residue(s) that are not affected by acrylamide, i.e. the ATP-sensitive tryptophanyl residue(s) of S-1 (Torgerson, P. M. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 3002-3007). The distance between the tryptophanyl residue(s) and Cys-697 was calculated to be 27 A assuming a single donor-acceptor pair. Trp-510 is proposed to be one of the ATP-sensitive tryptophanyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1584887870,"In most bacterial cell types studied, low intracellular free calcium is maintained by a variety of secondary exchangers which utilize transmembrane ion gradients. Prokaryotic calcium ATPases appear to be extremely uncommon, and none have been reported in Gram-negative organisms. We demonstrate ATP-dependent calcium uptake in everted membrane vesicles of Flavobacterium odoratum, a common Gram-negative soil and water bacterium. Calcium is transported with an apparent initial rate of 10 nmol/min mg of protein. It is inhibited by 20 microM orthovanadate, a specific P-type ATPase inhibitor, but significantly, it is unaffected by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide, N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, valinomycin, or nigericin. Because the Ca(2+)-ATPase makes up a high proportion of the total ATPase activity it is easily detected by a soluble ATP hydrolysis assay, with an initial rate for calcium-dependent ATPase activity in vesicles of 25-40 nmol/min.mg at pH 7.8 and 25 degrees C. The calcium-dependent activity is preferentially solubilized by the detergent C12E8 and can be precipitated at 55-80% ammonium sulfate in a fraction free of other contaminating ATPase activities. This partially purified fraction is enriched 15-fold and demonstrates an apparent Km for calcium of 2 microM, and for ATP of 130 microM. The IC50 for vanadate is 1.6 microM. These values are similar to those obtained for the eukaryotic sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. The enzyme is rapidly phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP in a calcium-dependent, vanadate-inhibitable manner. The phosphorylated species migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa by NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the phosphoryl group is sensitive to alkaline conditions, a characteristic of the acylphosphate linkage found in ATPases. These data demonstrate that the majority of calcium transport in F. odoratum is facilitated by a P-type ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1557721783,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a glycoprotein required for the proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte and macrophage precursors. Previous investigations have identified regions in human and murine GM-CSF that are required for bioactivity. In the present study, alanine substitution mutagenesis was undertaken to define more precisely specific amino-terminal residues in murine GM-CSF that are involved in bioactivity and receptor binding. Five double alanine mutants were identified that showed at least 10-fold reductions in bioactivity (K14AK20A, K14AE21A, H15AK20A, H15AE21A, K20AE21A). Each of these mutants maintained a normal N-linked glycosylation pattern when expressed in COS-1 cells, suggesting that native polypeptide backbone conformation was preserved. The purified prokaryotic expression products of two mutants (K14AE21A and H15AE21A) had a 100-fold decrease in bioactivity and a decrease in receptor binding, indicating that the side chains of K14, H15, and E21 are required for optimal receptor binding and maximal bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1576954053,"Abstract To detect movement of Cys-697 (SH2) in myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) associated with ATP hydrolysis, SH2 was labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent analog of maleimide, 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS). Complex formation of S-1 labeled at Cys-697 with MIANS (MIANS-S-1) with adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and ADP resulted in a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of approximately 40 and 30%, respectively. When ATP was added to MIANS-S-1, the fluorescence intensity decreased rapidly by approximately 40%, and this fluorescence level was maintained during the steady state of ATP hydrolysis. As the substrate was used up, the fluorescence intensity increased to approximately 70% of the original value. These results together with model experiments with MIANS-N-acetylcysteine indicate that in the presence of ATP, the MIANS fluorophore attached to SH2 is located in a less hydrophobic environment than is the fluorophore in the absence of ligand and that the hydrolysis of ATP enhances hydrophobicity around the fluorophore. Acrylamide fluorescence quenching studies of MIANS-S-1 confirmed these results, indicating that addition of ATP and ADP to MIANS-S-1 results in an increase in the Stern-Volmer quenching constant of the fluorophore by factors of approximately 3 and 2.5, respectively. The present observations suggest that binding of ATP causes a movement of SH2 toward the protein surface, whereas it goes back into the protein interior after ATP hydrolysis. The results also confirmed previous observations by a chemical cross-linking approach (Hiratsuka, T. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 3168-3173)."
https://openalex.org/W1499784950,"Treatment of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC) attached to fibronectin-coated dishes with dimethyl sulfoxide causes the cells to become committed to the erythroid differentiation pathway. These cells mature extensively and acquire the characteristics of erythroid cells. The cells lose their cell-surface fibronectin receptors and accumulate red cell-specific membrane proteins, such as band 3, in amounts comparable to those in erythrocytes. Previous studies of MELC have shown that the presence of protein kinase C (PKC) is required for commitment to differentiation, but that the level of PKC activity declines progressively during maturation. In this study, we have established a role for PKC in the maturation of MELC committed to differentiation. Our results show that down-regulation of PKC by addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to committed MELC blocks subsequent maturation of the cells. Treatment of MELC with the PKC inhibitors H7 and sphingosine had similar effects. Down-regulation of PKC was assayed by measuring cytosolic PKC activity as well as by Western blotting using PKC antibodies. MELC maturation was monitored by loss of the cell-surface fibronectin receptor, release of cells from fibronectin plates, and accumulation of the band 3 anion transport protein. Immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled proteins by an anti-fibronectin receptor (integrin) antibody showed that PMA-treated cultures had more fibronectin receptor protein than untreated cultures 6 days post-induction. As a result, cultures of committed MELC treated with PMA remained attached to fibronectin-coated plates, whereas non-PMA-treated cells were released into the culture medium. Furthermore, PKC-depleted cells accumulated much smaller amounts of band 3 protein and band 3 mRNA than did non-PKC-depleted controls. Our results show that although PKC activity declines progressively during post-commitment maturation of MELC, its continued presence is critical for the process of cellular maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1509189001,"Abstract Partial digestion of the native beta subunit of F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3 by three different proteases produced a limited number of peptide fragments. In most cases, the peptides remained associated, and the gross structure of the beta subunit was not destroyed. Furthermore, most peptides were able to reassociate into the form of the beta subunit after denaturating urea treatment. Therefore, the cleaved sites are most likely located in water-exposed loop regions in the tertiary structure of the protein. Almost all peptides were analyzed, and 17 cleaved sites were determined. From the analysis of the distribution of cleaved sites and deletions or insertions in the multiple amino acid sequence alignment of proteins homologous to the beta subunit, locations of five loops and four candidate loops in the beta subunit are suggested. There are two large loops in the central region of the beta subunit sequence, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-reactive Glu190 is located in one of them. Tyr341, involved in putative catalytic ATP binding, is also found in one of the loops. Then, taking cleaved sites as a reference, two kinds of expression plasmids, each of which carried genes of two complementary peptide fragments, 1-193 and 198-473 or 1-284 and 285-473, were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. For each plasmid, two peptides were coexpressed, associated into a stable beta subunit form in E. coli cells, and purified without dissociation. When these beta subunits were denatured by urea and applied to polyacrylamide gel without denaturant, a protein band with the same mobility as that of the beta subunit appeared, indicating that reassociation of peptide fragments into the form of the beta subunit occurred upon removal of urea. These beta subunits retained the ability to reconstitute the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma complexes even though the efficiency of reconstitution and the recovered ATPase activities were decreased. These complexes were stable at high or low temperature, and ATPase activities were sensitive to inhibition by N3-."
https://openalex.org/W1483641760,"The mitochondrial import and of the F1ATPase subunits requires, respectively, the participation of the molecular chaperones hsp70SSA1 and hsp70SSC1 and other components operating on opposite sides of the mitochondrial membrane. In previous studies, both the homology and the properties of the F1ATPase alpha-subunit (ATP1p) compared to the groEL homologue, hsp60, have led to the proposal that this subunit could exhibit chaperone-like activity. In this report the extent to which this subunit participates in protein transport has been determined by comparing import into mitochondria that lack the F1ATPase alpha-subunit (delta ATP1) versus mitochondria that lack the other major catalytic subunit, the F1ATPase beta-subunit (delta ATP2). Yeast mutants lacking the alpha-subunit but not the beta-subunit grow much more slowly than expected on fermentable carbon sources and exhibit delayed kinetics of protein import for several mitochondrial precursors such as the F1 beta subunit, hsp60MIF4 and subunits 4 and 5 of the cytochrome oxidase. In vitro and in vivo the F1 beta-subunit precursor accumulates as a translocation intermediate in absence of the F1 alpha-subunit. In the absence of both the ATPase subunits yeast grows at the same rate as a strain lacking only the beta-subunit, and import of mitochondrial precursors is restored to that of wild type. These data indicate that the F1 alpha-subunit likely functions as an assembly partner to influence protein import rather than functioning directly as a chaperone. These data are discussed in light of the relationship between the import and of proteins in mitochondria."

ATP analogues did not significantly affect antibody-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Unlike the GTP analogues, the GDP analogue guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP beta S) did not enhance phosphorylation of zeta.

https://openalex.org/W1500888016,"Based on a correlation between expression patterns of an abundant tissue-specific small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (N protein) and the calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP) splicing choice, a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (the N factor) has been hypothesized to potentially function as a trans-acting factor involved in the regulation of the alternative splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP transcript. RNA analysis indicated that most rat, human, and simian cell lines and tissues making the CGRP mRNA splicing choice expressed the N factor mRNA. These data led us to address the effect of ectopic expression of the N factor in HeLa cells, which exhibit a calcitonin splicing choice when expressing the calcitonin/CGRP gene. Expression of the N factor exerts no effect on the calcitonin/CGRP splicing choice in HeLa cells. Furthermore, several cell lines such as the human 293 cell line make the CGRP mRNA splicing choice in the absence of any detectable level of the mRNA encoding the N factor. Together, these data reveal that the N protein is neither sufficient nor required for the tissue-specific CGRP splicing decision and that the N protein is not the trans-acting factor regulating the alternative splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP gene."
