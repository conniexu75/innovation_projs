https://openalex.org/W2151492652,"Coordination and local geometry around Si cations in silicate liquids are of primary importance in controlling the chemical and physical properties of magmas. Pressure-induced changes from fourfold to sixfold coordination of Si in silicate glass samples quenched from liquids has been detected with (29)Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Samples of Na(2)Si(2)O(5) glass quenched from 8 gigapascals and 1500 degrees C contained about 1.5 percent octahedral Si, which was demonstrably part of a homogeneous, amorphous phase. The dominant tetrahedral Si speciation in these glasses became disproportionated to a more random distribution of bridging and nonbridging oxygens with increasing pressure."

The regional extent of the layers, their compositional complexity, and lack of included volcanic debris suggest that they are not products of volcanic activity. The layers are greatly enriched in iridium and other platinum group elements in roughly chondritic proportions. Geochemical modeling based on immobile element abundances suggests that the original average spherule composition can be approximated by a mixture of fractionated tholeiitic basalt, komatiite, and CI carbonaceous chondrite. The spherules are thought to be the products of large meteorite impacts on the Archean earth."

https://openalex.org/W1495440250,"In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger suggested his famous gedanken experiment of the cat that is simultaneously ""dead"" and ""alive"" inside its box until the box is opened. But as Tesche explains in her Perspective, such a macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanics has remained elusive until recently. The experiments by van der Wal et al. are an important step toward demonstrating that quantum mechanics can describe macroscopic phenomena. The approach may be exploited in quantum computing and quantum cryptography."

https://openalex.org/W1480248623,"Three researchers pondering what could be behind a roughly 1500-year cycle of warming and cooling are suggesting that it is a combination of two climate drivers, each too weak to have a large effect on its own. When a strictly periodic cycle teams up with just the right amount of thoroughly irregular noise, the combination could achieve ""stochastic resonance"" and set off the dramatic climate shifts of the last ice age--or the next, possibly human-triggered, Little Ice Age. No one is claiming the case is proven, but if true it will complicate predictions of future climate."

Their appearance should help researchers understand not just how the new moons were formed but also how the giant planets themselves came to be."

https://openalex.org/W2044916490,"The Yugoslavian scientific community has withered in the past decade, crippled by a massive brain drain and starved for resources. Now the promise of democratic rule in Yugoslavia has rekindled scientists' hopes that their careers will eventually get back on track and that scientific cooperation between the former Yugoslav republics can be reestablished. But the losses have been so great that the comeback of Yugoslavian science depends largely on how much assistance Western countries and expatriate scientists provide."

This summer the institute asked a court to rule on a 1996 agreement in which Hut promised to leave by 2001. This month Hut countersued, saying that he was coerced into signing the document and that the institute is trampling on his academic freedom."

https://openalex.org/W1574671734,"Slovenia, which escaped unscathed from its 1-week war of independence in 1991, has emerged from the chaos of the Yugoslav breakup with the biggest head start in science. Croatia also has a proud scientific tradition, but it paid a much higher price than Slovenia paid for its freedom: a bloody war for independence that took nearly 4 years to settle. The problems of Croatian researchers pale in comparison to those in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, however."

https://openalex.org/W2072823999,"In his insightful News Focus article, “CERN's gamble shows perils, rewards of playing the odds” (29 Sept., p. [2260][1]), Charles Seife discusses a paradox of “three-sigma” and “five-sigma” findings in the experiments of physicists and astronomers. Findings that are statistically significant to three standard deviations (that is, three sigma) theoretically occur less than one chance in 1000 if a hypothesis of no effect is true. Yet, Seife quotes particle physicist John Bahcall, “Half of all three-sigma results are wrong.” Seife comments, “To a statistician, such vagaries may seem absurd.” Actually, to statisticians the phenomenon is common. The problem usually is that the probability model under which the significance level is calculated is wrong. An example is the phenomenon Mosteller and Wallace referred to as the “outrageous event” ([1][2], [2][3]).

An outrageous event is one that is unexpected and is not included in the probability model that yields a multi-sigma answer—like the “systematics” Seife mentions that tripped up astronomer Peter Van de Kamp and others (in the case of Van de Kamp, changes in a telescope lens assembly were the source of evidence for a wobbly star and hence an extrasolar planet). When Muhammed Ali was boxing, Mosteller liked to give the example of himself, Fred Mosteller, contending with Ali for the world heavyweight title. Although Ali would be heavily favored in the odds, he could trip over his shoelaces rushing from his corner and be out cold, with Fred the winner on a technicality! The serious point is that a small probability of a finding cannot in practical terms ever be smaller than the probability of the “outrageous events” that could produce the finding.

Another example pertinent to the paradox is this: The more data one searches through to find a “finding,” the more opportunity there is to reach three sigmas ([3][4]).
