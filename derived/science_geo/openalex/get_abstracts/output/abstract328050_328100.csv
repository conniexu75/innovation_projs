https://openalex.org/W2022114069,"Between patch reefs and marine grass communities there is normally a zone or ""halo"" of heavily grazed grass 2 to 10 meters wide. Grazing by the echinoid Diadema antillarum Philippi during nocturnal migrations off the reefs is found to be the major factor in the formation of halos."
https://openalex.org/W1971398154,"Four distinct viruses with double-stranded DNA are known to replicate in Chlorella-like algae symbiotic with hydras and paramecia. An attempt was made to infect a number of cultured Chlorella strains derived from invertebrate hosts with these viruses. One of the viruses, PBCV-1, replicated in two of the algal strains. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the viral DNA showed that the infectious progeny virus was identical to the input virus; thus, Koch's postulates were fulfilled. Viral infection of the two Chlorella strains has allowed the large-scale production of a eukaryotic algal virus and the development of a plaque assay for the virus."

https://openalex.org/W1976514437,"A heterodont bivalve mollusk Calyptogena magnifica, from the East Pacific Rise and the Galápagos Rift hydrothermal vent areas, contains abundant hemoglobin in circulating erythrocytes. No other known heterodont clam contains a circulating intracellular hemoglobin. The hemoglobin is tetrameric and has a relatively high oxygen affinity, which varies only slightly between 2° and 10°C. The presence of hemoglobin in the clam may facilitate the transport of oxygen to be used in chemoautotrophic hydrogen sulfide metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2048779771,An ultraviolet spectrometer aboard the Apollo 17 orbiting spacecraft attempted to measure ultraviolet emissions from the lunar atmosphere. The only emissions observed were from a transient atmosphere introduced by the lunar landing engine. The absence of atomic hydrogen implies that solar wind protons are converted to hydrogen molecules at the lunar surface.
https://openalex.org/W2022947155,"Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) were hunted to near extinction in the 19th century. Protection has allowed them to recolonize former habitat on islands off California, where the population is increasing more than 14 percent per year. Immigration of young pregnant females from Baja California initiated the California rookeries but is responsible for only a small part of recent population growth. Almost 25,000 northern elephant seal pups were born in the species' range in Mexico and the United States in 1982 in comparison with only six known births in 1911."
https://openalex.org/W1971810835,"The feasibility of electrochemically synthesizing methane by a Fischer-Tropsch type reaction by use of a solid oxide electrolyte has been demonstrated. This solid-state ionic approach provides in situ control of the oxygen activity at the gascatalyst interface by imposing a suitable voltage drop across an oxygen-conducting solid electrolyte from an external source. Methanation rates for hydrogen-carbon monoxide and hydrogen-carbon dioxide synthesis gas mixtures upon nickel electrodes showed substantial enhancement with the use of this technique, reaching values nearly two orders of magnitude higher than their intrinsic rates."
https://openalex.org/W2011608131,"When males of the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi were exposed to 12 degrees C diuring adult development and then tested for flight activity at 25 degrees C, the time of the onset of the activity was advanced to the early part of the night. This change in the time of activity was stable and persisted through the life of the moth. Females showed a corresponding shift in the time of sex pheromone release when they were treated in the same fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1526787462,"Apollo 17 landed in a deep graben valley embaying the mountainous highlands southeast of the Serenitatis basin. Impact-generated breccias underlie the massifs adjacent to the valley, and basalt has flooded and leveled the valley floor. The dark mantle inferred from orbital photographs was not recognized as a discrete unit; the unusually thick regolith of the valley floor contains a unique high concentration of dark glass beads that may cause the low albedo of much of the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2001317634,"A critical discussion is presented on the use by Etkins and Epstein (1982) of combined surface air temperature and sea level time series to draw conclusions concerning the discharge of the polar ice sheets. It is objected by Robock that they used Northern Hemisphere land surface air temperature records which are unrepresentative of global sea surface temperature, and he suggests that externally imposed volcanic dust and CO2 forcings can adequately account for observed temperature changes over the last century, with global sea level changing in passive response to sea change as a result of thermal expansion. Hansen et al. adduce evidence for global cooling due to ice discharge that has not exceeded a few hundredths of a degree centigrade in the last century, precluding any importance of this phenomenon in the interpretation of global mean temperature trends for this period. Etkins and Epstein reply that since their 1982 report additional evidence has emerged for the hypothesis that the polar ice caps are diminishing. It is reasserted that each of the indices discussed, including global mean sea surface temperature and sea level, polar ice sheet mass balance, water mass characteristics, and the spin rate and axis of rotation displacement of the earth, are physically linked and can be systematically monitored, as is currently being planned under the auspices of the National Climate Program."

(16 November), the last sentence in the second column on page 694 should read, With some exceptions, little or nothing has been done by either federal or state government to cope with the ultimately more serious problem of protecting the land itself."
