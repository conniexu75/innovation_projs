https://openalex.org/W2086500947,"Attempts to understand the personal characteristics of others, in interactions with them, are complicated by the fact that one tends to find what one expects. This happens not only because processing of information is selective, but also because expectancies cause one to act in ways that elicit behavior interpretable as confirming those expectancies, even when the expectancies might have been mistaken. Studies provide ample evidence of such self-fulfilling prophecies in social interaction and are beginning to spell out the crucial steps in the process for confirming expectancies. Such studies help link the psychology of first impressions to the psychology of long-term relationships by showing how expectancies are sustained or modified through behavioral sequences that are partially determined by initial expectancies."

In addition to high sealevel stands recognized by other workers, the New Guinea data clearly indicate a marine transgression between 50,000 and 35,000 years before the present. A eustatic sea level curve reconstructed from field observations and radiometric dates shows a close correlation with temperature fluctuations in high latitudes as predicted by astronomical data."
https://openalex.org/W2041895044,"Although the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi does not regularly transmit the MAV isolate of barley yellow drawf virus from singly infected oats, it often transmits MAV, together with the serologically unrelated RPV isolate, from plants doubly infected by MAV and RPV. Vector specificity of the virus isolates appears to be a function of the virus capsid. Some MAV nucleic acid becomes coated with RPV capsid protein during simultaneous synthesis of the two isolates in the doubly infected plant."
https://openalex.org/W2089315480,"In recent years, improvements in the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance have made it possible to detect progressively smaller numbers of nuclei. Experiments and studies previously thought to be impractical can now be undertaken, for example, the study of phenomena at surfaces. Nuclear magnetic resonance has been applied to study simple molecules (carbon monoxide, acetylene, and ethylene) adsorbed on metal surfaces (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum). The metals, in the form of clusters 10 to 50 angstroms in diameter, supported on alumina, are typical of real catalysts. The experiments provide information about the bonding of the molecules to the metal, the structures the molecules assume after adsorption, the motion of molecules on the surface, the breakup of molecules induced by heating, and the products of such breakup."

https://openalex.org/W2075225651,"By radar backscattering, observations of the moon have been made which show a systematic difference between the backscattering coefficient of waves polarized in, and perpendicular to, the local plane of incidence. The results arein agreement with a model consisting of a tenuous top layer at least 10 centimeters thick, supported by a denser underlying layer."
https://openalex.org/W2074994926,"Experiments on thermal convection in a rotating, differentially heated hemispherical shell with a radial buoyancy force were conducted in an orbiting microgravity laboratory. A variety of convective structures, or planforms, were observed, depending on the magnitude of the rotation and the nature of the imposed heating distribution. The results are compared with numerical simulations that can be conducted at the more modest heating rates, and suggest possible regimes of motion in rotating planets and stars."
https://openalex.org/W2027930412,"Rangia cuneata, a valuable clam of the estuarine zone where fluctuating salinities (from 0 to 15 parts per thousand) exclude most animals, is now developing large populations in many estuaries from Florida to Maryland. Before 1955 it was thought to be extinct on the East Coast since the Pleistocene and to be living only in Gulf Coast estuaries."

https://openalex.org/W1983280656,The refractive indices of polywater columns in glass capillaries have been rapidly and accurately measured with an interference microscope. Polywater has been detected by this method in both quartz and Vycor glass capillaries. A comparison of refractive index measurements with measurements of optical anisotropy indicates that polywater initially condenses with an ordered structure.

https://openalex.org/W2027379414,"Ani enzyme activity similar to that of dextranase is associated with coleoptiles of Avena sativa. When subjected to purified dextranase, both the pure natural dextran and the cell walls of the Avena coleoptiles yield isomaltose and isomaltotriose. Thus, the cell walls contain dextrans or dextran-like compounds. Coleoptiles with low auxin content have a lower dextranase activity than coleoptiles with high auxin content. The enzyme activity is therefore in some way sensitive to thle hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2058608357,"Eustatic rises of sea level between A. D. 265 and 500 and between A. D. 1000 and 1100 caused the formation of raised beaches. After the first rise, sea level dropped about2 meters below the present level, permitting Eskimo settlement of Birnirk about A. D. 500. The second rise of the ocean flooded Birnirk. At present, sea level is about 0.6 to 1.0 meter below the highwater levels; the ocean partially floods Birnirk."

Such an iodine concentration has not yet been detected in any other enteropneust or protochordate."

https://openalex.org/W2039564851,"The unit cell volume of chromium was measured as a function of pressure from 1 bar to 30 kilobars by x-ray diffraction techniques. The antiferromagnetic transition occurred at 1.5 kilobars at 29 degrees C, where there is a discontinuity in the slope of the curve for lattice parameter vs. pressure. By electrical resistance measurements the value of -deltaT(N)/ deltaP was determined to be 5.9 degrees + 0.3 degrees per kilobar. At room temperature chromium remains in the body centered cubic crystal structure from 0 to 55 kilobars."

Concentrations of 108 to 109 ice particles,0.2 micron in diameter, per square-centimeter column are obtained. Based on concentrations of Aitken nuclei in the atmosphere of Earth, a layer less than 100 meters thick would contain the required number of particles. The compatible pressures obtained in this manner for various N(2)-CO(2) and Ar-CO(2) atmospheric models lie within the range of pressures determined spectroscopically."
