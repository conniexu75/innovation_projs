https://openalex.org/W2096940705,"Alternative pre–messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing plays important roles in development, physiology, and disease, and more than half of human genes are alternatively spliced. To understand the biological roles and regulation of alternative splicing across different tissues and stages of development, systematic methods are needed. Here, we demonstrate the use of microarrays to monitor splicing at every exon-exon junction in more than 10,000 multi-exon human genes in 52 tissues and cell lines. These genome-wide data provide experimental evidence and tissue distributions for thousands of known and novel alternative splicing events. Adding to previous studies, the results indicate that at least 74% of human multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced."

https://openalex.org/W1966790730,"Kinesin is a processive motor that takes 8.3-nm center-of-mass steps along microtubules for each adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed. Whether kinesin moves by a ""hand-over-hand"" or an ""inchworm"" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps."

https://openalex.org/W2003324942,"Molecular genetics has revealed a precise stereotypy in the projection of primary olfactory sensory neurons onto secondary neurons. A major challenge is to understand how this mapping translates into odor responses in these second-order neurons. We investigated this question in Drosophila using whole-cell recordings in vivo. We observe that monomolecular odors generally elicit responses in large ensembles of antennal lobe neurons. Comparison of odor-evoked activity from afferents and postsynaptic neurons in the same glomerulus revealed that second-order neurons display broader tuning and more complex responses than their primary afferents. This indicates a major transformation of odor representations, implicating lateral interactions within the antennal lobe."

https://openalex.org/W2052489905,"Despite the importance of tropical biodiversity1, informative species distributional data are seldom available for biogeographical study or setting conservation priorities2,3. Modelling ecological niche distributions of species offers a potential soluion4,5,6,7; however, the utility of old locality data from museums, and of more recent remotely sensed satellite data, remains poorly explored, especially for rapidly changing tropical landscapes. Using 29 modern data sets of environmental land coverage and 621 chameleon occurrence localities from Madagascar (historical and recent), here we demonstrate a significant ability of our niche models in predicting species distribution. At 11 recently inventoried sites, highest predictive success (85.1%) was obtained for models based only on modern occurrence data (74.7% and 82.8% predictive success, respectively, for pre-1978 and all data combined). Notably, these models also identified three intersecting areas of over-prediction that recently yielded seven chameleon species new to science. We conclude that ecological niche modelling using recent locality records and readily available environmental coverage data provides informative biogeographical data for poorly known tropical landscapes, and offers innovative potential for the discovery of unknown distributional areas and unknown species."
https://openalex.org/W2062834772,"Axoplasmic proteins containing nuclear localization signals (NLS) signal retrogradely by an unknown mechanism in injured nerve. Here we demonstrate that the importin/karyopherin α and β families underlie this process. We show that importins are found in axons at significant distances from the cell body and that importin β protein is increased after nerve lesion by local translation of axonal mRNA. This leads to formation of a high-affinity NLS binding complex that traffics retrogradely with the motor protein dynein. Trituration of synthetic NLS peptide at the injury site of axotomized dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons delays their regenerative outgrowth, and NLS introduction to sciatic nerve concomitantly with a crush injury suppresses the conditioning lesion induced transition from arborizing to elongating growth in L4/L5 DRG neurons. These data suggest a model whereby lesion-induced upregulation of axonal importin β may enable retrograde transport of signals that modulate the regeneration of injured neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1982327643,"The brain ""reward"" system, centered on the limbic ventral striatum, plays a critical role in the response to pleasure and pain. The ventral striatum is activated in animal and human studies during anticipation of appetitive/pleasurable events, but its role in aversive/painful events is less clear. Here we present data from three human fMRI studies based on aversive conditioning using unpleasant cutaneous electrical stimulation and show that the ventral striatum is reliably activated. This activation is observed during anticipation and is not a consequence of relief after the aversive event. Further, the ventral striatum is activated in anticipation regardless of whether there is an opportunity to avoid the aversive stimulus or not. Our data suggest that the ventral striatum, a crucial element of the brain ""reward"" system, is directly activated in anticipation of aversive stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2124786856,"The Toll- dependent defense against Gram-positive bacterial infections in Drosophila is mediated through the peptidoglycan recognition protein SA (PGRP-SA). A mutation termed osiris disrupts the Gram-negative binding protein 1 ( GNBP1 ) gene and leads to compromised survival of mutant flies after Gram-positive infections, but not after fungal or Gram-negative bacterial challenge. Our results demonstrate that GNBP1 and PGRP-SA can jointly activate the Toll pathway. The potential for a combination of distinct proteins to mediate detection of infectious nonself in the fly will refine the concept of pattern recognition in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2013490303,"The Earth's most severe glaciations are thought to have occurred about 600 million years ago, in the late Neoproterozoic era. A puzzling feature of glacial deposits from this interval is that they are overlain by 1-5-m-thick 'cap carbonates' (particulate deep-water marine carbonate rocks) associated with a prominent negative carbon isotope excursion. Cap carbonates have been controversially ascribed to the aftermath of almost complete shutdown of the ocean ecosystems for millions of years during such ice ages--the 'snowball Earth' hypothesis. Conversely, it has also been suggested that these carbonate rocks were the result of destabilization of methane hydrates during deglaciation and concomitant flooding of continental shelves and interior basins. The most compelling criticism of the latter 'methane hydrate' hypothesis has been the apparent lack of extreme isotopic variation in cap carbonates inferred locally to be associated with methane seeps. Here we report carbon isotopic and petrographic data from a Neoproterozoic postglacial cap carbonate in south China that provide direct evidence for methane-influenced processes during deglaciation. This evidence lends strong support to the hypothesis that methane hydrate destabilization contributed to the enigmatic cap carbonate deposition and strongly negative carbon isotopic anomalies following Neoproterozoic ice ages. This explanation requires less extreme environmental disturbance than that implied by the snowball Earth hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2061897041,"It is well-known that chemical synaptic transmission is an unreliable process, but the function of such unreliability remains unclear. Here I consider the hypothesis that the randomness of synaptic transmission is harnessed by the brain for learning, in analogy to the way that genetic mutation is utilized by Darwinian evolution. This is possible if synapses are “hedonistic,” responding to a global reward signal by increasing their probabilities of vesicle release or failure, depending on which action immediately preceded reward. Hedonistic synapses learn by computing a stochastic approximation to the gradient of the average reward. They are compatible with synaptic dynamics such as short-term facilitation and depression and with the intricacies of dendritic integration and action potential generation. A network of hedonistic synapses can be trained to perform a desired computation by administering reward appropriately, as illustrated here through numerical simulations of integrate-and-fire model neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2172105693,"It is now established that CD1 molecules present lipid antigens to T cells, although it is not clear how the exchange of lipids between membrane compartments and the CD1 binding groove is assisted. We report that mice deficient in prosaposin, the precursor to a family of endosomal lipid transfer proteins (LTP), exhibit specific defects in CD1d-mediated antigen presentation and lack Valpha14 NKT cells. In vitro, saposins extracted monomeric lipids from membranes and from CD1, thereby promoting the loading as well as the editing of lipids on CD1. Transient complexes between CD1, lipid, and LTP suggested a ""tug-of-war"" model in which lipid exchange between CD1 and LTP is on the basis of their respective affinities for lipids. LTPs constitute a previously unknown link between lipid metabolism and immunity and are likely to exert a profound influence on the repertoire of self, tumor, and microbial lipid antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2013721615,"Class switch recombination (CSR) at the antibody immunoglobulin locus is regulated by germline transcription (GLT)-coupled modifications in the accessibility of the switch region, where CSR takes place. Here we show that histone acetylation of switch regions is linked to CSR but that histone acetylation cannot alone promote CSR or GLT. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) specifically associates with the CSR target chromatin in a GLT-coupled manner, which may occur potentially by means of physical interaction between AID and the transcription machinery. These data indicate an important role of GLT in the regulation of chromatin accessibility, strongly suggesting that the target of AID is chromatin DNA. Our results give insights on the role of AID and the regulatory mechanism of CSR."
https://openalex.org/W2116783544,"Natural exploration of complex visual scenes depends on saccadic eye movements toward important locations. Saccade targeting is thought to be mediated by a retinotopic map that represents the locations of salient features. In this report, we demonstrate that extrastriate ventral area V4 contains a retinotopic salience map that guides exploratory eye movements during a naturalistic free viewing visual search task. In more than half of recorded cells, visually driven activity is enhanced prior to saccades that move the fovea toward the location previously occupied by a neuron's spatial receptive field. This correlation suggests that bottom-up processing in V4 influences the oculomotor planning process. Half of the neurons also exhibit top-down modulation of visual responses that depends on search target identity but not visual stimulation. Convergence of bottom-up and top-down processing streams in area V4 results in an adaptive, dynamic map of salience that guides oculomotor planning during natural vision."

https://openalex.org/W2010081774,"Although human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infects quiescent and proliferating CD4+ lymphocytes, the virus replicates poorly in resting T cells. Factors that block viral replication in these cells might help to prolong the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection; however, the molecular mechanisms that control this process are not fully understood. Here we show that Murr1, a gene product known previously for its involvement in copper regulation, inhibits HIV-1 growth in unstimulated CD4+ T cells. This inhibition was mediated in part through its ability to inhibit basal and cytokine-stimulated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity. Knockdown of Murr1 increased NF-kappaB activity and decreased IkappaB-alpha concentrations by facilitating phospho-IkappaB-alpha degradation by the proteasome. Murr1 was detected in CD4+ T cells, and RNA-mediated interference of Murr1 in primary resting CD4+ lymphocytes increased HIV-1 replication. Through its effects on the proteasome, Murr1 acts as a genetic restriction factor that inhibits HIV-1 replication in lymphocytes, which could contribute to the regulation of asymptomatic HIV infection and the progression of AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1987312959,"Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. The cold-dark-matter model of the formation of large-scale structures (that is, clusters of galaxies and even larger assemblies) predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensed by concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would be split by over 7 arcsec. Numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasars have, however, been unsuccessful. All of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known, including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that can be explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter. Although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known, quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of the resulting lens systems. Here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, SDSS J1004 + 4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62 arcsec. Such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominated by dark matter. Our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectations based on the cold-dark-matter model."
https://openalex.org/W2167496970,"Experimental sepsis in rodents occurring after cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) is associated with excessive complement activation and a systemic inflammatory response. The proinflammatory mediator IL-6 has recently been shown to be an important inducer of the C5a receptor (C5aR) during sepsis. We now provide evidence that serum IL-6 production during sepsis in rats was reduced in neutrophil-depleted animals and that absence of C5aR in mice as well as antibody-blockade of C5a in rats significantly reduced serum levels of IL-6 during sepsis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production in vitro of IL-6 by neutrophils was significantly enhanced in the co-presence of C5a, likely due to transcriptional up-regulation of IL-6. Production of IL-6 in neutrophils by LPS was NF-kappaB dependent (but not on the presence of p50) and dependent on phosphorylation of p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) as well as p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2) but not on phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2). C5a stimulation of neutrophils elicited a rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Accordingly, we suggest that induction of IL-6 after CLP is neutrophil and C5a/C5aR dependent, likely due to the ability of C5a to cause activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2029559609,"The Caenorhabditis elegans excretory canal is composed of a single elongated and branched cell that is tunneled by an inner lumen of apical character. Loss of the exc-4 gene causes a cystic enlargement of this intracellular tube. exc-4 encodes a member of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family of proteins. EXC-4 protein localizes to various tubular membranes in distinct cell types, including the lumenal membrane of the excretory tubes. A conserved 55-amino acid domain enables EXC-4 translocation from the cytosol to the lumenal membrane. The tubular architecture of this membrane requires EXC-4 for both its formation and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2031373742,"Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is generally assumed to occur only at ultrastructurally defined presynaptic active zones. If release is restricted to these sites, receptors not located within the synaptic cleft must be activated by transmitter that diffuses out of the cleft or not be activated at all. Here we report that AMPA receptor-mediated quantal events resulting from climbing fiber release are observed in Bergmann glial cells in the cerebellar cortex. These quantal events are not coincident with quanta recorded in neighboring Purkinje cells which receive input from the same climbing fiber. As Bergmann glial membranes are excluded from the synaptic cleft, we propose that exocytosis can occur from climbing fiber release sites located directly across from Bergmann glial membranes. Such ectopic release may account for the majority of the Bergmann glial AMPA response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1995403588,"In mammals, spermatogenesis is maintained by spermatogonial stem cells (SSC). In their niche, SSC divide to self-maintain and to produce a transit-amplifying population that eventually enters the meiotic cycle to give rise to spermatozoa. The low number of SSC and the lack of specific markers hinder their isolation and enrichment. Stem cells in several adult tissues can be identified by using their verapamil-sensitive Hoechst dye-effluxing properties, which define the characteristic ""side population"" (SP). Here we show, by multicolor flow cytometric analysis, that immature mouse testis contains a ""side-population"" (T-SP), which is Sca-1pos, Ep-CAMpos, EE2 pos, alpha6-integrin pos, and alpha(v)-integrin neg. A 13-fold enrichment in SSC activity was observed when sorted T-SP cells from ROSA 26 mice were transplanted in busulfan-treated mouse testis. Whereas an incomplete range of spermatogenic stages was encountered two months after transplantation of unsorted testicular cells, the transplantation of T-SP cells generated all associations of mouse germ cells representing the full range of spermatogenic stages. These data suggest that Hoechst staining and cell sorting might provide a novel approach to SSC enrichment in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2168477444,"The discrete nature of crystal lattices plays a role in virtually every material property. But it is only when the size of entities hosted by a crystal becomes comparable to the lattice period--as occurs for dislocations, vortices in superconductors and domain walls--that this discreteness is manifest explicitly. The associated phenomena are usually described in terms of a background Peierls 'atomic washboard' energy potential, which was first introduced for the case of dislocation motion in the 1940s. This concept has subsequently been invoked in many situations to describe certain features in the bulk behaviour of materials, but has to date eluded direct detection and experimental scrutiny at a microscopic level. Here we report observations of the motion of a single magnetic domain wall at the scale of the individual peaks and troughs of the atomic energy landscape. Our experiments reveal that domain walls can become trapped between crystalline planes, and that they propagate by distinct jumps that match the lattice periodicity. The jumps between valleys are found to involve unusual dynamics that shed light on the microscopic processes underlying domain-wall propagation. Such observations offer a means for probing experimentally the physics of topological defects in discrete lattices--a field rich in phenomena that have been subject to extensive theoretical study."
https://openalex.org/W2119360937,"To investigate the status of soluble adhesion molecules (sAMs) during aging, the present study determined protein levels of several major sAMs in serum samples obtained from rats at different ages. These sAMs include E-selectin, P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Fischer 344 rats, ages 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, fed ad libitum (AL) and calorie restricted (CR) diets were used in this study. Analysis by Western blotting showed that the levels of all sAMs studied increased during aging in AL rats, but were effectively blunted in the CR rats. Total reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) levels were measured by fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. Increased ROS/RNS levels were found to coincide with increased levels of superoxide-generating xanthine oxidase in serum during aging, but were found suppressed by CR. Increases in sAMs levels were duplicated in another experiment in which young (13-month-old) and old (31-month-old) rats were injected with proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide. These findings suggest that the altered expressions of sAMs may be due to increased oxidative stress with advanced age and that these increases were prevented by CR through its antioxidative action."
https://openalex.org/W2135971646,"By imposing a replicative defect in most somatic cells, gradual telomere attrition during aging is thought to progressively impair cellular function and viability and may contribute to age-related disease. Immune cells play important roles in all phases of atherosclerosis, a multifactorial disease that prevails within the elderly. Because shorter telomeres have been found in circulating blood leukocytes of human patients with advanced coronary atherosclerosis, it has been suggested that telomere shortening may predispose the organism to atheroma development. In this study, we assessed the impact of telomere attrition on atherogenesis induced by dietary cholesterol in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice, a well-established model of experimental atherosclerosis that recapitulates important aspects of the human disease. Our study shows that late-generation mice doubly deficient in apoE and telomerase RNA experience telomere attrition and a substantial reduction of atherosclerosis compared with control mice with intact telomerase, in spite of sustained hypercholesterolemia in response to the atherogenic diet. Short telomeres impaired the proliferation of both lymphocytes and macrophages, an important step in atherosclerosis development. Therefore, telomere exhaustion resulting in replicative immunosenescence may serve as a mechanism for restricting atheroma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2021861636,"We describe a new approach for making real-time measurements of exocytosis and endocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. The method utilizes interference reflection microscopy (IRM) to image surface membrane in close contact with a glass coverslip (the ""footprint""). At the synaptic terminal of retinal bipolar cells, the footprint expands during exocytosis and retracts during endocytosis, paralleling changes in total surface area measured by capacitance. In chromaffin cells, IRM detects the fusion of individual granules as the appearance of bright spots within the footprint with spatial and temporal resolution similar to total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Advantages of IRM over capacitance are that it can monitor changes in surface area while cells are electrically active and it can be applied to mammalian neurons with relatively small synaptic terminals. IRM reveals that vesicles at the synapse of bipolar cells rapidly collapse into the surface membrane while secretory granules in chromaffin cells do not."
https://openalex.org/W2097239730,"The cholinergic basis of auditory ""gating"" in the sensorimotor nucleus HVc and its efferent target robustus archistriatalis (RA) was investigated in anesthetized zebra finches. Injections of cholinergic agonists carbachol or muscarine into HVc strongly affected discharge rates and diminished auditory responsiveness in both HVc and its target RA, changes toward an awake-like condition. HVc nicotine injections produced similar strong effects in HVc, but weaker and inconsistent effects in RA. Stimulation of basal forebrain (BF) produced an initial transient network shutdown followed by diminished auditory responsiveness in HVc and RA. All stimulation effects were blocked when preceded by HVc injections of nicotinic or muscarinic antagonists. Thus, BF cholinergic modulation of song system auditory activity acting via functionally distinct HVc circuits can contribute to auditory gating. We hypothesize that wakeful BF activity levels block sensory input to motor systems and adaptively change during behavior to allow sensorimotor feedback such as auditory feedback during singing."

https://openalex.org/W2140806410,"Neoplastic cells overexpress several angiogenic cytokines, which stimulate neovascularization. Whether the responses of the host endothelial cells to these signaling molecules affect tumor cells during early tumorigenesis has not been investigated. We investigated pre-angiogenic tumor cell survival and angiogenesis initiation by two murine tumor lines (4T1 mammary carcinoma and B16 melanoma), which constitutively expressed GFP, in dorsal skin-fold window chambers of mice treated with extracellular domain of Tie-2 (ExTek) or bFGF. ExTek reduced tumor cell survival, retarded tumor growth, and inhibited angiogenesis onset compared with controls. bFGF increased tumor cell survival and promoted earlier angiogenesis and tumor growth. Neither bFGF nor ExTek affected cell proliferation in vitro. RT-PCR showed mRNA expression of bFGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) IIIb, which does not bind bFGF efficiently, by 4T1 cells and B16 cells express FGFR1 but not FGFR2. B16 cells expressed angiopoietin (Ang) 2, but neither cell line expresses Ang1. Both tumor lines express VEGF. These findings suggested that effects of bFGF and ExTek on tumor cell survival and angiogenesis were not due to direct action but were instead a result of paracrine factors secreted by endothelial cells. These subsequent signals from endothelial cells promote early survival and proliferation of disseminated tumor cells before onset of angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1675593303,Will 2003 be seen as a turning point in the battle against the infectious diseases -- such as malaria tuberculosis (TB) and AIDS -- that blight the lives of millions of people across the developing world? Certainly big sums of money have now started to flow and research and control efforts have begun to come together. This was the year in which US President George Bush pledged to spend $15 billion over five years to tackle AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean. Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria backed by donations from the worlds wealthy nations approved projects worth $623 million in 50 countries bringing its total spend to almost $3 billion. And the philanthropic Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave out $700 million for global health -- including $200 million for basic research. Although most of the new funds are for efforts to control disease they will have knock-on effects for research argues Richard Feachem executive director of the Global Fund. They represent a major increase in demand and guaranteed demand at high volumes is what fuels R&D he says. The world will know that there is now a buyer for medicines for diseases of poverty. Control funds also pay directly for epidemiological and clinical research providing substantial new data particularly on drug resistance Feachem adds. (excerpt)
