https://openalex.org/W1998054262,"Vervet monkeys give different alarm calls to different predators. Recordings of the alarms played back when predators were absent caused the monkeys to run into trees for leopard alarms, look up for eagle alarms, and look down for snake alarms. Adults call primarily to leopards, martial eagles, and pythons, but infants give leopard alarms to various mammals, eagle alarms to many birds, and snake alarms to various snakelike objects. Predator classification improves with age and experience."
https://openalex.org/W1999870605,"Infrequent, attended, auditory and visual stimuli evoke large potentials in the human limbic system in tasks that usually evoke endogenous potentials at the scalp. The limbic potentials reverse polarity over small distances and correlate with unit discharges recorded by the same electrodes, indicating that they are locally generated."
https://openalex.org/W1990663535,"Contrast thresholds for sine-wave gratings of spatial frequencies of 2, 4, 12, and 16 cycles per degree were determined for normal and disabled readers at a range of stimulus durations. Normal readers demonstrated monotonically decreasing sensitivity with increasing spatial frequency at exposure durations between 40 and 100 milliseconds. At exposure durations of 150 to 1000 milliseconds, they showed peak sensitivity at 4 cycles per degree. In comparison, disabled readers showed monotonically decreasing sensitivity with increasing spatial frequency at all stimulus durations. The difference in sensitivity pattern across spatial frequencies was greatest at stimulus durations approximately equal to fixation durations during reading."

https://openalex.org/W1965671642,"Intracellular recordings in vivo were obtained from dopamine-containing neurons of the rat substantia nigra. These neurons were identified electrophysiologically by antidromic activation and histochemically by L-dopa injection and subsequent fluorescence histochemistry. Extracellular spikes and antidromic conduction velocity of the neurons were identical to those previously described for putative dopaminergic neurons. Spontaneous intracellular fast potentials, slow depolarizations during burst firing, and spike prepotentials were observed."

https://openalex.org/W2016331834,"Administration of physostigmine to normal volunteers produced significant elevations in plasma cortisol and β-endorphin immunoreactivity as well as alterations in mood, cognition, and behavior. These observations might be explained by a cholinergically mediated stress syndrome. However, peak elevations in plasma β-endorphin immunoreactivity (but not in plasma cortisol) were significantly correlated with physostigmine-induced increases in depression ratings. These results suggest that a cholinergically mediated β-endorphin pathway may be involved in the observed affective changes."

https://openalex.org/W1969462641,"The ganglion cell layer of the rabbit retina contains neurons that synthesize acetylcholine. To identify these neurons, the ganglion cells were labeled by retrograde transport of a fluorescent dye, and the acetylcholine-synthesizing cells of the same retinas were labeled by exposing the tissue to tritiated choline. Autoradiographs inspected by fluorescence microscopy showed that tritiated acetylcholine and the dye accumulated in different cells. Optic nerves of other animals were sectioned, causing degeneration of many neurons of the ganglion cell layer. This loss affected neither the retina's overall rate of acetylcholine synthesis nor the number of acetylcholine-containing cells in the ganglion cell layer. The acetylcholine-synthesizing neurons thus appear to be displaced amacrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W2076864488,"Mutual coupling among oscillators of an ensemble has been proposed to explain the precision of some circadian rhythms. Reciprocal triggering is one of the most familiar forms of mutual coupling in nervous systems, but it can at best produce only modest improvement in temporal precision. Nevertheless, models with an elementary elaboration of such coupling show that circadian precision could be derived from oscillators that are intrinsically ""sloppy""; sufficient conditions are that output of the individual components be summed and that mutual triggering be mediated by a nonlinear phenomenon, such as a threshold."

https://openalex.org/W2024483071,"Regular consumers of caffeine had higher muscle tension after three or more hours of abstinence than low caffeine consumers. This difference was absent after double-blind administration of caffeine citrate or placebo. In a discriminative reaction time test, caffeine treatment improved performance. Among subjects receiving placebo, anxiety was highly correlated with prior caffeine use, suggesting that even a brief abstinence may produce anxiety in the regular user."

https://openalex.org/W2050982271,"Three major metabolites of propachlor were isolated from the excreta of germfree rats given 14C-labeled propachlor orally. In contrast, 11 urinary metabolites, six of which were 2-methylsulfonylacetanilides not present in excreta of germfree rats, were isolated from control rats given 14C-labeled propachlor orally. Enterohepatic circulation and microbial metabolism in the intestine were necessary for production of the methylsulfonyl-containing and other metabolites of propachlor in the conventional rat."

The decline in puffs appears to have been a major cause of the reported reductions in tar and nicotine yields during this period."

https://openalex.org/W1988447035,"Samples of minced mouse forebrain were treated in a way that resulted in a high ratio of false cholinergic transmitter (acetylhomocholine) to true transmitter (acetylcholine) in a synaptic vesicle fraction, and a low ratio of false to true transmitter in the nerve terminal cytoplasm. The spontaneous release of cholinergic transmitters from this minced tissue occurred independently of calcium and had a ratio of false to true transmitter similar to that of the cytoplasm, whereas the evoked transmitter release required calcium and had a ratio of false to true transmitter similar to that of the vesicular fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1972298619,"Electromyograms recorded by bipolar, fine wire electrodes placed into anatomically equivalent sites in skeletal muscles of vertebrates are repeatable when the animals use the muscles in a similar way. Repeatability applies to the number of spikes recorded from a given site and to their average amplitude as well as to the root-mean-square value, though the values obtained for these descriptors differ among muscles, and perhaps fascicles, of particular animals even when the animals are performing equivalent actions. Tests suggest that these results are not affected by the nature of most kinds of recording equipment. Also, substantial differences in electrode tip configuration and wire diameter induce relatively minor, less than 8 percent, differences in electrode resistance and impedance. Doubling the length of the fine wire leads produces less than an 8 percent (15 percent when the length is tripled) effect; however, the effect of electrode material may be as much as 85 percent in resistance and 20 percent in impedance. Reports of nonreproducibility or variability of electromyograms apparently result mainly from anatomically inexact placement into physiologically and histochemically different fascicles of compound muscles, from recordings of muscles that are active at very low levels, and perhaps from comparison among recordings of muscles that really differ in their activity level."

https://openalex.org/W2006933484,"When asynchronous and synchronous HeLa cells were incubated with small doses (10(-7) M) of tumor promoter 12 O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a variety of transient alterations in the replication cycle were detected within 24 hours by the use of independent methods. Especially, a delayed passage through the S phase and influences on the G2 phase resemble x-ray irradiation effects on cell cultures. None of these alterations was observed with the hyperplasiogenic but nonpromoting 4-O-methyl-TPA."

https://openalex.org/W1981832070,Trimethoprim in a concentration of 4 micrograms per milliter of Bacto-Casitone (Difco) medium inhibits the growth of nonvirulent Naegleria fowleri isolates. The growth of virulent strains is unaffected even with 400 micrograms of the drug per milliliter of medium. Differences in sensitivity constitute the possibility of a simple selection of environmental isolates. The pathogenicity and virulence of Naegleria species may be connected with the metabolism of folic acid.
