https://openalex.org/W2109439103,"F2-isoprostanes are prostaglandin F2-like compounds that are formed nonenzymatically by free radical-induced oxidation of arachidonic acid. We explored whether oxidation of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6ω3), which is highly enriched in the brain, led to the formation of F2-isoprostane-like compounds, which we term F4-neuroprostanes. Oxidation of docosahexaenoic acidin vitro yielded a series of compounds that were structurally established to be F4-neuroprostanes using a number of mass spectrometric approaches. The amounts formed exceeded levels of F2-isoprostanes generated from arachidonic acid by 3.4-fold. F4-neuroprostanes were detected esterified in normal whole rat brain and newborn pig cortex at a level of 7.0 ± 1.4 ng/g and 13.1 ± 8 ng/g, respectively. Furthermore, F4-neuroprostanes could be detected in normal human cerebrospinal fluid and levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease (110 ± 12 pg/ml) were significantly higher than age-matched controls (64 ± 8 pg/ml) (p < 0.05). F4-neuroprostanes may provide a unique marker of oxidative injury to the brain and could potentially exert biological activity. Furthermore, the formation of F4-neuroprostane-containing aminophospholipids might adversely effect neuronal function as a result of alterations they induce in the biophysical properties of neuronal membranes.

Isoprostanes (IsoPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IsoP, isoprostane; NP, neuroprostane; PG, prostaglandin; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; AA, arachidonic acid.are prostaglandin (PG)-like compounds that are formed nonenzymaticallyin vivo by free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid (AA). Their formation proceeds through bicyclic endoperoxide PGH2-like intermediates. The endoperoxide intermediates are reduced to form PGF2-like compounds (F2-IsoPs) (1Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F.

A novel aspect of the formation of IsoPs is that, unlike cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins, IsoPs are formed in situ esterified to phospholipids and subsequently released (4Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Quantification of F2-IsoPs has emerged as one of the most accurate approaches to assess oxidant injury in vivo (5Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IsoPs are capable of exerting potent biological activity (5Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6ω3) (DHA) has been the subject of considerable interest owing to the fact that it is highly enriched in the brain, particularly in gray matter, where it comprises approximately 25–35% of the total fatty acids in aminophospholipids (7Salem Jr., N. Kim H.-Y. Yergery J.A. Simopoulos A.P. Kifer R.R. Martin R.E. Health Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Seafoods. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 263-317Crossref Google Scholar, 8Skinner E.R. Watt C. Besson J.A.O. Best P.V. Brain. 1993; 116: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although DHA is present in high concentrations in neurons, neurons are incapable of elongating and desaturating essential fatty acids to form DHA. Rather, DHA is synthesized primarily by astrocytes after which it is secreted and taken up by neurons (9Moore S.A. Yoder E. Murphy S. Dutton G.R. Spector A.A. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of DHA in the brain is not well understood, deficiency of DHA is associated with abnormalities in brain function (10Conner W.E. Neuringer M. Reisbick S. Nutr. Rev. 1992; 50: 21-29Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that IsoP-like compounds could be formed by free radical-induced peroxidation of DHA. Because such compounds would be two carbons longer in length than IsoPs, it would be inappropriate to term these compounds IsoPs. Since DHA is highly enriched in neurons in the brain, we therefore propose to term these compounds “neuroprostanes” (NPs). One of our interests in the possibility that IsoP-like compounds could be formed from DHA derives from the fact that a role for free radicals in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases,e.g. Alzheimer's diesease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been suggested (11Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 12Knight J.A. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1997; 27: 11-25PubMed Google Scholar, 13Markesbery W.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). Thus, quantification of such compounds might provide a unique marker of oxidative injury in the brain. Furthermore, these compounds, like IsoPs, could potentially exert biological activity. This possibility is supported by the finding that PGF4α, the four series F-prostaglandin corresponding to the structure expected from cyclooxygenase action on C22:6, is approximately equipotent with cyclooxygenase-derived PGF2α in contracting gerbil colonic smooth muscle strips (13Markesbery W.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). In addition, the formation of NPs esterified in lipids might be expected to have significant effects on the biophysical properties of neuronal membranes, which might impair normal neuronal function. This may be particularly relevant, since it has been suggested that one of the physiological functions of DHA may be to maintain a certain state of membrane fluidity and promote interactions with membrane proteins that are optimum for neuronal function (14Salem Jr., N. Niebylske C.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Dratz E.A. Deese A.J. Simopoulos A.P. Kifer R.R. Martin R.E. Health Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Seafoods. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 319-351Crossref Google Scholar). The mechanism by which F4-NPs could be formed is outlined in Fig. 1, A–C. As noted, five DHA radicals are initially generated, which following addition of molecular oxygen, results in the formation of eight peroxyl radicals. These peroxyl radicals then undergo endocyclization followed by further addition of molecular oxygen to form eight bicylic endoperoxide intermediate regioisomers (not shown), which are then reduced to form eight F-ring NP regioisomers. Each regioisomer is theoretically comprised of eight racemic diastereomers for a total of 128 compounds. A nomenclature system for the IsoPs has been established and approved by the Eicosanoid Nomenclature Committee in which the different regioisomer classes are designated by the carbon number on which the side chain hydroxyl is located with the carboxyl carbon designated as C-1 (16Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, in accordance with this nomenclature system, the F-ring NP regioisomers are similarly designated as 4-series F4-NPs, 7-series F4-NPs, etc. Docosahexaenoic acid, pentafluorobenzyl bromide, and diisopropylethylamine were purchased from Sigma; dimethylformamide, undecane, and 1-butaneboronic acid from Aldrich;N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA); [2H9]N,O-bis(trimethysilyl)trifluoroacetamide from Regis Chemical (Morton Grove, Il); organic solvents from Baxter Healthcare (Burdick and Jackson Brand, McGaw Park, Il); C-18 Sep-Paks from Waters Associates (Milford, MA); 60ALK6D TLC plates from Whatman (Maidstone, UK); and [2H4]PGF2αfrom Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). DHA and AA were oxidized in vitro using iron/ADP/ascorbate as described (17Longmire A.W. Swift L.L. Roberts L.J., II Awad J.A. Burk R.F. Morrow J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Free and esterified F4-NPs were extracted using a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge, converted to a pentafluorobenzyl ester, purified by TLC, converted to a trimethylsilyl ether derivative, and quantified by stable isotope dilution negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography mass spectrometry using [2H4]PGF2α as an internal standard using a modification of the method described for the quantification of F2-IsoPs (18Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Instead of scraping 1 cm below to 1 cm above where PGF2α methyl ester migrates on TLC for analysis of F2-IsoPs, the area scraped was extended to 3 cm above where PGF2α methyl ester migrates. This extended area of the TLC plate was determined to contain F4-NPs by analyzing small 5-mm cuts using approaches for their identification described below. The M-ċCH2C6F5 ions were monitored for quantification (m/z 593 for F4-NPs and m/z 573 for [2H4]PGF2α). Quantification of the total amount of F4-NPs and F2-IsoPs was determined by integrating peak areas. Formation of cyclic boronate derivatives and hydrogenation were performed as described (19Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Electron ionization mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan Incos 50B quadropole instrument as described (19Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from seven subjects following informed consent. Subjects with Alzheimer's disease (n = 4) had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease during life. Control subjects (n = 3) were age-matched individuals without clinical evidence of dementia or other neurological disease; each had annual neuropsychological testing with all test scores within the normal range. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid was collected as part of a rapid autopsy protocol. Mean post-mortem intervals were 2.9 ± 0.3 h in control subjects and 2.7 ± 0.2 h in Alzheimer's patients. Brains were evaluated using standard criteria for Alzheimer's disease (20Khachaturian Z.S. Arch. Neurol. 1985; 42: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar, 21Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Bogel F.S. Hughes J.P. Van Belle G. Berg L. Neurology. 1991; 41: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with brainstem or cortical Lewy body formation, or significant cerebrovascular disease, were excluded. Control subjects demonstrated only age-associated alterations. Statistical analysis of data was performed using the unpaired t test. Molecular modeling was performed with Macspartan computer software. A representative selected ion current chromatogram obtained from the analysis for F4-NPs following oxidation of DHA in vitro with iron/ADP/ascorbate is shown in Fig.2. A series of m/z 593 peaks eluted over approximately a 90-s period beginning approximately 30 s after the elution of the [2H4]PGF2α internal standard. F4-NPs would be expected to have a longer GC retention time than PGF2α because their C-value is two units higher. It should be pointed out to avoid confusion that the time scales of some of the chromatograms obtained from the analysis of F4-NPs shown in subsequent figures are compressed or expanded compared with that in Fig. 2; this may give the impression that the relative abundances/pattern of the different isomers detected differs. Furthermore, the retention times over which the F4-NPs elute may differ somewhat in the different figures, because these analyses were performed on different days using different columns that vary somewhat in length. Analysis of these compounds as a [2H9]trimethylsilyl ether derivative resulted in a shift in the m/z 593 peaks to m/z 620, indicating the presence of three hydroxyl groups (not shown). Analysis following catalytic hydrogenation is shown in Fig.3. Prior to hydrogenation, no peaks were present 8 Da above m/z 593 at m/z 601. However, following hydrogenation, intense peaks appear at m/z 601, indicating the presence of four double bonds. The pattern of the hydrogenated compounds differs significantly from that of the nonhydrogenated compounds, because hydrogenation converts the compounds into new compounds that are resolved differently than the nonhydrogenated compounds. F4-NPs are formed by reduction of endoperoxide intermediates (Fig. 1). Thus, the cyclopentane ring hydroxyls must be oriented cis, but they can be either α,α or β,β. Evidence that these compounds contained a cyclopentane (prostane) ring with cis-oriented hydroxyls was obtained by analyzing the compounds as a cyclic boronate derivative (Fig.4). PGF2 compounds withcis-oriented prostane ring hydroxyls will form a cyclic boronate derivative bridging the ring hydroxyls (22Pace-Acsiak C.R. Wolfe L.S. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 56: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The M-ċCH2C6F5 ion for the cyclic boronate derivative is m/z 515. When the compounds were analyzed as a pentafluorobenzyl ester, trimethysilyl ether derivative, no intense peaks were present at m/z 515. However, when the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives were treated with 1-butaneboronic acid and then converted to a trimethylsilyl ether derivative, the intense peaks at m/z 593 were no longer present and intense peaks appeared at m/z 515. Again, the pattern of the m/z 515 peaks differs from that of compounds that were not treated with 1-butaneboronic acid because of differences in resolution of the individual compounds as a cyclic boronate derivative. Finally, these compounds were subjected to analysis by electron ionization mass spectrometry as a methyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivative. Multiple mass spectra consistent with compounds representing the different regioisomers of F4-NPs eluted from the GC column over approximately 45 s. This elution time differs from that of the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives used for negative ion chemical ionization, because methyl esters elute from the GC column much earlier and thus the duration over which they elute is compressed. When analyzed by electron impact mass spectrometry, the different F4-NP regioisomers would be expected to give characteristic α-cleavage ions of the trimethylsiloxy substituents on the side chains (Fig. 5). One of the mass spectra obtained is shown in Fig. 6. The ions designated with “A” are ions that would be generated from all of the different regioisomers. These include, in addition to the molecular ion at m/z 608, m/z 593 (M − 15, loss of ċCH3), m/z 539 (M - 90, loss of Me3SiOH), m/z 518 (M − 2 × 90)),m/z 501 (M − (90 + 15)), m/z 487 (M − 121, loss of ċOCH3 + 90), m/z 217 (Me3SiO–CH=CH=O+SiMe3), a characteristic ion of F-ring prostanoids (23Pace-Asciak C.R. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 18: 322Google Scholar), and m/z 191 (Me3SiO+=CH–OSiMe3), a rearrangement ion characteristic of F-ring prostanoids (23Pace-Asciak C.R. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 18: 322Google Scholar). The ions designated (17-S), (4-S), etc. indicate ions generated specifically from 17-series, 4-series, etc. regioisomers. These include the following: (a) 10-series regioisomer ions m/z539, (M − 69, lossċCH2(CH2)2CH3),m/z 449 (M − (69 + 90), m/z 359 (M − (69 + 2 × 90)), (b) 17-series regioisomer ionm/z 437 (M − 171, loss ofċCH(Me3SiOH)CH2CH=CHCH2CH3), (c) 7-series regioisomer ion m/z 409 (M − (109 + 90), loss ofċCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH3+ 90), (d) 13-series regioisomer ions m/z 401 (M − 207, loss ofċCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)2COOCH3),m/z 311, (M − (207 + 90)), m/z 219 (M − (309 + 90), loss ofċCH(Me3SiOH)CH2CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)2CO OCH3+ 90), and (e) 4-series regioisomer ion m/z 279 [M − (149 + 2 × 90), loss ofċCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH= CHCH2CH3 + 2 × 90). The six ions further designated with an asterisk represent specific α-cleavage ions of the trimethylsiloxy substituents of different regioisomers as shown in Fig.5. These data indicated that this was a mass spectrum of a mixture of six of the eight regioisomers co-eluting simultaneously from the GC column. This evidence for the presence of predicted six out of eight regioisomers supports the proposed mechanism of formation of these compounds outlined in Fig. 1.Figure 6Electron ionization mass spectrum obtained of putative F4-NPs as a methyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivative. An intense molecular ion is present at m/z608. The ions designated with an “A” are common ions generated from all regioisomers (see text for explanation). The designations (17-S), (4-S), etc. indicate ions specifically generated by compounds in the 17-series, 4-series regioisomers, etc. (see text for explanation). Ions further designated with an asteriskare specific α-cleavage ions of the trimethylsiloxy substituents for the different regioisomer classes as indicated in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time course of formation of F4-NPs during oxidation of DHA using iron/ADP/ascorbate was rapid, reaching a maximum level of approximately 5 μg/mg DHA at 50 min (Fig.7). We then compared the amounts of F2-IsoPs formed from oxidation of AA with the amounts of F4-NPs formed from DHA. In these experiments, equal molar amounts of AA and DHA were co-oxidized with Fe/ADP/ascorbate and the total amounts of F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs generated quantified. Interestingly, the relative amounts of F4-NPs formed exceeded that of F2-IsoPs by a mean of 3.4-fold (Fig. 8).Figure 8Relative amounts of F4-NPs and F2-IsoPs formed during co-oxidation of equal amounts of DHA and AA in vitro.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then undertook experiments to determine whether F4-NPs are present esterified in brain lipids in vivo (TableI). Both F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs were present at readily detectable levels esterified in lipids of normal whole rat brain at levels of 10.3 ± 3.1 and 7.0 ± 1.4 ng/g, respectively (n = 4). A selected ion current chromatogram obtained from one of these analyses is shown in Fig. 9. Although the levels of F2-IsoPs were slightly higher than the levels of F4-NPs, these differences were not significant (p > 0.05). However, levels of F4-NPs esterified in the cortex of newborn pig brain (13.1 ± 0.8 ng/g) greatly exceeded levels of F2-IsoPs (2.9 ± 0.4 ng/g) by a mean of 4.5-fold (n = 3) (p < 0.0001). Note that the pattern of F4-NP peaks detected esterified in brain differs somewhat than that of compounds formed by oxidation of DHA in vitro. We have also observed slight differences in the pattern of F2-IsoPs formed from oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro compared with that of compounds present esterified in tissue lipids. Although the reason for these differences has not been firmly established, a reasonable explanation for this is that there may be steric influences of phospholipids on the formation of different isomers from esterified substrate.Table ILevels of F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs measured esterified to lipids in whole normal rat brain (n = 4) and in brain cortex from newborn pig (n = 3)F2-IsoPsF4-NPsp value (F2-IsoP vs F4-NP)ng/gWhole brain from normal rat10.3 ± 3.17.0 ± 1.4>0.05Brain cortex from newborn pig2.9 ± 0.413.1 ± 0.8<0.0001F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs were measured as free compounds following base hydrolysis of a Folch lipid extract of brain tissue as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are expressed as nanograms of F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs measured per g of wet weight of tissue. Open table in a new tab F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs were measured as free compounds following base hydrolysis of a Folch lipid extract of brain tissue as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are expressed as nanograms of F2-IsoPs and F4-NPs measured per g of wet weight of tissue. As a measure of specificity of the assay to detect esterified F4-NPs in tissues, we analyzed for F4-NPs esterified in lipids in 1 ml of human plasma, which contains only very small amounts of DHA (Fig. 10) (7Salem Jr., N. Kim H.-Y. Yergery J.A. Simopoulos A.P. Kifer R.R. Martin R.E. Health Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Seafoods. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 263-317Crossref Google Scholar). Intense peaks were present in the m/z 569 ion current chromatogram representing F2-IsoPs but absent were peaks of significant intensity in the m/z 593 ion current chromatogram that would indicate the presence of F4-NPs at levels above the lower limits of detection (~5 pg/ml). Although F4-NPs can be readily detected esterified in the brain, the utility of such measurements to assess oxidative injury would primarily be restricted to animal models of neurological disorders or brain samples obtained post-mortem from humans. We therefore examined whether F4-NPs could be detected in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from four patients with Alzheimer's disease and three age-matched control subjects. F4-NPs were detected in 1–2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid from the control subjects at a level of 64 ± 8 pg/ml. Of considerable interest was the finding that the concentrations measured in the patients with Alzheimer's disease were significantly higher (110 ± 12 pg/ml) (p < 0.05). A selected ion current chromatogram obtained from the analysis of F4-NPs in cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with Alzheimer's disease is shown in Fig.11. The pattern of F4-NP peaks detected in free form in cerebrospinal fluid differs somewhat from the pattern peaks detected esterified in tissue phospholipids (Fig. 9). Similar differences have been observed for the pattern of F2-IsoP peaks detected in free form in plasma and urine compared with the pattern of peaks detected esterified in tissue phospholipids as free compounds following base hydrolysis of a tissue lipid extract. Although the reason for these differences has not been established, this may be explained by differences in the efficacy of phospholipases to hydrolyze different isomers from phospholipids. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of F2-IsoPs were similarly increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease but were lower than the levels of F4-NPs in both control subjects and Alzheimer's patients (46 ± 4 and 72 ± 7 pg/ml, respectively). These studies have elucidated a new class of F2-IsoP-like compounds formed in vivo by free radical-induced peroxidation of DHA. Free radical-induced peroxidation of AA results not only in the formation of F-ring IsoPs but also D-ring and E-ring IsoPs and thromboxane-like compounds (isothromboxanes) (2Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,3Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Wu A.

Thus, although it remains the subject of future studies, it is likely that analogous compounds in addition to F-ring NPs are also formed as products of nonenzymatic peroxidation of DHA. One of our motivations for determining whether IsoP-like compounds could be formed as peroxidation products of DHA involves the possibility that quantification of these compounds might provide a unique marker of oxidative injury in the brain that could be exploited to investigate the role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of neurological disease. The ultimate hope would be that quantification of F4-NPs could be utilized in studies of neurological disease in humans during life. Our findings indicate that these compounds are readily detected esterified in lipids in the brain. However, the application of such measurements in humans would be limited to samples of brain removed surgically or post-mortem samples of human brain. Measurements of F4-NPs made in human brain samples obtained after death could be quite problematic because of the possibility of artifactual generation of NPs by autoxidation of DHA during the time interval between death and sample procurement. This is not a unfounded concern as we previously demonstrated the occurrence of the generation of significant quantities of IsoPs by autoxidation of arachidonic acid in plasma, even when stored at −20 °C (19Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Although invasive, cerebrospinal fluid is frequently obtained for diagnostic purposes in patients with suspected neurological disorders. Thus, the availability of a marker of oxidative injury in the brain that could be measured in cerebrospinal fluid intra vitamwould be an important advance. Thus, the finding that F4-NPs could be detected in human cerebrospinal fluid clearly has potentially important clinical applications. Recently we have shown that markers of lipid peroxidation are increased in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (24Lovell M. Ehmann W. Mattson M. Markesbery W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Montine T.J. Montine K.S. Swift L.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1571-1575PubMed Google Scholar). However, these assays have shortcomings related to measurement of reactive molecules, i.e. 4-hydroxynonenal, and require large volumes of fluid. However, F4-NPs were detectable using negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry in 1–2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid from normal subjects, an amount that can usually be obtained safely from patients for diagnostic purposes. Although it was a limited study, the finding that F4-NP concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease were significantly higher than levels in age-matched control subjects highlights the potential of this approach to provide insights into the role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Another potentially important aspect of this finding is that serial measurements of F4-NPs in cerebrospinal fluid might provide a biochemical assessment of disease progression as well as a means to monitor efficacy of therapeutic intervention, e.g. with antioxidants, during life. To our knowledge, no other method has proven to be reliable to obtain such information. One question that arises is whether there is a distinct advantage of measuring either IsoPs or NPs to assess oxidative injury in the brain. The answer to this question is not forthcoming from the results of the studies reported herein. However, it is of interest that the relative amounts of F4-NPs formed during oxidation of DHA in vitro exceeded the amounts of F2-IsoPs generated from an equivalent amount of AA by as much as 3.4-fold (Fig. 8). This is consistent with the fact that of the naturally occurring fatty acids, DHA is the most easily oxidizable (15Dratz E.A. Deese A.J. Simopoulos A.P. Kifer R.R. Martin R.E. Health Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Seafoods. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 319-351Crossref Google Scholar). This suggests that measurement of F4-NPs in some situations may provide a more sensitive index of oxidative injury in the brain than measurement of F2-IsoPs. The ratio of levels of AA and DHA, and thus the capacity to form IsoPs and NPs, respectively, varies significantly between different regions of the brain (white matter, gray matter), different cell types (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), and subcellular fractions (myelin, synaptosomes) (7Salem Jr., N.

Neurochem. 1984; 43: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this regard, we found that levels of F4-NPs and F2-IsoPs esterified in whole rat brain were similar, whereas levels of F4-NPs were higher than levels of F2-IsoPs in the cortex of newborn pigs and in human cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, there may be distinct advantages associated with measuring either IsoPs or NPs to assess oxidant injury in the brain depending on the site of oxidant injury and the predominant cell types involved. Thus, the best approach at this time, which will provide valuable insight into this question, would be to quantify both IsoPs and NPs in a variety of situations involving different types of oxidative insults to the brain both in experimental animals and in human neurological disorders. The practicality of this approach will be facilitated by the fact that the method of assay we developed allows simultaneous measurement of both F4-NPs and F2-IsoPs in the same sample. There are additional ramifications that are potentially relevant to neuropathobiology that emerge from this discovery. Two of the IsoPs, previously referred to as 8-iso-PGF2α and 8-iso-PGE2, now termed 15-F2t-IsoP and 15-E2t-IsoP according to the approved nomenclature for IsoPs (16Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), have been found to possess potent biological activity ranging from effects on vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, endothelin release, platelet function, to cellular proliferation (5Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Of interest has been the evidence obtained which suggests that these IsoPs may exert their vascular effects by interacting with a unique receptor (5Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that NPs might also be found to possess important biological actions that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of oxidant injury to the brain. As mentioned, this possibility is greatly supported by the finding that C22-PGF4α is bioactive (7Salem Jr., N. Kim H.-Y. Yergery J.A. Simopoulos A.P. Kifer R.R. Martin R.E. Health Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Seafoods. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 263-317Crossref Google Scholar). This compound is one of the F4-NPs that would be formed, although, analogous to IsoPs, compounds in which the side chains are oriented cis likely predominate over compounds in which the side chains are orientedtrans in relation to the cyclopentane ring (19Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the IsoPs, inversion of the stereochemistry of the upper side chain of PGF2α and PGE2 affords different and/or more potent biological actions (5Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In addition, phospholipids containing esterified NPs are very unnatural and unusual molecules. Shown in Fig. 12is a molecular model of phosphatidylserine with palmitate esterified at the sn-1 position and a 13-series NP (13-F4t-NP) esterified at the sn-2 position. Mass spectral evidence for the formation of 13-series F4-NPs during oxidation of DHA was presented in Fig. 6. Trailing downward on the right from the polar head group above is palmitic acid. Trailing downward and then curving sharply upward on the left is the NP molecule in which the cyclopentane ring is seen at the top. Unmistakably, this is a remarkably distorted molecule. Thus, enhanced formation of these unusual phospholipids in neuronal membranes in settings of oxidant injury to the brain might lead to profound alterations in the biophysical properties of the membrane, e.g. degree of fluidity, which in turn might greatly impair normal neuronal function. Future studies using synthetic NP-containing aminophospholipids in model membranes to assess the extent to which these unique phospholipids alter membrane properties should provide valuable insight into the potential relevance of the formation of these phospholipids in settings of oxidative neuronal injury."

The generality of this early burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has now been investigated with human HL-60 cells, mouse 3T3-L1, and immortalized fibroblasts derived from wild-type mice. The effects of eliminating this early transient modification of nuclear proteins by depletion of PARP protein either by antisense RNA expression or by gene disruption on various morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis were then examined. Marked caspase-3-like PARP cleavage activity, proteolytic processing of CPP32 to its active form, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and nuclear morphological changes associated with apoptosis were induced in control 3T3-L1 cells treated for 24 h with anti-Fas and cycloheximide but not in PARP-depleted 3T3-L1 antisense cells exposed to these inducers. Similar results were obtained with control and PARP-depleted human Jurkat T cells. Whereas immortalized PARP +/+ fibroblasts showed the early burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and a rapid apoptotic response when exposed to anti-Fas and cycloheximide, PARP −/− fibroblasts exhibited neither the early poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation nor any of the biochemical or morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis when similarly treated. Stable transfection of PARP −/− fibroblasts with wild-type PARP rendered the cells sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that PARP and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may trigger key steps in the apoptotic program.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays important roles in development, homeostasis, and immunological competence. It is characterized by marked morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclear breakdown, and the appearance of membrane-associated apoptotic bodies, as well as by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); MNU,N-methyl-N-nitrosourea; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α. catalyzes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of various nuclear proteins with NAD as substrate, and, because it is activated by binding to DNA ends or strand breaks, PARP has been suggested to contribute to cell death by depleting the cell of NAD and ATP (1Berger N.A.

PARP undergoes proteolytic cleavage into 89- and 24-kDa fragments that contain the active site and the DNA-binding domain of the enzyme, respectively, during drug-induced apoptosis in a variety of cells (2Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; (53): 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, PARP has been implicated in the induction of both p53 expression and apoptosis (3Whitacre C.M. Hashimoto H. Tsai M.-L. Chatterjee S. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3697-3701PubMed Google Scholar), with the specific proteolysis of the enzyme thought to be a key apoptotic event (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P.

Caspase-3, a member of the caspase family of 10 or more aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that play a central role in the execution of the apoptotic program (7Alnemri E. Livingston D. Nicholson D. Salvesen G. Thornberry N. Wong W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar), is primarily responsible for the cleavage of PARP during cell death (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A.

Composed of two subunits of 17 and 12 kDa that are derived from a common proenzyme (CPP32), caspase-3 is related to interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and CED-3, which is required for apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans (8Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). In human osteosarcoma cells that undergo confluence-associated apoptosis over a 10-day period, caspase-3-like activity, measured with a specific [35S]PARP-cleavage assay in vitro, peaks at 6–7 days after initiation of apoptosis, concomitant with the onset of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). We recently examined the time course of PARP activation and cleavage during apoptosis in intact osteosarcoma cells by immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies to PARP, to the 24-kDa cleavage product of PARP, and to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) (9Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We observed a transient burst of synthesis of PAR from NAD that increased early and was maximal 3 days after initiation of apoptosis, prior to the appearance of internucleosomal DNA cleavage (at day 7) and before the cells became irreversibly committed to apoptosis. During this early period, expression of full-length PARP was detected by both immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. The amounts of both PAR and PARP decreased thereafter, and at 6 days, the 24-kDa cleavage product of PARP was detected both immunocytochemically and by immunoblot analysis. PAR was not observed during days 8 to 10, despite the presence of abundant DNA strand breaks, potential activators of PARP, during this time. These observations suggested that short-lived PARP-catalyzed poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may be important at an early stage of apoptosis and is followed by the cleavage of PARP by mid-apoptosis. We have now investigated whether this transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation occurs in other cell lines and with other inducers of apoptosis. We examined both cell lines stably transfected with inducible PARP antisense constructs (9Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M.E. Exp.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) to determine the effect of preventing the early burst in PARP activity on specific markers of apoptosis. Several PARP knockout mice have been established by disrupting the PARP gene in embryonic stem cells; these animals neither express PARP nor exhibit any poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (12Wang Z.Q. Auer B.

Despite variations in the physiological phenotypes of these animals, developmental apoptosis seems to take place in the absence of PARP. Furthermore, primary cells (fibroblasts, splenocytes, thymocytes) from these animals undergo apoptosis induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and other agents (13de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Waltzinger C. Chambon P. deMurcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The more recent PARP knockout mice exhibit extreme sensitivity to γ-irradiation and MNU, and primary cells derived from these mice showed an abnormal apoptotic response to MNU (13de Murcia J.

In contrast, >80% of primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from the earlier PARP knockout mice lost viability when exposed to anti-Fas (1000 ng/ml) for 8 h; thus, the absence of PARP does not seem to interfere with programmed cell death in these primary cells (14Wang Z. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Our previous studies with clonal cells depleted of PARP by expression of PARP antisense RNA have supported accessory roles for PARP and/or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in adipocyte differentiation (11Smulson M.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12804-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In DNA repair, for example, although the absence of PARP did not totally prevent the repair of single-strand breaks, it resulted in a significant delay in this process (16Ding R. Pommier Y. Kang V.H. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12804-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cell cultures presumably consist of a mosaic of different stages of development, many of which perhaps possess compensatory routes to overcome gene disruption. It is possible that biochemical roles, not easily observable in the context of the whole animal or in primary cultures of cells, can be identified in clonal cells because of more profound effects observed in these cells. The present study demonstrates the occurrence of a transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins at an early stage of apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, camptothecin, or antibodies to Fas in different cell lines. When this early poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was prevented as a result of depletion of endogenous PARP, either by gene disruption or by antisense RNA expression, several morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis were no longer observed in response to such inducers. A 1.1-kilobase fragment of murine PARP cDNA encoding the DNA-binding domain and the NH2-terminal automodification domain (for the mouse 3T3-L1 cell transfections) or a 3.7-kilobase XhoI full-length human PARP cDNA (for human Jurkat T cell transfection) was subcloned in an antisense orientation in the expression vector pMAM-neo (CLONTECH) under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. The resulting pMAM-As (antisense) or pMAM-neo (control) plasmids were transfected into cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (3T3-L1 cells) or by electroporation (Jurkat cells). Transfectants were selected in appropriate medium with G-418 (400 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells and fibroblasts derived from both wild-type and PARP knockout mice (12Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F.

The PARP +/+ and −/− fibroblasts, immortalized by a standard 3T3 protocol, were kindly provided by Z. Q. Wang (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France). Jurkat T cells and HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% and 20% fetal bovine serum, respectively. PARP −/− fibroblasts were either cotransfected with a plasmid expressing wild-type PARP (pcD-12; Ref. 17Alkhatib H.M. Chen D.F. Cherney B. Bhatia K. Notario V. Giri C. Stein G. Slattery E.

This vector system was utilized as the PARP −/− fibroblasts expressed an endogenous neo gene, which was used to establish the original PARP knockout mice.

Cytosolic extracts of various cells were prepared by rapid freezing and thawing of cells in a solution containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS detergent, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and aprotinin (10 μg/ml), followed by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 100,000 × g for 30 min and recovery of the supernatant. In vitroPARP-cleavage activity was measured in 25-μl reaction mixtures containing 5 μg of cytosolic protein, [35S]PARP (~5 × 104 cpm), 50 mm Pipes-KOH (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and PARP-cleavage products were visualized by fluorography. The procedures for fixation and staining with monoclonal antibodies to PAR (10HA) (18Kawamitsu H. Hoshino H. Okada H. Miwa M. Momoi H. Sugimura T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3771-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have been described previously (9Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W.

Cells were transferred to a slide in a Cytospin (IEC Centra), fixed with 10% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and dehydrated in 70%, 90%, and absolute ethanol for 3 min each at −20 °C. The slides were then incubated overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature with antibodies to PAR (1:250 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 12% bovine serum albumin. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution in PBS-bovine serum albumin), washed, and incubated for 30 min with streptavidin-conjugated Texas red (1:800 dilution in PBS-bovine serum albumin). Cells were finally mounted with PBS containing 80% glycerol and observed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. All exposure times were identical to allow comparisons of relative staining intensities at various times during apoptosis. For immunoblot analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer of proteins (30 μg per lane) to nitrocellulose membranes were performed according to standard procedures. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (0.1%) to confirm equal loading and transfer. After blocking of nonspecific sites, membranes were incubated with antibodies to PARP (1:2000 dilution) (19Ludwig A. Behnke B. Holtlund J. Hilz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6993-6999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to caspase-3 (1:10,000 dilution; kindly provided by Dr. D. Nicholson, Merck Labs). The membranes were subsequently probed with appropriate peroxidase-labeled antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (1:3000 dilution), and immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For detection of PAR bound to the separated proteins in the same blots, the membranes were stripped of antibodies by incubation at 50 °C for 30 min in a solution containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7); after blocking of nonspecific sites, they were reprobed with monoclonal antibodies to PAR (1:250 dilution). At indicated time intervals, cells were harvested by scraping, washed with ice-cold PBS, and assayed for PARP activity as described previously (20Cherney B.W. Midura R.J. Caplan A.J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sonicated for 20 s (three times) to lyse cells and introduce DNA strand breaks required for PARP activity, followed by measurement of [32P]NAD incorporation into acid-insoluble acceptors at 25 °C for 1 min. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 7m guanidine hydrochloride, and total genomic DNA was extracted and purified using a Wizard Miniprep DNA Purification Resin (Promega). After RNase A treatment (1 μg/50 μl) of the DNA samples for 30 min, apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining (0.5 μg/ml) as described previously (64Eldadah B. Yakovlev A. Faden A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4092-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 4% formalin, washed with PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33258 (24 mg/ml) in PBS containing 80% glycerol. An aliquot (25 μl) of the cell suspension was then dropped onto a slide, and nuclear morphology was observed with an Olympus BH2 fluorescence microscope. To investigate whether the brief activation of PARP during the early stages of apoptosis, detected initially by immunofluorescence in osteosarcoma cells (9Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is a general phenomenon, we examined several different cell types. The transient PARP activation occurs prior to the induction of caspase-3-like activity, as measured by the in vitro cleavage of [35S]methionine-labeled PARP into 89- and 24-kDa fragments by cell extracts derived at various stages of apoptosis. This burst of PAR synthesis also occurs before the onset of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis, which has been shown to begin on day 7 and peak at day 10, when almost 100% of the cells have undergone apoptosis (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although caspase-3 is the major protease responsible for the in vivo cleavage of PARP, other caspases have also been shown to partially cleave PARP at much lower efficiencies; thus, we refer to this activity as caspase-3-like. The time course of apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin in HL-60 cells is shorter than spontaneous apoptosis occurring in osteosarcoma cells, as evidenced by the detection of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by 6 h after induction (Fig.1 B). Caspase-3-like PARP-cleavage activity was apparent at 4 h and maximal at 6–8 h after induction (Fig. 1 C). Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PAR revealed an early transient peak of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins 2 h after induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1 A), prior to the onset of caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation, similar to that observed in osteosarcoma cells. Caspase-3-like cleavage of PARP apparently results in PARP inactivation as there are no poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated acceptors at the peak of caspase-3 like activity (6–8 h), even in the presence of massive DNA fragments (Fig. 1 B) at this time. We next examined murine 3T3-L1 cells that can be depleted of endogenous PARP by antisense RNA expression. We have previously used these cells, which are stably transfected with a dexamethasone-inducible PARP antisense construct, to investigate the role of PARP in differentiation (11Smulson M.E. Kang V.H.

(1998) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). PARP was shown to be required for a round of DNA replication that precedes the onset of differentiation in these cells. Because apoptosis has previously been induced in 3T3-L1 cells only by deregulated expression of c-Myc under conditions of serum deprivation (21Kohlhuber F. Hermeking K. Graessmann A. Eick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28797-28805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it was first necessary to establish conditions under which apoptosis could be triggered by exogenous inducers. 3T3-L1 cells transfected with the control vector (mock-transfected) were preincubated in the presence or absence of 1 mmdexamethasone for 72 h and then treated with various inducers of apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), camptothecin, or antibodies to Fas (anti-Fas) (even at a dose of 500 ng/ml, which is 10 times the concentration required to induce apoptosis in other cell lines) induced only a slight increase in caspase-3-like activity in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2). However, incubation of cells with a combination of anti-Fas and cycloheximide resulted in a marked induction of caspase-3-like activity, as indicated by the generation of the 89- and 24-kDa cleavage fragments of PARP. Densitometric scanning showed that ~60% of [35S]PARP substrate was converted to the 89-kDa cleavage product under these conditions. Cycloheximide alone did not induce apoptosis in these cells (data not shown). Cycloheximide has been previously shown to potentiate TNF-α-induced apoptosis (22Wu Y. Tewari M. Cui S. Rubin R. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 168: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Wright S. Kumar M. Tam A. Shen N. Varma M. Larrick J. J.

Aggarwal B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Ogasawara J. Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1157-1164PubMed Google Scholar); this latter effect of cycloheximide does not seem to be mediated by inhibition of translation because resistant cells can be sensitized to anti-Fas by subinhibitory concentrations of the drug. The presence of dexamethasone during the 72-h preincubation of mock-transfected 3T3-L1 cells had no effect on induction of caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 2 B). It was important to determine the kinetics of PARP depletion induced by antisense RNA expression in 3T3-L1 cells under the present conditions, given that our previous studies with this cell line had focused on the role of PARP in differentiation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of PARP in mock-transfected 3T3-L1 cells was not affected by incubation with dexamethasone (Fig.3 A). However, in the PARP-antisense cells, dexamethasone induced a time-dependent depletion of PARP, with only ~5% of the protein remaining after 72 h. Ponceau S staining for total protein on the same immunoblot confirmed essentially equal protein loading and transfer among lanes (Fig. 3 B). Whereas the in vitro PARP activity of control cells was not affected by incubation with dexamethasone, exposure of PARP-antisense cells to dexamethasone for 72 h resulted in an ~80% decrease in PARP activity (Fig. 3 C). 3T3-L1 control cells that had been preincubated with dexamethasone for 72 h were exposed to anti-Fas and cycloheximide for various times and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PAR. As in HL-60 and osteosarcoma cells, the extent of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins peaked early, 4 h after the induction of apoptosis in control 3T3-L1 cells, a stage at which all the cells were still viable and could be replated, and subsequently decreased (Fig.4 A).

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) constitute a subgroup of proteins belonging to the TGF-β superfamily. BMPs were initially identified by their ability to induce endochondral bone formation at ectopic sites, suggesting a critical role for this family in development and regeneration of the skeleton. They are also expressed at a variety of nonskeletal sites during development, suggesting possible extraskeletal roles for these proteins. We cloned a novel member of the BMP family that is expressed at high levels in the placenta and the prostate and that we have designated as prostate-derived factor (PDF). Based on cDNA sequence analysis, the predicted PDF protein contains two cysteines in addition to the seven conserved cysteines that are the hallmark of the members of the TGF-β superfamily. In addition, Northern blot hybridization to poly(A)+ RNA showed low levels of expression in the kidney and pancreas. We further characterized the expression of this member of the BMP family by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. These results show high expression in the terminal villae of the placenta. The expression of the protein as visualized by immunohistochemistry shows an expression pattern identical to that of the message in the terminal villae of the placenta. In day 18 rat embryos, protein expression was also seen in the skin and in the cartilaginous tissue of developing skeleton. Orchidectomy and dihydrotestosterone treatment of rats revealed that PDF expression is regulated by androgens in the prostate. In addition, subcutaneous implantation of recombinant PDF induced cartilage formation and the early stages of endochondral bone formation. These data indicate that PDF has a functional relationship to the BMPs.

These data indicate that PDF has a functional relationship to the BMPs. Morphogenetic proteins have been identified that play critical roles in regulating tissue differentiation and maintenance during embryogenesis and in the adult organism. These inductive proteins (morphogens) belong to a family of molecules called the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CDMP, cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein; DPP, Drosophiladecapentaplegic; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TEN, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mEDTA, 1 m NaCl; CMF, calcium-magnesium-free; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; 5αDHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone.superfamily. This superfamily includes bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), cartilage-derived morphogenetic proteins (CDMPs), Müllerrian inhibiting substance, activins, inhibins, TGF-β, growth and differentiation factors, and the Drosophiladecapentaplegic gene complex (DPP) (1Kingsley D.M.

Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 599-606Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These morphogenetic proteins are synthesized as large precursor molecules that are cleaved at a dibasic cleavage site (RXXR) to release carboxyl-terminal domains containing a characteristic motif of seven conserved cysteines. The biologically active proteins are homo- or heterodimers of the carboxyl-terminal domains (for review, see Ref. 1Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). TGF-β superfamily members have been implicated to perform various roles during embryogenesis, including dorsal ventral specification (DPP) (4Padgett R.W. St. Johnston R.D. Gelbart W.M. Nature. 1987; 325: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), formation of the axial and apendicular skeleton (various BMPs and CDMPs) (6Chang S.C. Hoang B. Thomas J.T. Vukicevic S. Luyten F.P. Ryba N.J.P. Kozak C.A. Reddi A.H. Moos Jr., M. J. Biol.

Farber N.M. Cheung A. Ninfa E.G. Frey A.Z. Gash D.J. Chowe P. Fisher R.A. Bertonis J.M. Torres G. Wallner B.P. Ramchandran K.L. Ragin R.C. Manganaro T.F. MacLaughilin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1986; 45: 685-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, it is clear that these proteins perform important roles during embryogenesis and in the adult animal. Several members of this family show overlapping patterns of expression during embryonic development, as well as functional redundancy, indicating the apparent importance of these proteins in embryogenesis (7Dudley A.T. Robertson E.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 8Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In addition to these redundant activities, recent data generated from identification of mutations in members of this protein family clearly show specific functions for different family members. For example, multiple recombinant BMPs and CDMPs are capable of inducing endochondral bone formation at ectopic sites (1Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 3Reddi A.H. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 599-606Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, mutations in CDMP-1 in humans and growth and differentiation factor-5, the murine homologue of CDMP-1, leads to specific morphological abnormalities in limbs and joints (9Thomas J.T. Lin K. Nandedkar M. Camargo M. Cervenka J. Luyten F.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10Storm E.E. Huynh T.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kingsley D.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1994; 368: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Thus, members of this family have specific activities in addition to the pluripotent functions each member might share with the rest of the family. These specific activities could be the result of exclusive expression in a spatial and temporal fashion during development or due to the expression or lack of expression of receptors. TGF-β superfamily proteins interact with and initiate intracellular effects through specific membrane bound receptors. A family of cell surface receptors that interacts and activates cell-specific responses upon binding ligands of the TGF-β superfamily has been identified. These receptors belong to a family of Ser/Thr kinase receptors and have been designated as either type I or type II based on their molecular weights (11Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 12Derynck R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 548-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 13Yamashita H. Ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Bone. 1996; 19: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Several different type I and type II receptors have been identified and cloned. Additional evidence indicates that the formation of a heteromeric complex of type I and type II receptors is required for signal transduction (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β family first bind the type II receptor. Ligand binding to the type II receptor causes phosphorylation and formation of a heteromer with the type I receptor. It is apparent that different combinations of type I and type II receptors can signal in response to the same ligand, and thus, the tissue-specific effect of any of the ligand would be dependent on the combinations of type I and type II receptors that are expressed by the different cell types. Receptor activation by ligands of the TGF-β superfamily results in the phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. Recent work has identified members of the mothers against dpp (MAD) proteins as downstream signaling molecules in the Ser/Thr kinase receptor signaling pathway. Ligand binding and receptor heterodimerization results in phosphorylation of the (MAD) proteins and their accumulation in the nucleus (15Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B.

Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The activation of specific (MAD) proteins is ligand- and receptor subtype-specific; thus, a combination of the ligand, the receptor profile, and the profile of the (MAD) proteins would define the final cellular response to a particular member of the TGF-β family. Recent work has also shown the ability of other secreted molecules to interact with and inhibit the activity of BMPs and other morphogens, such as Wnt, indicating yet another mechanism by which the activities of these proteins are regulatedin vivo (20Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. DeRobertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 21Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos M. Cell. 1997; 88: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). It is clear that ligands belonging to the TGF-β superfamily are highly conserved throughout evolution and that related genes play similar roles in vastly different organisms. The remarkable conservation of these proteins and their mechanisms of action are illustrated by the ability of Drosophila dpp to initiate endochondral bone formation in mammals and the ability of the mammalian homologues of dpp (the BMPs) to replace dpp function inDrosophila (22Padgett R.W. Wozney J.M. Gelbart W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2905-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 23Sampath T.K. Rashka K.E. Doctor J.S. Tucker R.F. Hoffmann F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6004-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work based on phenotypic effects identified upon inactivation of members of this family also illustrates the crucial role for these proteins in tissue differentiation and interaction in organisms as diverse asDrosophila and humans (Ref. 9Thomas J.T. Lin K. Nandedkar M. Camargo M. Cervenka J. Luyten F.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 24Tickle C. Nature. 1994; 368: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are expressed in a variety of tissue and cell types during organogenesis (7Dudley A.T. Robertson E.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 8Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). They seem to play an important role in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions based on their expression pattern, as well as on their in vitro and in vivoeffects (3Reddi A.H. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 599-606Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, despite the significant advances in the identification and characterization of members of the TGF-β superfamily, there still remain organs and tissues that do not appear to require members of this family for their differentiation and/or maintenance. It is possible that these proteins do not play a role in differentiation of some tissues or that further characterization of existing family members will show their involvement in as yet unidentified functions. On the other hand, it is likely that there remain members of this family that are not yet identified. In order to test the second hypothesis, we aimed to identify other members of this family that may play important roles in mammalian development. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a new member of the TGF-β/BMP superfamily, designated prostate-derived factor (PDF). In order to identify potentially novel family members of the TGF-β/BMP family, we searched the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and Their Expression (IMAGE) Consortium data base of expressed sequence tags (25Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Expressed sequence tag entry R33078 exhibited limited sequence homology to BMP family members. We designed a nested 5′RACE strategy in order to obtain more sequence data and confirm the homology. The source DNA was a human spleen cDNA library, and the 3′ oligonucleotide primers for the first and second round of amplification were DW3 (5′-GGGTCTTTTGAATGAGCACCATTTGGGATT-3′) and DW4 (5′-CGCGCCGTAGCACATGGTCACTTGCACCTC-3′). A SP6 primer was used as the 5′ primer in both rounds. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was sequenced and shown to extend to nucleotide 10, as shown in Fig. 2. Having confirmed sequence homology to known BMP family members, we attempted to isolate the full-length cDNA by library screening. IMAGE clone 140296 (R66917) was ordered from Research Genetics and used to probe a human placental cDNA library (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (CLONTECH). One clone representing the full sequence except for the 5′ three amino acids was isolated. The absence of the initiation codon in this clone was recognized by querying the IMAGE data base with the 5′ sequence of the cDNA clone. Multiple clones within the data base demonstrated that the open reading frame extended to that shown in Fig. 2. Based on these data, we engineered the initiation codon by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into pCR 3.1-Uni 3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the sequence was confirmed by double stranded DNA sequencing (GenBankTM accession no.AF003934).Figure 2Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the full-length PDF cDNA.

These were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 7.5× Denhardt's solution (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 42 °C in the same buffer. The probe was the same cDNA probe used for the library screening. The blots were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, three times for 20 min each at room temperature followed by two washes for 20 min each in 0.3× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and then exposed to Eastman Kodak XAR film. For Southern blot hybridization, 1 μg of each of genomic human DNA was digested overnight with EcoRI, XbaI,HindIII, or BamHI. The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis overnight on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The membrane was then probed with 32P-labeled PDF probe as described above and subjected to autoradiography and normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA. For in situ hybridization IMAGE clone 140296 was subcloned into PCR 2.0 plasmid (Invitrogen). The plasmid was linearized by digesting with either XbaI orSpeI, and the linearized plasmids were then used as a template to make sense and antisense 35S-labeled PDF riboprobes using T7 (sense probe using SpeI linearized plasmid) or SP6 (antisense probe with theXbaI linearized plasmid) RNA polymerase, respectively. Sections of human placenta, prostate, and accessory male genital glands were obtained by Dr. S. Vukicevic, University of Zagreb. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 5 mm, and mounted on silanated slides. Sections were deparaffinated in Histoclear (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), rehydrated in a descending ethanol series (100–50%), and washed twice for 5 min each in PBS. Nonspecific sulfur binding sites were blocked in PBS containing 4 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (iodoacetamide andN-ethymaleimide) for 30 min at 45 °C. Sections were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml heparin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 1× Denhardt's solution for at least 1 h at 50 °C; sections were then hybridized in the same buffer with 2 × 106counts/section of either sense or antisense 35S-labeled PDF riboprobe for 16–18 h at 50 °C in a humid chamber. After hybridization, sections were rinsed in 2× SSC for 15 min at 50 °C; in 2× SSC, 50% formamide, 20 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 65 °C; in TEN buffer twice for 10 min each; and in 20 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were then washed as described in (27Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1990; 109: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were dipped in NTB-2 autoradiography emulsion (Kodak) and exposed for 1 week in the dark at 4 °C. Slides were developed in Kodak D-19 solution (diluted 1:1 with water) for 4 min at 16 °C, fixed, rinsed in water, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted in Permount (Fisher). An antibody was raised in rabbits to a 15-amino acid peptide sequence (DTGVSLQTYDDLLIA) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an added carboxyl-terminal cysteine. Anti-PDF antibody was purified using peptide affinity chromatography and characterized by Western blot analysis against recombinant PDF expressed in CHO cells following transfection with a mammalian expression plasmid containing PDF (pcDNA 3.1). Stable cell clones expressing PDF were selected and made serum-free for 48 h. The serum-free media were collected and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting protein pellets were dissolved in 5× Laemmli sample buffer with 2% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to electrophoresis on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a Nytran membrane and visualized by Western blot analysis using the affinity-purified antibodies described above and detected by chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Tissues for immunolocalization were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in calcium-magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF/PBS) for 24 to 48 h, rinsed in CMF/PBS and embedded in paraffin using standard protocols. For immunolocalization of PDF, sections were deparaffinated with 3× Histoclear. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by a 10-min incubation in 3% H2O2 in methanol followed by a 10-min incubation in CMF/PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1.5% donkey serum in CMF/PBS for 30 min at room temperature followed by incubation in 10 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit anti-PDF diluted in CMF/PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were rinsed three times in CMF/PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min at room temperature and then incubated in a biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min at room temperature and developed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. R mutant mink lung epithelial cells (clonal Mv1Lu cells that lack the receptors for TGF-β1) were obtained from Dr. J. Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and cultured in minimum essential medium without l-Histidinol, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. The full-length PDF expression plasmid and a p3TP-Lux promoter-reporter construct (obtained from J. Massague) were transfected into either wild type or R mutant Mv1Lu cells using Tfx 50 (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. The p3TP-Lux promoter contains three consecutive TPA response elements and a portion of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promoter region and has been shown to be induced by TGF-β and the various BMPs (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were trypsinized and then replated into 6-well dishes the next day. Cells were made serum-free 2 h after replating, and the control wells were treated with recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. The next day, luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's direction. Seven to eight-month-old male Charles River rats weighing approximately 600 g were orchidectomized and allowed to recover for 3 weeks. The groups of animals (n = 3) were treated with 1 mg/kg 5αDHT (Sigma) and sacrificed at the indicated time points. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from the ventral prostates and used (1 μg/lane) for Northern blot analysis of PDF mRNA expression. Serum-free tissue culture media obtained from either CHO cells expressing recombinant PDF (650 ng or 1 μg/pellet of total protein) or nontransfected CHO cells was reconstituted with 25 mg of guanidine-insoluble collagenous residue of demineralized rat bone matrix (31Vukicevic S. Latin V. Chen P. Batorsky R. Reddi A.H. Sampath T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The resulting pellets were implanted subcutaneously into 1-month-old male Long-Evans rats. The implants were recovered on day 11 followed by histological analysis for bone and cartilage induction. To identify new members of the TGF-β/BMP superfamily we searched the IMAGE Consortium data base of expressed sequence tag. Northern blot analysis indicated that one expressed sequence tag was expressed at very high levels in the placenta and the prostate and had restricted expression in other tissues (Fig. 1). Other than the placenta and prostate, only the kidney and pancreas showed detectable levels of expression among the various tissues tested. Given the expression pattern, this sequence was designated PDF and used as a radiolabeled probe to screen a human placental cDNA library. Two cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. One of the clones had a 5′ deletion in the open reading frame about 30 amino acids from the start site, and this clone was not pursued further. Based on a search of the expressed sequence tag data base, we realized that the second clone lacked the coding region for the starting methionine and the next two amino acids. We used a PCR-based strategy to add the 5′ missing base pairs and obtain a full-length PDF cDNA as described under “Materials and Methods.” The open reading frame codes for a protein containing a hydrophobic leader sequence, a prodomain of approximately 175 amino acids, a dibasic cleavage site, and a mature domain containing nine conserved cysteine residues, hallmarks of members of the TGF-β superfamily (Fig. 2 A). Based on the presence of nine cysteine residues in the mature protein, PDF is structurally more related to the TGF-βs and the β-chain of inhibins than to other members of the superfamily (Fig. 2 B). However, the mature protein also has sequence similarities to the BMP6, BMP7/OP-1 subfamily, as well as sequences that are identical to those present in growth and differentiation factor-7 (not shown). An anti-peptide antibody to a sequence present in the mature protein was raised in rabbits. Western blot analysis of media obtained from CHO cells stably transfected with a PDF expression construct showed that upon reduction, PDF is detectable as a monomer of 16 kDa. A second band migrating at 42 kDa probably corresponds to the unprocessed PDF monomer (Fig. 2 C). Both of these bands were absent in medium obtained from control (pcDNA 3-transfected) cells (Fig. 2 C, lane B). Similar bands, corresponding to the reduced and unprocessed monomeric forms, have been seen in tissue culture media when other members of the BMP family have been expressed (30Jones W.K. Richmond E.A. White K. Sasak H. Kusmik W. Smart J. Oppermann H. Rueger D.C. Tucker R.F. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA yielded a very simple pattern, suggesting the presence of a single PDF gene (Fig.3). Northern analysis of human tissues expressing PDF suggests that it is not widely expressed (Fig. 1). In order to understand and characterize the precise cell types that express PDF, we used a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to localize PDF in the most highly expressing tissues placenta and prostate. The cell type-specific distribution of PDF was initially analyzed in the placenta by in situhybridization and revealed that PDF mRNA is expressed at very high levels in the cells of the terminal villi (Fig.4 A). Control hybridizations done with the probe corresponding to the sense strand showed no binding, indicating the specificity of the localization obtained with the antisense probe (Fig. 4 B). Immunohistochemistry in corresponding serial sections using the affinity-purified anti-PDF polyclonal antibody showed a pattern of expression identical to the one obtained with in situ hybridization (Fig. 4, Cand D). The expression of PDF in whole embryo sections was further characterized using serial sections from 18-day-old rat embryos. In these sections, it can be seen that the protein was also expressed specifically in the skin and in cartilaginous tissue of the developing embryo (Fig. 4, E–G). Very little expression of the protein was detected in other skeletal tissues at this stage of development. In a human postnatal prostate, in situhybridization of PDF revealed that PDF message was expressed in both the normal and hypertrophic prostate. Expression was seen in the epithelium of the main prostatic glands (Fig.5). No specific hybridization was seen in the fibromuscular stroma. To determine the specificity of PDF localization, we performed further experiments using other accessory male genital glands, namely seminal vesicles and bulbourethral glands. Results indicate that PDF was mainly present in the secretory epithelium of the prostatic main glands (Fig.6 B), whereas mucosal prostatic glands close to the urethra in the main lobe, tubulo-alveolar epithelium of the bulbourethral glands, and the epithelium of the seminal vesicle did not express PDF protein (Fig. 6, C–E). These data suggest that main prostatic glands but not other accessory male genital glands produce PDF.Figure 5PDF mRNA expression in human prostate.

Magnification, × 60 in D andE; × 100 in A–C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of androgens in the control of PDF expression in prostate was investigated by studying the expression pattern of PDF following orchidectomy. Orchidectomy resulted in a dramatic decrease in prostate size and a similar decrease in the expression of PDF compared with sham-operated controls animals (Fig.7). Treatment of orchidectomized animals with 5αDHT (1 mg/Kg) resulted in a time-dependent increase in PDF expression, with maximum increase (2-fold) over control seen 6 h after treatment (Fig. 7). Although the levels of PDF do not approach those of sham-operated control animals, it should be noted that the increase in expression was seen upon a single dose of 5αDHT. The ability of PDF to activate specific cell surface receptors was investigated using a p3TP-Lux promoter reporter construct. This construct is regulated by members of the TGF-β/BMP superfamily in a receptor-specific manner (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). This reporter construct was transfected into wild type and R mutant Mv1Lu cells (data not shown). The R mutant cells lack type II receptors for TGF-β, and although they express the endogenous BMP receptors, co-transfection of BMP receptors along with the reporter construct results in a superinduction of luciferase activity upon BMP treatment. Transfection of PDF along with p3TP-Lux resulted in a 5-fold induction of luciferase activity over control cells, which were transfected with pcDNA3 along with p3TP-Lux (Fig. 8). These results suggest that PDF activates signal transduction along the same pathway as other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Because PDF is a member of the BMP superfamily, we next investigated the ability of PDF to induce ectopic bone formation. Tissue culture medium containing recombinant PDF was reconstituted and subcutaneously implanted as described previously (29Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7599-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Histological examination of the implants revealed the presence of cells with a typical chondrocytic morphology (Fig.9, B–D, arrows), as well as metachromatic staining of cartilage matrix (Fig. 9, B–D), indicating biological activity in the media. Pellets reconstituted with tissue culture media from mock-transfected cells did not show any chondrocytic cells (Fig. 9 A). These results were similar to those observed upon implantation of CDMP-1 (6Chang S.C. Hoang B. Thomas J.T. Vukicevic S. Luyten F.P. Ryba N.J.P. Kozak C.A. Reddi A.H. Moos Jr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28227-28234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when development of a predominantly cartilagenous tissue was observed following subcutaneous implantation. We report here the cloning of a new member of the TGF-β/BMP superfamily. In contrast to other members of the family, PDF expression is more tissue restricted, at least at the current level of detection. Identification of additional sites of expression of PDF will help to better define the in vivo physiological role of PDF. The activity of proteins of the BMP superfamily is regulated through specific cell surface receptors. Because the family of TGF-β receptors bind more than one ligand, it is clear that a certain combination of receptors present on the surface of a cell dictates its response to a specific member of the TGF-β/BMP family of proteins. At present, we have shown the ability of PDF to initiate activation of the p3TP-Lux promoter reporter construct indicating receptor activation similar to other members of the superfamily. Clearly, the identification of specific receptors that interact with PDF and their expression pattern will be important in understanding the physiological function of PDF. Extracellular matrix interactions can also regulate the activity of members of the TGF-β superfamily (31Vukicevic S. Latin V. Chen P. Batorsky R. Reddi A.H. Sampath T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Paralkar V.M. Nandedkar A.K.N. Pointer R.H. Kleinman H.K. Reddi A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17281-17284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, a number of studies have shown the regulation of expression of TGF-β family proteins during embryonic development. However, little is known about the ability of other hormones or morphogens to regulate the expression of these proteins. The identification of these upstream signaling molecules will be a major focus of future studies. In conclusion, PDF is related to the inhibin β-chain based on structural similarity of the conserved nine cysteine residues, but it is also related to the BMP6, BMP7/OP-1 subfamily in terms of sequence identities. Based on biological activity, PDF appears to initiate a signaling cascade similar to that of other members of the TGF-β/BMP family. Although PDF is a member of this family of proteins, it is difficult to place in any one subgroup due to the presence of sequences and structural motifs that place it in more than one subgroup. Based on its in vivo biological ability to induce bone, it has classical BMP-like activity. Based on its expression in the prostate, regulation by androgens, and ability to induce bone formation, we believe that future work regarding the identification of its in vivo functional role in the prostate and its regulation of expression by other hormones and growth factors will result in obtaining important insight into the role of TGF-β superfamily members in prostate development and maintenance.

Ara h1, an abundant peanut protein, is recognized by serum IgE from >90% of peanut-sensitive individuals. It has been shown to belong to the vicilin family of seed storage proteins and to contain 23 linear IgE binding epitopes. In this communication, we have determined the critical amino acids within each of the IgE binding epitopes of Ara h1 that are important for immunoglobulin binding. Surprisingly, substitution of a single amino acid within each of the epitopes led to loss of IgE binding. In addition, hydrophobic residues appeared to be most critical for IgE binding. The position of each of the IgE binding epitopes on a homology-based molecular model of Ara h1 showed that they were clustered into two main regions, despite their more even distribution in the primary sequence. Finally, we have shown that Ara h1 forms a stable trimer by the use of a reproducible fluorescence assay. This information will be important in studies designed to reduce the risk of peanut-induced anaphylaxis by lowering the IgE binding capacity of the allergen.

This information will be important in studies designed to reduce the risk of peanut-induced anaphylaxis by lowering the IgE binding capacity of the allergen. It is estimated that up to 8% of children and 2% of adults have allergic reactions to foods (1Jansen J.J. Kardinaal A.F.M. Huijber G. Vleig-Boestra B.J. Martens B.P. Ockhuizen T. J. Allergy Clin.

Peanut allergy is one of the most common and serious of the immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods in terms of persistence and severity of reaction. Unlike the clinical symptoms of other food allergies, the reactions to peanuts are rarely outgrown; therefore, most diagnosed children will have the disease for a lifetime (4Sampson H.A. Burks A.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Bock S.A. J. Pediatr. 1985; 107: 676-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In a sensitized individual, ingestion of peanuts results in mast cell-bound IgE binding to a specific allergen. The IgE-allergen complex causes mast cell receptors to cross-link, inducing a signal transduction cascade that ends in degranulation and release of a variety of mediators that give rise to the clinical symptoms of peanut hypersensitivity (6Bock S.A. Atkins F.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1989; 83: 900-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 7Kaminogawa S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The majority of cases of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis involve ingestion of peanuts (8Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Sampson H.A. Mendelson L. Rosen J.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Currently, the only effective treatment for food allergy is avoidance of the food. For peanut-allergic individuals, total avoidance is difficult since peanuts are increasingly being used in the diet as an economical protein source in processed foods. Because of the significance of the allergic reaction and the widening use of peanuts as protein extenders in processed foods, there is increasing interest in defining the allergenic proteins and exploring ways to decrease the risk to the peanut-sensitive individual. Various studies over the last several years have identified the major allergens in peanuts as belonging to different families of seed storage proteins (10Burks A.W. Shin D. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Stanley J.S. King N. Burks A.W. Huang S.K. Sampson H. Cockrell G. Helm R.M. West C.M. Bannon G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For example, two of the major peanut allergens Ara h1 and Ara h2 belong to the vicilin and conglutin families of seed storage proteins, respectively. The vicilins represent one of the most abundant proteins found in legumes used for human consumption. This class of proteins does not have any known enzymatic activity but is thought to interact with each other to form unique higher order oligomeric structures that may help in packaging these proteins into seeds (12Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because the vicilins represent such a large percentage of the total protein in a seed, any approach designed to alter the IgE binding capacity of this protein would require that the genetically engineered gene product retain its native function, properties, and three-dimensional structure. Genetically modified plants are being used more frequently as food sources for human consumption. The major emphasis has been on the introduction of genes whose products would enhance the nutritional value or disease resistance of the transgenic plant. One of the major concerns of this approach is that a gene will be introduced that encodes an unwanted or unknown allergen that would put allergic individuals at risk. Indeed, the introduction of a gene encoding a major Brazil nut allergen into soybeans, ostensibly to increase the nutritional value of soybeans, is a prime example (13Nordlee J.A. Taylor S.L. Townsend J.A. Thomas L.A. Bush R.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In cases where allergens are transferred into plants, consumers must be informed of the existence of the allergen by labeling as suggested by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, a range of tests that compare the physicochemical properties of known allergens with expressed transgenic products has been proposed for those gene products of unknown allergenicity (14Astwood J.D. Leach J.N. Fuchs R.L. Nature Biotechnology. 1996; 14: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 15Veiths S. Aulepp H. Becker W-M. Buschmann L. Eisenband G. Food Allergies and Intolerances. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 130-149Google Scholar, 16Hefle S.L. Nordlee J.A. Taylor S.L. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1996; 36: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Currently, there is little known about the physicochemical properties of many of the plant allergens, and there have been few investigations aimed at modifying allergenic proteins. Previous work on the allergenic aspects of the Ara h1 protein has shown that it is recognized by serum IgE from >90% of the peanut-sensitive individuals, indicating that it is a major allergen involved in the clinical etiology of this disease (17Burks A.W. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1715-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recently, using pooled serum IgE from a population of peanut-hypersensitive individuals, 23 linear IgE binding epitopes of this allergen have been mapped (10Burks A.W. Shin D. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). There was no obvious sequence motif shared by the epitopes. In this communication, we have determined the critical amino acids within each of the IgE binding epitopes of Ara h1 that are important to immunoglobulin binding. Surprisingly, substitution of a single amino acid within each of the epitopes led to loss of IgE binding. In addition, the hydrophobic residues located in the center of the epitope appeared to be most critical to IgE binding. The position of each of the IgE binding epitopes on a homology-based tertiary structure model of Ara h1 showed that they were clustered into two main regions. This was in contrast to previous observations that showed the IgE binding epitopes distributed evenly along the linear sequence of the molecule. Finally, we have shown that, like other vicilins, Ara h1 forms a stable trimer by the use of a reproducible fluorescence assay. This assay will allow for the rapid assessment of the effect that amino acid changes in Ara h1 primary sequence have on tertiary structure. This information will be important in studies designed to reduce the risk of peanut-induced anaphylaxis by lowering the IgE binding capacity of the allergen. Serum from 15 patients with documented peanut hypersensitivity reactions (mean age, 25 years) was used to determine relative binding affinities between wild type and mutant Ara h1 synthesized epitopes. The patients had either a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) 1The abbreviations used are: DBPCFC, double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge; Fmoc,F-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). or a convincing history of peanut anaphylaxis (laryngeal edema, severe wheezing, and/or hypotension; Ref. 18Burks A.W.

At least 5 ml of venous blood was drawn from each patient and allowed to clot, and serum was collected. A serum pool from 12 to 15 patients was made by mixing equal aliquots of serum IgE for our experiments. The pools were then used in immunoblot analysis. All studies were approved by the Human Use Advisory Committee at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Individual peptides were synthesized on a derivatized cellulose membrane usingN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acid active esters according to the manufacturer instructions (Genosys Biotechnologies, Woodlands, Texas; Ref. 19Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). Peptide synthesis reactions were monitored by bromphenol blue color reactions during certain steps of synthesis. Cellulose-derivitized membranes and Fmoc amino acids were supplied by Genosys Biotechnologies. All other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI) or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Membranes were either probed immediately or stored at −20 °C until needed. Cellulose membranes containing synthesized peptides were washed 3 times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 136 mmNaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, and 50 mmTrizma (Tris base, pH 8.0) for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated overnight in blocking buffer (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20; concentrated membrane-blocking buffer supplied by Genosys; and sucrose (9.0:1.0:0.5)). The membrane was then incubated in pooled sera diluted 1:5 in 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody was detected with 125I-labeled equine anti-human IgE (Kallestad, Chaska, MN) followed by autoradiography. Relative amounts of IgE binding to individual peptides were determined by scanning autoradiographs using a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) model GS-700 imaging laser densitometer and quantitated with Bio-Rad molecular analyst software. A background area was scanned and subtracted from the obtained values. Following quantitation, wild type intensities were normalized to a value of one, and the mutants were calculated as percentages relative to the wild type. Molecular modeling and computations were performed on Silicon Graphics workstations running IRIX 6.2. The Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group (GCG) software package (20Devereux J. Haeberli P.

Ara h1 was modeled as a monomer using the COMPOSER module of SYBYL Version 6.3 from Tripos Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Phaseolin is a smaller protein than Ara h1, and it only allowed for the modeling of the region between residues 172–586. Residues Ser211-Asp219 and Asn281-Lys282 on the structure of phaseolin were not solved because of low electron density (12Lawrence M.C. Izard T. Beuchat M. Blagrove R.J. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 748-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Before attempting to use the structure for modeling, the regions were constructed using the protein loop search option in SYBYL and minimized using local annealing and the Powell algorithm. Alignment between Ara h1 and phaseolin was determined using COMPOSER and was optimized with information from alignment of Ara h1 to other vicilin homologs using the GCG pileup program. Following alignment, structurally conserved regions were constructed. Loops were then added using orientations to fragments from x-ray crystal structures in the SYBYL data base following homology searches and fitting screens. The model was minimized with the CHARMM force field using the Adopted Basis Newton-Raphson method using QUANTA Version 96 from Molecular Simulations Inc./BIOSYM (Burlington, MA). The protein backbone was given a harmonic force constraint constant of 500 to hold it rigid during the first 400 iterations of minimization, followed by relaxation with 100 steps each at constraints of 400, 300, 200, and 100 and a final 400 steps with a constraint of 10 (23Brooks B.R.

Shin, H. Sampson, A. W. Burks, and G. A. Bannon, manuscript in preparation. A constant amount of the labeled protein, 10 nm, in binding buffer (50 mmTris, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) was mixed with serial dilutions (by 0.5 or 0.8 increments) of unlabeled Ara h1 to analyze oligomer formation. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Beacon fluorescence polarization spectrometer (Pan Vera, Madison, WI) with fixed excitation (490 nm) and emission (530 nm) wavelengths at room temperature (24 °C) in a final volume of 1.1 ml (25Royer C.A. Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 481-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Each data point is an average of three independent measurements. The intensity of fluorescence remained constant throughout the polarization measurements. Cross-linking experiments were done exactly as described in Maleki et al. (27Maleki S.J. Royer C.A. Hurlburt B.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6762-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were desalted into phospate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, using disposable PD-10 gel filtration columns. The protein cross-linking reagent utilized was dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP). Limited cross-linking was performed so the monomer disappearance could be observed and to minimize the formation of nonspecific complexes. The amino acids essential to IgE binding in the Ara h1 epitopes were determined by synthesizing duplicate peptides with single amino acid changes at each position. These peptides were then probed with pooled serum IgE from 15 patients with peanut hypersensitivity to determine if the changes affected peanut-specific IgE binding. An immunoblot strip containing the wild type and mutated peptides of epitope 9 is shown in Fig. 1. Binding of pooled serum IgE to these individual peptides was dramatically reduced when either alanine or methionine was substituted for each of the amino acids at positions 144, 145, and 147–150. Changes at positions 144, 145, 147, and 148 had the most dramatic effect when methionine was substituted for the wild type amino acid, resulting in less than 1% of peanut-specific IgE binding to these peptides. In contrast, the substitution of an alanine for arginine at position 152 resulted in increased IgE binding. The remaining Ara h1 epitopes were tested in the same manner, and the intensity of IgE binding to each spot was determined as a percentage of IgE binding to the wild type peptide (TableI). Each epitope could be mutated to a non-IgE binding peptide by the substitution of a single alanine or methionine residue.Table IAmino acids critical to IgE bindingPeptideAmino acid sequencePosition 1AKS SPYQ KKT25–34 2QEPDDLKQKA48–57 3LEYDPRLVYD65–74 4GERTRGRQPG89–98 5PGDYDDDRRQ97–106 6PRREEGGRWG107–116 7REREEDWRQP123–132 8EDWRRPSHQQ134–143 9QPRKIRPEGR143–15210TPGQFEDFFP294–30311SYLQEFSRNT311–32012FNAEFNEIRR325–33413EQEERGQRRW344–35314DITNPINLRE393–40215NNFGKLFEVK409–41817RRYTARLKEG498–50718ELHLLGFGIN525–53419HRIFLAGDKD539–54820IDQIEKQAKD551–56021KDLAFPGSGE559–56822KESHFVSARP578–587The Ara h1 IgE binding epitopes are indicated as the single letter amino acid code.

The position of each peptide with respect to the Ara h1 protein coding sequence is indicated in the right hand column. The amino acids that, when altered, lead to loss of IgE binding are shown as the bold, underlined residues. Epitopes 16 and 23 were not included in this study because they were recognized by a single patient who was no longer available to the study. The amino acids within each epitope were classified according to whether they were hydrophobic (apolar), polar, or charged residues (Fig. 2). There were a total of 196 amino acids present in the 21 epitopes of Ara h1 that were studied. Charged residues occurred most frequently (89/196), with hydrophobic residues (71/196) being the next frequent type of amino acid in the epitopes and polar residues representing the least frequent amino acid group (36/196). Thirty-five percent of the mutated hydrophobic residues resulted in loss of IgE binding (<1% IgE binding), whereas only 25 and 17% of mutated polar and charged residues, respectively, had a similar effect. These results indicated that the hydrophobic amino acid residues within these IgE binding epitopes were the most sensitive to changes. In addition results from this analysis indicated that the amino acids located near the center of the epitope were more critical for IgE binding. A homology-based model of Ara h1 tertiary structure was generated to determine the location of the epitopes on this relatively large allergenic molecule. To construct this model, the primary amino acid sequence of Ara h1 was aligned to the highly homologous protein phaseolin, for which x-ray crystal structure data was available (Fig.3). The quality of the Ara h1 model was assessed using the protein health module of QUANTA and PROCHECK Version 2.1.4 (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Most of the backbone torsion angles for non-glycine residues lie within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Fig.4). Only 1.4% of the amino acids in the Ara h1 model have torsion angles that are disallowed as compared with 0.3 and 0.6% of amino acids in phaseolin and canavalin, respectively (Table II). In addition, the number of buried polar atoms, buried hydrophilic residues, and exposed hydrophobic residues in the Ara h1 model are comparable with those found in the structures of phaseolin and canavalin (Table II). Taken together, these data indicate that the homology-based model of Ara h1 tertiary structure is reasonable and similar to the structures of other homologous proteins that have been solved. The global fold of the Ara h1 molecule and the position of epitopes 10–22 are shown in Fig.5 A. The tertiary structure of the molecule consists of two sets of opposing anti-parallel β-sheets in Swiss roll topology joined by an interdomain linker. The terminal regions of the molecule consist of α-helical bundles containing three helices each. Epitope 12 resides on an N-terminal α-helix while epitopes 20 and 21 are located on C-terminal α-helices. Epitopes 14, 15, and 18 are primarily β-strands on the inner faces of the domain, and epitopes 16, 17, 19, and 22 are β-strands on the outer surface of the domain. The remainder of the epitopes are without a predominant type of higher secondary structure. A space-filled model depicting the surface accessibility of the epitopes and critical amino acids is shown in Fig. 5 B. Of the 35 residues that affected IgE binding, 10 were buried beneath the surface of the molecule, and 25 were exposed on the surface.Figure 4Most of the φ/ψ torsion angles of the amino acid residues in the Ara h1 tertairy structure model are allowed. A plot of the φ and ψ angles for the amino acids in the Ara h1 tertiary structure model is shown. Each dot within one of the boxes represents an amino acid that has acceptable torsion angles.

Purified, fluorescein-labeled Ara h1, 10 nm, was mixed with various concentrations of unlabeled Ara h1. The fluorescence polarization observed at each concentration was then determined and plotted as milli-polarization units (mP in arbitrary units) versus the concentration of Ara h1 (Fig. 6). Measurement of fluorescence reveals the average angular displacement of the fluorphor, which is dependent on the rate and extent of rotational diffusion. An increase in the size of the macromolecule through complex formation results in decreased rotational diffusion of the labeled species, which in turn results in an increase in polarization. The plateaus observed at protein concentrations between 0 and 20 nmand between 200 nmand 2 μmindicate the presence of a homogeneous species at these concentrations. The sharp increase in polarization observed at concentrations of Ara h1 above 50 nmindicates that a highly cooperative interaction between Ara h1 monomers had occurred that results in the formation of a stable homo-oligomeric structure. In order to determine the stoichiometry of this interaction, cross-linking experiments were performed followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the cross-linked products (Fig. 6, inset). Ara h1 oligomers representing samples taken at the 200 nmconcentration were subjected to limited chemical cross-linking with DSP. Cross-linked and noncross-linked samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie staining of the gel. We found that limited cross-linking at 1 μmDSP results in the formation of an electrophoretically stable complex with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa, appropriate for an Ara h1 trimer. Food allergies are mediated through the interaction of IgE to specific proteins contained within the food. While the IgE binding epitopes from the major allergens of cow milk (30Ball G. Shelton M.J.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 5354-5363PubMed Google Scholar) have all been elucidated there have been few, if any, characteristics found in common with these binding sites. Our work on the IgE binding epitopes of Ara h1 also indicates that there is no common amino acid sequence motif found in all epitopes (10Burks A.W. Shin D. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, we have determined that, once an IgE binding site has been identified, it is the hydrophobic amino acid residues that appear to play a critical role in immunoglobulin binding. The observation that alteration of a single amino acid leads to the loss of IgE binding in a population of peanut-sensitive individuals is significant because it suggests that, while each patient may display a polyclonal IgE reaction to a particular allergen (10Burks A.W.

Cockrell G. Helm R.M. West C.M. Bannon G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), IgE from different patients that recognize the same epitope must interact with that epitope in a similar fashion. Besides finding that many epitopes contained more than one residue critical for IgE binding, it was also determined that more than one residue type (Ala or Met) could be substituted at certain positions in an epitope with similar results. This may allow for the design of a hypoallergenic protein that would be effective at blunting allergic reactions for a population of peanut-sensitive individuals. Furthermore, a peanut where the IgE binding epitopes of the major allergens have been removed may prevent the development of peanut hypersensitivity in individuals genetically predisposed to this food allergy. The characteristics that have been attributed to allergenic proteins include their abundance in the food source, their resistance to food processing, and their stability to digestion by the gastrointestinal tract (14Astwood J.D. Leach J.N. Fuchs R.L. Nature Biotechnology. 1996; 14: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 15Veiths S. Aulepp H. Becker W-M. Buschmann L. Eisenband G. Food Allergies and Intolerances. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 130-149Google Scholar). The major peanut allergen, Ara h1, has been shown to be an abundant protein (35Burks A.W. Williams L.W. Helm R.M. Connaughton C. Cockrell G. O'Brien T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 88: 172-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) that survives intact in most food processing methods (36Lehrer S.B. Horner W.E. Reese G. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1996; 36: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and is stable to digestion in in vitro systems designed to mimic the gastrointestinal tract (37Becker W.M. Monogr. Allergy. 1996; 32: 92-98PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physical characteristics that allow this protein to exhibit these properties have not previously been examined. Our observations on the tertiary structure of the Ara h1 monomer and the determination that this protein readily forms a trimeric complex may help to determine why this protein is allergenic. For example, we have described the tertiary structure of the Ara h1 protein as consisting of two sets of opposing antiparallel β-sheets in Swiss roll topology with the terminal regions of the molecule consisting of α-helical bundles containing three helices apiece. While there are numerous protease digestion sites throughout the length of this protein, the structure may be so compact that potential cleavage sites are inaccessible until the protein is denatured. In addition, the formation of a trimeric complex and further higher order aggregation may also afford the molecule some protection from protease digestion and denaturation and allow passage of Ara h1 across the small intestine. It has been shown that some atopic individuals transfer more antigen across the small intestine in both the intact and partially degraded state (38Majamaa H Isolauri E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 985-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These physical attributes of the Ara h1 molecule may help to explain the extreme allergenicity exhibited by this protein. The only therapeutic option currently available for the prevention of a peanut hypersensitivity reaction is food avoidance. Unfortunately, for a ubiquitous food such as the peanut, the possibility of an inadvertent ingestion is great. This is complicated by the fact that all of the peanut allergens identified to date have sequence homology with proteins in other plants. This may explain the cross-reacting IgE antibodies to other legumes that are found in the sera of patients that manifest clinical symptoms to only one member of the legume family (39Bernhisel-Broadbent J. Taylor S. Sampson H.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1989; 84: 701-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the position of the Ara h1 IgE binding epitopes clustered on the surface of the molecule may enable us to better understand why these regions elicit the clinical symptoms associated with peanut hypersensitivity. Perhaps the presentation of multiple, clustered epitopes to mast cells results in a more efficient and dramatic release of mediators that result in the more severe clinical symptoms observed in patients with peanut hypersensitivity. We are currently exploring this possibility by comparing the IgE binding epitopes and tertiary structures of other legume allergens. Finally, it has been suggested that an altered Ara h1 gene could be developed to replace its allergenic homologue in the peanut genome, thus blunting allergic reactions in sensitive individuals who inadvertently ingest this food (10Burks A.W. Shin D. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Since the Ara h1 gene product is such an abundant and integral seed storage protein, it would be necessary for the altered vicilin to retain as much of its native function, properties, and three-dimensional structure as possible. The data presented here indicate that development of a hypoallergenic vicilin may be feasible. However, the effect that altering critical amino acids within each of the IgE binding epitopes has on the properties of this seed storage protein is currently unknown. Given the widespread use of peanuts in consumer foods and the potential risk this poses to individuals genetically pre-disposed to developing peanut allergy and to the health of individuals already peanut-sensitive, this approach is currently being explored in our laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W1548755019,"The mitochondrial KATP channel (mitoKATP) is hypothesized to be the receptor for the cardioprotective effects of K+ channel openers (KCO) and for the blocking of cardioprotection by glyburide and 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD).

The energetic costs of this futile cycle are small, between 100–150 nmol of H+/mg of protein·min at 25 °C, and we have concluded that the sole function of mitoKATP is to regulate matrix volume (1Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that matrix expansion secondary to mitoKATPopening plays an important role in cell-signaling pathways calling for activation of electron transport and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation (2Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A pharmacological role for mitoKATP in cardiac ischemia seems clearer. During prolonged cardiac ischemia, myocyte ATP levels fall, and the heart does not survive reperfusion. Either pretreatment with K+ channel openers (KCO) or preconditioning with a brief period of ischemia protects the heart; during subsequent ischemia, ATP loss is reduced, and the heart recovers to nearly normal function upon reperfusion (3Grover G.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24: S18-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Importantly, cardioprotection by either KCO or preconditioning is blocked by glyburide and 5-HD. This set of agents, KCO, glyburide, and 5-HD, identifies the receptor as a KATP channel, and pharmacological studies indicate that mitoKATP is the receptor for these effects (4Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). A major problem with this hypothesis has been that glyburide appears to be ineffective as a specific inhibitor of K+ flux in intact, respiring mitochondria (5Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific inhibition of K+ flux does occur (5Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, we have attributed this effect, which occurs at high doses of glyburide, to low affinity reactions with key energy-transducing enzymes (6Debeer L. Mannaerts G. deSchepper P.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Somogyi J. Vér AÖ. TroÖja G. Végh E. Bühler C. Hatfaludi F. Csermely P. Popovic S.

The effect of these nonspecific actions is to reduce ΔΨ, the driving force for K+ uptake, and has nothing to do with mitoKATP. We have now verified this conclusion in experiments that examine the effects of glyburide on both respiration and respiration-driven cation uptake into mitochondria. Failure to inhibit mitoKATP seemed to be a property of both glyburide and 5-HD. We recognized, however, that these drugs had only been studied under conditions when no other ligands of mitoKATP were present, a condition that never obtainsin vivo. We now report that glyburide and 5-HD are potent blockers of K+ flux through mitoKATP in open states in which Mg2+, ATP, and physiological (GTP) or pharmacological (KCO) openers are present. In intact rat heart mitochondria, K½ values for glyburide and 5-HD are about 1 and 50 μm, respectively. We infer that susceptibility to glyburide and 5-HD requires a ligand-induced conformational change in the mitochondrial sulfonylurea receptor (mitoSUR). These results are consistent with a role for mitoKATP in cardioprotection (4Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ.

Methods Cell. Biol. 1978; 20: 411-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and rat heart mitochondria were prepared by the Glass-TeflonTM homogenization procedure according to Matlib et al. (11Matlib M.A. Rouslin W. Vaghy P.L. Schwartz A. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 25-37Google Scholar). The final mitochondrial pellet was washed and resuspended at 50 mg/ml (liver) or 20 mg/ml (heart) in 0.22 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, and potassium salts of 5 mm TES and 0.5 mm EGTA. Mitochondria were kept on ice at pH 7.2 during the experiments. MitoKATP was purified and reconstituted as described previously (12Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). K+ or TEA+ uptake was assayed by following swelling, which accompanies net salt transport, using previously established light-scattering techniques (13Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reciprocal absorbance (A -1) at 520 nm varies linearly with matrix volume within three well defined regions, separated by transitions at 115 and 68 milliosmolal (13Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β is a dimensionless parameter that normalizes A –1 for mitochondrial protein concentration, P (mg/ml),β≡P/Ps(A−1−a),Equation 1 where a is a machine constant (0.25 for our apparatus), and Ps equals 1 mg/ml. To obtain initial rates (dβ/dt), it is necessary to avoid the sharp discontinuities in the relationship between β and matrix volume. For ion flux measurements, we normally begin measurements at 115 milliosmolal, where the outer membrane begins to break (14Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This technique is particularly important for light scattering of rat heart mitochondria, which is only weakly sensitive to volume changes in the isosmotic domain. Thus, kinetic curves in 250 milliosmolal salts exhibit an artifactual “lag” during salt uptake as volume goes through the first transition point (14Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 115 milliosmolal assay media contained either K+ or TEA+ salts of chloride (45 mm), acetate (25 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and TES (5 mm), pH 7.4. Media also contained MgCl2 (0.1 mm), rotenone (5 μg/mg), and cytochrome c (10 μm). Respiratory substrates were either succinate (3 mm) or ascorbate (2.5 mm) plus TMPD (0.25 mm). Mitochondria were assayed at a concentration of 0.1 mg of protein/ml at 25 °C. Respiration was measured with a Yellow Springs oxygen electrode assembly in a hypotonic assay medium identical to the one used for measurement of K+ uptake, or in an isotonic assay medium consisting of K+ salts of chloride (120 mm), succinate (10 mm), phosphate (5 mm), TES (5 mm), and MgCl2 (0.1 mm), pH 7.4, supplemented with rotenone (2 μg/mg of protein). Mitochondria were assayed at 1 mg of protein/ml at 25 °C. MitoKATP was partially purified from rat liver mitochondria and reconstituted into proteoliposomes loaded with PBFI according to previously published protocols (15Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Internal medium contained TEA+ salts of sulfate (100 mm), EGTA (1 mm), and HEPES (25 mm) at pH 6.8. 15 μl of stock proteoliposomes (50 mg of phospholipids/ml) were added to 2 ml of external medium containing 150 mm KCl and TEA+ salts of EGTA (1 mm) and HEPES (25 mm), at pH 7.4. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C during assays. Electrophoretic K+ flux was initiated by the addition of 1 μmFCCP to provide charge compensation and measured from changes in PBFI fluorescence (12Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PBFI was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc.; HEPES was obtained from Calbiochem; 5-HD was obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc.; and other drugs and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The Tris salt of ATP was titrated to pH 7.2 with Tris base. Respiring mitochondria take up K+ by nonspecific and specific mechanisms, i.e. viadiffusion and via mitoKATP. We used TEA+ to distinguish between these two parallel mechanisms, as demonstrated by the four traces in Fig.1 A. K+ flux (trace a) is greater than TEA+ flux (trace b). Addition of ATP inhibits K+ flux (trace c) but not TEA+ flux (trace d). These results, which are routinely observed in rat heart (Fig. 1) and liver (5Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mitochondria, permit the following conclusions: (i) TEA+ is transported solely by diffusive leak (16Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and is not transported by mitoKATP; and (ii) in the presence of ATP, K+ is transported solely by diffusion, and its flux equals that of TEA+. Thus, TEA+ flux may be used as a control for the component of K+ flux due to leak. The traces in Fig. 1 B show that 10 μmglyburide does not inhibit K+ flux under these conditions, despite the fact that mitoKATP is evidently open. 100 μm 5-HD was similarly ineffective (data not shown). To summarize a large body of experiments, these agents did not inhibit K+ flux at these doses in rat liver or heart mitochondria respiring on succinate or TMPD/ascorbate. This failure of glyburide and 5-HD to inhibit is the central problem addressed by this paper. In massive doses, glyburide does inhibit K+ flux, as previously reported by us (5Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by Belyaevaet al. (17Belyaeva E.A. Szewczyk A. Mikolajek B. Nalecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar) and Szewczyk et al. (18Szewczyk A. Pikula S. WoÖjcik G. Nalecz M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We concluded, however, that this effect was secondary to inhibition of respiration (5Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cation uptake into respiring mitochondria is exquisitely sensitive to ΔΨ (16Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and it is essential to differentiate between nonspecific inhibition due to reduced driving force and specific inhibition of mitoKATP. Accordingly, we examined the effect of glyburide on uncoupled respiration, on respiration-driven K+ and TEA+ uptake, and on respiration-driven K+ uptake in the presence of valinomycin. The dose-response curves in Fig. 2confirm that glyburide inhibits succinate utilization during uncoupled respiration. In hypotonic assay medium supplemented with acetate and cytochrome c, the K½ values for inhibition were 5.7 ± 2.7 μm (n = 3) in rat heart mitochondria and 157 ± 27 (n = 3) in rat liver mitochondria. In isotonic assay medium without acetate, the K½ values for inhibition were 5.3 ± 0.5 μm (n = 2) in rat heart mitochondria and 70 ± 2 μm (n = 2) in rat liver mitochondria (not shown). A more direct demonstration of the nonspecific effect of glyburide on K+ uptake was obtained in protocols measuring respiration-dependent cation uptake. As shown in Fig.3, cation uptake was inhibited by glyburide as a function of dose. In rat heart mitochondria (Fig.3 A), the K½ values were 6.4 ± 1.1 μm (n = 3) when succinate was used as substrate and 470 ± 35 μm (n = 2) when ascorbate/TMPD was used as substrate. In rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 3 B), the K½ values were 63 ± 13 μm (n = 3) when succinate was used as respiratory substrate and 476 ± 34 μm(n = 3) when ascorbate/TMPD was used as substrate. Inhibition was nonselective—K+ flux and TEA+flux were inhibited at the same doses—and the K½ values were essentially the same as K½ values for respiratory inhibition (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that inhibition of cation flux was due to reduction in driving force and not due to inhibition of mitoKATP. Similar results were obtained for valinomycin-induced swelling in potassium medium (data not shown). We conclude that the only inhibition mediated by glyburide under these conditions is nonspecific, secondary to inhibition of respiration and a reduction of the driving force for cation uptake. An identical series of experiments was carried out using 5-HD. 5-HD had no effect on K+ flux under these conditions. In contrast to glyburide, 5-HD did not inhibit uncoupled respiration or cation uptake in either rat liver or heart mitochondria up to 500 μm (data not shown). Under the conditions of Fig. 1, mitoKATP is open because no inhibitory ligands are present.In vivo, mitoKATP would be opened by pharmacological agents (KCO), such as diazoxide or cromakalim (15Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), or physiological ligands, such as GTP (12Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP and Mg2+ would also be present in vivo. When mitochondria were studied under these more physiological conditions, glyburide and 5-HD were potent, specific inhibitors of K+flux, as illustrated by the traces in Fig.4. Control K+ flux (Fig. 4,trace a) was inhibited in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (Fig. 4, trace b) and then restored to control values by diazoxide (Fig. 4, trace c). This pharmacologically induced K+ flux was strongly inhibited by 10 μm glyburide to the level associated with ATP inhibition (Fig. 4, trace d). Note that this glyburide dose had no effect on respiration in ascorbate/TMPD and no effect on TEA+ flux (see Fig. 3 A). Therefore, the effect is specific for K+ flux through mitoKATP. Fig. 5, A and B,contains the concentration dependences of specific glyburide and 5-HD inhibition of K+ flux. The opening effect of 10 μm diazoxide was reversed by glyburide withK½ = 1.1 μm (closed circles in Fig.5 A), and by 5-HD with K½ = 45 μm (closed circles in Fig. 5 B). The opening effect of 50 μm GTP was reversed by glyburide withK½ = 6 μm (Fig. 5 A, open circles), and by 5-HD with K½ = 58 μm (Fig. 5 B, open circles). Three additional ligands were required for specific glyburide inhibition of mitoKATP: Mg2+, ATP, and either GTP or a KCO. No single one of these, nor any combination of two, was effective. An identical series of experiments was carried out with rat liver mitochondria, and the results were qualitatively identical to the results with rat heart mitochondria. We were also able to compare the effect of substrates on glyburide potency in liver mitochondria because the margin of safety for nonspecific inhibition during respiration on succinate is much wider in liver than in heart mitochondria (compare Fig. 3, A and B). The results are summarized in Table I. The K½ for glyburide inhibition was 3.4 μm when either succinate or ascorbate/TMPD was the respiratory substrate. 5-HD also inhibited cromakalim-opened mitoKATP in liver mitochondria respiring on either succinate or ascorbate/TMPD with equal potency (K½ = 73 μm).Table ISpecific inhibition of mitoKATP by glyburide and 5-HDExperimental preparationK 1/2-glyburideK 1/2-5-HDRat heart mitochondria No ATPNo effectNo effect ATP + 10 μmdiazoxide1.1 ± 0.2 μm45 ± 5 μm ATP + 50 μm GTP6 ± 1 μm58 ± 5 μmRat liver mitochondria No ATPNo effectNo effect ATP + 10 μmcromakalim3.4 ± 0.3 μm73 ± 3 μmReconstituted mitoKATP No ATP250 ± 15 nmNo effect ATP + 10 μm cromakalim90 ± 6 nm85 ± 5 μm ATP + 20 μm GTP80 ± 5 nmNDThe table compares the mean values of half-maximal inhibition (±S.D.,n = 3) by glyburide and 5-HD in three different preparations.

In the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and cromakalim, both glyburide and 5-HD inhibited mitoKATP. Glyburide inhibited with K½ = 90 nm, and 5-HD inhibited with K½ = 85 μm. In the absence of ATP, 5-HD had no effect, but glyburide inhibited K+ flux with K½ = 250 nm. The latter result is consistent with our previous results on reconstituted mitoKATP in the presence of Mg2+(19Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glyburide was also a potent inhibitor (K½ = 80 nm) of the reconstituted mitoKATP in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and GTP. There is growing evidence for the hypothesis that mitoKATP is the receptor for the cardioprotective actions of K+ channel openers and the cardio-damaging actions of glyburide and 5-HD (4Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 9Grover G.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Glyburide is a prototypical sulfonylurea inhibitor that acts on all KATP channels and blocks the protective effects of both KCO and cardiac preconditioning (20Grover G.J. McCullough J.R. Henry D.E.

Res. 1992; 26: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 5-HD, which is structurally unrelated to glyburide, has been characterized as an ischemia-selective inhibitor of KATPchannels (22McCullough J.R.

Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1055-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Like glyburide, 5-HD selectively blocks the protective effects of both KCO (22McCullough J.R. Normandin D. Conder M.L. Sleph P.G. Dzwonczyk S. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and cardiac preconditioning (24Auchampach J.A. Grover G.J. Gross G.J.

There have been no previous studies of the effects of 5-HD on mitochondria. The hypothesis that mitoKATP is involved in cardiac protection has been clouded by the lack of a crucial piece of evidence: a convincing demonstration that glyburide and 5-HD inhibit ATP-dependent K+ uptake in intact mitochondria. MitoKATP activity can readily be elicited in respiring mitochondria, as demonstrated by the data in Fig. 1. We showed previously that glyburide inhibits K+ flux under these conditions; however, inhibition required high doses that inhibit respiration in the presence of succinate, and we concluded that this inhibition was nonspecific (5Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Belyaeva et al. (17Belyaeva E.A. Szewczyk A. Mikolajek B. Nalecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar) concluded to the contrary that mitoKATP was specifically inhibited by 150 μm glyburide. To resolve this disagreement, we carried out a thorough study of the nonspecific effects of glyburide, as reported under “Results.” We found that glyburide is a potent inhibitor of uncoupled respiration in both liver and heart mitochondria when succinate was used as the respiratory substrate (Fig. 2). Over the same dose range, glyburide also inhibited diffusive K+ and TEA+ fluxes (Fig. 3). TEA+ is transported solely by leak pathways; accordingly, glyburide inhibited K+ and TEA+ fluxes by depression of ΔΨ and not by inhibition of mitoKATP. Thus, glyburide inhibition of K+ flux under these conditions is nonspecific. Respiration using ascorbate/TMPD is relatively insensitive to inhibition by glyburide and 5-HD, and the flux experiments using these substrates (Fig. 3) permit a further conclusion: glyburide and 5-HD,at any dose, are completely ineffective under the conditions that have routinely been used to study inhibition of K+flux through mitoKATP, namely respiration on succinate with rotenone. These findings presented a serious obstacle to studies of the pharmacological regulation of mitoKATP in mitochondria. We finally recognized, however, that the conditions routinely used, namely, in the absence of other ligands of mitoKATP, are far from those present in vivo. In a living cell, the open channel would never be exposed to glyburide under such conditions. Rather, the channel would be exposed to ATP and Mg2+ and then opened by GTP or a K+channel opener (12Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the in vitroexperiments were adjusted to mimic these in vivo conditions, we found glyburide and 5-HD to be potent, specific blockers of K+ flux in the open states induced by physiological or pharmacological ligands (Figs. 4 and 5 and Table I). We emphasize that three components, Mg2+, ATP, and a physiological or pharmacological opener, were required to achieve inhibition by either of these drugs. No single component nor any combination of two components was sufficient. This phenomenon was observed in both heart and liver mitochondria. Results with reconstituted mitoKATP qualitatively reflect results in intact mitochondria (Table I). With glyburide, theK½ value was reduced when studied in the pharmacological open state. With 5-HD, no inhibition was observed in the absence of ATP, but 5-HD inhibited in the pharmacological open state, when ATP and a KCO were present. Some aspects of these findings raise new scientific questions. (i) What renders mitoKATP susceptible to these inhibitors in one open state and not the other? In view of the fact that K+fluxes are identical in all open states, we conclude that the protein must be in a different state. Thus, we infer that Mg2+, ATP, and an opener induce a conformation in mitoSUR that renders it susceptible to glyburide and 5-HD. (ii) Why is glyburide a potent inhibitor of reconstituted mitoKATP under conditions in which it is ineffective in intact mitochondria? The logical inference is that mitochondria are regulated by a factor that is lost during reconstitution. These hypotheses are under investigation. In conclusion, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mitoKATP is the essential drug receptor involved in ischemic cardioprotection. They also remove the previous deterrent to pharmacological studies on mitoKATP in intact mitochondria. We thank Yuliya Yarova-Yarovaya and Craig Semrad for excellent technical assistance."

During apoptosis, type IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), a PLA2 isozyme with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa critical for stimulus-coupled AA release, was converted to a 78-kDa fragment with concomitant loss of catalytic activity. Cleavage of cPLA2 correlated with increased caspase-3-like protease activity in apoptotic cells and was abrogated by a caspase-3 inhibitor. A mutant cPLA2 protein in which Asp522 was replaced by Asn, which aligns with the consensus sequence of the caspase-3 cleavage site (DXXD↓X), was resistant to apo-ptosis-associated proteolysis. Moreover, a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of cPLA2 truncated at Asp522 comigrated with the 78-kDa fragment and exhibited no enzymatic activity. Thus, caspase-3-mediated cPLA2 cleavage eventually leads to destruction of a catalytic triad essential for cPLA2 activity, thereby terminating its AA-releasing function. In contrast, the activity of type VI Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2), a PLA2 isozyme implicated in phospholipid remodeling, remained intact during apoptosis. Inhibitors of iPLA2, but neither cPLA2 nor secretory PLA2 inhibitors, suppressed AA release markedly and, importantly, delayed cell death induced by Fas. Therefore, we conclude that iPLA2-mediated fatty acid release is facilitated in Fas-stimulated cells and plays a modifying although not essential role in the apoptotic cell death process.

Evidence is also accumulating that certain phases of stimulus-initiated AA release are regulated by types IIA or V secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) isozymes, which require millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ for catalytic activity (8Murakami M.

In contrast, type VI Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) has been proposed to participate in fatty acid release associated with phospholipid remodeling and to play a minimal role in signal transduction (13Ackermann E.J.

The programmed cell death pathway called apoptosis plays a fundamental role in tissue homeostasis, development, and host defense. The discovery of increasing numbers of death factors (e.g. Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α), their receptors, adapter molecules, and caspases have provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms leading to apoptosis that are highly conserved in eukaryotic cells (16Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 479-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 17Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Following ligation of these receptors by their cognate ligands, several cytoplasmic signal-transducing adapters are recruited to the receptors to form multimeric complexes, thereby leading to either apoptosis or cellular activation, depending on the adapters involved (18Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 19Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). In the apoptotic pathway, these adapter molecules in turn recruit particular caspases (20Boldin M.P. Goncharav T.M.

The changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism, unlike those in protein and DNA levels, during apoptosis are rather obscure. Although the involvement of particular PLA2 enzymes in stimulus-coupled eicosanoid biosynthesis has been studied extensively as discussed above, relatively little is known about their roles in fatty acid release associated with apoptotic signaling. Recently, we and others showed that the plasma membrane phospholipids of apoptotic cells are the preferred substrates for type IIA sPLA2 (31Atsumi G. Murakami M. Tajima M. Shimbara S. Hara N. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1318-1325Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which is induced by proinflammatory stimuli and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation (10Murakami, M., Shimbara, S., Kambe, T., Kuwata, H., Winstead, M.

Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the AA thus liberated is taken up by surrounding live cells to be metabolized to eicosanoids, representing a particular transcellular pathway for AA metabolism that contributes to propagation of inflammation. cPLA2 has also been implicated in AA release during certain cell death processes, such as TNFα-induced apoptosis (34Voelkel-Johnson C. Thorne T. Laster S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 201-207PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hayakawa M. Ishida N. Takeuchi K. Shibamoto S. Hori T. Oku N. Ito F. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In these studies, the use of cPLA2 inhibitors, overexpression, and antisense technologies revealed significant correlations between the cPLA2 expression level, amounts of AA released, and cell death. However, the role of cPLA2 is uncertain in Fas-mediated apoptosis (38Enari M. Hug H. Hayakawa M. Ito F. Nishimura Y. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In order to explore the role of particular PLA2 isozymes in fatty acid release and glycerophospholipid metabolism alterations associated with the apoptotic pathway, we chose the Fas system, which strongly promotes apoptosis but barely elicits cell activation signals. We now provide evidence that Fas-mediated apoptosis of human leukemic U937 cells is accompanied by gradual fatty acid release, which appears to be mediated by iPLA2 but not by cPLA2 or sPLA2. During apoptosis, cPLA2 is inactivated by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic cleavage at Asp522. Inhibition of iPLA2-evoked fatty acid release results in slight but significant retardation of cell death, suggesting that disturbed phospholipid turnover renders cells more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling. Mouse cPLA2 cDNA and a rabbit antiserum against human cPLA2 were provided by Drs. M. Tsujimoto (RIKEN Institute) and J. D. Clark (Genetics Institute), respectively. The agonistic anti-Fas antibody (CH-11) (39Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) was purchased from MBL.

Two caspase inhibitors (Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO) and chymostatin were obtained from the Peptide Institute, and caspase substrates were obtained from Takara Biomedicals. LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent, Opti-MEM medium, and TRIzol reagent were obtained from Life Technologies. Etoposide,p-bromophenacyl bromide, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, cytochalasin B, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate andNα-benzoyl-arginine ethyl ester were purchased from Sigma. All the other reagents used were of analytical grade and purchased from Wako, unless stated otherwise. The human monocytic leukemia cell lines U937 and HL-60 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. In order to investigate AA and oleic acid release, U937 cells were preincubated with 0.1 and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA and [3H]oleic acid (NEN Life Science Products), respectively, for 24 h. Then the cells were washed three times, resuspended in culture medium to produce 1 × 107 cells/ml, and incubated for various periods with or without the anti-Fas antibody. In the experiments to determine the effect of etoposide treatment, the cells were incubated with etoposide for 1 h, washed three times, and then incubated for a further 10 h in culture medium without etoposide. In some experiments, various PLA2 inhibitors were added to the cells during incubation. The process of cell death was monitored by observing the morphological changes, assessing the cell viability by trypan blue dye exclusion, and quantifying DNA fragmentation fluorometrically using DAPI as described previously (42Kizaki H. Tadakuma T. Odaka C. Muramatsu J. Ishimura Y. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1790-1794PubMed Google Scholar). The free 3H-labeled fatty acids released were extracted by the method of Dole and Meinertz (43Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the associated radioactivity was counted using a liquid β-scintillation counter (Aloka). The amount of each fatty acid released, expressed as a percentage, was calculated using the formula [S/(S +P)] × 100, where S and P are the radioactivities of equal portions of supernatant and cell pellet, respectively. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm p-4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm iodoacetamide, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μm leupeptin by sonication for 1 min with a Branson Sonifer (power 30, 50% pulse cycle). The samples (10 μg protein equivalents/lane) were subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), which were probed with the antibody against human cPLA2 and visualized with the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The protein contents were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). In order to assess cPLA2 activity, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in buffer comprising 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline), and lysed by sonication as described above. The resulting lysates were incubated in 250 μl of buffer comprising 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (NEN Life Science Products) as the substrate at 37 °C for 30 min. In order to assess iPLA2 activity, the lysates, prepared in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.34 m sucrose, were incubated in 250 μl of buffer comprising 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm Triton X-100, 0.1 mm ATP, and 10 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine at 40 °C for 30 min (13Ackermann E.J.

Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the associated radioactivity was counted. The total lipids were extracted from [3H]AA-labeled cells and their supernatants by the method of Bligh and Dyer (44Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and developed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica 60 gel plates (Merck), according to a method described previously with a slight modification (31Atsumi G. Murakami M. Tajima M. Shimbara S. Hara N. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The first solvent system consisted of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (65/25/4/2, v/v/v), and the second comprised chloroform/methanol/formic acid (65/25/8.8, v/v/v). The zones on the silica gel corresponding to AA and phospholipids were identified by comparison with the mobilities of authentic standards and visualized with iodine vapor. Each zone was scraped into a vial, and its radioactivity was counted using a liquid β-scintillation counter. To separate free fatty acids and other neutral lipids, including triacylglyceride, the neutral lipid fraction was developed further on fresh plates with a solvent system of hexane/ether/acetic acid (80/30/1, v/v/v). Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with mouse cPLA2 cDNA that had been subcloned into the pVL1392 baculovirus transfection vector (Pharmingen), as described previously (8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, suspended in a buffer comprising 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Nα-benzoyl-arginine ethyl ester, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml antipain, and disrupted by sonication for 1 min, as described above. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline. After washing the column with Tris-buffered saline, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.15 to 0.5m in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The eluted fractions containing cPLA2 activity were pooled, applied to a phenyl-Superose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1m NaCl, and the bound cPLA2 was eluted stepwise with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended (108 cells/ml) in an extraction buffer comprising 50 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μmcytochalasin B, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml antipain, and 10 mg/ml chymostatin, and disrupted by freeze-thawing twice. Aliquots (10 μg of protein equivalents) were incubated with 1 μmMca-YVADAPK(Dnp)-OH or Mca-DEVDAPK(Dnp)-OH, substrates for caspase-1 and caspase-3, respectively (45Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, at 30 °C for 30 min. Then the fluorescence of each cleaved substrate was determined using a spectrofluorometer (Hitachi) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 325 and 392 nm, respectively. Substitution of Asp522 of mouse cPLA2 with Asn (cPLA2-D522N) was performed by altering the codon GTC to GTT using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with two synthetic oligonucleotides for the sense and antisense strands: 5′-C CTT CGA TGA CGA GCT CAA CGC AGC GGT AGC AG-3′ and 5′-C TGC TAC CGC TGC GTT GAG CTC GTC ATC GAA GG-3′, respectively (altered codons are underlined). Briefly, mouse cPLA2 cDNA subcloned into pBK-CMV (Stratagene) at theEcoRI site was denatured and annealed with the two oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation. After incubation with Pfu DNA polymerase followed by treatment with DpnI, the resulting mutated plasmid was transfected into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). A cPLA2 deletion mutant, cPLA2(1–522), was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cPLA2 coding sequence with ex Taq polymerase (Takara) using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-ATG TCA TTT ATA GAT CCT TAC-3′ and 5′-TCA GTC GAG CTC GTC ATC GAA-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into pCR™3.1 (Invitrogen) and was transfected into Top10F′ supercompetent cells (Invitrogen). Colonies were picked up, and the plasmids were isolated and sequenced using a Taq cycle sequencing kit (Takara) and an auto-fluorometric DNA sequencer (DSQ-1000L, Shimadzu) to confirm the mutation. [35S]Methionine-labeled cPLA2 and its mutants were synthesized using a PROTEINscript™ kit (Ambion). Briefly, plasmids containing mouse cPLA2, cPLA2-D522N, or cPLA2(1–522) cDNA were transcribed using RNA polymerase and then incubated with [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized autoradiographically. Aliquots of [35S]cPLA2 or baculovirus-derived recombinant cPLA2 proteins prepared as described above were incubated with the cytosolic fraction obtained from U937 cells that had been treated for 12 h with or without the anti-Fas antibody in the presence or absence of a caspase inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO or Ac-DEVD-CHO) (45Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and immunoblotting, respectively. The cDNAs for mouse cPLA2 and its mutants cPLA2-D522N and cPLA2(1–522) that had been subcloned into pBK-CMV and PCR 3.1™, respectively, were each transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (46Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting and PLA2 assay. Human monocytic leukemia U937 cells were prelabeled with [3H]AA for 24 h, washed, and then exposed to various concentrations of the agonistic anti-Fas antibody for various periods to assess the changes in the free [3H]AA levels (Fig.1 A). AA release by cells cultured without the anti-Fas antibody increased minimally over 24 h, whereas that by replicate cells treated with the anti-Fas antibody increased significantly after culture for 3–24 h in a concentration-dependent manner. AA release by U937 cells treated with 10, 50, and 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody for 24 h was about 3.5, 5.0, and 6.5 times higher, respectively, than that by the cells before anti-Fas antibody addition (Fig. 1 A). AA release was almost parallel to the reductions in cell viability and DNA fragmentation, assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion and fluorometric quantification with DAPI (33Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 1, B andC), as well as DNA rudder formation, assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). After a 24-h preincubation of U937 cells with [3H]AA, nearly 95% of the radioactivity was incorporated into phospholipid pools, mainly into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, followed by phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (Fig.2). Up to 5% of the radioactivity was incorporated into the neutral lipid fraction, mainly into triacylglycerol (Fig. 2, right panel). After incubation with 50 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody, the free [3H]AA level increased significantly, accompanied by reductions in the percentages of the total [3H]AA remaining in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine without appreciable changes of those in other phospholipids and triacylglycerol (Fig. 2). In terms of the total counts, the combined decrements in these two phospholipids roughly matched the net increase in free [3H]AA. Initially, we thought that the increased Fas-mediated AA release from apoptotic U937 cells was due to cPLA2activation. Unexpectedly, however, the cPLA2 catalytic activity toward exogenous substrate gradually declined during the Fas-mediated apoptotic process: the cPLA2 activities of cells after treatment with 10 and 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody for 12 h were about one-half and one-ninth, respectively, of that of untreated cells (Fig. 3 A). The cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3, at 1 μm, abolished the cPLA2 activity of U937 cells, whereas [3H]AA release by apoptotic cells incubated with and without AACOCF3 at 10 μm, the concentration at which it inhibits cPLA2 but not other PLA2s (Ref. 13Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar and data not shown), did not differ significantly (Fig.3 B). Moreover, net amounts of [3H]oleic acid comparable with those of [3H]AA were released by anti-Fas antibody-treated cells prelabeled with these fatty acids (Fig.3 C), arguing against the AA selective property of cPLA2. In order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the decrease in cPLA2 activity in cells undergoing Fas-mediated apoptosis, we examined cPLA2 protein expression by immunoblotting. We found that treating U937 cells with the anti-Fas antibody resulted in time- (Fig. 4 A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 4 B) cleavage of intact cPLA2 with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa, which was present in untreated cells, to a proteolytic fragment of approximately 78 kDa. Proteolysis of cPLA2 was detectable with"
https://openalex.org/W2041788236,"Cellular disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) are a family of genes with a sequence similar to those of snake venom metalloproteinases and disintegrins. The ADAMTS-1 gene encodes a new type of ADAM protein with respect to possessing the thrombospondin (TSP) type I motifs. Expression of the gene is induced in kidney and heart by in vivo administration of lipopolysaccharide, suggesting a possible role in the inflammatory reaction. In this study, we characterized the ADAMTS-1 gene product by using a transient expression system in COS-7 cells. We found that the precursor and processed forms of ADAMTS-1 were secreted from cells. Under normal growth conditions, little or none of both forms was detected in the cell culture medium, and instead the majority was found associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, when cells were cultured in the presence of heparin, the mature form of ADAMTS-1 protein was detected in the cell culture medium, suggesting that binding of ADAMTS-1 to the ECM is mediated through sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate. Analyses of deletion mutants of the ADAMTS-1 protein revealed that the spacer region as well as three TSP type I motifs in the carboxyl-terminal region of the ADAMTS-1 protein are important for a tight interaction with the ECM. These results suggest that the ADAMTS-1 is a unique ADAM family protein that anchors at the ECM. Cellular disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) are a family of genes with a sequence similar to those of snake venom metalloproteinases and disintegrins. The ADAMTS-1 gene encodes a new type of ADAM protein with respect to possessing the thrombospondin (TSP) type I motifs. Expression of the gene is induced in kidney and heart by in vivo administration of lipopolysaccharide, suggesting a possible role in the inflammatory reaction.

Typical ADAMs are cell surface proteins that consist of a pro-, a metalloprotease-like, a disintegrin-like, a cysteine-rich, an epidermal growth factor-like, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain. Fertilin, the first ADAM described, has been implicated in integrin-mediated sperm-egg binding (3Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P.P. White J.M.

However, a recently cloned gene encoding tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-converting enzyme (TACE) has been shown to be a membrane type metalloproteinase that also belongs to the ADAM family (10Black R.A.

In Drosophila, an ADAM family gene, Kuzbanian has been demonstrated to play a role in the lateral inhibition during neurogenesis by cleavage of the extracellular domain of the transmembrane receptor Notch (12Pan D.

Interestingly, it has been found that mammalian disintegrin-metalloprotease (MADM or ADAM10) is also able to process pro-TNF-α (14Lunn C.A. Fan X. Dalie B. Miller K. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K.

ADAMTS-1 has been identified as a gene highly expressed in the colon 26 cachexigenic tumor in vivo (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The mouse ADAMTS-1 gene is mapped to chromosome 16, region C3–C5 (18Kuno K. Iizasa H. Ohno S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of ADAMTS-1 shows sequence similarity to both snake venom metalloproteinases, such as hemorrhagic toxins, and other ADAM family proteins such as fertilin, meltrin, and MS2, indicating that ADAMTS-1 belongs to the ADAM family. The amino-terminal region of ADAMTS-1 consists of a proprotein, a metalloproteinase, and a disintegrin-like domain. Typical ADAM family proteins are membrane-anchored proteins that have a transmembrane region in the carboxyl-terminal region. In contrast, the ADAMTS-1 protein does not contain a transmembrane domain but possesses three thrombospondin (TSP) type I motifs, which are the conserved motifs in both thrombospondin 1 and 2 (19Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), at its carboxyl-terminal region. The analyses of the genomic structure of ADAMTS-1 showed that it is markedly different from those of MDC and MS2 (20Katagiri T. Harada Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Kataoka M. Yoshiyama K. Matsuura K. Hijiya N. Higuchi Y. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that ADAMTS-1 may be a distant member of the ADAM family. Because in vivo administration of lipopolysaccharide significantly enhanced the expression of ADAMTS-1 mRNA in kidney and heart, it is presumed that ADAMTS-1 might be involved in the inflammatory reaction (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this study, to elucidate further the role of ADAMTS-1 in inflammatory processes, we first investigated how the ADAMTS-1 protein is secreted and delivered. We describe here that the majority of the ADAMTS-1 protein binds to the extracellular matrix (ECM) after being secreted by producing cells. In addition, analyses of deletion mutants revealed that the TSP type I motifs and the spacer region in the carboxyl-terminal half are involved in binding to the ECM. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Soluble heparin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Tunicamycin was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, FRG). The full-length mouse ADAMTS-1 cDNA was isolated as described previously (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of ADAMTS-1 cDNA in pBluescript vector (Stratagene) were deleted, and an XhoI site was added after the Ser-951 codon by means of PCR to generate pBL151–31. The coding region of the ADAMTS-1 cDNA was isolated from pBL151–31 by digestion with NotI and XhoI and ligated into theNotI and XhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), giving rise to pCMV151. To add the FLAG epitope tag in the COOH terminus of the ADAMTS-1 protein, the double-stranded synthetic DNA corresponding to both FLAG epitope tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) and stop codon was inserted intoXhoI-XbaI sites of the pCMV151 vector, generating the pCMV-151CF vector. The expression vectors for the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants (X3–X6) were constructed using PCR. In brief, the wild type cDNA fragment corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal region was replaced by partially deleted PCR products. For construction of mutant DPM-1, the proprotein and metalloproteinase domains were deleted by mutagenesis based on PCR (22Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). In mutant DPM-1, a BamHI site was introduced after the signal peptide (1–32 amino acids) and was followed by the middle TSP type I motif region. Furthermore, mutants DPM-4, -5 and -6, which are truncation mutants of DPM-1, were also constructed using PCR. Nucleotide sequences of mutants were confirmed by direct sequencing. DNA sequencing analysis was performed by using a PCR employing fluorescent dideoxynucleotides and a model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression vectors (2 μg) by means of LipofectAMINE (6 μl) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The liposome-DNA complex solution was spread on cells in 3.5-cm dishes and incubated for 6 h. Thereafter, 1 ml of the DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum was added into the medium, and 18 h after transfection the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with DMEM without serum. Transfected cells were grown further in serum-free DMEM. Cells were grown in 3.5-cm dishes for 2 days after transfection. The dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were detached from dishes by brief incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA. After the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cell lysate was prepared by adding RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracellular material remaining on the dishes was extracted by 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). In some experiments, either tunicamycin that was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, or heparin was added into the cell culture medium. Aliquots of cellular lysate, culture medium, or ECM fraction were subjected to 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred for 3 h at 1 mA/cm2 onto nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm). Filters were blocked overnight in Block ACE (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2 (Eastman Kodak) in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl) followed by incubation with a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS buffer, bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected by chemiluminescense (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Kodak XAR autoradiography film. GST fusion protein expression vector for the middle TSP type I motif (amino acids 535–615) of ADAMTS-1 was prepared as described previously (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Similarly, cDNA corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal TSP type I submotifs (amino acids 832–951) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) and purified as described previously (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). These GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and applied to an HPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equipped with a TSK gel heparin-5PW column (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan), which was equilibrated previously with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). After washing the column, bound materials were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0 to 1m in the same buffer. The fractions containing GST fusion proteins were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Because ADAMTS-1 has a putative signal peptide at the amino terminus but not a transmembrane region (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), it is a putative secretory protein. To examine whether the ADAMTS-1 protein is actually secreted from cells or not, ADAMTS-1 cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells. For detection of the recombinant ADAMTS-1 protein, the FLAG epitope tag, consisting of eight amino acids, was added in the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The expression vector for ADAMTS-1 was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and 2 days after transfection the culture supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. However, ADAMTS-1 protein was not detected in the conditioned cell culture medium (Fig.1, lane 6). ADAMTS-1 has three TSP type I motifs in its carboxyl-terminal half. The TSP type I repeats were shown to be one of the ECM interaction sites of thrombospondins 1 and 2 (19Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the possibility that ADAMTS-1 is incorporated into the ECM. After transfection of the expression vector, cells were detached from dishes by EDTA treatment, and thereafter ECM proteins were extracted with Laemmli buffer. As shown in Fig. 1, two major bands were detected in the ECM fraction from the ADAMTS-1 cDNA-transfected cells (lane 4) but were not detected in that from the control vector-transfected cells (lane 3). The molecular size of the upper band is about 110 kDa, corresponding approximately to the full-length ADAMTS-1 protein but slightly larger than the expected size. The FLAG epitope tag was added at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. In addition, the difference in size between the lower and upper bands is about 20 kDa, corresponding to the size of the proprotein domain. Therefore, the lower band represents the mature form of the ADAMTS-1 protein after processing of the proprotein domain. These data demonstrate that both the precursor and the processed forms of the ADAMTS-1 protein are secreted from cells and incorporated into the ECM. To identify the domains that are responsible for the binding of the ADAMTS-1 protein to the ECM, we first constructed several carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants (Fig.2 A). These deletion mutants were expressed as FLAG-tagged protein in COS-7 cells, and the effects of deletions on binding to the ECM were investigated. When mutant X4, deleting the spacer region and the carboxyl-terminal TSP submotifs, was expressed in COS-7 cells, the precursor form of mutant X4 was detected in both the culture medium and the ECM fraction (Fig.3, lanes 3 and 8). In contrast, the mature form of mutant X4 was detected in the culture supernatant but not in the ECM fraction (lanes 3 and8). Similarly, the precursor form of mutant X5, deleting from the middle TSP type I motif to the carboxyl terminus, was detected in both the ECM fraction and the culture medium, whereas its mature form was detected only in the culture medium (lanes 4 and9). Furthermore, the precursor form of mutant X6, also lacking a disintegrin-like domains, was found associated with the ECM (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the precursor form consisting of a proprotein and a proteinase domain has ECM binding capacity, whereas its mature form, lacking a proprotein domain, does not.Figure 3Identification of the ECM binding domains of the ADAMTS-1 protein. COS-7 cells were transfected with various expression vectors encoding the FLAG-tagged wild type ADAMTS-1 (lanes 5 and 10), mutant X3 (lanes 2and 7), mutant X4 (lanes 3 and 8), mutant X5 (lanes 4 and 9), and control vector (lanes 1 and 6). Two days after transfection, the culture medium (lanes 1–5) and the ECM fractions (lanes 6–10) were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The positions of the wild type ADAMTS-1 and its deletion mutants are shown by arrows; p, precursor form; m, mature form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the other hand, the mature form of the wild type ADAMTS-1 protein was found associated with the ECM (Fig. 1, lane 4, and Fig.3, lane 10), whereas no mature form of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants X4 and X5 was detected in the ECM fraction (Fig. 3,lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal half containing TSP type I motifs is important for the interaction of the mature protein with the ECM. The above results suggest a major contribution of the carboxyl-terminal half to the ECM binding for the mature form of ADAMTS-1 protein. To confirm the ECM binding activity of the carboxyl-terminal region, we next constructed a vector expressing the mutant (DPM-1) that lacks both a proprotein and a metalloproteinase domains (Fig. 2 B). In mutant DPM-1, the signal peptide is followed by the middle TSP type I motif of the ADAMTS-1 protein. When mutant DPM-1 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, it was detected in the ECM fraction but not in the cell culture medium (Fig. 4,lanes 2 and 6), confirming the capacity of the carboxyl-terminal half for ECM binding. Similarly, mutant DPM-3, deleting the carboxyl-terminal TSP submotifs, was detected predominantly in the ECM fraction (lanes 3 and7). In contrast, DPM-6, which is a truncation mutant of the spacer region, was found in both the culture medium and the ECM fraction (lanes 4 and 8). This indicates that truncation of the spacer region results in reduction of ECM binding activity and that the three TSP type I motifs alone have ECM binding activity. Moreover, the carboxyl-terminal spacer region alone (DPM-5) was found associated with the ECM (lanes 10 and13). These results demonstrate that the spacer region in the carboxyl-terminal region contributes its tight binding to the ECM in addition to that of the three TSP type I motifs. As described above, the ADAMTS-1 proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells with a slightly larger molecular size than expected. Because ADAMTS-1 possesses the putativeN-linked glycosylation motifs, it is possible that the larger molecular size of ADAMTS-1 is caused by post-translational modification by glycosylation. Therefore, we next examined whether tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, affects the molecular size of the protein. As shown in Fig.5 A, tunicamycin treatment of cells clearly resulted in reduction of the molecular size of the precursor form of ADAMTS-1 protein (lanes 3 and4), suggesting that the majority of ADAMTS-1 is glycosylated when expressed in COS-7 cells. ADAMTS-1 has four putative N-linked glycosylation motifs. One is located between the disintegrin-like and the first TSP type I motif, and the others are present within the carboxyl-terminal spacer region of the protein (Fig. 2). To analyze the contribution of these motifs to glycosylation of the ADAMTS-1 protein in vivo, we next compared molecular size of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants with or without tunicamycin treatment. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the precursor forms of mutant X3, deleting the carboxyl-terminal TSP submotifs, were detected as triplet bands without tunicamycin (lane 1), whereas the upper two bands were shifted to the faster migrating one by treatment with tunicamycin (lane 2), suggesting that mutant X3 is highly glycosylated. In contrast, the precursor forms of mutant X4, deleting the spacer region that includes three N-linked glycosylation motifs, were detected as doublet bands in the absence of tunicamycin (lane 3), and the upper band disappeared by tunicamycin treatment (lane 4), suggesting that mutant X4 is partially glycosylated. However, tunicamycin treatment did not change the molecular size of the precursor form of mutant X6 (lanes 5 and 6), deleting all four N-linked glycosylation motifs in the protein. These data demonstrate that ADAMTS-1 isN-glycosylated at multiple sites within the carboxyl-terminal region. The above results suggest that TSP type I motifs contribute to the ECM binding of the ADAMTS-1 protein. Because TSP type I motifs of thrombospondins were shown to associate with sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate (19Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we next examined the possibility that sulfated glycosaminoglycan is a target for the ECM binding of the ADAMTS-1 protein. To address this possibility, soluble heparin was added to the cell culture medium, and its effect on the distribution of the ADAMTS-1 protein was analyzed. As mentioned above, under normal cell culture conditions, little or no ADAMTS-1 protein was found in the cell culture medium (Fig.6, lane 9). In contrast, the processed form of the ADAMTS-1 protein clearly appeared in the cell culture supernatant when the cells were grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml soluble heparin (lane 10). Similarly, mutant DPM-1, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal half, was not detected in the normal condition medium (lane 11) but was present in the culture medium containing soluble heparin (lane 12). These results raise the possibility that the ADAMTS-1 protein was released into the medium by competing with soluble heparin. In addition, we studied the elution profile of recombinant GST fusion proteins for the TSP type I motifs from a heparin-HPLC column using a linear gradient (Fig. 7). The middle TSP type I motif protein was eluted at 0.46–0.66 m NaCl, whereas the carboxyl-terminal TSP submotifs protein were eluted at slightly lower salt concentration (0.4–0.53 m NaCl). GST alone was recovered in the flow-through fraction (data not shown). These data indicate that both the middle and the carboxyl-terminal TSP type I motifs can bind to heparin independently at a physiological salt concentration. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the ECM association of the mature form the ADAMTS-1 protein occurs through binding to sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate. Typical ADAMs are classified as not only membrane-anchored proteases, but also cell surface adhesion molecules (1Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 2Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Previously, we have identified ADAMTS-1 as an atypical ADAM family protein that does not possess a transmembrane domain (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that COS-7 cells transfected with the expression vector for the ADAMTS-1 gene express and secrete ADAMTS-1 protein as both precursor and mature forms. In normal growth condition, little or none of the ADAMTS-1 protein was detected in the cell culture supernatant, whereas the majority of the protein was found in the ECM fraction on the culture dishes after the intact cells were detached. Our previous study showed that ADAMTS-1 mRNA expression is induced in kidney and heart after lipopolysaccharide administration, suggesting that ADAMTS-1 protein may be involved in an inflammatory process. Because this protein has the ECM binding property, it is unlikely that the ADAMTS-1 protein would diffuse extensively in these organs during inflammation, although ADAMTS-1 is secretory type of ADAM family protein. Instead, ADAMTS-1 may be incorporated into the ECM region around the producing cells. The ECM binding domains of the ADAMTS-1 protein were first addressed by analysis of its carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal region containing three TSP type I motifs completely abolished the ECM binding capacity of the mature form of the protein. Consistent with this finding, we observed that localization of the mutant corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal half was restricted to the ECM. These data demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal half, including three TSP type I motifs, of the protein is important for the ECM binding of the mature form of the ADAMTS-1 protein. The TSP type I motif is conserved in thrombospondins 1 and 2, which are multifunctional ECM proteins that influence cell adhesion, motility, and growth (19Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 24Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The TSP type I motif was also found in multiple copies in properdin, which stabilizes the C3 convertase during activation of the alternate complement pathway (25Goundis D. Reid K.B.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The TSP type I motifs of these factors have been shown to be involved in binding to sulfated glycoconjugates, such as heparin and heparan sulfate. It was shown that the TSP type I motifs in thrombospondins possess two conserved heparin binding segments: W(S/G)XWSXW and CSVTCG (24Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 26Guo N.-H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequences related to the latter segment (CSVTCG) are also found in a group of secreted proteins such as cyr61(CEF-10), which is induced by v-src, serum, and platelet-derived growth factor (28Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar), a serum-inducible protein, fisp-12 (29Ryseck R.-P. Macdonald-Bravo H. Mattei M.-G. Bravo R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), an immediate early gene expressed in virally induced avian nephroblastoma, nov (30Joliot V. Martinerie C. Dambrine G. Plassiart G. Brisac M. Crochet J. Perbal B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and a connective tissue growth factor (31Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Among these factors, cyr61 was shown to bind to the ECM (28Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of ADAMTS-1, the middle TSP I motif has sequences similar to these heparin-binding segments in thrombospondins, WGPWGPW, and CS(R/K)TCG, whereas the carboxyl-terminal submotifs have only the latter sequence (17Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that both the middle TSP type I motif and the carboxyl-terminal TSP submotifs of the ADAMTS-1 protein are able to bind to heparin. The carboxyl-terminal TSP submotif protein binds to heparin with slightly lesser affinity than the TSP type I motif in the middle of the molecule. This lower affinity of the carboxyl-terminal submotifs might be the result of incomplete conservation in the amino-terminal sequence of the motifs. On the other hand, we also showed that growth of transfected cells in the presence of soluble heparin led to the appearance of the mature ADAMTS-1 protein in the culture medium. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the interaction between its three TSP type I motifs and sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the ECM, such as heparan sulfate, plays a role in the ECM binding of the ADAMTS-1 protein. On the other hand, we also found that truncation of the spacer region intervening between the middle and carboxyl-terminal TSP type I motifs significantly reduced the ECM binding of the protein. Moreover, the spacer region alone was able to associate tightly with the ECM. Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal spacer domain is also important for tight binding to the ECM in addition to the three TSP type I motifs. In our previous study, we called this region the “spacer region” because it does not show any homologies with known proteins. However, the present study has identified the spacer region as one of the ECM binding domains of the ADAMTS-1 protein. Finally, our data demonstrate that the mature ADAMTS-1 protein is associated tightly with the ECM through independent multiple ECM attachment sites in its carboxyl-terminal region, whereas the metalloproteinase domain in the amino-terminal region is free. Analyses of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants also revealed that the precursor form, consisting of a proprotein domain and a metalloproteinase domain, has the ability to bind to the ECM, whereas its mature form does not. One possibility is that the proprotein domain of ADAMTS-1 possesses an ECM binding site. However, when the proprotein domain alone was expressed in COS-7 cells, it was present only in the culture medium. 2K. Kuno and K. Matsushima, unpublished results. Therefore, it seems that a conformational change in the amino-terminal region, triggered by an interaction between the proprotein and the proteinase domains, might lead to exposure of an unknown ECM binding site on the surface of the molecule. Like other ADAMs, the amino-terminal half of the ADAMTS-1 protein consists of a proprotein domain, a metalloproteinase domain, and disintegrin-like domains. We found that the wild type or deletion mutants of the ADAMTS-1 protein were detected as both the precursor and mature forms when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Because there are two typical cleavage site (RRRR, 178–182) (RKKR, 233–236) for the furin-like protease within the proprotein domain of the mouse ADAMTS-1 protein, it is possible that the precursor of ADAMTS-1 protein is processed by a furin-like protease. Furin is a widely distributed serine endoprotease in the Golgi. It cleaves a wide range of precursor proteins at the consensus RX(K/R)R (32Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furin cleavage sites are found in a number of precursor proteins that are transported to the cell surface by a constitutive pathway rather than one that is involved in storage in granules (34Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ADAM family proteins are classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of a zinc binding motif (HEXXH) in their protease domains. In addition, it is thought that the zinc binding motif is masked by the conserved cysteine in the proprotein domain. Because the ADAMTS-1 protein has a zinc binding motif in its metalloproteinase domain, the present data suggest that ADAMTS-1 is secreted from cells as a proteolytically active form by cleavage with a furin-like enzyme. ADAMTS-1 possesses putative N-linked glycosylation motifs. In this study, we have shown that ADAMTS-1 is actuallyN-glycosylated at multiple sites within the carboxyl-terminal region. Unexpectedly, when cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin, the processed form of the ADAMTS-1 protein was not detected in the ECM fraction. It is possible that processing of the ADAMTS-1 protein may be regulated by N-glycosylation in the Golgi. On the other hand, it is clear that glycosylation of the protein is not required for the association with the ECM because the precursor forms of the wild type and deletion mutants were found associated with the ECM after tunicamycin treatment. Recent studies show that TACE and ADAM10 (MADM) cleave a membrane-bound TNF-α precursor protein and release soluble TNF-α. In addition, inDrosophila, the Kuzbanian gene product is responsible for cleavage of the extracellular domain of Notch. From these observations, membrane-bound ADAM family proteins with a metalloproteinase consensus sequence are proposed as candidates for protein ectodomain shedding protease of cytokines such as the c-kit ligand, transforming growth factor α, and Fas ligand, cytokine receptors such as the interleukin-6 receptor, and adhesion molecules such as L-selectin (35Arribas J.

In this study, we demonstrated that the ADAMTS-1 protein is secreted from cells, and the majority of the protein is incorporated into the ECM. Therefore, it is presumed that the target molecule(s) of the ADAMTS-1 protein may be different from those of membrane-anchored ADAM proteinases. We are grateful to Dr. Y.

Combinatorial ligand/receptor/effector interactions allow large potential for signal diversification. Here we addressed the possibility that turn-off mechanisms enhance the diversification potential. Concentrating on ErbB-1 and two of its ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), and the Neu differentiation factor (NDF/neuregulin) and one of its receptors, ErbB-3, we show that ligand binding variably accelerates endocytosis of the respective ligand-receptor complex.

In the case of NDF, structural, as well as biochemical, analyses imply that ligand degradation occurs at a relatively late endosomal stage. Attenuation of receptor down-regulation by this mechanism apparently confers to both NDF and TGF-α more potent and prolonged signaling activity.

In conclusion, alternative endocytic trafficking of ligand-ErbB complexes may tune and diversify signal transduction by EGF family ligands. The ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases is representative of several other groups of highly homologous receptors sharing growth factors as their ligands (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Whereas only one ErbB homolog exists in invertebrates, such as flies and worms, four receptors are present in mammals, and they bind to multiple growth factor molecules through an epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary, MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; NDF, Neu differentiation factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α; MAP, mitogen-activated protein.1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary, MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; NDF, Neu differentiation factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. motif. The variety of receptors and ligands is thought to contribute to the diversification potential of the ErbB signaling network (reviewed in Ref. 2Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Three levels of signal diversification may be proposed. First, each ligand molecule is apparently bivalent; the high affinity binding site binds to a “primary receptor,” whereas a low affinity site, whose specificity is broad, allows selective recruitment of ErbB molecules into dimeric receptor structures, leading to effective signaling (3Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Second, at the receptor level, 10 distinct homo- and heterodimeric complexes may be formed in a ligand-specific order of preference. Yet, the most divergent level of the signaling mechanism appears to be postreceptor; through their various autophosphorylation sites, dimeric receptor complexes engage specific sets of cytoplasmic signaling proteins sharing a phosphotyrosine binding motif, usually a Src homology 2 domain (4Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Despite the remarkably large repertoire of signaling proteins that become physically associated with specific ErbB dimers, only a few have been shown to be strictly specific. Examples include the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, an enzyme that selectively binds to ErbB-3-containing dimers (5Soltoff S.P. Carraway K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and phospholipase Cγ, a specific target of ErbB-1 (6Cohen B.D. Kiener P.K. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. Zhang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30897-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and ErbB-2 (7Peles E. Ben-Levy R. Or E. Ullrich A. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, signaling pathways stimulated by all ErbB combinations feed into the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway (8Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), resulting in a surprisingly uniform pattern of signaling, which is shared by the invertebrate versions of ErbB proteins (9Perrimon N. Perkins L.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, unlike the shared rapid coupling to MAP kinases, the kinetics of MAP kinase inactivation, a critical parameter in determining signal outcome (10Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar), differ according to the identity of the stimulating receptor. Especially important is the engagement of ErbB-2, a ligandless protein that delays inactivation of ErbB signals (11Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and ErbB-3, a kinase-defective receptor whose activation depends on the presence of a co-receptor (8Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 12Riese D.J. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Thus, the inactivation phase of ErbB signaling may be critical for determination of the duration and potency of cell activation by EGF family growth factors. Whereas the major events involved in ErbB activation are fairly well understood, the inactivation phase is still poorly characterized. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that turn-off mechanisms may be as important for signal diversification as is the stimulatory process. An obvious candidate is the interaction of ligand-occupied receptors with tyrosine-specific phosphatases (13Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cbl is another example; this cytoplasmic adaptor protein, whose ortholog inCaenorhabditis elegans negatively regulates ErbB signaling (14Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), associates with ErbB-1 but not with ErbB-3 or with ErbB-4 (15Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar). The third mechanism of receptor inactivation involves ligand-induced down-regulation of the number of surface receptors. This fairly complex regulatory process is mediated by rapid endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes, and their variable delivery into cytoplasmic compartments (for review see Ref. 16Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Unlike receptors for nutrients such as transferrin and lipoproteins, efficient internalization of growth factor receptors through coated pits requires ligand binding. In addition, a more significant fraction of the endocytosed signaling receptors escapes recycling and is sorted to degradation in lysosomes. Apparently, a fine balance between receptor recycling and lysosomal targeting exists in cells, yet its molecular details are still poorly understood. For example, specific domains of ErbB-1 are necessary for lysosomal targeting (17Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and certain cytoplasmic proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, are probably involved in the selective sorting of internalized receptors (18Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Another critical parameter is the pH sensitivity of ligand/receptor interactions; ligands, such as EGF, whose interaction is relatively resistant to mildly acidic pH, target ErbB-1 to lysosomes, whereas transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) and other ligands that readily dissociate due to the mildly acidic endosomal pH cause receptor recycling (19French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Despite the open questions, it seems clear that endocytosis and lysosomal targeting critically attenuate signaling by growth factors (20Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 21Reddy C.C. Niyogi S.K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that alternative intracellular routing of ErbB proteins and their ligands may contribute to diversification of signal transduction (8Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 22Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In contrast to the rapid internalization of ErbB-1 and its ligand, EGF, retarded endocytosis of the three other members of the ErbB family has been observed. In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism underlying differential receptor trafficking by ErbB ligands. We have found that an ErbB-3-specific ligand, the Neu differentiation factor (NDF/neuregulin), undergoes slow endocytosis that is followed by receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. By contrast, most of the EGF-stimulated ErbB-1 molecules are destined to lysosomal degradation. Due to the consequent clearance of ErbB-1 molecules, but not ErbB-3 molecules, from the cell surface, the mitogenic signal evoked by EGF is less potent than the NDF signal. This phenomenon, however, depends also on the nature of the ligand, since another ErbB-1 ligand, TGF-α, undergoes rapid endocytosis but nevertheless induces receptor recycling with only limited receptor down-regulation. Consistently, the mitogenic activity of this ligand is superior to that of EGF, reinforcing a role for ErbB routing in tuning of mitogenic signals. A recombinant form of NDF-β1177–246 was prepared by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Human recombinant EGF and TGF-α were purchased from Sigma. Radioactive materials were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. IODO-GEN was from Pierce. A monoclonal antibody to ErbB-3 was generated in our laboratory (23Chen X. Levkowitz G. Tzahar E. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ben-Baruch N. Leitner O. Ratzkin B.J. Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7620-7629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ErbB-1-specific monoclonal antibody 528 was a gift from John Mendelsohn (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The monoclonal antibody to the active form of MAP kinase (doubly phosphorylated on both tyrosine and threonine residues of the TEY motif (24Yung Y. Dolginov Y. Yao Z. Rubinfeld H. Michael D. Hanoch T. Roubini E. Lando Z. Zharhari D. Seger R. FEBS J. 1997; 408: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) was a gift from Rony Seger (Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel). Binding buffer contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES. HNTG buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. Solubilization buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm EGTA, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (0.15 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Biotin-X-NHS was from Calbiochem. Colloidal gold sols (10-nm diameter) were from British Biocell International. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing the various ErbB proteins or a deletion mutant of ErbB-3 were described previously (25Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The ErbB-3 QQGFF insertion mutant was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using T7-DNA polymerase (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). The cDNA of erbB-3 was subcloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector containing an F1 origin of replication, and the mutation was introduced by using the primer 5′-GGAGCAGGAGTTAGAAAAAGCCCTGTTGCGTTCTCTGGG-3′ and the purified single-stranded DNA as a template. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments, cells were grown to 90% confluence. Sublines derived from the 32D murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line and expressing various ErbB proteins have been previously described (8Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% medium that was conditioned by an interleukin-3-producing cell line (27Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Human recombinant EGF, TGF-α, and human recombinant NDF-β1177–246 were labeled with IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described (3Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For binding assays, monolayers of the indicated cell lines in 24-well dishes were washed once with binding buffer and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 ng/ml125I-labeled NDF-β1177–246,125I-EGF, or TGF-α. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. Labeled cells were lysed for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH solution containing 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity was determined. Nonspecific binding was calculated by subtracting the binding of radiolabeled ligands to CHO cells or by performing the binding assays in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Cells cultured in 24-well plates were washed with binding buffer and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of radiolabeled NDF or EGF (each at 10 ng/ml). To allow ligand internalization, the cells were transferred to 37 °C and incubated for various periods of time. The cells were then put on ice and washed twice with binding buffer, and cellular distribution of the radiolabeled ligand was determined by using a 7-min-long incubation in 0.5 ml solution of 150 mm acetic acid (pH 2.7), containing 150 mm NaCl. The released ligand was considered as cell surface-associated ligand (28Yarden Y. Gabbay M. Schlessinger J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 674: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The remaining radioactivity was solubilized in 100 mm NaOH solution containing 0.1% SDS that was considered as internalized ligand. Ligand-induced receptor down-regulation was measured as follows. Cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for up to 2.5 h without or with 250 ng/ml ligand in binding buffer and then rinsed with cold binding buffer. Surface-bound growth factor was removed by using a low pH acetic acid wash. The number of ligand binding sites on the cell surface was then determined by incubating cells at 4 °C with the corresponding radiolabeled ligand for at least 1 h. Coupling of EGF and NDF to gold colloids (10-nm diameter) was performed by using a standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cellular uptake of colloidal gold-labeled ligands was performed as follows. Cells grown in 24-well plates were rinsed twice with binding buffer at 4 °C and then incubated in the same buffer containing 1:10 dilution of either NDF- or EGF-colloidal gold for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were then warmed to 37 °C and incubated for various time intervals in the continuous presence of the ligand. At the end of incubation at 37 °C, cells were rinsed twice with binding buffer and fixed for 24 h with Karnovsky's fixative (3% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, and 5 mmCaCl2 in 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) at room temperature and 10 h at 4 °C. Lighter fixation was then carried out with a mixture of 3% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer. Tissues were impregnated in 100 mmcacodylate buffer, with 2.3 m sucrose, pH 7.4. The samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ultrathin sections (500–1000 Å) were cut at −115 °C using a Reichert-Jung FS-4D ultracryomicrotome. The sections were recovered from the knife in a 2.3m sucrose droplet according to the method of Tokuyasu and Singer (29Tokuyasu K.T. Singer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 894-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and transferred to Formvar-coated 300-mesh grids. The grids were floated on water in a Petri dish at 4 °C. The duration of the water rinse was between 1 and 16 h, without any appreciable difference in the resulting ultrastructure. The sections were then processed for methyl-cellulose mounting according to a modification of the above mentioned protocol. Cells were washed free of interleukin-3, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at 5 × 105 cells/ml, and treated without or with EGF, TGF-α, or NDF at various concentrations for dose response experiments. Cell survival was determined by using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which determines mitochondrial activity in living cells (30Mosman T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar). MTT (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with the analyzed cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Living cells can transform the tetrazolium ring into dark blue formazan crystals that can be quantified by reading the optical density at 540–630 nm after lysis of the cells with acidic isopropyl alcohol. Monolayers of CHO cells grown in 10-cm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 0.5 mg/ml of a water-soluble Biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) dissolved in borate buffer (10 mmboric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for 45 min at 4 °C. Coupling of biotin was blocked by extensive washes with a solution of 15 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then treated with a growth factor (250 ng/ml) for different time intervals at 37 °C. To evaluate the amounts of cell surface receptors, the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Visualization of the biotinylated proteins was performed by probing the nitrocellulose membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After treatment with growth factors, cells were scrapped, pelleted by centrifugation, and solubilized in solubilization buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). For direct electrophoretic analysis, boiling gel sample buffer was added to cell lysates. For other experiments, lysates were first subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies that were precoupled to rabbit-anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and then to protein A-Sepharose. The proteins in the lysate supernatant were immunoprecipitated with aliquots of the protein A-Sepharose-antibody complex for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 7.5% gels, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 h in TBST buffer (0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.1% milk, blotted with 1 μg/ml primary antibodies for 2 h, followed by 0.5 μg/ml secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Conditioned media containing radiolabeled ligands were assayed by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). Samples were precipitated after 1 h at 2 °C by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity present in the supernatants (trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction) and pellets (trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction) was determined. It has been previously reported that the rates of ligand-induced internalization of NDF receptors are significantly slower than the rate of EGF-driven endocytosis of ErbB-1 (8Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 22Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We used a series of CHO cells (25Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), which share landmarks with many ErbB-expressing epithelial and fibroblastic cells, to address the mechanism underlying differential endocytosis of ErbB proteins. Comparative analysis revealed that CHO cells ectopically expressing ErbB-1 (denoted CB1 cells) internalized radiolabeled EGF at a higher rate than the kinetics of endocytosis of surface-bound NDF into cells expressing ErbB-3 (CB3 cells) or ErbB-4 (CB4 cells, Fig. 1 A). Two lines of evidence indicated that this difference is receptor-specific rather than ligand-specific. First, internalization of EGF by cells expressing a chimeric receptor, denoted NEC, in which the extracellular and intracellular domains are derived from ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, respectively (31Ben-Levy R. Peles E. Goldman-Michael R. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17304-17313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was relatively slow, in accordance with a previous report (32Sorkin A. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the rate of internalization of another ErbB-1 ligand, namely TGF-α, was comparable with that of EGF (Fig.1 A). These results are consistent with previous reports (8Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar,22Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and they imply that the differences in cellular uptake of NDF and EGF are independent of cell type or ligand identity. To gain insight into the mechanism of the relatively slow internalization of NDF, we concentrated on one of its receptors, ErbB-3, and analyzed its fate in the presence or absence of the ligand. For comparison, we used ErbB-1 and two of its ligands, EGF and TGF-α, because differences in cellular routing of these growth factors, when complexed to ErbB-1, have previously been noted (34Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Labeling of cell surface receptor molecules with biotin and subsequent immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ErbB-3 underwent a constitutively rapid down-regulation, which was only moderately enhanced by NDF (Fig. 1 C). By contrast, ErbB-1 displayed a relatively long membrane residence, and it was rapidly cleared from the cell surface after binding of EGF (Fig. 1 B). It is noteworthy that analysis of a chimeric ErbB-3 molecule, whose extracellular domain was derived from ErbB-1, detected a very small effect of the ligand on the half-life of the metabolically labeled ErbB-3 chimera (22Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A third pattern of down-regulation was displayed by the TGF-α-activated ErbB-1. This ligand exerted no detectable effect on surface ErbB-1 (Fig. 1 B). We concluded that the turnover rates of surface-exposed ErbB-3 and ErbB-1 molecules differ even in the absence of a ligand. However, the extent of ligand-induced down-regulation depends on ligand identity, as exemplified by the comparison between EGF and TGF-α. To further follow the differences in receptor down-regulation, we used a ligand binding assay as an alternative measure of the decrease in the number of cell surface receptors following stimulation with a growth factor. The ability of EGF, TGF-α, and NDF to down-regulate ErbB receptors was examined in the absence or presence of monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that disrupts intracellular traffic and receptor recycling (35Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of the inhibitor, ErbB-1 molecules were down-regulated within 30 min by approximately 80%, while at this time point both NDF and TGF-α caused the disappearance of only a quarter of their respective receptors. Inhibition of receptor recycling, however, increased the extent of down-regulation by NDF, as well as by TGF-α, but the drug was ineffective on the EGF-induced down-regulation of ErbB-1 (Fig. 2). In analogy to previous models of TGF-α-induced down-regulation (34Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 36Kramer R.H. Leferink A.E.G. van Bueren-Koornneef I.L. van der Meer A. van de Poll M.L.M. van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8708-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one possible interpretation of our results is as follows. NDF, as well as TGF-α, targets its receptor to a recycling pathway, whereas the EGF-bound ErbB-1 is destined primarily to intracellular degradation. If correct, this model predicts that receptor recovery following down-regulation will be rapid in the case of the recycling-inducing ligands (i.e. NDF and TGF-α), but only slow recovery of ErbB-1 may be expected after stimulation with EGF. In order to examine this prediction, receptors were down-regulated in the presence of high ligand concentrations, and the cells were subsequently acid-washed to remove surface-bound ligand molecules. Later, treated cells were transferred to 37 °C to allow receptor recovery at the cell surface. Recovery was detected by rebinding of a labeled ligand. In line with the proposed model, rapid recovery followed down-regulation by NDF or TGF-α, but practically no reappearance of binding sites was coupled to the EGF-induced down-regulation of ErbB-1 (Fig. 3). The extra recovery displayed by ErbB-3 is surprising and may be due to an intracellular pool of ErbB-3, whose existence is consistent with the short half-life of this receptor (Fig. 1 C), and its mostly cytoplasmic, rather than cell membrane, localization as revealed by immunostaining (37Prigent S.A. Lemoine N.R. Hughes C.M. Plowman G.D. Selden C. Gullick W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2064734596,"The rat μ opioid receptor is alternatively spliced into two isoforms (MOR1 and MOR1B) which differ in length and amino acid composition at the carboxyl terminus. When stably expressed in HEK 293 cells, both splice variants bind the μ receptor agonist [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,-Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) with similar affinity and exhibit functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase with similar efficiency. However, the shorter isoform, MOR1B, desensitized at a slower rate during prolonged DAMGO exposure (4 h) but resensitized at a faster rate than MOR1 during agonist withdrawal (20 min). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that DAMGO-induced internalization of MOR1B proceeded much faster than that of MOR1 followed by rapid recycling of the receptor to the cell surface. In addition, the greater resistance of MOR1B to homologous desensitization compared with MOR1 as well as MOR1B resensitization was abolished when receptor reactivation/recycling was blocked with monensin, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification. It is concluded that the sequence at the cytoplasmic tail of MOR1B facilitates clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis which, in turn, promotes accelerated receptor reactivation. Taken together, our findings suggest that carboxyl-terminal splicing of the rat μ opioid receptor modulates agonist-induced internalization and receptor resensitization.

Taken together, our findings suggest that carboxyl-terminal splicing of the rat μ opioid receptor modulates agonist-induced internalization and receptor resensitization. Prolonged exposure of G protein-coupled receptors to agonists results in a rapid decrease of receptor responsiveness. It is now generally accepted that agonist-induced desensitization involves phosphorylation of intracellular receptor domains. Several kinases have been implicated in opioid receptor desensitization, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; MOR, rat μ opioid receptor; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney 293; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,-Glyol5]enkephalin; CaM kinase II; calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; Li, like immunoreactivity; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; MOR, rat μ opioid receptor; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney 293; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,-Glyol5]enkephalin; CaM kinase II; calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; Li, like immunoreactivity; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance. protein kinase C (PKC), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) (1Chen Y.

Specific phosphorylation sites have been localized in the third intracellular domain and at the carboxyl terminus, which play a critical role in homologous desensitization of the opioid receptor (6Evans C.J. Keith D.E. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1952-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 7Kieffer B.L. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, the receptor is being targeted to the endocytotic machinery. A large body of evidence suggests that the main route of internalization of G protein-coupled receptors is via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles into early endosomes. Within the acidic environment of the endosomes, the ligand is effectively separated from the receptor which becomes dephosphorylated and thus resensitized. As a final step, the receptor recycles back to the cell surface (11Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). For the μ opioid receptor, desensitization seems to be regulated by CaM kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser261/Ser266) in the third intracellular loop (3Koch T. Kroslak T. Mayer P. Raulf E. Ho¨llt V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Koch T. Wolf R. Raulf E. Ho¨llt V. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: R37Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another important phosphorylation site of the μ opioid receptor is the threonine at position 394 in the carboxyl terminus. Indeed, we and others have recently observed that site-directed mutagenesis of Thr394 to alanine profoundly delays DAMGO-induced desensitization, suggesting that this site may be a primary target for phosphorylation by GRKs upon agonist binding to the MOR1 (9Koch T. Wolf R. Raulf E. Ho¨llt V. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: R37Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have previously shown, that the cytoplasmic tail of the rat μ opioid receptor undergoes alternative splicing giving rise to two isoforms, MOR1 and MOR1B. The receptor variants share 100% amino acid sequence identity up to amino acid 386 but differ from residue 387 to the carboxyl terminus (MOR1,387LENLEAETAPLP398; MOR1B,387KIDLF391). Both isoforms exhibit similar pharmacological profiles, however, MOR1B which lacks Thr394appears to be more resistant to agonist-induced desensitization than MOR1 (12Zimprich A. Simon T. Ho¨llt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the role of receptor internalization in the desensitization process of the two μ opioid receptor isoforms. Evidence will be provided, that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of MOR1B contains a putative endocytotic motif that leads to an enhanced internalization/reactivation rate and, hence, may explain the delayed desensitization kinetics of MOR1B as compared with MOR1. MOR1 cDNA subcloned into pRc/CMV (kindly provided by Dr. L. Yu, Indianapolis, IN), and MOR1B cDNA subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vectors were used for transfection of human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells (ATCC). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium NuT F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described by Chen and Okayama (13Chen C.A. Okayama H. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany), and the whole pool of resistant cells was used without selection of individual clones. Transfected cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 per well in 22-mm 12-well dishes. After 24 h, cells were exposed to 1 μm DAMGO (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h. When indicated, cells were preincubated either with 0.4 msucrose (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), an inhibitor of clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis, for 30 min or with 50 μmmonensin (Sigma), an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, for 60 min and subsequently maintained under these conditions during agonist exposure. For resensitization assays, cells were washed after 4 h of DAMGO exposure followed by an additional incubation period of 0, 5, 10, or 20 min in the absence of agonist. For the measurement of cAMP accumulation, medium was removed from individual wells and replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) containing 25 μm forskolin (Biotrend, Ko¨ln, Germany) or 25 μm forskolin plus 1 μmDAMGO. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by removing the medium and sonicating the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold HCl/ethanol (1 volume of 1 n HCl/100 volumes of ethanol). After centrifugation, the supernatant was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5), and the cAMP content was determined using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). Statistical evaluation of results was performed using ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test. For whole cell binding, 106 cells treated as described above were incubated with 2.5 nm [3H]DAMGO (NEN, Ko¨ln, Germany) for 40 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Cells were collected on GF 10 glass-fiber filters and unbound ligand was removed by extensive washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The radioactivity on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Nonspecific binding was determined as radioactivity bound in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled DAMGO. Results were calculated as fmol bound radioligand per mg of protein, measured by Lowry (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding characteristics of MOR1 and MOR1B were determined by saturation binding assays on membranes prepared from transfected HEK 293 cells. The dissociation constant (K D) and number of [3H]DAMGO binding sites (B max) were calculated by Scatchard analysis (15Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-664Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar) using at least seven concentrations of labeled DAMGO in a range from 0.25 to 10 nm. HEK 293 cells stably expressing either MOR1 or MOR1B were grown on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips overnight. Cells were then exposed to 1 μmDAMGO for 0, 10, 30, or 50 min. When indicated, the medium was supplemented with sucrose or monensin as described above. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, for 45 min at room temperature and subsequently washed several times in TPBS (10 mm Tris, 10 mm phosphate buffer, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% thimerosal, pH 7.4). After 1 h of preincubation in TPBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% normal goat serum, cells were incubated either with anti-MOR1 (9998) or anti-MOR1B (9636) antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000 in TPBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum overnight at RT. The antibodies were generated against the following peptide sequences: LENLEAETAPLP, which corresponds to residues 387–398 of MOR1, and VDRTNHQKIDLF, which corresponds to residues 380–391 of MOR1B and have been characterized extensively (16Schulz S. Schreff M. Koch T. Zimprich A. Gramsch C. Ho¨llt V. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibody was detected with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Vector, Burlingame, CA) followed by streptavidin-cyanin 3.18 (1:400; Amersham, Germany). Cells were then dehydrated, cleared in xylol and permanently mounted in DPX (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Specimens were examined using a Leica TCS-NT laser scanning confocal microscope. Cyanin 3.18 was imaged with 568-nm excitation and 570–630-nm bandpass emission filters. Confocal micrographs were taken by a person blinded to the treatments who was instructed to randomly select one colony of 4–12 cells per coverslip. The splice variants MOR1 and MOR1B were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. First, we compared binding affinities and functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase of the expressed receptors. Saturation binding experiments indicated no major difference between MOR1 and MOR1B with respect to their affinity to [3H]DAMGO. The maximum percentage inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activities for MOR1 and MOR1B was also identical. However, the number of binding sites was higher in MOR1-expressing cells than in MOR1B-expressing cells (Table I).Table IFunctional properties of MOR1 and MOR1B opioid receptor types after stable expression in human embryonic kidney cellsSplice variantK DB maxReduction of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels by 1 μm DAMGOnmfmol/mg%MOR12.4 ± 0.1742 ± 1238 ± 4MOR1B2.4 ± 0.3200 ± 937 ± 6The K D and B max for the binding of [3H]DAMGO to both splice variants were determined by Scatchard analyses.

Open table in a new tab The K D and B max for the binding of [3H]DAMGO to both splice variants were determined by Scatchard analyses. The effect of 1 μm DAMGO on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values shown are the mean ± S.E. from at least four experiments. Next, we studied the time-course of agonist-induced loss of functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase for MOR1 and MOR1B. Forskolin treatment resulted in a five-fold increase in intracellular cAMP levels as compared with untreated HEK 293 cells. DAMGO inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation by 40% in both MOR1- and MOR1B-expressing cells (Table I). When transfected HEK cells were preincubated with 1 μm DAMGO for extended time periods, a time-dependent loss of coupling efficiency, which was complete after 4 h of agonist exposure, was observed for both receptor isoforms (Fig. 1). However, MOR1 and MOR1B did significantly differ in their time-course of DAMGO-induced desensitization. While the ability of MOR1 to inhibit cAMP accumulation was strongly reduced already after 1 h of DAMGO exposure, the MOR1B-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation was retained for longer time periods (Fig. 1). In wild-type HEK 293 cells, no DAMGO-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was observed (data not shown). To examine the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail in μ opioid receptor internalization, HEK 293 cells expressing MOR1 or MOR1B were treated with 1 μm DAMGO for various time periods, and the number of cell surface binding sites was determined. As depicted in Fig.2, cell surface binding in MOR1-expressing cells was only slightly reduced to 80% during the 4-h agonist exposure. In contrast, in MOR1B-expressing cells the number of binding sites progressively decreased to 40% within 2 h and remained at this level during the rest of the treatment period. To test the possibility that the loss of cell surface binding sites may be due to receptor endocytosis, MOR1- and MOR1B-expressing HEK 293 cells were exposed to 1 μm DAMGO for 0, 10, 30, or 50 min. The culture medium was either not supplemented or supplemented with monensin or sucrose. These cells were subsequently fixed, permeabilized, and fluorescently labeled with antibodies specific for either MOR1 or MOR1B. The subcellular distribution of the receptor proteins was then analyzed by confocal microscopy. The results are depicted in Figs.3, 4, and 5. Fig. 3 (upper panel) shows that, in the absence of DAMGO, MOR1-like immunoreactivity (Li) was mostly present at the level of the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm. After 30 min of agonist exposure, a dramatic loss of MOR1-Li from the plasma membrane with a concomitant accumulation in vesicle-like structures within the cytoplasm was observed. When exposure to DAMGO was continued, MOR1 began to reappear at the plasma membrane while a significant proportion of the receptor remained in the intracellular compartment. When MOR1-expressing cells were cultured in the presence of monensin, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, the receptor progressively accumulated in the cytoplasm and did not redistribute to the plasma membrane during the 50 min of agonist exposure (Fig. 3, middle panel). When sucrose, an inhibitor of clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis, was added to the culture medium, MOR1 internalization was completely blocked (Fig. 3, lower panel).Figure 4Comparison of agonist-induced endocytosis of MOR1 and MOR1B.

Scale bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 compares the rate and extent of MOR1 and MOR1B internalization in the presence of monensin, which blocks receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. The results clearly show that MOR1B internalization proceeds at a faster rate than that of MOR1. While internalization of MOR1 was not complete before 50 min (Fig. 3, middle panel and Fig. 4, upper panel), in most cells, internalization of MOR1B was complete already after 10 min of DAMGO treatment (Fig. 4, lower panel). In addition, we noted that in MOR1B-expressing cells, a significant proportion of receptor-Li was localized in the intracellular compartment even in the absence of DAMGO. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when monensin was added to the culture medium (Fig. 4, lower panel, left micrograph, and Fig. 5). In contrast, MOR1B receptor protein was virtually absent from the cytoplasm when the cells were cultured in the presence of sucrose (Fig.5, right micrograph). These results suggest that the MOR1B receptors are subject to constitutive internalization in the absence of agonist. Monensin effectively trapped internalized receptor proteins in endosomes, resulting in intracellular accumulation of MOR1B-Li. Sucrose prevented internalization of recycled receptor proteins so that MOR1B-Li almost completely disappeared from the cytoplasm. Moreover, binding analyses revealed that addition of the μ opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (12 h before the binding experiment) led to an increase of the B max of only MOR1B but not MOR1 receptor type, supporting the idea of the constitutive internalization of the MOR1B receptor (Fig. 6). To investigate whether desensitization of the μ opioid receptor isoforms is reversible by agonist withdrawal, HEK 293 cells expressing either MOR1 or MOR1B were treated for 4 h with 1 μm DAMGO, and medium was removed followed by an additional agonist-free incubation interval of 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 min and determination of cAMP accumulation. Fig. 7 Areveals that, after complete receptor desensitization, only MOR1B but not MOR1 resensitized during the 20 min of DAMGO withdrawal. In addition, the rapid resensitization of MOR1B was prevented by monensin (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that the faster rate of internalization of MOR1B is associated with accelerated receptor resensitization and that MOR1B reactivation involves redistribution of receptor proteins to the cell surface. To determine to what extent the faster receptor internalization/reactivation of MOR1B contributes to its greater resistance to homologous desensitization compared with MOR1, we carried out desensitization assays as described above except that monensin was included in all incubations. While agonist-induced desensitization of MOR1 did not dramatically change, MOR1B showed very rapid desensitization which was already complete after 2 h of DAMGO exposure (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that the delayed desensitization of MOR1B involves its rapid targeting to the endocytotic machinery which, in turn, promotes accelerated receptor reactivation and recycling. The μ opioid receptor splice variants, MOR1 and MOR1B, markedly differ in their desensitization kinetics when expressed in HEK 293 cells. Both variants share 100% amino acid sequence identity up to amino acid 386 but differ from residue 387 up to the carboxyl terminus (MOR1, 387LENLEAETAPLP398; MOR1B,387KIDLF391). Specifically, MOR1B that lacks threonine 394 appears to be more resistant to agonist-induced desensitization than MOR1. It is therefore very tempting to speculate that MOR1B due to its lack of this threonine may be a bad substrate for phosphorylation by GRKs and, hence, more resistant to agonist-induced desensitization. However, an alternative explanation emerges from our internalization studies showing that MOR1B undergoes faster endocytosis than MOR1. After internalization, receptors will be dephosphorylated, separated from bound ligands and become subject to endosomal sorting either by passing through a process of receptor degradation or being recycled to the cell membrane. Our immunocytochemical analysis revealed, that MOR1 internalization in HEK 293 cells reached a maximum at 30 min of DAMGO preincubation and that after 50 min, receptors seemed to reappear at the cell membrane. In addition, pretreatment of μ opioid receptor expressing HEK 293 cells with the recycling blocker monensin led to a complete internalization of both MOR1B and MOR1 within 50 min of DAMGO treatment. It can be assumed that the fast process of receptor reappearance after agonist-induced internalization is due to receptor recycling and not due to receptor de novo synthesis since studies with other G-protein-coupled receptors showed that cycloheximide did not inhibit fast receptor reappearance at the cell surface (17Wang J.M.

A. 1995; 92: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Previous evidence with the β2-adrenergic receptor suggests that receptor desensitization and internalization are two distinct and independent processes (21Campbell P.T. Hnatowich M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron B.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 192-198PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In fact, blockade of receptor internalization by sucrose does not prevent agonist-induced desensitization (23Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 3202-3211Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Hertel C. Coulter S.J. Perkins J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 12233-12237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that, first of all, functional uncoupling depends on receptor phosphorylation followed by spatial uncoupling involving receptor endocytosis. We suggest a model whereby rapid endocytosis of MOR1B permits accelerated resensitization and recycling of the receptor. This enhanced rate of resensitization of MOR1B compared with MOR1, in turn, confers a greater resistance to agonist-induced desensitization. Several lines of evidence indicate that enhanced resensitization of MOR1B as compared with MOR1 does indeed contribute to its slower time course of desensitization. First, after complete receptor desensitization, only MOR1B but not MOR1 resensitized during 20 min of agonist withdrawal. Second, MOR1B did no longer resensitize when receptor recycling was blocked with monensin. Third, when desensitization assays were carried out in the presence of monensin, the greater resistance of MOR1B to homologous desensitization compared with MOR1 was abolished. Another difference between MOR1 and MOR1B is that in the absence of agonist a significant proportion of the MOR1B receptor protein seems to be constitutively internalized and recycled to the cell surface. This assumption is favored by the fact that MOR1B receptor proteins could be effectively trapped in endosomes by monensin incubation, whereas sucrose treatment prevented constitutive MOR1B internalization (Fig.5). In addition, our binding analysis showed that preincubation with the antagonist naloxone increased only the receptor number in the MOR1B-expressing cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that antagonist treatment inhibits constitutive internalization by stabilizing the receptor in a conformation that prevents exposing a receptor domain critical to directing it into the clathrin-dependent endocytotic pathway. It is thus conceivable that the carboxyl-terminal tail of MOR1B contains an endocytotic sequence motif which facilitates targeting of the receptor protein to the endocytotic machinery. Constitutive internalization has previously been observed with a truncation mutant of the μ opioid receptor that lacks a carboxyl-terminal Ser/Thr-rich domain (354Thr-Ser-Ser-Thr357). When the truncation spared this Ser/Thr-rich domain, constitutive internalization did not occur (26Segredo V. Burford N.T. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2395-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings confirm the complex role of the carboxyl terminus in μ opioid receptor endocytosis. While the Ser/Thr-rich domain (354Thr-Ser-Ser-Thr357) which is shared in both μ opioid receptor splice variants suppresses internalization, the cytoplasmic tail of MOR1B greatly enhances internalization. Internalization results in a loss of membrane binding sites in intact cells. The binding analyses revealed that 40% of the MOR1B receptor sites have disappeared at 30 min of agonist treatment, without markedly affecting functional activity at this time. The simplest explanation for this finding is that only 60% of intact MOR1B receptors are necessary for maximum inhibition of intracellular cAMP formation. The decreasing pool of receptors in the membrane after agonist treatment may then be balanced by receptor recycling after internalization. Surprisingly, after 4 h of DAMGO preincubation, the MOR1 receptor is completely desensitized, whereas nearly 80% residual MOR1 binding sites could be detected in the cell membrane. This indicates, that phosphorylation and uncoupling of the receptor did not automatically induce massive internalization of the receptor and that only a portion of the residual receptor binding sites seem to represent active receptors coupling to intracellular G-proteins. In summary, we have established that receptor internalization and resensitization is differentially affected by the divergent cytoplasmic tails of the μ opioid receptor isoforms, MOR1 and MOR1B. It appears that the sequence motif at the cytoplasmic tail of MOR1B facilitates clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis and, in turn, promotes accelerated receptor reactivation and redistribution. The comparison between MOR1 and MOR1B provides strong evidence that receptor internalization is a primary rate-limiting step for receptor resensitization, and that enhanced resensitization also confers apparent resistance to agonist-induced desensitization. Thus, alternative carboxyl-terminal splicing of G-protein-coupled receptors may be a physiologically relevant mechanism that determines rate and extent of receptor internalization and resensitization.

We determined cell numbers, total nucleic acid, DNA, and RNA contents in both groups every day for a total period of 7 days. Based on all 4 parameters it was evident that growth of mIMCD3 cells is arrested for ~18 h following onset of hyperosmolality. However, none of the parameters measured indicated cell death because of hyperosmolality. Growth curves of hyperosmotic samples were shifted compared with isosmotic samples showing a gap of 18 h but had the same shape otherwise. We demonstrated that at 24 and 48 h after onset of hyperosmolality, but not in isosmotic controls, growth arrest and DNAdamage-inducible (GADD) proteins GADD45 and GADD153 are strongly induced. This result is consistent with growth arrest observed in hyperosmotic medium. We tested if mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascades are involved in osmosignaling that leads to GADD45 and GADD153 induction. Using phosphospecific antibodies we showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK), SAPK1 (JNK), and SAPK2 (p38) are hyperosmotically activated in mIMCD cells. Hyperosmotic GADD45 induction was significantly decreased by 37.5% following inhibition of the SAPK2 pathway, whereas it was significantly increased (65.2%) after inhibition of the ERK pathway. We observed similar, although less pronounced effects of SAPK2 and ERK inhibition on hyperosmotic GADD153 induction. In conclusion, we demonstrate that mIMCD cells arrest growth following hyperosmotic shock, that this causes strong induction of GADD45 and GADD153, that GADD induction is partially dependent on osmosignaling via SAPK2 and ERK, and that SAPK2 and ERK pathways have opposite effects on GADD expression.

Osmotic stress severely compromises functioning of eukaryotic cells, which must maintain homeostasis of inorganic ions as a prerequisite for metabolic processes to proceed properly. When eukaryotic cells are osmotically stressed they generally respond by regulating three functionally distinct sets of proteins. First, molecular chaperones and heat shock proteins are activated to counteract destabilization and unfolding of proteins because of osmotic stress (1Rauchman M.I. Pullman J. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: F9-F17Google Scholar, 2Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Second, enzymes or transmembrane transporters regulating compatible osmolyte levels are activated upon hyperosmotic stress and deactivated upon hyposmotic stress (3Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar, 4Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Compatible organic osmolyte concentrations are regulated such that homeostasis of inorganic ion concentrations after disturbance because of cell volume regulation is reestablished. Third, proteins that define structural and functional aspects of specialized cell types at different osmolalities and certain immediate early genes are tightly regulated by osmotic strength. This is particularly the case in epithelial cells of animals that maintain osmotic homeostasis of their extracellular body fluids (osmoregulators), e.g. mammalian kidney cells (5Gullans S.R. Cohen D.M. Kojima R. Randall J. Brenner B.M. Santos B. Chevaile A. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1678-1681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or teleost gill cells (6Kültz D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1181-C1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kültz D. Somero G.N. J. Comp. Physiol.[B]. 1996; 166: 88-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we asked first if a fourth group of proteins, thegrowth arrest and DNAdamage-inducible (GADD) 1The abbreviations used are: GADD, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mIMCD, murine inner medullary collecting duct; Chaps, 3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DVU, densitometric volume units. gene products, that are commonly induced by stressors such as UV radiation, chemical carcinogens, starvation, etc. are also induced by osmotic stress. These proteins have been shown to be associated with growth arrest and to be involved in DNA damage repair in a variety of cell types (8Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Vos J.-M.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Georgetown, TX1995: 219-237Google Scholar). In vitro approaches have demonstrated strong effects of osmotic stress on DNA structure and function (9Vanden Broeck J. De Loof A. Callaerts P. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Ivanov V.I. Karapetian A.T. Miniat E.E. Sad' Ia Mol. Biol. ( Moscow ). 1993; 27: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 11Douzou P.

Chem. 1995; 57: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the contrary, prior to this study it was unknown whether animal cells are able to arrest their growth and induce GADD expression when exposed to osmotic stress or simply undergo cell death if a certain osmotic threshold is exceeded. Our second objective was to test whether osmosensing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are involved in osmotic regulation of GADD expression. The MAPK family of protein kinases contains many subfamilies of which at least 5 are represented by paralogous isoforms in vertebrates (13Kültz D. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 571-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Two of these MAPK subfamilies (the stress-activated protein kinases SAPK1 = JNK and SAPK2 = p38) display the highest degree of homology to the osmosensing yeast MAPK high osmolarity glycerol kinase 1 (HOG1) and are able to complement ΔHOG1 mutants (14Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 15Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). However, we previously demonstrated that SAPK1 and SAPK2 are not necessary for transducing hyperosmotic stress to the aldose reductase osmotic responsive enhancer element and that osmoregulation of this mammalian enzyme differs in this respect from osmolyte-producing enzymes in yeast (16Kültz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We continued to search for possible targets of MAPK-osmosensing pathways and found that GADD protein expression is at least partially activated by SAPK2 phosphorylation and inhibited by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. A working model explaining these results is presented and the implications of our findings for strategies of cellular adaptation to osmotic stress are discussed. Murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD) cells (17Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of passage numbers 12–16 were used for all experiments. Monolayers were cultured in medium consisting of 45% Hams-F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 45% DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The final osmolality of this medium was 300 ± 5 mosmol/kg water as checked using a freezing point osmometer (μOsmette, Precision Instruments). 10x hyperosmotic medium of 3000 ± 5 mosmol/kg water was prepared by addition of NaCl to regular growth medium. Exposure of mIMCD cells to either iso- or hyperosmotic medium was initiated during all experiments by addition of one-tenth of the total volume of either regular medium or 10x hyperosmotic medium, respectively. Quick mixing with regular medium was achieved by gently swirling the dish. Final osmolality in dishes exposed to hyperosmolality was 600 ± 5 mosmol/kg water as checked using a freezing point osmometer (μOsmette, Precision Instruments). mIMCD cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 during all experiments. mIMCD cells were seeded at a density of 7 × 105 cells in 10-cm dishes and allowed to attach for 6 h. At this time half of the dishes were exposed to hyperosmotic medium while the other half served as isosmotic controls (see above). Cells grown in either of these two different osmotic environments were harvested at the following times after seeding: 6, 30, 54, 78, 102, 126, and 150 h. Cell harvest was achieved by trypsinization (18Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: a Manual of Basic Technique. Wiley-Liss, New York1994Google Scholar). 2 aliquots were used for counting cells in a Neubauer hemocytometer, and the remainder was centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min. The resulting cell pellets were stored frozen at −80 °C. Cell pellets were analyzed for total nucleic acid, DNA, and RNA contents using an assay based on binding of a fluorescent dye to cellular nucleic acids (CyQuant®, Molecular Probes). All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes), and fluorescence intensity was measured with an SLT Fluostar fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan). The excitation wavelength was set at 485 nm, and fluorescence intensity was recorded at an emission wavelength of 538 nm. To prevent targets of SAPK2 and ERK pathways from being activated by hyperosmolality we utilized highly specific inhibitors (19Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 20Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) of SAPK2 (SB 203580, Calbiochem) and MEK (PD98059, Calbiochem). Both compounds were administered 2 h prior to onset of either hyperosmotic or isosmotic conditions to allow for sufficient time for diffusion into cells and complete inhibition. Inhibitors were dissolved in ethanol in the dark to yield 25 mm stock solutions (1000×), which were prepared fresh daily. 8 μl of stock solution was added to 8 ml of medium. Final concentration of both inhibitors was 25 μm. Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline of the same osmolality as medium and lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer per dish. Lysis buffer was prepared fresh and composed as follows: 100 mmol/liter NaF, 50 mmol/liter Tris, 250 μmol/liter thimerosal, 1% v/v igepal, 16 mmol/liter Chaps, 5 mmol/liter activated NaVO4, 50 mg/l Pefabloc® (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter aprotinin, and 100 mg/liter pepstatin A. Cell lysates were scraped off the dishes, transferred to Teflon/glass homogenizers (Wheaton), and homogenized by applying 10 strokes on ice water. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) using a kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) were loaded to each lane of 4–20% acrylamide/Tris/glycine gradient gels. At least one lane per gel was loaded with prestained molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was performed at 125 V constant voltage, and gels were processed by Western blotting immediately following electrophoresis. Gels were rinsed briefly in transfer buffer (composition: 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol) whereafter proteins were blotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) at 1 mA/cm2 constant current for 90 min using a Multiphor II NovaBlot semidry blotting unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were immersed in blocking buffer (composition: 137 mmol/liter NaCl, 20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.6, with HCl, 0.1% v/v Tween-20, 5% w/v nonfat dry milk, 0.02% w/v thimerosal) and kept at 4 °C overnight. Immunodetection procedures were carried out for stress-activated protein kinase 1 (SAPK1 = JNK), stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2 = p38), ERK1 and ERK2, phospho-SAPK1, phospho-SAPK2, phospho-ERK, GADD45, and GADD153. First, blots were incubated for 3 h in primary antibody solution (composition: same as blocking buffer except that nonfat dry milk had been replaced by an equal amount of bovine serum albumin). The following primary antibodies were used: phospho-SAPK1 (New England Biolabs 9251S, 1:2000), phospho-SAPK2 (New England Biolabs 9211S, 1:2000), phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs 9101, 1:2000), SAPK1 (New England Biolabs 9252, 1:2000), SAPK2 (New England Biolabs 9212, 1:2000), ERK (New England Biolabs 9102, 1:2000), GADD45 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-792, 1:10,000), GADD153 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-575, 1:2000). After three 5-min washes in blocking buffer the blots were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody (New England Biolabs 7051–1, goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. After another three 5-min washes in blocking buffer and two additional 5-min washes in blocking buffer devoid of milk the blots were finally incubated for 5 min with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (CDP-Star, New England Biolabs). All incubations except blocking were done at room temperature on a laboratory rotating shaker. Blots developed with ECL reagent were wrapped in plastic wrap, exposed to ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and developed using an automatic film developer (Kodak M-35 X-Omat). Films were scanned using a PDSI-90 densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed with ImageQuant densitometry software (Molecular Dynamics). For each blot an exposure time was chosen that gave good intensity of bands without exceeding the sensitivity of the film. Intensity of individual bands was quantified from an identical area by calculating the densitometric volume of this area and are given as densitometric volume units (DVU). Background correction was set to local median. All values were normalized to a reference band from the same sample that was set 100% on all films. Statistical data analysis was done using StatMost32 software. Time series effects were evaluated by analysis of variance and differences between values within a single series by Student-Newman-Keuls test. Differences between pairs of data (hyper- versus isosmotic) at the same time point were tested for significance by F-test followed by either paired t test or Mann-Whitney test. All experiments were replicated between 4 and 6 times. mIMCD cells arrest their growth after medium osmolality is increased from 300 to 600 mosmol/kg water by addition of NaCl. Cell numbers double during the first day after seeding in isosmotic medium (Fig. 1 A). This initial growth is suppressed by hyperosmolality (Fig. 1 A). Starting from day 5 the difference in cell numbers diminishes because cell monolayers start to reach confluency by this time (Fig. 1 A). The duration of growth arrest was approximately 18 h as illustrated by the magnitude of shift of the growth curve after hyperosmotic exposure. Total nucleic acid content showed the same pattern compared with cell numbers and also illustrated growth arrest after hyperosmotic shock (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the difference in DNA content between iso- and hyperosmotic samples is very small (Fig.1 C), whereas it is very large for RNA content (Fig.1 D). These data suggest that growth of mIMCD cells is arrested in G2 rather than G1 phase. Presumably, DNA replication rate is not strongly affected by hyperosmolality, whereas mitosis is delayed. This is reflected in low abundance of cellular RNA versus DNA (Fig. 1, Cand D). In addition, our data illustrating a strong decrease in RNA content (Fig. 1 D) may reflect an inhibition of transcription by hyperosmolality. Because we were able to demonstrate that mIMCD cells undergo a period of 18 h of growth arrest after hyperosmotic shock we tested if GADD proteins are induced by hyperosmolality. Indeed, we found that two GADD proteins, GADD45 (Fig.2 A) and GADD153 (Fig.2 B), are strongly induced by hyperosmolality. Time courses of induction are depicted for GADD45 (Fig. 2 C) and GADD153 (Fig. 2 D). The levels of GADD45 and GADD153 expression are very low in isosmotic controls and during the first hours following hyperosmotic exposure, but they increase dramatically 24–48 h after onset of hyperosmolality (Fig. 2). Maximum induction of both GADD45 (Fig. 2 C) and GADD153 (Fig. 2 D) was observed at 24 h in cells exposed to hyperosmotic medium. Our next goal was to get insight into osmosensing signal transduction pathways that are responsible for hyperosmotic GADD45 and/or GADD153 induction. To that end we determined time courses of activation of a number of protein kinase cascades that have previously been shown to be important for osmosensing signal transduction. We found that in mIMCD cells, three subfamilies of MAPKs are activated. These include the stress-activated protein kinase 1 (SAPK1 = JNK), SAPK2 (p38), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK). Phosphorylation-mediated hyperosmotic activation of these protein kinases is illustrated in Fig. 3. Hyperosmotic activation of ERK (Fig. 3 A, p42 and p44) was much weaker compared with SAPK1 (Fig. 3 B) and SAPK2 (Fig.3 C). In addition, ERK also showed a considerable amount of constitutive phosphorylation, which was not the case for SAPK1 or SAPK2 (Fig. 3). ERK phosphorylation reached its maximum after 5 min of exposure to hyperosmotic medium (Fig. 3 D), whereas maximal SAPK1 phosphorylation was obtained after 1 h in hyperosmotic medium (Fig. 3 E). Hyperosmotic activation of p54 SAPK1 was slowest (Fig. 3 E) followed by p46 SAPK1 (Fig.3 E). In contrast, the phosphorylation kinetics of SAPK2 (Fig. 3 F) and ERK (Fig. 3 D) was much faster with maximal or near maximal activities achieved already within 5 min of hyperosmotic treatment. Hyperosmotically induced phosphorylation of all three MAPK subfamilies was transient and completely reversed within 6 h of onset of hyperosmotic exposure (Fig. 3). Hyperosmolality did not affect the expression of any of the MAPKs analyzed within a period of 2 days (Fig.4). Therefore changes in the abundance of these kinases can be excluded from being responsible for hyperosmotic induction of GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Interestingly, SAPK2 phosphorylation had an inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation even though activation of both of these MAPKs is hyperosmotically induced (Fig. 5). This cross-talk between SAPK2 and ERK pathways may explain the relatively high variability of phospho-ERK levels following hyperosmotic stress (Fig.3 D).Figure 5Hyperosmotic induction of ERK is increased by inhibition of SAPK2. Panel A depicts data obtained for ERK1 (p44) phosphorylation and panel B for ERK2 (p42) phosphorylation at 30 min following onset of hyperosmotic exposure. The SAPK2-specific inhibitor SB203580 does not affect basal levels of phospho-ERK in isosmotic medium but leads to significantly higher phospho-ERK levels in hyperosmotic medium. Data are given as DVU (see “Experimental Procedures”) and represent means ± S.E.,n = 6. Asterisks symbolize significant effects of SB203580 (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the changes in phosphorylation of ERK and SAPK2 account for the observed induction of GADD proteins, we inhibited ERK and SAPK2 pathways using highly specific pharmacological inhibitors of MEK (specific ERK activator) and SAPK2. Inhibition of SAPK2 resulted in a 37.5% decrease in hyperosmotic GADD45 induction (Fig.6 A) and 19.6% decrease in hyperosmotic GADD153 induction (Fig. 6 B). On the contrary, inhibition of the ERK pathway resulted in further potentiation of hyperosmotic GADD45 induction by 65.2% (Fig. 6 A) and of GADD153 induction by 28.7% (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that hyperosmotic induction of GADD45, and to a lesser degree of GADD153, is positively regulated via SAPK2 and negatively regulated via ERK osmosensing pathways. However, because SB203580 only partially prevented the increase in GADD45 and GADD153 expression, it is clear that additional, as yet unidentified elements, are also involved in hyperosmotic GADD induction. We demonstrate for the first time that hyperosmolality induces growth arrest of animal cells. Growth arrest of mIMCD cells persisting for 18 h appears immediately following exposure to hyperosmolality of 600 mosmol/kg water (+300 mosmol of NaCl). Our data do not indicate any cell death caused by this kind of hyperosmotic stress. However, induction and length of growth arrest clearly depend on the strength of osmotic stress. Sudden change of medium from isosmolality (300 mosmol/kg water) to hyperosmolality of 650 instead of 600 mosmol/kg water causes a significant fraction of mIMCD cells to show clear signs of cell death (data not shown). Osmotically induced growth arrest has been observed in bacteria (22Nystrom T. Neidhardt F.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and yeast (23Boguslawski G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2425-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Brewster J.L. Gustin M.C. Yeast. 1994; 10: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) where it appears to be a necessary component for recovery from osmotic stress. One may speculate that these unicellular organisms as well as mIMCD cells arrest growth in situations of hyperosmotic stress to 1) provide sufficient time for adaptive responses to be activated before undergoing mitosis, and 2) redirect energetic resources from mitotic cell growth to resistance and capacity adaptations that compensate osmotic stress. The time of ~18 h that mIMCD cells are arrested in G2 corresponds to the time required for compatible organic osmolytes to accumulate during hyperosmotic stress (25Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data on RNA and DNA contents in mIMCD cells indicate that hyperosmolality causes G2 arrest. The minor effect of hyperosmolality on cellular DNA content is consistent with relatively undisturbed DNA replication. On the contrary, transcription may be inhibited by hyperosmotic stress as indicated by the large difference in RNA content between populations of cells grown in iso-versus hyperosmotic medium. These findings, taken together with the differences observed in growth rates based on cell numbers, indicate that mIMCD cells proceed through G1 and S phase but are arrested in G2 before starting to divide. Most DNA-damaging agents are known to cause growth arrest in G2suggesting potential DNA damage by hyperosmolality (8Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Vos J.-M.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Georgetown, TX1995: 219-237Google Scholar). G2arrest may have a selective advantage to cells insofar as transcription and overall metabolism are slowed down such that possible osmotic damage may be kept at minimum. Growth arrest has been shown to strongly induce GADD gene products in a variety of cell types (26Fornace A.J.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 27Fornace A.J.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In this study we provide evidence that this paradigm holds true for hyperosmotically stressed mIMCD cells. However, only GADD45 and GADD153 are induced by osmotic stress in mIMCD cells, whereas GADD34 remains unchanged at very low levels (data not shown). Therefore, GADD45/GADD153 and GADD34 are not cooperatively regulated by osmotic stress in mIMCD cells. At present it is unknown at which level (transcriptional, posttranscriptional, or translational) GADD45 and GADD153 are primarily induced in response to osmotic stress. The elements involved in this regulation remain to be elucidated. Currently, the function of GADD proteins is also unknown although GADD153 has been shown to dimerize with and alter the binding capacity of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein transcription factors (28Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 29Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Time courses of GADD45 and GADD153 induction are somewhat stressor-specific, being very rapid (maximum at 1 h, returning to baseline levels within 24 h) in response to DNA-damaging carcinogens and UV radiation (26Fornace A.J.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 27Fornace A.J.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In these cases it has been suggested that growth arrest, often in G1 phase, is a result of GADD induction (30Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace A.J.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 31Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that osmotic stress leads to a much slower but more persistent induction of GADD45 and GADD153 resembling the kinetics observed by medium depletion (32Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace A.J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). By comparing time courses of growth arrest and GADD45/153 induction in IMCD cells it is evident that induction of GADD proteins does not precede G2 arrest in mIMCD cells. Rather, hyperosmotic GADD45/153 induction seems to be a consequence of growth arrest or occur in parallel to growth cessation. The tumor suppressor p53 has also been reported to either induce growth arrest (33Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar) or to be induced as a result of growth arrest (32Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace A.J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) depending on the nature of the stress and cell type. Growth arrest and GADD protein induction were shown to be triggered by a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents, including chemical carcinogens, starvation, hypoxia, UV radiation, and other stresses (8Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Vos J.-M.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Georgetown, TX1995: 219-237Google Scholar). Moreover, GADD153 and GADD45 are specifically involved in DNA damage repair and activated in this capacity via the tumor suppressor p53 (34Zhan Q. Bae I. Kastan M.B. Fornace A.J.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2755-2760PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that osmotic stress leads to DNA damage that in turn triggers growth arrest and GADD45/153 induction as part of a DNA repair mechanism. The time courses of GADD45 and GADD153 induction seem to contradict this notion. These proteins are induced strongest only after mIMCD cells have resumed to grow again (at 24 h). Thus, the need for DNA repair may not be immediate anymore by the time GADD45 and GADD153 are present at highest levels. Alternatively, GADD45/153 may be involved in DNA stabilization at high osmotic strength and/or required for lifting the G2 growth arrest. A variety of in vitro experiments employing different methodologies have convincingly demonstrated strong effects of osmotic strength on DNA structure (10Ivanov V.I. Karapetian A.T. Miniat E.E. Sad' Ia Mol. Biol. ( Moscow ). 1993; 27: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 12Podgornik R. Strey H.H. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 57: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and transcriptional activity (5Gullans S.R. Cohen D.M. Kojima R. Randall J. Brenner B.M. Santos B. Chevaile A. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1678-1681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Vanden Broeck J. De Loof A. Callaerts P. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,11Douzou P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In general, transcription is severely inhibited by deviations from intracellular osmotic homeostasis that is caused by noncompatible osmolytes (9Vanden Broeck J. De Loof A. Callaerts P. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, optimization of transcriptional activity for specific (homeostatic) osmotic conditions may well represent one of the major forces leading to the extraordinary wide phylogenetic conservation of intracellular inorganic ion concentrations. This scenario is supported by our data demonstrating a large difference in RNA content between populations of cells grown in isosmoticversus hyperosmotic medium. However, despite this overall negative effect of hyperosmolality on RNA content, certain genes of particular adaptive value are induced instead of repressed under these conditions. Examples include genes for osmolyte-producing enzymes,e.g. aldose reductase, or osmolyte transporters,e.g. betaine transporter (4Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In some of these genes, specific osmotically or tonicity-responsive enhancer elements have been identified in the 5′-untranslated region, and progress is being made in elucidating the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of these elements (35Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29379-29381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.-Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The adaptive value of these genes lies in the restoration of ionic homeostasis after a disturbance by replacing excessive inorganic ions with compatible osmolytes. The adaptive advantage of GADD45 and GADD153 gene expression may lie in enhanced repair of damaged DNA caused by osmotic fluctuations, but this remains to be confirmed. Alternative functions of GADD proteins may include lifting of G2 growth arrest or stabilization of DNA in unfavorable situations, e.g. during hyperosmotic stress. Similarly, it has been shown that hyperosmotic stress induces molecular chaperones that protect proteins from unfolding and degradation (1Rauchman M.I. Pullman J. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: F9-F17Google Scholar). Presently, it is not known whether osmolyte-producing enzymes and transporters, molecular chaperones, and GADD proteins are all regulated by a similar mechanism operating coordinately in situations of hyperosmotic stress or by multiple strategies. A key question remains how these genes and proteins of adaptive value are induced, whereas the majority of genes and metabolic activity seems to be repressed by osmotic stress. To address this question we analyzed three osmosensing signal-transduction pathways for their potential to confer osmotic regulation of GADD45 and GADD153. The three pathways analyzed are all phosphorylation cascades arranged around a particular MAPK. We chose to evaluate the ERK pathway, the SAPK1 (JNK) pathway, and the SAPK2 (p38) pathway for their potential to signal GADD45 and/or GADD153 induction. Our results demonstrate that all three pathways are hyperosmotically activated in mIMCD cells, which is consistent with an independent study published recently (37Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F305-F311PubMed Google Scholar). We find that differences in the kinetics of hyperosmotic activation of ERK, SAPK1, and SAPK2 exist and that activation of all three MAPK pathways was exclusively because of phosphorylation without a change in the number of kinases present. Activation kinetics was very fast for SAPK2 and ERK, and slower for SAPK1. In contrast to SAPKs, constitutive levels of phospho-ERK are significant and do not increase much after exposing mIMCD cells to hyperosmotic medium. A negative feedback mechanism might explain the early maximum and rather large fluctuations in phospho-ERK levels observed after hyperosmotic shock. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that SAPK2 activation leads to activation of a MAPK phosphatase (MKP1), which specifically dephosphorylates ERK (38Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the betaine transporter gene is a target of SAPK2 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (39Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, we previously demonstrated that SAPK-osmosensing pathways in rabbit PAP-HT25 cells do not target the osmotic responsive enhancer element of the aldose reductase gene (16Kültz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that osmolyte transporter genes are not regulated via the ERK pathway (40Kwon H.M. Itoh T. Rim J.S. Handler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or the SAPK1 pathway (41Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Siriwardana G. Berl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 800-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in other potential targets of MAPK-osmosensing pathways in mammalian kidney cells and tested if GADD45 and GADD153 are osmotically regulated via SAPK2 or ERK phosphorylation cascades. We find that GADD45/153 expression is positively regulated by the SAPK2 and negatively regulated by the ERK pathways (Fig. 6). The physiological significance of negative feedback regulation of phospho-ERK levels may lie in conferring signal specificity and/or to reinforce the positive effect of SAPK2 phosphorylation on GADD expression by minimizing negative effects of phospho-ERK. Because inhibition of SAPK2 only partially diminishes hyperosmotic induction of GADD proteins, other pathways are likely to be involved. One candidate is the SAPK1 (JNK) pathway, which has been shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation (42Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), apoptosis (43Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.F. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and p53 phosphorylation (44Adler V. Pincus M.R. Minamoto T. Fuchs S.Y. Bluth M.J. Brandtrauf P.W. Friedman F.K. Robinson C. Chen J.M. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of SAPK1 was not readily available and a negative dominant mutant of SEK1 (MKK4) could not be employed for these studies because of side effects of the transfection procedure on GADD45 and GADD153 expression in mIMCD cells. Our current working hypothesis summarizing events leading to hyperosmotic GADD45/GADD153 induction is depicted in Fig. 7. Hyperosmolality activates SAPK2 and ERK very rapidly (within minutes) and also causes mIMCD cells to arrest their growth very rapidly. This growth arrest lasts for about 18 h. Growth arrest in G2 may be either a direct consequence of hyperosmotic inactivation of molecular components required for mitosis, or it may be mediated by SAPK1, SAPK2, ERK, or other, as yet unknown, pathways. GADD45 and GADD153 are only expressed at highest levels at the time when cells start to divide and overcome the growth arrest (24–48 h after onset of hyperosmotic stress). Induction of GADD45 and GADD153 is at least in part mediated via the SAPK2 pathway. SAPK2 reinforces its positive effect on GADD induction by inhibiting the ERK pathway, which suppresses GADD45 and GADD153 induction after hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 7). This negative feedback may be mediated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase, which specifically dephosphorylates ERK, e.g.via mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1. Additional pathways are involved in hyperosmotic GADD45/153 induction. Potential candidates are SAPK1 and p53-dependent pathways. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hyperosmolality induces growth arrest in murine kidney (mIMCD) cells and that this apparently triggers a late induction of GADD45 and GADD153. Hyperosmotic induction of GADD45 and GADD153 is partially conferred via the SAPK2 osmosensing pathway and negatively regulated by the ERK pathway. These results stimulate further research addressing the nature of DNA-damage resulting from osmotic stress and the integration of molecular messengers in response to hyperosmolality."

Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), whereas the hyperphosphorylated polymerase II (IIO) has been observed in productive elongation (11Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6693-6698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of the CTD is controlled by the action of kinases and phosphatases (9Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Struct. Expr. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DmP-TEFb has been identified as a kinase with subunits of 124 and 43 kDa that can phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of P-TEFb is very sensitive to the purine analog DRB (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Consistently, the transition from abortive to productive elongation can be inhibited by DRB in vitroand in vivo (4Yamaguchi, K., Wada, T., and Handa, H. (1997) Genes to Cells, in pressGoogle Scholar). The 43-kDa subunit of DmP-TEFb was cloned and found to be similar to Cdc2, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) (13Zhu Y.R. Peery T. Peng J.M. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Most known CDKs play a role in regulating the cell cycle, but some CDKs have been found to be involved in other cellular events (14Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). A CDK can be activated by binding of a cyclin and phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T-loop of the catalytic subunit. Conversely, a CDK·cyclin complex can be inactivated by phosphorylation of a threonine residue and a tyrosine residue near the ATP binding site or by binding of a family of small proteins termed CKIs (14Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunits are well conserved in the CDK family, but the cyclins are not conserved except for the cyclin box that is predicted as a helix-rich structure (15Bazan J.F. Proteins. 1996; 24: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We show here that DrosophilaP-TEFb is composed of a CDK·cyclin pair. Drosophila P-TEFb was purified as described (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The large subunit was excised from an SDS gel and used for peptide sequencing (Keck Facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Based on the peptide sequences, three degenerate primers were designed to clone a 1.6-kb cDNA fragment with nested PCR reactions. First, a 35-cycle PCR reaction was performed using Taq DNA polymerase, two degenerate primers (5′-GGAATTCTGGTAYTTYWSNAAYGA and 5′-CGGGATCCTGYTCRAANGGNGGCAT), and Drosophila embryonic cDNA from CLONTECH as a template. Second, a 1.6-kb cDNA fragment was amplified in another 35-cycle PCR reaction using the total PCR products above as template, and the primer (5′-GGAATTCTGGTAYTTYWSNAAYGA) and a nested primer (5′-CGGGATCCAANGGNGGCATNCCRT). Third, this 1.6-kb fragment was digested into three fragments of 0.9, 0.6, and 0.1 kb. The 0.9- and 0.6-kb fragments were cloned into the Bluescript II SK+vector (Stratagene). A 1.5-kb cDNA fragment sequence was obtained by combining the 0.9- and 0.6-kb fragments. The 3′ region of the full-length cDNA sequence was obtained using a Life Technologies, Inc. 3′ RACE kit with three gene specific primers based on the 1.5-kb sequence (5′-ATCACGACACCACCAGAGCTGTTA, 5′-CGAATTCAGATCGTGAACGGGA and 5′-CGAATTCAGGCGCTAGCAATG). The 5′ region of cDNA sequence was obtained using a Life Technologies, Inc. 5′ RACE kit with three gene-specific primers (5′-GAAAGGCGTAGAACCGA, 5′-GCTGACCCATTTCCTGTATCAGATAG and 5′-GGAATTCTTCTGCTTGGCGAAT). The entire coding sequence of the large subunit was cloned by reverse transcription PCR. First, the cDNA of the large subunit was generated in a reverse transcription using a primer (5′-GGGAATTCGAGGTTCTATACATAT) and Drosophila embryonic mRNA. Second, a 4-kb cDNA fragment containing the coding sequence was produced in a 35-cycle PCR reaction using Expand polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), two primers (5′-CTGTGTGAATGGAATCTGTGATGTG and 5′-GGGAATTCGAGGTTCTATACATAT), and the cDNA as template. Third, the 3.3-kb encoding sequence was amplified in another PCR reaction using Vent DNA polymerase, the 4-kb fragment as template and two primers (5′-TATCCCGGGTCATATGAGTCTCCTAGCC and 5′-GGGAATTCGAGGTTCTATACATAT). Finally, the coding sequence was digested with SmaI and EcoRI and cloned into a pET21a-GST vector (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) to produce pET21a-GST-Dmcyclin T. The coding region of the small subunit of Drosophila P-TEFb (DmCDK9) was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and cloned into a pET21a-GST vector to generate pET21a-GST-DmCDK9. The DmCDK9 coding region was amplified by Vent DNA polymerase using pET21a-GST-DmCDK9 as template and two primers (5′-GAATGCCCGGGATAAATATGGCGCACATGTCCCA and 5′-ATCCCACCTCGAGCCAAACCCGGTCAATCAT). The amplified 1.2-kb fragment was digested with XmaI and XhoI and cloned into the pBAC4X-1 (Novagen) to generate a plasmid (pBAC-DmCDK9) for expression of a His-tagged DmCDK9. The coding region of Dmcyclin T was amplified by Vent DNA polymerase using pET21a-GST-Dmcyclin T as template and two primers (5′-GCTCTAGATAAATATGAGTCTCCTAGCC and 5′-GGGAATTCGAGGTTCTATACATAT). The PCR product was digested withXbaI and EcoRI and cloned into pBAC-DmCDK9 to generate a plasmid (pBAC-DmP-TEFb) for co-expression of Dmcyclin T and DmCDK9. To make the kinase knockout of DmCDK9 the same mutation used to knockout the kinase activity of the human homologue, PITALRE (D199N) was used (16Garriga J. Mayol X. Grana X. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to theCLONTECH manual (Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit) using a selection primer (5′-CTCAGGTCTAGCTGGGATATCGAGGTTCTATAC), a mutagenic primer (5′-GGCATCTTAAAGCTGGCTAATTTTGGCTTGGCCCGTGC), and pBAC-DmP-TEFb as the target plasmid. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Because extra mutations in the plasmid could have been generated, a short sequence containing the mutation site was cut from the mutated plasmid and recloned into the original plasmid, yielding a mutated plasmid pBAC-DmCDK9 (D199N)-Dmcyclin T. To generate the C-terminal truncations of Dmcyclin T, pBAC-DmP-TEFb was digested with EcoRV and EcoRI followed by filling in of the cohesive ends and religation to generate pBAC-DmCDK9-Dmcyclin T (1–543). The plasmid pBAC-DmCDK9-Dmcyclin T (1–714) was made in the same way except that PpuMI and EcoRI sites were used. Five plasmids, pBAC-DmCDK9, pBAC-DmP-TEFb, pBAC-DmCDK9 (D199N)-Dmcyclin T, pBAC-DmCDK9-Dmcyclin T (1–543), and pBAC-DmCDK9-Dmcyclin T (1–714), were used to cotransfect Sf9 cells with BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen) to generate recombinant baculoviruses. After 5 days, recombinant viruses were harvested and amplified again. The optimal level of the baculoviruses for expression was determined by an end point dilution assay. To express the recombinant proteins, Sf9 cells (5 × 108 in 10 flasks of 150 cm2) were infected with the baculovirus, incubated for 2–3 days, and harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended into 9 ml of a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% of a saturated solution of PMSF in isopropanol and other protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and antipain at 0.5 μg/ml), incubated on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was supplemented with NaCl to 0.5 m and imidazole to 5 mm followed by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h. A 0.4-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) was loaded with the clarified supernatant, washed with 20 ml of a wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and PMSF), and eluted with 2 ml of an elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, and PMSF). The eluted fraction was diluted by HGEDP (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and PMSF) so that the final salt concentration was equivalent to that in 80 mm HGKEDP (HGEDP with 80 mm KCl). The diluted fraction was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column. Recombinant protein flowed through the Mono Q and was directly loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column. Proteins bound to the Mono S were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 m to 0.5 m HGKEDP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Different proteins eluted at different salt concentrations: DmCDK9, 110–160 mm; DmP-TEFb, 240–300 mm; DmCDK9 (D199N)/Dmcyclin T, 240–300 mm; DmCDK9/Dmcyclin T (1–543), 160–210 mm; and DmCDK9/Dmcyclin T (1–714), 140–190 mm. All procedures of purification were performed at 4 °C unless indicated. The protein concentration of CDK9 (D199N)/cyclin T was measured using a Bio-Rad assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Concentrations of other proteins were determined by comparing the CDK9 subunit on silver-stained gels using CDK9 (D199N)/cyclin T as a standard. Although the comparisons are fairly precise, the absolute amount of the proteins could be inaccurate due to differences in response of CDK9 (D199N)/cyclin T and bovine serum albumin to the detection reagent. The assay was performed as described (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Purified Drosophila RNA polymerase II (about 10 ng) was incubated with kinase samples in a 20-μl reaction including 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 55 mm KCl, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) at 23 °C for 5 min unless indicated. Reactions were terminated by SDS loading buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and autoradiography. Recombinant GST-Dmcyclin T(CT) fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli using a T7 polymerase-dependent expression system. Plasmid pET21a-GST-Dmcyclin T was cut with BamHI and religated to generate a plasmid (pET21a-GST-Dmcyclin T(CT)). The GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of Dmcyclin T (Gly550 to Lys1097) was expressed in DE3 cells, purified using a glutathione affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then used to immunize rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm). Dry protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) beads were swollen in water, washed with 150 mm HGKEDPB (HGKEDP buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated with either preimmune serum or anti-serum for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were spun down, washed with a wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.6 m KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100) followed by 150 mm HGKEDPB, and then packed into three columns. Kc cell nuclear extract (KcN in 150 mm HGKEDP) was passed over the three columns in succession. The flowthrough of the third column was used as depleted KcN. Transcription assay was carried out using a continuous labeling procedure (7Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The actin Act5C template linearized with HpaI (15 μg/ml) giving a 520-nucleotide runoff transcript was used. Transcription reactions (15 μl) contained either KcN or depleted KcN, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 55 mmKCl, 600 μm each of ATP, GTP, and UTP, 30 μm CTP, and 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP and were incubated at 23 °C for 20 min. P-TEFb proteins and DRB were included as indicated. Labeled transcripts were analyzed on 6% denaturing gels. To advance our understanding of the function of P-TEFb as a CTD kinase controlling the elongation phase of transcription, it was necessary to obtain cDNAs encoding the two subunits. We recently cloned a cDNA encoding the small subunit and found that it was a kinase that might require a cyclin subunit for activity (13Zhu Y.R. Peery T. Peng J.M. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Our next goal was to clone the large subunit, determine if it had homology to other cyclins, and generate recombinant P-TEFb by co-expressing both subunits. We cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the large subunit ofDrosophila P-TEFb from sequence information obtained from the pure protein. The large subunit from purified P-TEFb was excised from an SDS gel and subjected to a peptide sequencing protocol. Based on the peptide sequence information, we cloned a 4.3-kb cDNA fromDrosophila embryonic mRNA (Fig.1). The open reading frame was determined by knowing the size of P-TEFb large subunit and by finding a consensus sequence for the translational start site (17Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes a 118-kDa protein (1097 amino acids) with an isoelectric point of 9.5 and a putative nuclear localization signal from amino acids 872–876 (18Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region is relatively long, and the 3′-untranslated region is terminated by a poly(A) tail. Northern analysis indicated embryonic and adult flies contained mRNAs 5, 5.5, and 7 kb in length (data not shown). Comparison of the new Drosophila sequence to those in the data bases using a Blast search (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70693) Google Scholar) indicated that the amino-terminal region had highest similarity to Drosophila cyclin C (20Lahue E.E. Smith A.V. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and cyclin H 2K. Barrier and Y. Xiong, unpublished data. proteins. Although the amino-terminal region of the large subunit of DmP-TEFb showed only 14% identity to that of cyclin C and 12% identity to that of cyclin H, it is predicted to have two 5-helix folds (Fig.2) that are conserved in cyclin proteins (15Bazan J.F. Proteins. 1996; 24: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The cyclin-CDK interaction is partly dictated by the first cyclin fold in which helix 3 forms the hydrophobic core as illustrated by the crystal structure of cyclin A and CDK2 (21Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The first five helices, especially helix 3, are the most conserved sequences in the cyclin box of the large subunit of DmP-TEFb. The carboxyl terminus of the large subunit of Drosophila P-TEFb did not show high similarity to any other protein in the data bases. All these data suggest that the large subunit is a novel cyclin that we name cyclin T. Because the kinase subunit of P-TEFb associates with a cyclin subunit and shows similarity to other cyclin-dependent kinases, we call it CDK9. cDNAs encoding both subunits of P-TEFb were co-expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig.3 A), and recombinantDrosophila P-TEFb (rDmP-TEFb) was purified using a nickel column followed by Mono Q and Mono S. Both subunits were retained on the nickel column even though only the small subunit was tagged. Both proteins co-eluted from Mono S at the identical salt concentration at which native P-TEFb eluted. These results demonstrate a strong interaction between the two recombinant proteins. On a polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3 B), the cyclin T subunit of rDmP-TEFb (lane a) had the same mobility as the large subunit of purified native DmP-TEFb (lane S). The CDK9 subunit of rDmP-TEFb had a slightly lower mobility compared with that of native DmP-TEFb due to the presence of the His tag. These results further support our hypothesis that the cDNAs encode the subunits ofDrosophila P-TEFb. The DmP-TEFb possesses a CTD kinase activity that is very sensitive to DRB (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). To examine the kinase activity of rDmP-TEFb,Drosophila RNA polymerase II was incubated with increasing amounts of either native DmP-TEFb or rDmP-TEFb in the presence of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min. The reactions were analyzed by 6–15% SDS-PAGE. The protein gel was silver-stained (Fig. 4 A) and then subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 4 B). As expected, increasing the amount of native DmP-TEFb increased the fraction of the hyperphosphorylated IIO form of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II as well as the total amount of label incorporated into the IIO form. The activity of rDmP-TEFb was indistinguishable from that of native DmP-TEFb. The sensitivity of rDmP-TEFb to DRB was compared with that of native DmP-TEFb using a similar assay. The radioactivity incorporated into the large subunit of RNA polymerase II was quantitated, normalized to the no DRB point (100%), and plotted (Fig. 4 C). The 50% inhibition point of rDmP-TEFb (0.5 μm) was similar to that of DmP-TEFb (0.7 μm). To analyze the function of rDmP-TEFb in elongation control, it was first necessary to generate a P-TEFb-dependent transcription system. P-TEFb allows the generation of long DRB-sensitive transcripts (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and in a human transcription system depletion of P-TEFb eliminated DRB-sensitive transcription (13Zhu Y.R. Peery T. Peng J.M. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). To deplete DmP-TEFb from Kc cell nuclear extract (KcN), we first needed to produce antibodies toDrosophila P-TEFb. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal half of the cyclin T subunit was used to immunize rabbits. A Western blot indicated that the resulting antiserum recognized both the native and recombinant DmP-TEFb (Fig. 5 A), providing further evidence that we had cloned the large subunit of DmP-TEFb. Moreover, the antibodies in the antiserum, but not in the preimmune serum, were able to deplete the cyclin subunit of DmP-TEFb (Fig. 5 A). The depleted KcN was characterized and then used to compare the activity of rDmP-TEFb to the native factor (Fig. 5 B). The starting extract as well as the preimmune depleted extract both exhibited DRB-sensitive runoff transcripts indicative of the function of P-TEFb. Depletion of DmP-TEFb decreased these runoff transcripts. As was found in the human transcription system (13Zhu Y.R. Peery T. Peng J.M. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), depletion of P-TEFb did not deplete other factors needed to generate DRB-sensitive transcription. Addition of increasing amounts of native DmP-TEFb to the depleted extract restored the appearance of runoff transcripts to levels higher than that observed with the low level of endogenous P-TEFb in the starting extract. As expected, the runoff transcripts stimulated by DmP-TEFb were sensitive to DRB. Incomplete inhibition by DRB was likely due to the saturating amount of P-TEFb being added (see Fig. 7). The recombinant DmP-TEFb gave identical results to native DmP-TEFb, demonstrating that it was fully functional in transcription. To begin to elucidate the role of the cyclin subunit and to determine the requirement of the kinase activity, recombinant proteins containing various mutations were generated (Fig.3). The proteins were produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and then purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Recombinant proteins included a kinase knockout, CDK9 alone, and two CDK9/cyclin pairs in which portions of the carboxyl-terminal region of the cyclin subunit were deleted. In each case, the CDK9 subunit was His tagged, and as long as the cyclin subunit contained an intact cyclin box, it associated strongly with the kinase subunit. This was also found with another construct that contained only amino acids 1–348 of the cyclin subunit; however, this construct was not included in this analysis because of the low expression level (data not shown). The recombinant proteins were examined for their ability to phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II (Fig.6 A) as well as their ability to function during transcription (Fig. 6 B). CDK9 alone had no activity in either assay, demonstrating that, indeed, its activity is cyclin dependent. The kinase knockout mutant also had no activity in either assay, demonstrating that the function of DmP-TEFb is through its ability to carry out phosphorylation. Deletion of the unique carboxyl-terminal domain of cyclin T caused a dramatic reduction in both activities measured. The two cyclin T truncation mutants gave only 10–20% of the kinase activity seen with the intact protein, and this reduction was quantitatively mirrored in the transcription assay. An unusual feature of the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by the two truncation mutants was that the shift from IIA to IIO did not occur as readily. DmP-TEFb has been shown to preferentially phosphorylate a CTD that has already been phosphorylated (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), and at low levels of the kinase this leads to the hyperphosphorylation of a subset of the polymerases (see Fig. 4 A). Evidently, the carboxyl-terminal region of cyclin T is responsible for this preferential phosphorylation of the partially phosphorylated polymerase molecules. To better compare the transcriptional activity of the two cyclin truncation mutants with intact DmP-TEFb, a wider range of kinase concentrations was titrated (Fig. 7). We were especially interested in determining if higher levels of the truncation mutants could compensate for their lower kinase activity or if they were in some other way defective. Intact DmP-TEFb functioned as expected, giving rise to a high level of runoff transcripts. Comparison of the amount of runoff at intermediate levels of intact DmP-TEFb (4× to 16×) indicated that addition of 2-fold more kinase had an effect greater than 2-fold (Fig. 7 B). A different result was obtained with the two truncation mutants. Neither showed the effect seen at intermediate levels of intact DmP-TEFb (Fig. 7). Even though very high levels were used, the effect of both truncation mutants saturated before reaching the high level of runoff seen with the intact protein (Fig. 7 B). We conclude that the carboxyl-terminal region of cyclin T is important for the function of P-TEFb in transcription. Others have implicated the kinase activity of TFIIH in CTD phosphorylation (22Akoulitchev S. Makela T.P. Weinberg R.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1995; 377: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and in elongation control (23Yankulov K.Y. Pandes M. McCracken S. Bouchard D. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine if the CDK-activating kinase associated with TFIIH could affect the CTD kinase activity of P-TEFb. Kinase reactions were set up with RNA polymerase II as substrate, limiting amounts of P-TEFb or lower levels of DrosophilaTFIIH. As expected, CTD phosphorylation by P-TEFb but not TFIIH was sensitive to DRB (Fig. 8). In reactions containing both kinases, the signals were apparently the sum of the two activities. The phosphorylation of cyclin T (Fig. 8) and CDK9 (data not shown) was also unaffected by the presence of TFIIH. This suggests that neither kinase has a dramatic effect on the other. We have completed the cloning of cDNAs encodingDrosophila P-TEFb, a novel CDK/cyclin pair and we name the subunits CDK9 and cyclin T. Cytogenetic mapping was performed, and we found that the CDK9 and cyclin T mapped to 58F and 74EF, respectively (data not shown). A number of mutations including lethal mutations also map to these areas. We produced fully functional recombinant DmP-TEFb. Furthermore, we showed that the cyclin subunit was required to activate the kinase and that the carboxyl-terminal region of cyclin T was important in this activation. Finally, we found that TFIIH did not affect the ability of P-TEFb to phosphorylate the CTD of pure RNA polymerase II. Our results here coupled with earlier results suggest that DmP-TEFb is not part of a larger complex and does not stably associate with RNA polymerase II or the elongation complex (2Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Depletion of DmP-TEFb even under low salt conditions did not remove other required factors because addition of pure DmP-TEFb was able to restore DRB-sensitive transcription. It is possible that other required factors are in excess over the DmP-TEFb. We do not believe this is the case because when the kinase knockout mutant was added in more than 10-fold excess over the wild type kinase, no reduction in kinase activity or DRB-sensitive transcription was observed (data not shown). Consistent with this, we have not been able to detect more than one chromatographic form of DmP-TEFb. DmP-TEFb must interact at least briefly with the polymerase to carry out phosphorylation, and this transient interaction may be enhanced by the positive charge of the carboxyl-terminal region of cyclin T. This could explain why DmP-TEFb preferentially phosphorylated a CTD that was already partially phosphorylated (3Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). When the CTD is partially phosphorylated, it contains more negative charge and might interact more strongly with the positively charged region of cyclin T. Removal of this region decreased the kinase activity. The timing of phosphorylation of the polymerase in an early elongation complex is important because of the termination activity of factor 2 (5Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Essentially, there is a functional competition between factor 2 and P-TEFb. During a short period of time after initiation, P-TEFb must phosphorylate the CTD to an appropriate extent to cause the transition into productive elongation. Otherwise factor 2 will cause premature termination. This may be why the cyclin mutants lacking the carboxyl-terminal region were able to generate only low levels of runoff transcripts. The reduced ability of the cyclin mutants to recognize partially phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in an early elongation complex would lead to a reduced rate of phosphorylation and, therefore, ultimately a reduced number of hyperphosphorylated polymerases that generate runoff. As a cyclin-dependent kinase, P-TEFb is likely to be activated by phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit. The TFIIH-associated kinase is a CDK-activating kinase termed CDK7 that has been shown to activate CDC2, CDK2, and CDK4 (14Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). TFIIH has also been shown to function in transcription elongation (23Yankulov K.Y. Pandes M. McCracken S. Bouchard D. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that TFIIH plays a role in activating P-TEFb, our results do not support this hypothesis. Using pure RNA polymerase II as a substrate, TFIIH had no effect on the kinase activity of P-TEFb. It is possible that in the context of transcription with other factors involved, TFIIH might play a role in activating P-TEFb. It is also possible that P-TEFb purified from eucaryotic cells is already activated. Further work in vitro and in vivo will be required to understand how P-TEFb activity is regulated.

https://openalex.org/W1991498982,"Recently, it has been reported that cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from <i>Escherichia coli</i>induces formation of stress fibers by deamidation of glutamine 63 of RhoA (Schmidt, G., Sehr, P., Wilm, M., Selzer, J., Mann, M., and Aktories, K. (1997) <i>Nature</i> 387, 725–729); Flatau, G., Lemichez, E., Gauthier, M., Chardin, P., Paris, S., Fiorentini, C., and Boquet, P. (1997) <i>Nature</i> 387, 729–733). By using mass spectrometric analysis, we show now that the toxin transfers ethylenediamine, putrescine, and dansylcadaverine specifically onto glutamine 63 of RhoA. RhoA was also a substrate for guinea pig liver transglutaminase, which modified not only glutamine 63, but also glutamine residues at positions 52 and 136. Treatment of the fully active N-terminal fragment of CNF1 (amino acid residues 709–1014) with iodoacetamide inhibited both deamidation and transglutamination activities. Moreover, exchange of cysteine 866 with serine blocked the enzyme activity of the N-terminal CNF1 fragment. In addition, we identified histidine 881 to be essential for the enzyme activity of CNF1. The data indicate that CNF1 shares a catalytic dyad of cysteine and histidine residues with eukaryotic transglutaminases and cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2011739619,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of the major platelet integrin αIIbβ3 has been shown to occur during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (1Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We now show that a wide variety of platelet stimuli induced β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, but that this phosphorylation occurred only following platelet aggregation. Several lines of evidence suggest that the β3 cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues and/or their phosphorylation function to mediate interactions between β3 integrins and cytoskeletal proteins. First, phospho-β3 was retained preferentially in a Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeletal fraction of thrombin-aggregated platelets. Second, in vitro experiments show that the cytoskeletal protein, myosin, associated in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner with a diphosphorylated peptide corresponding to residues 740–762 of β3. Third, mutation of both tyrosines in the β3 cytoplasmic domain to phenylalanines markedly reduced β3-dependent fibrin clot retraction. Thus, our data indicate that platelet aggregation is both necessary and sufficient for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this phosphorylation results in the physical linkage of αIIbβ3 to the cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that this linkage may involve direct binding of the phosphorylated integrin to the contractile protein myosin in order to mediate transmission of force to the fibrin clot during the process of clot retraction. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of the major platelet integrin αIIbβ3 has been shown to occur during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (1Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J.

We hypothesize that this linkage may involve direct binding of the phosphorylated integrin to the contractile protein myosin in order to mediate transmission of force to the fibrin clot during the process of clot retraction. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeletal/contractile apparatus within a cell (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). These cytoskeletal linkages are characteristically induced by integrin clustering that can occur by the binding of multivalent or immobilized extracellular ligands, often resulting in the assembly of “focal contacts” in cultured cells. Several cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. talin, actin binding protein, α-actinin) directly bind to integrin cytoplasmic domains (3Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 4Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), indicating that integrins may interact by multiple mechanisms for focal contact assembly. Focal contact assembly is often followed by signal transduction events such as induction of gene transcription (7Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) and prevention of apoptosis (8Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 9Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar), regulating a diversity of cellular functions from embryonic development to hemostasis (10Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Although cytoskeletal and signaling proteins have been identified which bind integrin cytoplasmic domains, major unsolved questions persist. For example, what is the identity of the proteins responsible for the initial interactions of integrins with the cytoskeletal structures? How are these interactions regulated? In this regard, it is relevant to the present study that focal contacts are major sites for protein tyrosine phosphorylation, one of the earliest signaling events observed upon integrin ligation (11Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On platelets, the interaction of the integrin αIIbβ3 with its adhesive ligands, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor leads to platelet aggregation and association of αIIbβ3 with the cytoskeleton (12Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, platelet aggregation is the desired response to external trauma, allowing for hemostasis. However, inappropriate platelet aggregation does occur, as in ruptured artherosclerotic plaques, resulting in the formation of occlusive thrombi leading to myocardial infarction or thrombolytic stroke (14Davies M.J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The importance of αIIbβ3-mediated events in both hemostasis and thrombosis is underscored in two ways. First, patients who lack, or have mutated, αIIbβ3, a condition known as Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, have a bleeding disorder that arises from the failure of the platelets to aggregate (15George J.N. Caen J.P. Nurden A.T. Blood. 1990; 75: 1383-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, clinical trials have shown that antagonists for αIIbβ3 ligand binding are effective antithrombotics (16Lefkovits J. Topol E.J. Eur. Heart. J. 1996; 17: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3 is involved in both “inside-out” and “outside-in” signaling pathways during platelet aggregation (12Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In order to bind soluble forms of its adhesive protein ligands, αIIbβ3 on resting platelets has to undergo a conformational change. This process, the consequence of “inside-out” αIIbβ3 signaling, occurs when agonists such as ADP or thrombin activate platelets. Binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor to αIIbβ3 induces platelet aggregation and αIIbβ3 clustering: the signals transduced by this process are referred to as “outside-in” signaling events. The cytoplasmic domains of the integrin are thought to play a critical role in these signaling events (17Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Ylanne J. Huuskonen J. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Virtanen I. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, platelet aggregation induces the direct interaction of αIIbβ3 with the cytoskeleton (21Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Edwards H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 22Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoskeletal proteins talin and α-actinin have been found to act directly with αIIbβ3 (4Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Along with αIIbβ3, many other intracellular proteins, including Src and FAK, redistribute to the cytoskeleton of aggregated platelets (22Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In these ways, the integrin may play a direct role not only in organizing the cytoskeleton but also in transducing signals to elicit cellular responses. Although it is clear that the cytoplasmic domains of αIIbβ3 are involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal reorganization events, the precise mechanisms regulating these processes remain to be discovered. Previously, we showed that tyrosine phosporylation of β3occurs upon thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, indicating a potential role for integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling (1Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we observed that the signaling adaptor proteins SHC and Grb2 interacted with peptides corresponding to the tyrosine phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of β3 (1Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The present study shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 is a unifying event of platelet aggregation and provides in vitroevidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of this integrin subunit may direct its binding to myosin, a specific element contained within the platelet cytoskeleton.

Anti-human β3 monoclonal antibody C3a.19.5, which recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of the β3 subunit, was described previously (1Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol.

See-blue molecular mass standards were purchased from Novex. Blood from healthy volunteers was drawn on the day of use, and washed platelets were prepared as described previously (28Fox J.E. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except 0.6 units/ml apyrase and 50 ng/ml prostaglandin I2 (final concentrations) were present in the collecting solution. Before stimulation, the platelets (~4–8 × 108/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Tyrodes-HEPES buffer (12 mmNaHCO3, 138 mmNaCl, 5.5 mmglucose, 2.9 mmKCl, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2) unless otherwise stated. Platelet samples of 0.5 ml were then stirred at 37 °C in a whole blood lumiaggregometer, and various agonists and conditions were examined. When platelet lysates were not prepared, 4× nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer containing vanadate (37 mmTris, pH 6.8, 11.8% (v/v) glycerol, 2.36% (w/v) SDS, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue (final concentration)) was added immediately after aggregation, and samples were boiled for 5 min. For two-dimensional gel analysis of detergent-soluble and cytoskeletal fractions, platelets were lysed immediately after aggregation by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 2× Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mmNaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.0, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mmethyleneglycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmleupeptin, 4 mmsodium orthovanadate, 2 mmbenzamidine, 0.27 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate (final concentrations)). The lysate was then centrifuged for 6 min at 15,000 × g to remove the Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeletons formed during aggregation (22Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant was reserved and 100 μl of 2× RIPA buffer (see below) was added to the pellet and sonicated for 20 min at room temperature in a Branson 5120 Sonicator to resolubilize the pellet. Nonreducing sample buffer (as described above) was added to each of the samples (supernatant and resolubilized pellet) and boiled for 5 min. For ligand blot analysis, platelets were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 mmethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, 20 mmTris pH 7.5, 5 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 75 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin (final concentrations)). For resolution of detergent soluble from cytoskeletal fractions for ligand blots, platelets were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 137 mmNaCl, 2 mmethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, 20 mmTris pH 8, 5 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 75 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin (final concentrations)) and cytoplasmic actin filaments were sedimented by centrifugation at 15 600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (22Fox J.E.

Nonreduced-reduced two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed to visualize the characteristic migration of β3and assess its phosphorylation state as described previously (1Law D.A.

Invest. 1977; 60: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY-20 and 4G10. The blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) System. The level of phosphorylation was determined by densitometry using Imagequant software on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. In each case, three to five different ECL exposures were subjected to densitometry analysis to reduce the risk of erroneous results from nonlinear signals. The blots were then stripped (according to ECL protocol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and reprobed with the β3 antibody C3a.19.5 to determine β3protein content for each sample. Phosphorylation results were normalized for the total amount of β3 protein present. Myosin was purified from human platelets as described, and purification yielded myosin heavy chain and light chains (30Daniel J.L. Sellers J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Controlled proteolytic digests of platelet myosin with papain or chymotrypsin were performed as described (31Sellers J.R. Soboeiro M.S. Faust K. Bengur A.R. Harvey E.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6977-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) except that myosin was not phosphorylated prior to chymotryptic digestion. Papain was activated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Digests were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to nitrocellulose for ligand blotting. Platelet lysates or purified myosin were reduced, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were wet briefly in HEPES blot buffer (HBB) (25 mmHEPES, 25 mmNaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C. The transferred proteins were denatured by 6 mguanidine HCl in HBB for 10 min at 4 °C and renatured by 2-fold dilution of guanidine HCl (10-min incubations each with 3 m, 1.5m, 0.75 m, 0.38 m, 0.19 m, and 0 mguanidine HCl in HBB). The blot was blocked in HBB containing 4% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C and probed with 1 μmbiotinylated peptide in HBB containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at room temperature. After washing in Tris-buffered saline (20 mmTris, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4)/ 0.01% Nonidet P-40 three times at 4 °C, peptide-reactive bands were visualized by incubating the blots in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and employing ECL detection. β3(Y747F, Y759F) was generated and stably transfected into CHO cells as described (32Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were detached with trypsin, washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 25 mmHEPES once and resuspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in FACS buffer (Hanks buffered saline solution with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, 0.1% Gamimmune N, 0.03% sodium azide). The cells were then seeded at 200 μl/well, pelleted, and incubated with 5 μg/ml primary antibodies LM609 or control mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. After two washes, the cells were incubated with 1:200 goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer, and the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson). Clot retraction experiments were performed as described with minor modifications (33Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were trypsinized, washed twice, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 25 mmHEPES. 0.5 ml of cell suspension containing 5 × 106 cells was mixed with 0.1 ml of fibronectin-depleted plasma in a 12 × 70-mm glass tube treated with Sigmacote. Fibrin clots were formed by adding 1 unit/ml thrombin and allowed to retract at 37 °C over a 2–3-h period. The extent of clot retraction was measured by removing and weighing the clot. We previously reported that aggregation of platelets by thrombin in a stirred suspension induced a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3subunit of αIIbβ3 (1Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect was thrombin-specific, we examined β3tyrosine phosphorylation in response to various agonists. Adding ADP or ADP + epinephrine to a stirred suspension of platelets in the presence of added fibrinogen induced platelet aggregation and an increase in β3 phosphorylation, similar to that seen in thrombin-aggregated platelets (Table I). In contrast, when ADP was added in the absence of added fibrinogen or was added without stirring, no platelet aggregation occurred and no increase in β3 tyrosine phosphorylation was seen. ADP added in this manner did, however, induce platelet stimulation since other substrates were tyrosine phosphorylated and fibrinogen binding on unstirred preparations occurred (data not shown). An illustration of the increase in β3 tyrosine phosphorylation upon thrombin- or ADP-induced platelet aggregation is shown in Fig.1 A. Thus, ADP and ADP + epinephrine induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in an aggregation-dependent manner.Table Iβ3 tyrosine phosphorylation is induced by platelet aggregationAgonistAggregationβ3PhosphorylationPhosphotyrosine β3 stimulated/controlThrombinYesYes++Thrombin, cyclic RGDNoNo0TRAPYesYes++ADP, fibrinogenYesYes++ADPNoNo0ADP, fibrinogen (unstirred)NoNo0ADP, epinephrine, fibrinogenYesYes++CollagenYesYes++LIBS6, fibrinogenYesYes+LIBS6, fibrinogen, cyclic RGDNoNo0U44619YesYes++U44619, cyclic RGDNoNo0Washed platelets were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” except that calcium was omitted from the final buffer in the collagen sample and magnesium was omitted and 100 μmaspirin and 0.33 units/ml apyrase were added to the final buffer in the LIBS6 samples. Platelets (approximately 5 × 108/ml) were stimulated at 37 °C and allowed to stir in the aggregometer for 0.5–8 min with the following agonist concentrations: 0.1 units/ml thrombin, 1 μm TRAP, 4–16 μm ADP, 2 μm epinephrine, 0.2 mg/ml collagen, 5 μl LIBS6 ascites, 1 μm U44619. Fibrinogen was added to the indicated samples at a final concentration of 0.25–0.5 mg/ml. In the indicated samples, the cyclic RGD peptide (1 μm) was added to inhibit aggregation. Nonreducing sample buffer containing vanadate was added immediately after aggregation to terminate the reaction. The level of β3 phosphorylation was assessed by densitometry after transferring nonreduced-reduced two-dimensional gels to nitrocellulose and probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The blots were stripped and reprobed with the anti-β3 monoclonal antibody C3a.19.5 to determine protein content. The key to the -fold increase of β3 phosphorylation is as follows: 0, no increase in phosphorylation; +, 2–6-fold increase; ++, 7–14-fold increase in phosphorylation as compared with control unstimulated platelets.

Threshold concentrations of ADP can result in reversible platelet aggregation (34Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5357-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mustard J.F. Perry D.W. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Packham M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1975; 228: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We next determined the effect of reversal of ADP-induced aggregation on β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Washed platelets, resuspended in a buffer containing fibrinogen and Ca2+, were stirred with ADP. Platelet aggregation occurred but, as illustrated in Fig. 1 C, reversed with time. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer to the aggregometer tubes either at maximal ADP-induced aggregation or after aggregation was fully reversed (Fig. 1 C). As described above, ADP-induced aggregation led to an increase in β3phosphorylation, as well as the phosphorylation of a number of other substrates, similar to the response induced by thrombin (Fig.1 A). When samples were obtained in which ADP-induced platelet aggregation had reversed, no tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 was observed (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, when thrombin-induced platelet aggregates were maintained in suspension for up to 10 min prior to addition of SDS-sample buffer, no reversal of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). Platelets aggregated in response to stimulation through the collagen or thromboxane A2 receptors also showed a marked increase in β3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Table I). However, if platelet aggregation was prevented by cyclic RGD peptide (a competitive inhibitor of αIIbβ3), β3phosphorylation was not observed (Table I). Together, these data indicate that many platelet agonists can induce aggregation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. In the previous experiments, platelet agonists were used to induce fibrinogen binding and subsequent aggregation. To determine whether β3 tyrosine phosphorylation can occur in the absence of an agonist, platelet aggregation was induced by anti-LIBS6, a β3-specific antibody that, upon binding to β3, activates the receptor such that it becomes competent to bind fibrinogen. This activation occurs even in the absence of detectable platelet stimulation (27Frelinger III, A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LIBS6 antibody induced smaller platelet aggregates, and aggregation took slightly longer than that induced by classical platelet agonists. Nevertheless, an average 4-fold increase in the level of β3 phosphorylation was still observed (Table I). Again, the addition of cyclic RGD peptide inhibited both platelet aggregation and β3phosphorylation. Thus, αIIbβ3-dependent platelet aggregation is both necessary and sufficient for tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. To gain insight into the functional significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of β3, we assessed its effects on the partitioning of the receptor with the cytoskeleton, a process known to occur upon platelet aggregation (21Phillips D.R.

Kell, a type II membrane glycoprotein, carries over 20 blood group antigens, and XK, which spans the membrane 10 times, is lacking in rare individuals with the McLeod syndrome. Kell is classified in the neprilysin family of zinc endopeptidases, and XK has structural features that suggest it is a transport protein. Kell has 15 extracellular cysteines, and XK has one in its fifth extracellular loop. Five of the extracellular cysteine residues in Kell are not conserved in the other members of the neprilysin family, and based on the hypothesis that one of the nonconserved cysteines is linked to XK, cysteines 72 and 319 were mutated to serine. The single extracellular cysteine 347 of XK was also mutated. Co-expression of combinations of wild-type and mutant proteins in transfected COS-1 cells showed that Kell C72S did not form a Kell-XK complex with wild-type XK, while wild-type Kell and Kell C319S did. XK C347S was also unable to form a complex with wild-type Kell, indicating that Kell cysteine 72 is linked to XK cysteine 347. Kell C72S was transported to the cell surface, indicating that linkage to XK is not required. In addition, chemical cross-linking of red cell membranes with dithiobispropionimidate indicated that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a near neighbor of Kell.

In addition, chemical cross-linking of red cell membranes with dithiobispropionimidate indicated that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a near neighbor of Kell. The association of Kell and XK proteins on red cell membranes was predicted from early serological studies on two rare Kell-related phenotypes that noticed a relationship between antigens residing on the Kell blood group protein and Kx antigen, which is carried on a separate XK protein. In the McLeod phenotype red cell, there is an absence of Kx, an otherwise ubiquitous red cell antigen, and this is accompanied with a depression of all Kell antigens. On the other hand, in the Ko (null) phenotype, in which there is no detectable Kell surface antigens, there is an enhanced level of Kx antigens (1Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, treatment of normal red cells with reducing reagents, which inactivate the Kell antigens, showed a marked increase in Kx activity, indicating a sulfhydryl involvement in the presentation of Kell and Kx antigens on the red cells (3Branch D.R. Sy Siok Hian A.L. Petz L.D. Br. J. Haematol. 1985; 59: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies in which Kell protein was isolated from red cells in nonreduced conditions, showed that Kell protein was associated with itself as an oligomer and was also complexed with other red cell membrane proteins (4Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P. Marsh W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9521-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, immunoprecipitation of Kell protein in nonreduced conditions co-isolated XK, demonstrating that the two proteins exist as a disulfide-bonded complex on the red cell membrane (5Khamlichi S. Bailly P. Blanchard D. Goossens D. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further studies on the Kell-XK complex showed its absence in McLeod red cells and also demonstrated that although Ko (null) red cells have high Kx activity they contain less XK protein, indicating that lack of Kell protein may expose more Kx antigens on the cell surface (6Carbonnet F. Hattab C. Collec E. Le Van Kim C. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The McLeod phenotype has an X-linked mode of inheritance, and since some McLeod patients also have chronic granulomatous disease and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy, XK was located close to those genes at the Xp21 region of the X chromosome (7Bertelson C.J. Pogo A.O. Chaudhuri A. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Banerjee D. Symmans W.A. Simon T. Frey D. Kunkel L.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 42: 703-711PubMed Google Scholar). The red cell membrane protein (XK) that carries Kx antigen migrates on SDS-PAGE as a 37-kDA polypeptide (8Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Scarborough A. Johnson C.L. Rabin B.I. Overbeeke M. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 68: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Positional cloning isolated the XK gene and predicted that it encodes a 444-amino acid protein that spans the red cell membrane 10 times and has structural characteristics of a membrane transporter (9Ho M. Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Since XK protein may only have one extracellular cysteine residue in the fifth extracellular loop, it was predicted that this residue may be involved in disulfide linkage with Kell protein, which has 15 extracellular cysteine residues and one cysteine in the transmembrane domain (5Khamlichi S. Bailly P. Blanchard D. Goossens D. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Lee S. Vox Sang. 1997; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). McLeod red cells, which lack XK protein, have abnormal cell shape with a high proportion of acanthocytes. Another striking aspect of the McLeod phenotype is its association with a late onset form of muscular dystrophy, although high serum levels of the muscle enzyme, creatine phosphokinase are noted at earlier ages (11Marsh W.L. Marsh N.J. Moore A. Symmans W.A. Johnson C.L. Redman C.M. Vox Sang. 1981; 40: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Some McLeod patients also develop neurological symptoms (1Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1987; 1: 4-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In accordance with the clinical studies, XK transcripts are present not only in erythroid tissues but also in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and pancreas (9Ho M. Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to KEL, which appears to be mostly restricted to erythroid tissues (13Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2804-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning ofKEL (14Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) showed that the Kell protein is a 731-amino acid type II membrane glycoprotein with close structural and sequence similarities to a subfamily of zinc endopeptidases that includes neutral endopeptidase 24.11, endothelin-converting enzyme, and the product of the PEX gene (10Lee S.

In this study, the association of Kell and XK on red cell membranes is explored with emphasis on the topology of XK, on the near neighbor relationship of Kell to other red cell membrane proteins, and on the cysteine residues that link Kell and XK proteins. A 42-amino acid synthetic peptide, corresponding to the second extracellular loop domain of XK, was prepared by Synpep (Deblin, CA). A 30-mer peptide derived from an intracellular domain of Kell (amino acids 2–31) was synthesized by the Microchemistry Laboratory of the New York Blood Center. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and were affinity-purified. The antibody to the XK peptide reacted with several red cell membrane proteins on Western immunoblots, but it isolated XK from a nonionic detergent extract from normal, but not from McLeod, red cells. The antibody to the Kell peptide was specific both by Western immunoblotting and the ability to isolate Kell from a red cell detergent extract. Polyclonal antibody to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PAGE, polyacrylamide electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; COS-1, monkey kidney fibroblast cells; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; kb, kilobase pair; bp, base pair. purchased from Sigma, was raised in mice. A mouse monoclonal antibody to a Kell surface antigen (KEL14) was a gift from Dr. Pablo Rubinstein of the New York Blood Center. Surface-exposed Kell was isolated from red cells using a monoclonal antibody to KEL14. Red cells were coated overnight with 5 volumes of 300 μg/ml anti-KEL14 at 4 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and membrane “ghosts” were prepared as described previously (4Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P. Marsh W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9521-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, and the solution was cleared by centrifugation at 27,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman 50Ti rotor. The following protease inhibitors were used: 0.1 mml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 units/ml aprotinin (Sigma). The Kell-antibody complex was isolated with protein G coupled to Sepharose (Pierce) as described previously (4Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P. Marsh W.L.

Transfusion. 1984; 24: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). XK and XK-Kell complexes were also isolated from detergent-soluble extracts of red cell membranes using rabbit antibody to a peptide representing the second loop of XK. Membrane ghosts were prepared and solubilized as described above and treated overnight at 4 °C with 3.5 μg/ml affinity-purified antibody. The immune complex was isolated with protein A-Sepharose. (4Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P. Marsh W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9521-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Redman C.M. Marsh W.L.

After removal of the incubation medium, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma), and a mixture of protease inhibitors described above. The extract was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Antibody to the second loop of XK (3.5 μg/ml) or to the COOH-terminal peptide of Kell (3.5 μg/ml) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex was isolated with protein A-Sepharose. To isolate surface-exposed Kell and its complexes from transfected COS cells, the cells were labeled overnight withl-[35S]methionine, and the cells, attached to the bottom of the 100-mm Petri dishes, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated for 30 min over ice with 3 ml of 300 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody to KEL14. The cells were again washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with detergent as described above. The immune complexes present in the detergent-soluble extract were isolated with protein G-Sepharose. The immune complexes on protein A or protein G-Sepharose were eluted with SDS-loading buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol or 4 m urea with or without 10 mm dithiothreitol or 300 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE using 9% polyacrylamide gels. Red cells were coated with monoclonal antibody to KEL14, washed with normal saline, and lysed with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and membrane “ghosts” were prepared as described previously (4Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P. Marsh W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9521-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The washed membranes, suspended in 5 volumes of 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8, containing 1 mm MgCl2, were cross-linked at room temperature for 2 h with a final concentration of 4 μg/ml freshly prepared 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP) purchased from Pierce. The membranes were solubilized with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100 and the proteins, cross-linked to the Kell antibody complex, were isolated with protein G-Sepharose. Since DTBP is a thiol-cleavable cross-linking reagent, the isolated complexes were disassembled with DTT, separated on SDS-PAGE, detected by silver staining, or analyzed by Western immunoblotting using polyclonal antibody to GAPDH or to Kell protein. Proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, were transferred to ProBlotTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (purchased from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and digested with trypsin (21Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry V. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 215-223Google Scholar). The released peptides were separated by HPLC, and well separated peptides, were sequenced using an automated Applied Biosystems, model 477A, amino acid sequencer. All site-directed mutations were carried out by PCR, changing a single base in the cysteine codon of one of the primer sets to encode serine. The primers containing the mutation site included a restriction enzyme site that, used together with another nearby unique restriction enzyme site in the cDNAs of Kell or XK, were used to replace the respective region of the wild-type DNA. The wild-type cDNAs were placed in the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen Inc.) and were linearized before being used as template DNA in the PCR procedure. When there was more than a single restriction enzyme site in the construct, limited digestions were performed. Positive clones were selected with the appropriate restriction enzymes or selected by sequencing if it was not possible to select with restriction enzymes. The mutated regions in the plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. An expression vector, pRc/CMV, containing XK and Kell cDNAs, either wild-type or mutant, in tandem, each with its own CMV promoter and polyadenylation signals, was constructed as summarized in Fig.1. Kell cDNA was modified to contain a Kozak sequence (22Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before the ATG initiation codon as follows. A Kozak sequence (underlined) was placed at the 5′-end of a sense PCR primer, and an antisense primer was modified to contain a BamHI site (also underlined). These primers were used to amplify full-length Kell cDNA.Sense primer:5′­GCCGCCACC¯ATGGAAGGTGGGGACCAA­3′Anti­sense primer:5′­GGGGTGGCATCTTTGGGATCC¯AAGTTACC­3′ The 2.2-kb PCR product was placed in pBC SK(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using EcoRV and BamHI cloning sites. A 650-bp fragment was released by cutting withHindIII and PpuMI (at nucleotide 753 of Kell cDNA) and ligated to a 7-kb Kell cDNA in pRc/CMV expression vector that had been cut with HindIII andPpuMI. The following denaturation, annealing, and polymerization steps were performed in an automated thermocycler (Minicycler; MJ Research Inc, Watertown, MA). The initial cycle was 94 °C for 3 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s; in cycles 2 through 30, the conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. In the last cycle, the polymerization step at 72 °C was extended to 7 min to complete copies. The PCR procedure described earlier was used to create a G335C mutation in Kell cDNA that encodes serine instead of cysteine at Kell amino acid 72. The PCR product was inserted into wild-type Kell cDNA that had been modified to contain a Kozak sequence (GCCGCCACC) before the ATG initiation codon, as described above, and had been placed in pRc/CMV vector using HindIII and XbaI cloning sites. Wild-type Kell in pRc/CMV was amplified using the following primers to yield a 512-bp product. Anti­sense primer:5′­CTTGAGGGGAACATCAAACTCTGGC­3′ The sense primer contained a G to C mutation that is conveniently cut with BstXI at the mutation site (underlined). The PCR product also contains a PpuMI site that is unique in Kell cDNA. Kell cDNA in pRc/CMV, however, has two BstXI sites (nucleotides 165 and 327). First, pRc/CMV Kell was cut with PpuMI followed by limited digestion withBstXI. A 7.5-kb band that was produced was isolated by 0.8% low melting agarose gel electrophoresis. The 512-bp PCR product was also cut with BstXI and PpuMI, and the isolated 427-bp product was ligated to the 7.5-kb Kell cDNA fragment. The ligation products were transformed into Top10F1 Escherichia coli competent cells (Invitrogen). Miniplasmid preparations were performed using RPMR Miniplasmid preparation kit (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Positive clones were selected, and plasmid DNA was obtained by the polyethylene glycol procedure. A similar procedure was followed to create the Kell C319S mutant. The following primers were used to create a 224-bp PCR product containing the G1076C mutation. Anti­sense primer:5′­GAGCTTTCTGCGTGCCTCCTGGAATTGAC­3′ An AhdI site in the sense primers is underlined, as is the G to C mutation. Template pRc/CMV-Kell was used, and the PCR product was cut with AhdI and BstEII and purified in 1% low melting agarose electrophoresis. Kell in pRc/CMV was cut with BstEII, followed by limited digestion withAhdI. A 7.6-kb fragment was isolated and ligated with the 176-bp PCR product. Wild-type XK cDNA, placed in pRc/CMV in HindIII and XbaI cloning sites, was linearized by digestion withNruI, prior to its use as a template in the PCR reaction. XK cDNA was a generous gift from Drs. M. Ho and A. P. Monaco (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom). The following phosphorylated primers were used to generate a 698-bp product.Sense primer:5′­pCAGAGGAGATTGAGAAGGAGGTGG­3′Anti­sense primer:5′­pGCT¯CACATACATATAGATGTCAGT­3′The antisense primer contains a T1121 Amutation (underlined), which encodes serine instead of cysteine at XK amino acid 347. About 2 × 107 cells were released from Petri plates with trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended for 15 min with 10 μg of the circular plasmid DNA prior to electroporation. Electroporation was performed in 1-ml disposable electrochambers (Life Technologies, Inc.) to which an electrical pulse (250 V, 330 microfarads) was applied in a Life Technologies cell porator. The cells were allowed to recover for 10 min in ice and were then seeded at 5 × 106 cells on 100-mm Petri dishes with 12 ml of growth medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and grown to confluence in 2 days. Two days after transfection, confluent COS cells (100-mm plates) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or overnight in 1 ml of l-methionine-free medium with 0.5 mCi of l-[35S]methionine. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and “chase” incubated with normal growth media for 5 h. Previous studies showed that Kell and XK are surface-exposed on red cells, and both can be labeled by radioactive iodine (4Redman C.M. Avellino G. Pfeffer S.R. Mukherjee T.K. Nichols M. Rubinstein P. Marsh W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9521-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Scarborough A. Johnson C.L. Rabin B.I. Overbeeke M. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 68: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Normal and McLeod red cells were surface-labeled with125I by the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed method (4Redman C.M. Avellino G.

Chem. 1974; 250: 6256-6263Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and lysed, and the washed membranes were solubilized with detergents. Rabbit antibody to a synthetic peptide, which represents the predicted second extracellular loop of XK protein, was used to immunoprecipitate radioactive XK and any other associated surface-labeled proteins. The isolated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in reduced conditions. The patterns of total surface-labeled proteins in normal and McLeod red cells were similar. The majority of radioactivity corresponded with the predominant surface-exposed proteins, band 3 and the glycophorins (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 3). Antibody to the second loop of XK isolated radioactive proteins from normal red cells (Fig. 2, lane 4) but not from McLeod red cells that lack this protein (Fig. 2, lane 2). From normal red cells, radioactive proteins were noted at the top of the SDS-PAGE gel and at two other locations that correspond to proteins of approximately 93 and 40 kDa. The electrophoretic migration of the 93- and 40-kDa proteins correspond to the expected sizes of Kell and XK proteins. Failure to isolate the 40-kDa protein from extracts of McLeod red cells and its presence in normal cells indicated that the 40-kDa protein is surface-labeled XK protein. Western immunoblot using a rabbit antibody specific for Kell protein, reacted with the 93-kDa protein (data not shown). The 93-kDa protein was transferred from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and treated with trypsin, the peptides were separated by HPLC, and a well separated peptide was sequenced. The sequence VSPWDYNAYYSVSDXVWF was obtained, which corresponds to amino acid residues 535–552 of Kell protein (14Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine if other proteins are associated with or are near neighbors of Kell, red cells were treated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to KEL14, which specifically reacts with a surface-exposed Kell epitope. The cells were lysed, and membranes were isolated and were incubated with or without a thiol-cleavable cross-linking reagent, dithiobispropionimidate. The membranes were then dissolved in detergents (sodium deoxycholate and Triton X-100), and the immune complexes were isolated, reduced, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The isolated proteins were detected by silver staining (Fig.3) or by Western immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody to GAPDH or to Kell protein. The silver-stained protein patterns are shown in Fig. 3. In dithiobispropionimidate-cross-linked membranes (Fig. 3, lane 1), but not in untreated membranes (Fig. 3, lane 2), a 36-kDa protein co-precipitated with Kell protein. In these experiments, very little XK was detected, and the predominant silver-stained proteins were Kell and the heavy and light chains of IgG. The bands of approximately 30 and 24 kDa, that appear to be more prominent in the cross-linked sample in this experiment, were variable and were not characterized. The 36-kDa protein was unique in the cross-linked samples and was identified as GAPDH by amino acid sequencing of two peptides isolated from a trypsin digest. Two peptides, separated by HPLC, had the amino acid sequences LVSWYDNEFGYSNR and GALQXIIPASTGAAK. These two sequences correspond to amino acid residues 19–32 and 200–214 of human GAPDH. The 36-kDa protein also reacted on Western immunoblotting with a rabbit antibody to human GAPDH (data not shown). Hydropathy plots predict that XK has a single extracellular cysteine residue in its small, 11-amino acid, fifth loop (9Ho M. Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and that Kell has 15 extracellular cysteine residues (14Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Any one of the 15 extracellular cysteine residues of Kell could form a disulfide bond with the single extracellular cysteine of XK. To determine which of the cysteine residues are involved in disulfide linkage, the single cysteine extracellular residue in XK and two different cysteines in Kell were mutated to serine by site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type or the mutated proteins were co-expressed in COS cells, and their ability to form Kell-XK disulfide-bonded complexes was determined. Kell is a member of a subfamily of membrane zinc metalloendopeptidases, which includes neutral endopeptidase 24.11, endothelin-converting enzyme, and the product of the PEX gene (14Lee S. Zambas E.D.

Members of this subfamily of zinc endopeptidases conserve 10 cysteine residues in their extracellular domains. We hypothesized that one of the five nonconserved cysteine residues of Kell is likely to be involved in linkage to XK. A likely candidate was Kell cysteine 72, since it is close to the membrane-spanning domain, as is the single cysteine of XK. As a control, we also mutated cysteine 319 of Kell to serine, since this cysteine residue is the next nonconserved cysteine from the transmembrane domain. COS cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector containing Kell and XK cDNAs in tandem and the recombinant Kell-XK complex isolated with an antibody to the second loop of XK. On analysis, by SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions, both Kell (93 kDa) and XK (40 kDa) were detected when wild-type XK and Kell proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 4 A,lane 1). Kell was not co-isolated with XK, indicating a lack of Kell-XK formation, when the Kell mutant (C72S) was co-expressed with wild-type XK (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) or when the XK mutant (C347S) was co-expressed with wild-type Kell (Fig.4 A, lane 4). However, co-expression of XK with another Kell mutant (C319S) did co-isolate Kell protein (Fig.4 A, lane 3), indicating that mutation of another nonconserved Kell cysteine residue does not affect Kell-XK formation and that Kell Cys72 specifically links Kell to XK. Analysis on nonreduced SDS-PAGE confirmed that a 134-kDa Kell-XK complex was formed when wild-type XK and Kell (Fig. 4 B,lane 1) and when wild-type XK and Kell mutant (C319S) (Fig.4 B, lane 3) were co-expressed. However no 134-kDa complex occurred when XK and Kell mutant (C72S) (Fig. 4 B,lane 2) or mutant XK (C347S) and wild-type Kell (Fig.4 B, lane 4) were co-expressed. Taken together, these results indicate that Kell Cys72 is linked to XK Cys347. Although COS cells assemble recombinant Kell and XK, not all of the expressed proteins were disulfide-linked. Free XK was detected with antibody to XK, in conditions that isolated Kell-XK complex (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 3), and when antibody to Kell was employed, free Kell was detected, in addition to the 134-kDa complex (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). To establish if Kell-XK formation is required for cell surface expression and also to determine the fate of mutant Kell (C72S), COS cells, co-expressing wild-type XK and Kell or wild-type XK and mutant Kell (C72S), were incubated overnight withl-[35S]methionine and treated with an antibody to Kell (anti-KEL14) that recognizes Kell surface antigens. The cells were washed and lysed with detergents, and the radioactive proteins associated with anti-KEL14 were analyzed by nonreduced SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. When wild-type XK and Kell proteins were co-expressed, both the 134-kDa XK-Kell complex and free Kell (93 kDa) were present on the cell surface (Fig. 5,lane 2). Upon co-expression of wild-type XK and mutant Kell (C72S), the 134-kDa complex was not detected on the cell surface, but mutant Kell (C72S) was present (Fig. 5, lane 1). This demonstrates that wild type Kell and XK occur as a complex on the cell surface of transfected COS cells but that Kell does not have to be complexed with XK to be transported to the cell surface. The Kell blood group glycoprotein is classified as a member of the neprilysin family (M13) of zinc metallopeptidases (24Rawlings N.D. Barrett N.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Proteins in the M13 family are type II membrane glycoproteins and currently consist of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, Kell, endothelin-converting enzyme, and the product of the PEX gene. This topic was recently reviewed (15Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The physiological substrates of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and endothelin-converting enzyme are known, but those of Kell and PEX have not yet been identified. Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 is widely distributed and has broad specificity, processing a large number of peptide hormones (15Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 25Roques B.P. Noble F. Dauge V. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Beaumont A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 87-146PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, endothelin-converting enzyme is more specific and activates a 38- or 39-amino acid “big” endothelin, by cleavage of a Trp21–Val22 bond, to an active 21-amino acid endothelin peptide (15Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 16Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 17Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays an essential role in maintaining vascular tone. Endothelin-converting enzyme is a dimer consisting of two disulfide-linked 130-kDa subunits. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in COS cells suggests that the endothelin-converting enzyme subunits are linked by Cys412, a residue not conserved in neutral endopeptidase 24.11, Kell, or PEX (26Shimada K. Takahashi M. Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Kell is covalently linked through a nonconserved Cys72 to Cys347 of XK protein (see Fig.6). By contrast, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 is not covalently associated with itself or with another protein. Therefore, Kell differs from the other members of the M13 family in that it is linked to another membrane protein. XK, to which Kell is linked, is an integral membrane protein, which probably spans the membrane 10 times and has both its NH2 terminus and COOH terminus within the cell. The function of XK is not known, although it has structural features that suggest a transport function. Thus, although the functions of both Kell and XK are unknown, their covalent association on the red cell membrane suggests cooperative activities. It should be noted, however, that XK is present in nonerythroid tissues, primarily in skeletal muscle, brain, and pancreas (9Ho M. Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), while Kell may be restricted to erythroid tissues (13Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2804-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, an extensive set of tissues has not been monitored for the presence of Kell protein. Kell is one of the major antigenic systems in human red cells mainly due to its complex polymorphisms. At least 20 different antigens are associated with Kell glycoprotein, and because of its immunogenicity severe reactions can occur if incompatible blood is transfused (1Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the different Kell antigens has been elucidated and is due to single base mutations leading to amino acid changes (10Lee S. Vox Sang. 1997; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The covalent linkage of Kell and XK is not needed to express Kell antigens on the cell surface, since Kell antigens are expressed in a recombinant system that only synthesizes Kell protein and not XK (27Russo D.C. Lee S. Reid M. Redman C.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3518-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Kell antigens can be detected in McLeod red cells that lack XK (1Redman C.M. Marsh W.L. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar,2Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we also show that a specific Kell antigen, KEL14, is expressed on the surface of transfected COS cells, in the absence of XK, demonstrating that Kell protein can be transported to the cell surface without being linked to XK. In addition, since Kell protein, by itself, expresses KEL14, a conformational epitope, these data suggest that Kell protein assumes normal folding in the absence of XK. Since mutant Kell (C72S) was transported to the cell surface of COS cells in the absence of XK and retained its ability to be recognized by a specific monoclonal antibody to the KEL14 conformational epitope, these results further indicate that mutation of Kell (C72S) does not markedly change the tertiary structure of the protein. Our results are in agreement with previous studies (5Khamlichi S. Bailly P. Blanchard D. Goossens D. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Carbonnet F. Hattab C. Collec E. Le Van Kim C. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that show that Kell and XK are disulfide-linked in the native state on human red cells. There is no evidence, however, that Kell and XK are part of a larger membrane complex, since antibodies to Kell or XK did not isolate other proteins and since chemical cross-linking studies, using a reagent that detects near neighbors with free amino groups, only co-isolated a cytoplasmic protein, GADPH. Although the cross-linking studies may not be quantitative, it appears that not all of the Kell proteins on red cells are cross-linked to GADPH. GADPH is known to be linked to other red cell membrane proteins, notably band 3, the anion transporter (28Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The hydropathy plot of XK predicts five extracellular loops and predicts that Cys347 resides on the small fifth extracellular loop (9Ho M. Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Kell cysteine 72, which is known to be in the extracellular domain of Kell protein (27Russo D.C. Lee S. Reid M. Redman C.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3518-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is linked to XK Cys347. This indicates that the disulfide linkage of Kell to XK lies close to the extracellular membrane surface and supports the predicted topology of XK.

This situation strongly favors the installation and propagation of this pathogen within its mammalian host. Previous findings by us and others have established that alteration of several signaling pathways (protein kinase C-, Ca2+- and protein-tyrosine kinases-dependent signaling events) were directly responsible for Leishmania-induced macrophage (MØ) dysfunctions. Here we report that modulation of phosphotyrosine-dependent events with a protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) inhibitor, the peroxovanadium (pV) compound bpV(phen) (potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate(Vi)), can control host-pathogen interactions by different mechanisms. We observed that the inhibition of parasite PTP resulted in an arrest of proliferation and death of the latter in coincidence with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1) tyrosine 15 phosphorylation. Moreover the treatment of MØ with bpV(phen) resulted in an increased sensitivity to interferon-γ stimulation, which was reflected by enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production. This enhanced IFN-γ-induced NO generation was accompanied by a marked increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA gene and protein expression. Finally we have verified the in vivo potency of bpV(phen) over a 6-week period of daily administration of a sub-toxic dose. The results revealed its effectiveness in controlling the progression of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Therefore PTP inhibition ofLeishmania and MØ by the pV compound bpV(phen) can differentially affect these eukaryotic cells. This strongly suggests that PTP plays an important role in the progression ofLeishmania infection and pathogenesis.

PTP could also play a pivotal role in Leishmaniapathogenesis since several important immune functions necessary for the development of a protection against leishmaniasis are PTK-regulated, and their Leishmania-induced inhibitions are correlated with host signaling alterations (3Olivier M.

Thus, we have evaluated the effectiveness of bpV(phen) in vivo in controlling the development of the cutaneous lesions and inflammation of the hind footpad in BALB/c mice induced by Leishmania majorinfection. The effect of similar in vivo PTP inhibition on the development of visceral leishmaniasis has also been evaluated. The present study firmly establishes that the pV compound bpV(phen) can modulate both Leishmania and MØ cellular physiology to effect protection against leishmaniasis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAttenuation of MØ and other host immune functions byLeishmania infection has been correlated with alterations of several signaling pathways including PTK activation (3Olivier M.

Involvement of PTK-dependent events in the regulation of cell proliferation, including that of protozoan parasites, and in the modulation of immune cell functions has been increasingly recognized (14Dong Z. Qi X. Xie K. Fidler I.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parsons M. Valentine M. Deans J. Schieven G.L. Ledbetter J.A. Mol. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of these cellular processes using PTP inhibitors has been widely studied in a range of in vitrosystems including activation of T lymphocytes (23Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With the exception of experiments in animal diabetes, few studies have tested the in vivo effects of PTP inhibitors, including the recently characterized pV compounds (20Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on the modulation of PTK-dependent cellular events. In this study, we have thus evaluated the role of PTP in the development of murine leishmaniasis using the pV compound bpV(phen) to inhibit both the parasite and host cell PTP activities.We measured the effects of vanadate and different pV compounds on the growth of L. donovani promastigotes (Fig.1 A). Only bpV(phen) was found to inhibit L. donovani growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. No inhibition by vanadate or other pV compounds tested (bpV(pic), bpV(OHpic), bpV(bipy)) was observed, showing that the nature of the ancillary ligand is important. Similar effects have been observed on the growth of severalLeishmania species including L. major (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of bpV(phen) on L. donovaniwas observed at a dose of 10 μm and was characterized by an increase in the number of cells at the SG2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1 B) when compared with vanadate and untreated parasites. In parallel, PTP activity was measured (20Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in whole Leishmania extracts using 32P-labeled poly Glu-Tyr as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1 C, incubation ofL. donovani for 6 h with 10 μm bpV(phen) reduced parasite PTP activity by more than 90%. Similar levels of inhibition were measurable from 1 to 24 h after treatments (data not shown). One direct effect of this inhibition was further documented by the Tyr-15 hyperphosphorylation of CDK1 observed upon incubation with bpV(phen) (Fig. 1 D). This showed that CDK1 is an endogenous target. Vanadate, albeit less efficient, was also able to inhibit PTP activity in these conditions and induced a slight increase in CDK1 phosphorylation. This observation may in part explain the absence of Leishmania growth inhibition in response to vanadate treatment in vitro. These results are in accordance with the report of Morla et al. (31Morla A.O. Draetta G. Beach D. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1989; 58: 193-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) concerning the hyperphosphorylation of CDK1 by vanadate (50 μm) in 3T3 cells and the observation of Faure et al. (22Faure R. Vincent M. Dufour M. Shaver A. Posner B.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 389-401Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) on the effect of bpV(phen) to promote the inhibition of mitosis by blocking progression at the SG2/M interphase in coincidence with CDK1 hyperphosphorylation and loss of catalytic activity. These observations suggest that, as in mammalian cells (22Faure R. Vincent M. Dufour M. Shaver A. Posner B.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 389-401Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Morla A.O. Draetta G. Beach D. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1989; 58: 193-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the protein tyrosine phosphatase Cdc25 is an important endogenous target in protozoan cells.Leishmania can inhibit several MØ functions to improve its survival and propagation. It is also well established that phagocytes play a key role in controlling Leishmania infection in vivo by secreting molecules such as NO (32Stenger S. Thüring H. Ro¨llinghoff M. Bogdan C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which are regulated by Tyr(P)-dependent events (14Dong Z. Qi X. Xie K. Fidler I.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar). We thus evaluated the effect of bpV(phen) on MØ functions since an inhibition of MØ PTP activities may contribute to increased responsiveness toward cytokine stimulation. The effects of bpV(phen) treatment on murine MØ responsiveness to IFN-γ are shown in Fig.2 A. NO production was significantly increased in bpV(phen)-treated cells over untreated or vanadate-treated MØs at various doses and inhibitable by the iNOS inhibitor l-NMMA. Similarly, IFN-γ-stimulated bpV(pic)-treated MØ has generated NO levels comparable to that of bpV(phen)-treated cells (data not shown). In addition, the inhibition of MØ PTK by genistein led to an almost complete abrogation of inducible NO production as previously reported by others (14Dong Z. Qi X. Xie K. Fidler I.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar). These results established that PTP inhibition by bpV(phen) can modulate events in cells as different as the pathogen Leishmania and its host cell, the macrophage. We then assessed whether this bpV(phen) dual effect may attenuate parasite persistence within its host cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, bpV(phen) at a dose of 10 μm can effectively reduce the parasitic load ofLeishmania-infected MØ by more than 75% in comparison to control cells. In addition, we observed that the NO inhibitorl-NMMA almost completely reversed this bpV(phen)-mediated protection against Leishmania infection, suggesting that NO is a key player in pV-mediated leishmanicidal activity. MØ PTP activities, as for Leishmania, were substantially inhibited by bpV(phen) (data not shown). This was paralleled by augmented levels of Tyr(P) proteins in MØ (Fig. 2 C), which may result from enhanced MØ PTK activity (Fig. 2 D). Total MØ Tyr(P) protein levels were further induced by IFN-γ stimulation as revealed by intracellular flow cytometry determinations (Fig. 2 E). In addition, bpV(phen) treatment enhanced iNOS gene mRNA and iNOS protein expressions both in the basal state and in response to IFN-γ stimulation in comparison to their respective controls (Fig.2 F). Altogether, these observations document the capacity of bpV(phen) to favor PTK-dependent signaling and to prime MØ for enhanced responsiveness toward stimulants. Regulation ofiNOS has been previously reported to involve the participation of the transcription factor NF-κB (33Xie Q.-E. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar). Our recent observations that several pV compounds can strongly induce NF-κB nuclear translocation in lymphoid and monocytoid cells (23Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) support the hypothesis that nuclear translocation of NF-κB is involved in the effect of bpV(phen) to increase iNOS mRNA expression. Furthermore, the activity of iNOS may be directly influenced by tyrosine phosphorylation (34Pan J. Burger K.L. Szczepanik A.M. Ringheim G.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Figure 2Modulation of murine MØ functions by bpV(phen). A, NO production by the J774 cell line (5 × 105cell/well) cultured in the presence or absence of Vi (V) or bpV(phen) (1 h) before IFN-γ (100 units/ml). Results are the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. *, NO production was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in comparison to control (cells solely stimulated with IFN-γ). l-NMMA (5 μm) treatment reduced NO generation by more than 75%. bpV(phen) treatmentper se (10 μm) induced NO generation (>15 μm). B, effects of bpV(phen) in vitro on Leishmania-infected murine MØ. Parasitic load was significantly reduced (p < 0.05; mean ± S.E. of four experiments) by 5 (~45% reduction) and 10 (~70% reduction) μm treatments after 24 h in culture in comparison to untreated and vanadate-treated cells. l-NMMA (5 μm) and bpV(phen) were added to cell cultures simultaneously. C, pattern of Tyr(P) proteins in MØ after treatment with bpV(phen). Cells were incubated in 24 well dishes (106 cells/well) for 1 h with 10 μm of bpV(phen) or Vi and subjected to Western blotting. MØ Tyr(P) protein levels were revealed using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphorylation levels were maximal 1–2 h post-stimulation and were dose-dependent (data not shown). Results are representative of four experiments similarly performed. MW,M r. D, tyrosine kinase activity in Vi- and bpV(phen)-treated-murine MØ. J774 cells (5 × 105) were incubated in 24-well dishes with Vi(•) or bpV(phen) (○) (10 μm) over a 1-h period at 37 °C. PTK activity in cell lysates was assessed by their capacity to phosphorylate poly(Glu-Tyr). The capacity of bpV(phen) to inhibit MØ PTP activities by ~90% (data not shown) was similar to that attained in bpV(phen)-treated parasites (Fig. 1 C).E, IFN-γ-induced intracellular tyrosyl phosphorylation in bpV(phen)-treated phagocytes. Cells were treated as above and further treated with IFN-γ (100 units (U)/ml) for 30–60 min. Levels of Tyr(P) (Y) proteins were monitored by flow cytometry in permeabilized MØ incubated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments.F, effect of bpV(phen) treatment on MØ iNOS gene expression in response to IFN-γ stimulation. Cells were treated as above and further stimulated with IFN-γ for an 8-h period. RNA isolated from cells was subjected to Northern analysis to evaluateiNOS gene expression. Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was also evaluated as the control for equal RNA loading. The level of iNOS protein in cells treated for 24 h was monitored by Western blotting (i.b.) using an anti-iNOS antibody (α-iNOS). Results are representative of three experiments independently performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of this, experiments were done to determine whether bpV(phen) (21Bevan A.P.

Physiol. 1995; 268: E60-E66PubMed Google Scholar) could modulate the course of the infection in a murine leishmaniasis model (32Stenger S. Thüring H. Ro¨llinghoff M. Bogdan C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Infection by L. major, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, was inhibited by 60% (p < 0.05) in bpV(phen)-treated BALB/c mice (Fig.3, A and B). As shown in Fig. 3 A, mice treated daily with bpV(phen) (2.5 μmol/30 g (500 nm) of body weigh, intraperitoneal injection) over a 6 week period showed significantly reduced footpad inflammation compared with control, vanadate, and phenanthroline-treated groups. The bpV(phen) treatment not only reduced the inflammation of the footpads but also completely blocked the development of the cutaneous lesion (Fig. 3 B). The remarkable reduction of these typical features of cutaneous leishmaniasis was further evidenced by the almost complete disappearance of parasite from the popliteal lymph node and complete absence of hepatic involvement (Table I). The effect of bpV(phen) on the course of murine visceral leishmaniasis was also tested and found to be even more striking. As noted in Fig.3 C, bpV(phen) was capable of completely reducing the liver parasitic load at two weeks post-infection, whereas hepatic infestation of control C57BL/6 was still at peak levels. These data strongly suggest that in vivo modulation of PTK/PTP balance by pV compounds (35Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) can restrict and favor regression of leishmaniasis in mammals.Figure 3Protection by bpV(phen) treatment of mice against Leishmaniainfections. A, L. major-infected BALB/c mice were subjected to daily saline (Control), Vi (oV), bpV(phen), and phenanthroline (phen) intraperitoneal injections over a period of 6 weeks. Infection is expressed as the net increase in hind footpad volume (mm3). Treatments performed at 0.5 μmol/30 g (100 nm) of body weight were ineffective to control the progression of the L. major infection (data not shown). Doses ≥5 μmol/30 g (1 μm) were toxic for the animals.B, this photograph represents typical L. majorcutaneous lesions illustrating the reduced foot pad inflammation and the total inhibition of lesion development observable in animals treated with bpV(phen) (2.5 μmol/30 g; 500 nm).C, L. donovani infection in C57BL/6 mice receiving saline (control) or bpV(phen) treatments. At 1 and 2 weeks post-infection, the parasitic load (L. donovani units) in the infected organ was monitored as described previously (38Olivier M. Tanner C.E. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1989; 40: 32-38PubMed Google Scholar). In allin vivo experiments, each time point represents the mean value obtained for five animals and are representative of two experiments separately performed. *, reductions of footpad inflammation, lesion development (L. major), or liver parasitic load (L. donovani) from bpV(phen)-treated animals were significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ILiver and popliteal lymph node parasitic loads of L. major-infected miceTreatmentPopliteal lymph nodeLiver% of visceralizationnMLeishmania units1-aNumber of amastigotes/1000 cells × by organ weight (mg).Leishmani"

Previous studies have shown that GATA-6 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and rapidly down-regulated when VSMCs are induced to proliferate. Here we investigated whether the GATA-6 transcription factor can modulate cellular proliferation. Transient transfection with a GATA-6 expression vector inhibited S-phase entry in VSMCs and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking both p53 alleles. The GATA-6-induced growth arrest correlated with a marked increase in the expression of the general cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21. In contrast to p53-deficient MEFs and VSMCs, MEFs null for both p21 alleles were refractory to the GATA-6-induced growth inhibition. These data demonstrate that elevated GATA-6 expression can promote the quiescent phenotype in VSMCs.

The GATA transcription factors are required for establishing hematopoietic cell lineages and for the proper formation of the cardiovascular system. GATA-1/2/3 isoforms are predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, and disruption of each of these genes results in deficiencies in hematopoiesis and embryonic lethality (1Weiss M. Orkin S. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the more recently identified GATA-4/5/6 genes represent a subfamily of factors that are expressed in cardiovascular tissues (2Jiang Y.

Little is known about the functions of GATA-5 and -6, but their expression patterns overlap with that of GATA-4 in the developing cardiovasculature.

Bioessays. 1996; 18: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). Following acute injury, the quiescent VSMCs of the vessel wall up-regulate cyclin and Cdk expression and rapidly re-enter cell cycle in a synchronous manner (15Wei G.L. Krasinski K. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Andrés V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As lesion size increases the proliferative capacity of VSMCs decreases, and this correlates with an up-regulation of the Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (16Yang Z. Simari R. Perkins N. Sang H. Gordon D. Nabel G. Nabel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7905-7910Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 17Chang M.W. Barr E. Lu M.M. Barton K. Leiden J.M. J. Clin.

Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the cell cycle regulatory properties of the human GATA-6 factor. The forced expression of GATA-6 inhibited S-phase entry in VSMCs and non-muscle cells. GATA-6 overexpression resulted in the induction of the Cdk inhibitor p21, and the cell cycle inhibitory activity of GATA-6 was markedly attenuated in p21-deficient cells. These data suggest that GATA-6 may function in VSMCs to coordinate cell cycle activity with the state of cellular differentiation.DISCUSSIONVSMCs are of interest because of their ability to undergo a dedifferentiation process referred to as phenotypic modulation in response to mitogen stimulation, vascular injury, or other environmental stimuli (11Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Campbell J.H. Campbell G.R. Vascular Smooth Muscle in Culture. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 39-55Google Scholar, 12Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Manderson J.A. Horrigan S. Rennick R.E. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1988; 112: 977-986PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotypically modulated VSMCs are proliferative and migratory and resemble their fibroblast-like precursor cells in that they express low levels of contractile proteins and high levels of extracellular matrix. Thus, it is likely that VSMCs contain mitogen-regulated transcription factors that function to coordinate the expression of genes required for cell cycle activity with those encoding smooth muscle contractile proteins (31Gorski D.H. Walsh K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Walsh K. Perlman H. Semin. Interventional Cardiol. 1996; 1: 173-179PubMed Google Scholar). A number of mitogen-regulated transcription factors have been identified in VSMCs, including the homeoprotein Gax (33Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Patel C.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell.

Recently, GATA-6 expression was shown to be rapidly down-regulated when quiescent human or rat VSMCs were stimulated to proliferate with mitogens (10Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This expression pattern is reminiscent of that described for the gas and gadd family genes (39Fornace A.J.

Fornace A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar).In this study we explored the growth regulatory properties of GATA-6 in VSMCs and fibroblasts. The forced expression of GATA-6 in VSMCs inhibited the incorporation of BrdUrd following mitogen stimulation, but a GATA-6 mutant lacking the zinc finger domains exhibited no detectable effect on DNA synthesis. The wild type GATA-6, but not mutant GATA-6, also inhibited the mitogen-induced proliferation of a fibroblast line that does not normally express GATA-6. These results demonstrate that GATA-6-induced growth arrest is not cell type-specific and that it may control cell cycle activity through the modulation of a ubiquitously expressed cell cycle regulatory protein.Ectopic GATA-6 expression induced the expression of p21, a general Cdk inhibitor induced in skeletal myoblasts and other cell types during differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 30Walsh K. Perlman H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Google Scholar) and whose expression is modulated by the tumor suppressor, p53 (23El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). GATA-6-mediated growth arrest and p21 induction are independent of p53 function as indicated by the ability of ectopic GATA-6 to fulfill these functions in fibroblasts deficient for p53. Other factors that activate p21 expression in a p53-independent manner include the transcriptional regulators MyoD (43Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), C/EBP-α (44Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 805-815Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar), Gax (24Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.-F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denéfle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K.

Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and the tumor suppressor BRCA-1(46). Thus, up-regulation of p21 by these developmental regulators may represent a general mechanism by which cell growth and phenotypic differentiation are coordinated during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Similar mechanisms may also be involved in regulating VSMC phenotypic modulation in response to injury in adult vessels.Our data indicate that the up-regulation of p21 is a functionally significant feature of growth arrest induced by GATA-6. In contrast to results with p53-deficient MEFs, p21-deficient low passage MEFs expressing GATA-6 incorporated the S-phase marker BrdUrd at a high frequency (91% for p21−/− MEFs versus 5% for p53−/− MEFs). These data suggest that the up-regulation of p21 by GATA-6 overexpression largely accounts for the G1 cell cycle arrest under these conditions. Consistent with this proposed mechanism GATA-6-transfected p21−/− MEFs form stable colonies at a high frequency, while the restoration of p21 decreases colony formation. In separate experiments, GATA-6 was unable to transactivate expression from a 2.4-kilobase pair fragment of the p21 promoter (not shown), and these data suggest that GATA-6 either acts on an unidentified p21 gene regulatory element at a distant site or increases p21 expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Post-transcriptional regulation of p21 was recently reported for C/EBP-α, which increases the stability of the p21 protein (47Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we have shown that GATA-6 overexpression can up-regulate the expression of the p21 Cdk inhibitor and inhibit S-phase entry in VSMCs and fibroblasts. Though VSMC-specific gene targets for GATA-6 are currently unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that in VSMCs GATA-6 functions, like GATA-4 in heart, to activate the expression of contractile protein genes associated with the differentiated phenotype. Therefore, GATA-6 may serve multiple regulatory roles in VSMCs and function, along with other mitogen-regulated transcription factors, to coordinate VSMC proliferation and differentiation during normal vessel development. The identification of GATA-6 as a regulator of VSMC proliferation may also have implications in the development of molecular therapies to treat proliferative vessel wall disorders. The GATA transcription factors are required for establishing hematopoietic cell lineages and for the proper formation of the cardiovascular system. GATA-1/2/3 isoforms are predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, and disruption of each of these genes results in deficiencies in hematopoiesis and embryonic lethality (1Weiss M. Orkin S. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the more recently identified GATA-4/5/6 genes represent a subfamily of factors that are expressed in cardiovascular tissues (2Jiang Y. Evans T. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,3Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos that lack GATA-4 fail to develop a centralized heart tube and foregut (4Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 5Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M.

Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C.A. Narita N. Saffitz J.E. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Wilson D.B. Development ( Camb. ). 1995; 121(11): 3877-3888Google Scholar). Little is known about the functions of GATA-5 and -6, but their expression patterns overlap with that of GATA-4 in the developing cardiovasculature. Both GATA-4 and -6 are expressed in heart throughout development, while GATA-5 is expressed during early heart development (7Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

Of note, GATA-4 and -6 are co-expressed in the vasculature during early development, but only GATA-6 is detected in vessels post-day 13.5 of mouse embryonic development (7Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S.

Unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, VSMCs are not terminally differentiated and can dedifferentiate and reenter the cell cycle in response to multiple stimuli (11Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H.

A number of mitogen-regulated transcription factors have been identified in VSMCs, including the homeoprotein Gax (33Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Patel C.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell.

Recently, GATA-6 expression was shown to be rapidly down-regulated when quiescent human or rat VSMCs were stimulated to proliferate with mitogens (10Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This expression pattern is reminiscent of that described for the gas and gadd family genes (39Fornace A.J.

Fornace A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In this study we explored the growth regulatory properties of GATA-6 in VSMCs and fibroblasts. The forced expression of GATA-6 in VSMCs inhibited the incorporation of BrdUrd following mitogen stimulation, but a GATA-6 mutant lacking the zinc finger domains exhibited no detectable effect on DNA synthesis. The wild type GATA-6, but not mutant GATA-6, also inhibited the mitogen-induced proliferation of a fibroblast line that does not normally express GATA-6. These results demonstrate that GATA-6-induced growth arrest is not cell type-specific and that it may control cell cycle activity through the modulation of a ubiquitously expressed cell cycle regulatory protein. Ectopic GATA-6 expression induced the expression of p21, a general Cdk inhibitor induced in skeletal myoblasts and other cell types during differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 30Walsh K. Perlman H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Google Scholar) and whose expression is modulated by the tumor suppressor, p53 (23El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). GATA-6-mediated growth arrest and p21 induction are independent of p53 function as indicated by the ability of ectopic GATA-6 to fulfill these functions in fibroblasts deficient for p53. Other factors that activate p21 expression in a p53-independent manner include the transcriptional regulators MyoD (43Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and the tumor suppressor BRCA-1(46). Thus, up-regulation of p21 by these developmental regulators may represent a general mechanism by which cell growth and phenotypic differentiation are coordinated during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Similar mechanisms may also be involved in regulating VSMC phenotypic modulation in response to injury in adult vessels. Our data indicate that the up-regulation of p21 is a functionally significant feature of growth arrest induced by GATA-6. In contrast to results with p53-deficient MEFs, p21-deficient low passage MEFs expressing GATA-6 incorporated the S-phase marker BrdUrd at a high frequency (91% for p21−/− MEFs versus 5% for p53−/− MEFs). These data suggest that the up-regulation of p21 by GATA-6 overexpression largely accounts for the G1 cell cycle arrest under these conditions. Consistent with this proposed mechanism GATA-6-transfected p21−/− MEFs form stable colonies at a high frequency, while the restoration of p21 decreases colony formation. In separate experiments, GATA-6 was unable to transactivate expression from a 2.4-kilobase pair fragment of the p21 promoter (not shown), and these data suggest that GATA-6 either acts on an unidentified p21 gene regulatory element at a distant site or increases p21 expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Post-transcriptional regulation of p21 was recently reported for C/EBP-α, which increases the stability of the p21 protein (47Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that GATA-6 overexpression can up-regulate the expression of the p21 Cdk inhibitor and inhibit S-phase entry in VSMCs and fibroblasts. Though VSMC-specific gene targets for GATA-6 are currently unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that in VSMCs GATA-6 functions, like GATA-4 in heart, to activate the expression of contractile protein genes associated with the differentiated phenotype. Therefore, GATA-6 may serve multiple regulatory roles in VSMCs and function, along with other mitogen-regulated transcription factors, to coordinate VSMC proliferation and differentiation during normal vessel development. The identification of GATA-6 as a regulator of VSMC proliferation may also have implications in the development of molecular therapies to treat proliferative vessel wall disorders.

TIMP-1 production by isolated human articular synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes, stimulated by IL-6 and/or its soluble receptor, was first assayed by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the slight stimulatory effect of IL-6 on TIMP-1 production by both types of cells was markedly amplified by the addition of soluble receptor, the maximal secretion being observed only at 96 h. TIMP-1 mRNA expression, determined by ribonuclease protection assay, was induced by IL-6 together with its soluble receptor, but TIMP-2 and -3 mRNAs were not affected by these factors. A specific neutralizing antibody abolished the effects of the soluble receptor. Finally, supernatant from synoviocytes stimulated by IL-6 plus its soluble receptor blocked almost completely the collagenolytic activity of supernatant from IL-1-induced synoviocytes. These observations indicate that IL-6 and its soluble receptor have a protective role in the metabolism of cartilage. Given the high levels of soluble receptor in synovial fluid and the marked induction of IL-6 by IL-1 or TNF-α, it is likely that IL-6 and its soluble receptor are critical in controlling the catabolic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

These two classes of molecules play a crucial role in the fine regulation of extracellular matrix turnover, which is altered in most pathological states associated with abnormal extracellular matrix formation (i.e. fibrotic diseases) or tissue destruction (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis). TIMP proteins can bind either to the active site of MMPs, thus blocking access to the substrate, or to the precursor form, blocking further activation. So far, the sequences coding for four human TIMPs (TIMP-1, -2, and -3 and, more recently, TIMP-4) have been identified (1Denhardt D.T. Rajan S. Walther S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The expression of TIMP-1 proved to be both constitutive and inducible, whereas TIMP-2 appeared to be widely expressed but not inducible (1Denhardt D.T. Rajan S. Walther S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

A recent study indicates that TIMP-3 expression is also constitutive and inducible (13Su S. Dehnade F. Zafarullah M. DNA Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).TIMP-1 expression in differentiated chondrocytes and fibroblasts has been shown to regulated by a few growth factors or cytokines, among which transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is considered to be the most important inducer (1Denhardt D.T.

On the other hand, catabolic cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the main promoters of MMPs synthesis and matrix degradation, have a marked inhibitory effect on TIMP-1 expression by chondrocytes, although some results have shown that IL-1, depending on the conditions, can either stimulate or inhibit the synthesis of TIMP-1 (15Circolo A.

IL-6 was initially considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine like TNF-α and IL-1, because of its IL-1-like effects on immune and hepatic cells. On the other hand, IL-6 has repeatedly been shown not to induce the synthesis of MMPs (20Lotz M. Guerne P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2017-2020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hauptmann B. Van Damme J. Dayer J.M. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1991; 2: 39-46PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, IL-6 can induce, in some conditions, the synthesis of TIMP-1 in human articular chondrocytes and fibroblasts (20Lotz M. Guerne P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2017-2020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-6 is one of the most abundant cytokines, synthesized in large amounts in response to IL-1 or TNF-α stimulation, this effect might represent a very important protective mechanism, and be consistent with other effects of IL-6 on synthesis of inhibitory acute phase proteins such as α2-macroglobulin and IL-1 receptor antagonist (22Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 23Gabay C. Smith Jr., M.F. Eidlen D. Arend W.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2930-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Induction of TIMP-1 by IL-6, however, was very weak compared with that obtained with TGF-β (20Lotz M. Guerne P.-A. J. Biol.

Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Rheumatol. 1995; 34: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In various body fluids including serum, urine, and synovial fluid, naturally occurring sIL-6Rα appears to be present in patients with various diseases as well as in healthy subjects (35Frieling J.T.M. Van Deuren M. Wijdenes J. Van der Meer J.W.M. Clement C. Van der Linden C.J. Sauerwein R.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Novick D. Engelmann H.

IL-6 alone exerted a very weak effect on TIMP-1. Our principal finding is that the effect of IL-6 can be enhanced by adding sIL-6Rα to the culture medium. This increase was observed in human articular chondrocytes and human synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that the weak IL-6 effect on TIMP-1 expression was a result of the low level of IL-6Rα expressed on the surface of these cells. These results are consistent with the identification of the IL-6 response element in the rat tissue inhibitor of the TIMP-1 promoter (42Bugno M. Graeve L. Gatsios P. Koj A. Heinrich P.C. Travis J. Kordula T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).It has already been observed that significant amounts of sIL-6Rα (20–25 ng/ml) can be present in the serum of healthy donors (35Frieling J.T.M. Van Deuren M. Wijdenes J. Van der Meer J.W.M. Clement C. Van der Linden C.J. Sauerwein R.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and that serum concentrations may increase in certain pathological conditions such as interstitial pneumonia (43Yokoyama A. Kohno N. Hirasawa Y. Kondo K. Abe M. Inoue Y. Fujioka S. Fujino S. Ishida S. Hiwada K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 100: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), multiple myeloma (44Gaillard J.P. Bataille R. Brailly H. Zuber C. Yasukawa K. Attal M. Maruo N. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 820-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (45Honda M. Yamamoto S. Cheng M. Yasukawa K. Suzuki H. Saito T. Osugi Y. Tokunaga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2175-2180PubMed Google Scholar). High amounts of sIL-6Rα, equivalent to the doses used in our experiments, are also found in synovial fluid (5–40 ng/ml). Although hepatocytes seem to be a major source of sIL-6Rα in body fluids, inflammatory cells as well as human synoviocytes and articular chondrocytes have also been shown to express and release this molecule (37Desgeorges A. Gabay C. Silacci P. Novick D. Roux-Lombard P. Grau G. Dayer J.M. Vischer T.L. Guerne P.-A. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1510-1516PubMed Google Scholar). It might be of relevance that synovial fluid levels appear to be higher (~25 ng/ml) in the joints of patients affected by inflammatory diseases than in the joints of patients with non-inflammatory diseases (~10 ng/ml) (37Desgeorges A. Gabay C. Silacci P. Novick D. Roux-Lombard P. Grau G. Dayer J.M. Vischer T.L. Guerne P.-A. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1510-1516PubMed Google Scholar). Synoviocytes and most probably chondrocytes, at least in the superficial layers, therefore have access to sIL-6Rα by diffusion, which renders them more susceptible to the effects of IL-6.Conflicting results have been obtained on the induction of TIMP-1 expression by IL-6 alone; some authors reported mild effects (20Lotz M. Guerne P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2017-2020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Sato T. Ito A. Mori Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas others observed no effects at all (47Günther M. Haubeck H.-D. van der Leur E. Blo¨ser J. Bender S. Gütgemann I. Fischer D.-G. Tscheche H. Greiling H. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These discrepancies could be due in part to the culture conditions and/or the heterogeneity of the primary cells. Among other parameters, the origin and concentration of FCS might be an important factor. Chondrocytes are known to dedifferentiate in monolayer cultures; during the first passages of the primary culture, the cells still have a chondrocytic phenotype, but it is not clear whether they are really identical to chondrocytes in vivo. For this reason and because large amounts of chondrocytes are difficult to obtain, we performed most experiments with synovial fibroblasts, another mesenchymal cell type present in joints and involved in extracellular matrix turnover and tissue destruction.Other cytokines of the IL-6 family, such as leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-11, were also tested. The stimulation of TIMP-1 production was comparable to that obtained with IL-6 alone but clearly weaker than that obtained by adding both IL-6 and sIL-6Rα (data not shown). A more extensive comparative study of the effects of IL-6 and related cytokines on TIMP-1 production by human articular chondrocytes was performed by Nemoto et al. (48Nemoto O. Yamada H. Mukaida M. Shimmei H. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). With the exception of oncostatin M, the effects of these factors were weak (48Nemoto O. Yamada H. Mukaida M. Shimmei H. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oncostatin M appeared to be a potent stimulator of TIMP-1 expression in these cells. However, taken together with the very high levels of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα in synovial fluid compared with other cytokines (38Guerne P.-A. Zuraw B.L. Vaughan J.H. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 49Okamoto H. Yamamura M. Morita Y. Harada S. Makino H. Ota Z. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the combination of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα represents one of the main stimuli of TIMP-1 production by cells involved in cartilage metabolism. More specifically, because of the marked induction of IL-6 synthesis after IL-1 or TNF-α stimulation (38Guerne P.-A. Zuraw B.L. Vaughan J.H. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), IL-6 together with sIL-6Rα probably plays a specially important role in feedback mechanisms in response to the effects of these inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, IL-6 has also been shown to enhance the synthesis of TGF-β (50Villiger P.M. Kusari A.B. Ten Dijke P. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3337-3344PubMed Google Scholar), which might reinforce these feedback circuits. The contradictory results, which have shown that IL-1, depending on the conditions, can either stimulate or inhibit the synthesis of TIMP (17Ito A. Goshowaki H. Sato T. Mori Y. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Nagase H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,19Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3079-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest interactions and indirect effects through other cytokine receptors systems, including IL-6/IL-6Rα/sIL-6Rα.In addition to its effects on TIMP, IL-6 increases the hepatic synthesis of α2-macroglobulin, another inhibitor of various proteases including collagenase and stromelysin, which further demonstrates the protective role of IL-6. Overall, these data support the concept that IL-6-related cytokines, and especially IL-6 with its soluble receptor, are important in controlling the catabolic effects of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular during remodeling processes. In this context, further studies on the effects of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα on MMP expression and proteoglycan synthesis are in progress in our laboratory and might be of particular interest. In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that IL-6 + sIL-6Rα cause the induction of collagenase 3 expression in rat osteoblast cultures (51Franchimont N. Rydziel S. Delany A.M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12144-12150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Finally, we have been able to demonstrate that synovial fibroblasts can express TIMP-3 mRNA. TIMP-3 was first isolated in chicken (Ch-imp-3) (6Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then in humans (2Apte S.S. Mattei M.G. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Wick M. Bürger C. Brüsselbach S. Lucibello F.C. Müller R. J. Biol.

Like TIMP-1 and -2, TIMP-3 inhibits MMP activity (6Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulates the division of serum-deprived cells (54Yang T.-T. Hawkes S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10676-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The observation that synovial fibroblasts express TIMP-1, -2 and -3 mRNAs raises the question of the relative importance of these proteins in synovium and cartilage metabolism. In synoviocytes, only TIMP-1 mRNA expression was increased by IL-6 and sIL-6Rα, suggesting that the potential protective effect of this cytokine receptor system is mainly mediated by TIMP-1. The differential regulation of TIMPs has already been described in normal and malignant cell lines (12Sato H. Kida Y. Mai M. Endo Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka J. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, structural analysis of the promoters of the corresponding three genes revealed a housekeeping-like structure for TIMP-2 and -3 gene promoters (9Wick M. Häro¨nen R. Mumberg D. Bürger C. Olsen B.R. Budarf M.L. Apte S.S. Müller R. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 55De Clerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both lack the classic TATA box, are rich in CG, and have multiple SP1 binding sites. On the other hand, the structure of TIMP-1 promoter possesses typical elements of inducible promoters, like phorbol ester-responsive elements, c-Fos, c-Jun, and Ets binding sites (56Uchijima M. Sato H. Fujii M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14946-14950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Campbell C.E. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 774-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results suggest that the anti-catabolic response in joint tissues is prompted to a great extent by an increased expression of TIMP-1, mediated by protective cytokines among which IL-6 together with sIL-6Rα plays a critical role. The fact that TIMP-2 and -3 are unresponsive in these conditions probably means that their role is more limited to normal cartilage turnover. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; sIL-6Rα, soluble IL-6 receptor α; SN, supernatant; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.1The abbreviations used are: TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; sIL-6Rα, soluble IL-6 receptor α; SN, supernatant; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α. are important and specific inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) activity (1Denhardt D.T. Rajan S. Walther S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These two classes of molecules play a crucial role in the fine regulation of extracellular matrix turnover, which is altered in most pathological states associated with abnormal extracellular matrix formation (i.e. fibrotic diseases) or tissue destruction (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis). TIMP proteins can bind either to the active site of MMPs, thus blocking access to the substrate, or to the precursor form, blocking further activation. So far, the sequences coding for four human TIMPs (TIMP-1, -2, and -3 and, more recently, TIMP-4) have been identified (1Denhardt D.T. Rajan S. Walther S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The expression of TIMP-1 proved to be both constitutive and inducible, whereas TIMP-2 appeared to be widely expressed but not inducible (1Denhardt D.T. Rajan S. Walther S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 12Sato H. Kida Y. Mai M. Endo Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka J. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that TIMP-3 expression is also constitutive and inducible (13Su S. Dehnade F. Zafarullah M. DNA Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 expression in differentiated chondrocytes and fibroblasts has been shown to regulated by a few growth factors or cytokines, among which transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is considered to be the most important inducer (1Denhardt D.T. Rajan S. Walther S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Roberts A.B. McCune B.K. Sporn M.B. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 557-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). On the other hand, catabolic cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the main promoters of MMPs synthesis and matrix degradation, have a marked inhibitory effect on TIMP-1 expression by chondrocytes, although some results have shown that IL-1, depending on the conditions, can either stimulate or inhibit the synthesis of TIMP-1 (15Circolo A.

IL-6 was initially considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine like TNF-α and IL-1, because of its IL-1-like effects on immune and hepatic cells. On the other hand, IL-6 has repeatedly been shown not to induce the synthesis of MMPs (20Lotz M. Guerne P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2017-2020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hauptmann B. Van Damme J. Dayer J.M. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1991; 2: 39-46PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, IL-6 can induce, in some conditions, the synthesis of TIMP-1 in human articular chondrocytes and fibroblasts (20Lotz M. Guerne P.-A. J. Biol.

Because IL-6 is one of the most abundant cytokines, synthesized in large amounts in response to IL-1 or TNF-α stimulation, this effect might represent a very important protective mechanism, an"

Spectrin contains an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of unknown function. A cDNA encoding a candidate spectrin SH3 domain-binding protein was identified by interaction screening of a human brain expression library using the human erythroid spectrin (αI) SH3 domain as a bait. Five isoforms of the αI SH3 domain-binding protein mRNA were identified in human brain. Mapping of SH3 binding regions revealed the presence of two αI SH3 domain binding regions and one Abl-SH3 domain binding region. The gene encoding the candidate spectrin SH3 domain-binding protein has been located to human chromosome 10p11.2 → p12. The gene belongs to a recently identified family of tyrosine kinase-binding proteins, and one of its isoforms is identical to e3B1, an eps8-binding protein (Biesova, Z., Piccoli, C., and Wong, W. T. (1997)Oncogene14, 233–241). Overexpression of the green fluorescent protein fusion of the SH3 domain-binding protein in NIH3T3 cells resulted in cytoplasmic punctate fluorescence characteristic of the reticulovesicular system. This fluorescence pattern was similar to that obtained with the anti-human erythroid spectrin αIΣI/βIΣI antibody in untransfected NIH3T3 cells; in addition, the anti-αIΣI/βIΣI antibody also stained Golgi apparatus. Immunofluorescence obtained using antibodies against αIΣI/βIΣI spectrin and Abl tyrosine kinase but not against αII/βII spectrin colocalized with the overexpressed green fluorescent protein-SH3-binding protein. Based on the conservation of the spectrin SH3 binding site within members of this protein family and published interactions, a general mechanism of interactions of tyrosine kinases with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton is proposed.

Based on the conservation of the spectrin SH3 binding site within members of this protein family and published interactions, a general mechanism of interactions of tyrosine kinases with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton is proposed. Erythroid spectrin is the predominant component of the two-dimensional protein network called the membrane skeleton, underlying the lipid bilayer of red cells (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Bennett V.

Interactions of spectrin with other membrane proteins such as ankyrin, protein 4.1, and adducin provide a linkage of spectrin either to the plasma membrane or among spectrin tetramers. Many hereditary anemia mutations affect interactions of these integral membrane proteins, resulting in increased fragility and shortened lifespan of erythrocytes. In hereditary elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis, the mutations have been localized in the α- and β-subunits of spectrin (reviewed in Refs. 4Lux S.E. Palek J. Handlin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P.

Distinct protein interactions are likely to involve these domains, and they may be important for specific distribution and specialized roles of brain spectrin isoforms. The SH3 domain was originally identified in the regulatory region of Src and Src-like tyrosine kinases (Abl, Fps) and then identified in other proteins, including Raf, phospholipase C, Ras GTPase-activating protein, and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, all involved in transmitting signals within cells (reviewed in Refs. 30Koch A.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The SH3 domains are involved in protein interactions thought to control signaling pathways. In Src and Abl, oncogenic mutations have been identified in the SH3 domain, indicating that this region might have a negative regulatory effect on transformation (33Hirai H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SH3 domains of several tyrosine kinases were found to bind to short proline-rich sequences containing a PXXP motif (34Cicchetti P.

Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and a general model for the SH3-ligand complex has been proposed based on NMR studies (36Yu H. Rosen M. Shin T.B.

Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The list of SH3-containing and SH3-binding proteins is rapidly growing (reviewed in Ref. 32Birge B.R. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Diversity in SH3 domains and in their ligand binding sites indicate that their binding specificities are variable and thus mediate different protein-protein interactions. In addition to αI and αII spectrin, several unrelated cytoskeletal or membrane proteins have been shown to contain the SH3 domain, including a major palmitoylated erythrocyte membrane protein p55 (38Ruff P. Speicher D.W. Husain-Chishti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mulholland J. Zhu Z. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and yeast protein BEM1, which is involved in cell polarization (40Chenevert J. Corrado K. Bender A. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1992; 356: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using interaction cloning, we identified a cDNA encoding a candidate human αI spectrin SH3 domain-binding protein. Five isoforms of the candidate mRNA were identified in human brain. Using the recombinant polypeptides, we located the αI SH3 domain and Abl-SH3 domain binding regions. Immunofluorescence studies suggest association of the αI spectrin SH3 domain-binding protein and Abl tyrosine kinase with an erythroid-like spectrin in transfected NIH3T3 cells. The candidate αI SH3-binding protein belongs to a recently identified family of tyrosine kinase-binding proteins (41Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.

In both cases, the SH3 domain sequence was fused to the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The human adult brain expression library was obtained from CLONTECH(catalog no.

Although no additional sequence was obtained at the 5′ end, the 3′-untranslated region was extended to 1044 base pairs; it contained a poly(A) addition signal, AATAAA, located 17 base pairs from the 3′ poly(A) tail. At the 5′ end of the hssh3bp1/e3B1 cDNA, the first ATG codon was located 81 base pairs downstream from the 5′EcoRI restriction site. No additional ATG codons were found following the TATA box identified in the genomic DNA fragment that hybridized to the 5′ end sequence (data not shown); therefore, it is likely that the first ATG identified in the original cDNA clone represents the translation initiation site of the candidate mRNA. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into M13mp18 or 19 or into pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced (46Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each hssh3bp1/e3B1 isoform was sequenced from two independent subclones. The variable alanine residue (see Fig. 1 A) was present in five of eight subclones. The desired regions of αI and αII spectrin were obtained by amplification using specific primers and subsequently cloned into the pGEX-2T vector using BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites incorporated into amplification products by primers. All primer sequences used for expression plasmids are listed in Table I. The plasmid GST-E-SH3 encodes residues 977–1062 of the αI spectrin that includes the SH3 domain (residues 3115–3370 in the αI cDNA; Ref. 27Sahr K.E. Laurila P. Kotula L. Scarpa A.L. Coupal E.

In this case, the termination codon was present in the vector sequences, and this resulted in addition of residues EFIVTD to the C terminus of the spectrin sequence. The construct GST-F-SH3 encodes residues 965–1025 of αII spectrin (nucleotides 2995–3177 of αSpII cDNA sequence; Ref. 29Moon R.T. McMahon A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4427-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGEX-2T plasmids expressing SH3 domains of Abl, Crk, Src and n-Src (34Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G.

Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Bruce J. Mayer (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). The 1.63-kb EcoRI fragment was obtained from the clone pGAD4-1 (isolated from the human brain expression library) and subcloned into the plasmid pGEX1λ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), plasmid C1. The other GST-hssh3bp1/e3B1 fusion plasmids are pGEX-2T subclones. Plasmids C2 and C3 were obtained by truncation of the 1.63-kb fragment at the BamHI site andNcoI site, respectively. The plasmid C12 was obtained by subcloning the HincII fragment of the 1.63-kbEcoRI fragment, clone pGAD4-1, into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T. All subsequent plasmids are subclones of amplification products obtained using specific primers listed in Table I and the clone pGAD4-1 as a template; for the plasmid C7, the PCR fragment encoding isoform 5 was used. The plasmid C4 was obtained by subcloning the amplification product digested with BamHI. The plasmid C5 was obtained by ligating the BglII-BamHI fragment obtained from the PCR amplification with theBamHI-EcoRI fragment from the plasmid C12 into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX2T and checking for the correct orientation of inserts. Plasmids C6, C8–C10, and C13 were assembled in each case by subcloning simultaneously theBamHI-BglII fragment obtained from the PCR amplification and the BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the plasmid C12 as described for C5. The plasmid C15 was assembled by annealing two complementary primers. The rest of the plasmids (C16–C19) are PCR amplification products subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of pGEX-2T. The coding sequence of hssh3bp1/e3B1 isoform 1 was obtained by PCR amplification (primers M5′ and NGFP413′) and was subcloned into the plasmid pEGFP-N3 (BglII and EcoRI sites) (CLONTECH) so that the GFP sequences were located at the C terminus of hssh3bp1/e3B1 (plasmid N3–1). The αI SH3 domain containing the same region of αI spectrin as clone GST-E-SH3 was obtained by PCR amplification (primers SH5–1 and 2E-SH3) and cloned into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the plasmid pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) (plasmid C1–2E1). In plasmid NG-1, the GFP sequence was removed from plasmid N3–1 by digestion withEcoRI and BsrGI restriction enzymes followed by the Klenow fill-in reaction and ligation. The affinity purification of GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose was followed by gel filtration using Sephacryl S-100 (47Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Speicher D.W. Curtis P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14788-14793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Biotinylation of recombinant polypeptides was performed using 6-[(6-{(biotinoyl)amino}hexanoyl)amino]hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (Biotin-XX, SE; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the filter binding assay was performed essentially as described (34Cicchetti P.

Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). All GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 strain ofEscherichia coli. Inductions of GST recombinant polypeptides were performed as described (47Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Speicher D.W. Curtis P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14788-14793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, bacterial lysates from 50 μl of induced cell cultures were solubilized and separated on SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After the transfer, blots were blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, v/v) containing 2% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated in the same buffer with biotinylated recombinant fusion proteins (0.4 μg/ml). Following incubation for 1 h at 20 °C, the blots were extensively washed with TBST buffer and incubated with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate at 1:5,000 dilution (Boehringer Mannheim) in 2% milk TBST for 1 h. After washing, the blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrates. The band located between the 19.8- and 33.5-kDa molecular mass markers, present on all blots developed with the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, most likely represents a naturally occurring biotinylated bacterial protein and has been observed previously (34Cicchetti P.

To quantitate the intensity of bands, the blots were scanned and bands were quantified using Scan Analysis software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with GFP fusion plasmids or NG-1 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24–48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with −20 °C methanol and 1 mm EGTA, and processed for imunofluorescence essentially as described in Ref. 63Holleran E.A.

Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used in all experiments; no staining of GFP alone was observed with this antibody. All images were obtained from the Texas Red channel first, and this procedure prevented possible bleed-through of GFP immunofluorescence into the Texas Red channel.

We used a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to ascertain at the molecular level whether the α1Acalcium channel isoform was also present. Results revealed two new variants of the rat brain α1A channel in the islet with divergence in a putative extracellular domain and in the carboxyl terminus. Using antibodies and cRNA probes specific for α1A channels, we found that the majority of cells in rat pancreatic islets were labeled, indicating expression of the α1A channels in β cells, the predominant islet cell type. Electrophysiologic recording from isolated islet cells demonstrated that the dihydropyridine-resistant current was sensitive to the α1A channel blocker, ω-agatoxin IVA.

Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Pharmacological and heterologous expression studies have identified selective antagonists for certain of these: ω-agatoxin IV blocks α1A, ω-conotoxin GVIA blocks α1B, and 1,4-dihydropyridines block α1C, α1D, and α1S (13Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). No selective antagonist has been identified to date for α1E calcium channels, although they are sensitive to nonselective calcium channel antagonists (e.g.ω-grammotoxin SIA and cadmium). Previous work on pancreatic β cells demonstrated that calcium influx and depolarization-evoked insulin release are blocked 60–80% by inhibitors of α1D channels (14Keahy H. Rajan A.S. Boyd A.E.

Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and 27% of the second phase insulin secretion from rat pancreatic β cells under conditions of maximal glucose stimulation (18Komatsu M.

In the presence of both ω-conotoxin GVIA and the dihydropyridine antagonist nifedipine, 25% of Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion remains, suggesting the involvement of another calcium channel type. Because α1A and α1B channels are known to colocalize within mammalian central nervous system nerve terminals and play prominent roles in neurosecretion (19Turner T.J. Adams M.E. Dunlap K. Proc. Natl.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 463-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the α1A isoform was also present in β cells and responsible for the current and insulin release that are resistant to dihydropyridines and ω-conotoxin GVIA. Here we report the full-length sequences of two unique α1A splice variants cloned from rat pancreatic islets. We demonstrate their expression in β cells and provide an initial characterization of their pharmacologic and electrophysiologic properties using tight seal whole cell recording. These channels play a role in calcium-dependent insulin secretion. Results may have significant implications for understanding, and perhaps treating, β cell disorders such as diabetes and hyperinsulinemia. Islets were isolated from male, 200–225 gm, Spraque-Dawley rats. Animals were anesthetized (Nembutol 50 mg/kg), and the pancreatic bile duct exposed, cannulated, and infused with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) in medium M199 (Life Technologies, Inc., with 5.6 gm/l HEPES, 2.2 gm/l NaHCO3). The infused pancreas was removed and incubated in a 50-ml tube submerged in a 37 °C water bath for 17 min. Tubes were shaken briefly to dissociate tissue, the digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of cooled M199 with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the tissue was shaken again to further dissociate while washing free of collagenase. The tissue was spun for 30 s (speed 3) in an ICN table-top clinical centrifuge and washed in fresh medium M199 with serum. This procedure was repeated twice to remove collagenase. After a final spin (1 min. at speed 3) to pellet the tissue, the medium was discarded, and the tissue was suspended in 10 ml of Histopaque (Sigma) and overlaid with 10 ml of M199 (without serum). The tissue was centrifuged in this gradient at 900 ×g in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant containing the islets was removed and centrifuged (speed 4, ICN centrifuge) to pellet the islets. The supernatant was discarded and the islets washed with 10 ml of M199 (with serum) twice before use. They were used intact for insulin release assays, further dissociated into single cells for electrophysiology, or homogenized for isolation of RNA. Primers were designed along the full-length of the rat brain class A channel (rbA-1, GenBankTM accession no.M64373). Regions of high homology to the rat brain α1Bchannel (rbB) were avoided. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides ranged in length from 18 to 24 bases beginning at the following 5′ nucleotides (nt) 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer. of the rbA-1 sequence: −20, 540, 1265, 1610, 2091, 2484, 2879, 3309, 3658, 4104, 4620, 5170, 5607, 5961, 6527, 7010, and 7125. Total RNA purified from homogenized rat islets (Trizol, Life Technologies, Inc.) was DNase treated (Life Technologies, Inc., amplification grade DNase) and reverse-transcribed for 30 min at 42 °C (reverse transcriptase, Perkin Elmer). GC rich regions were reverse transcribed at 50 °C (Superscript, Life Technologies, Inc. or avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 10% glycerol was used in the PCR amplification. At least two separate PCR amplifications (Taqpolymerase, Perkin Elmer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed for each primer set and 2 sense and 2 antisense strands sequenced (ABI, fluorescent-labeled automated sequencing) to ensure accuracy of sequence. To verify regions detected to diverge from rbA-1 over a ~2-kilobase region, reverse transcription of islet total RNA was performed at 50 °C for 1 h using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate longer products over GC rich regions. For this “long” PCR, primers at nt 4620 and from the rbA-1 3′ UT region were used and generated two ~2 kilobases alternatively spliced carboxyl-terminal fragments as described below. Primers were designed to yield a 587-bp product from the 3′-end (5961–6548) of coding sequence of rbA-1 (23Starr T.V.B. Prystay W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5621-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated islet RNA for reverse transcription (Perkin Elmer reverse transcriptase), and Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer) were used for cDNA amplification. Control samples, in which reverse transcriptase was omitted, were included to ensure that products had not been amplified from genomic DNA. Because the region contained a high percentage of GC-rich sequence, 10% glycerol was added to the reaction mix. The annealing temperature was 60 °C. The original 587-bp PCR product (nt 5961–6548) above was subcloned (vector pCR I, Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions. Comparison of the sequences revealed 100% nucleotide identity to rbA-1. Using this subclone as a template, digoxigenin-labeled (Boehringer Mannheim) sense and antisense RNA probes were synthesized for in situ hybridization studies of rat pancreas. Paraffin sections were mounted on slides, cleared, and hydrated before treatment with proteinase K. This was followed by equilibration in 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, to which acetic anhydride had been added. The probe was added at 4 ng/μl to the hybridization mix. Sections were incubated overnight at 60 °C in a humid chamber. Post hybridization, the slides were soaked in 2× SSC (300 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm sodium citrate), gently agitated in warm 50% formamide in 2× SSC, and transferred to 60 °C. The sections were then treated with RNase A buffer (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and RNase A at 20 μg/ml) to remove unhybridized probe. Slides were washed in 0.1× SSC at 65 °C. For color detection of labeled cells (Boehringer Mannheim Genius System), slides were blocked, washed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200–500 ml of antidigoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase. The subsequent chromagen substrate (Sigma) consisted of nitroblue tetrazolium salt and X-phos (bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate toluidinium salt). Experiments employed the antipeptide antibody, CNA-1 (generously provided by Drs. R. Westenbroek and W. A. Catterall). This antibody recognizes amino acids 865–881 in rbA-1, corresponding to nucleotides 2595–2643 (identical amino acids in the islet). 8-μm cryosections of rat pancreas were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton, washed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with CNA-1 primary antibody diluted 1:25 in Tris-buffered saline. Sections were washed, incubated with rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma, diluted 1:350 in Tris-buffered saline) for 20 min, washed again, then visualized and photographed through a Zeiss Axioplan Universal microscope. Islets were isolated as described above, dissociated in trypsin/EDTA (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mmEDTA) and cultured 1–3 days in M199 (with serum) prior to the experiments. Voltage-dependent calcium currents were examined in the whole cell configuration using pipettes fabricated from nonheparinized soda lime glass (VWR, 73811). Pipette resistances averaged ~2 megaohms with an internal solution containing 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 20 mm tetraethylammonium-OH, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 4 mm MgATP (pH 7.0) and an external solution containing 10 mm BaCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm triethanolamine, and 1.2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 1 μmtetrodotoxin, 1 μm nimodipine (pH 7.4). ω-Agatoxin IVA was applied by pressure ejection from a wide-bore (~2–3 μm) pipette positioned within 20 μm of the cell. The toxin was stored at −40 °C in 10-μl samples of 10 mm in distilled deionized water and diluted to the final working concentration in external solution immediately before use. Islets were isolated from exocrine pancreas as described above. They were selected for uniform size (150–200 μm), washed in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB, equilibrated with O2 for 30 min), evenly divided into KRB with 2.8 mm glucose (with or without 500 nmω-agatoxin IVA) and allowed to recover from isolation. The islets were incubated at 37 °C (95% O2, 5% CO2) during equilibration. After 90 min of preincubation in low glucose KRB, the islets were divided into groups of 10 islets/vial in 0.5 ml of fresh KRB, three vials for each condition (2.8 or 11 mmglucose with or without ω-agatoxin IVA). All samples were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h to promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Samples were centrifuged at 700 rpm, and 300 μl of supernatant was removed and viewed under a dissecting microscope to ensure no islet tissue was present. This sample was assayed for insulin content using ICN insulin radioimmunoassay reagents. Briefly, 100 μl of each sample or standards were added to duplicate anti-insulin antibody-coated tubes followed by 900 μl of 125I-labeled insulin diluted into buffer. In addition, control samples of toxin alone were included to ensure that the ω-agatoxin IVA did not interfere with insulin antibody binding. The samples and standards were incubated for 18 h at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and tubes were washed with double-distilled H2O and counted in a gamma counter. Sample counts were compared with the standard curve for determination of insulin concentrations. Results are reported as mean ± S.E. of the mean, and statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test. Given our goal of identifying the class A (α1A) variants in pancreatic islets, a PCR strategy was followed using primers designed along the full-length of the cloned α1A sequence from rat brain, rbA-1 (23Starr T.V.B. Prystay W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5621-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Snutch T.P. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Each product was generated twice, and both the sense and antisense strands were sequenced to ensure accuracy. Reverse transcriptase was eliminated from control samples to ensure that amplification products were from islet mRNA and not of genomic origin. The entire coding sequence was determined. From the 5′-UT to base 4806, the sequence was 100% identical to the type “a” splice variant (α1A-a) of rbA-1 (25Zamponi G.W. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2430-2443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At nt 4807, in a putative extracellular domain, there is a six base in-frame insertion in both variants described below cloned from rat islets. This insertion results in the addition of amino acids asparagine and proline (Figs.1 A and2), as previously reported for α1A in rat kidney cortex (26Yu A.S. Hebert S.C. Brenner B.M. Lytton J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10494-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and α1A-b in rat brain (25Zamponi G.W. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2430-2443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two carboxyl-terminal variants are present in the islet that have not been reported elsewhere. One, riA-1, diverges over the bases 5385–5477, altering 10 amino acids throughout the region (Figs. 1 and 2). Further 3′, the bases corresponding to 6160–6195 (in rbA-1) are deleted in riA-1. The riA-1 variant is also significantly longer than rbA-1 due to a 5-base (GCCAG) insertion before the stop codon, resulting in a frameshift (Figs. 1 and 2). This same insertion has also been described in human brain α1Achannels (27Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Bonnen P. Ashizawa T. Stockton D.W. Amos C. Dobyns W.B. Subramony S.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Lee C.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The contiguity of the observed variations in riA-1 was confirmed by generating and sequencing >2 kilobase fragments using primers at 4620 and in the 3′-untranslated region. Although combinations of these carboxyl-terminal modifications have been described in human brain partial cDNA clones (27Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Bonnen P. Ashizawa T. Stockton D.W. Amos C. Dobyns W.B. Subramony S.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Lee C.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), riA-1 is unique among known full-length clones.Figure 2Amino acid sequences of α1A variants.Primary sequences of riA-1 and riA-2 are compared with those of rbA-1a (GenBankTM accession no. M64373) and a human brain α1A (GenBankTM accession no. U79666) beginning at amino acid 1400 where divergence begins. Amino acids identical to those of rbA-1 are shaded. Deletions are noted with dashes (–). Asterisks (*) denote locations of stop codons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the other product, riA-2, the reading frame and stop codon of rbA-1 are maintained, but bases 4922–4987 and 5256–5480 are deleted (Fig.1). The latter deletion corresponds to the region of nucleotide divergence found in riA-1 and is homologous to the proposed calcium-binding, EF-hand motif in α1C (25Zamponi G.W. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2430-2443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28de Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, rat pancreatic islets appear to express two unique forms of class A channel. This represents the first molecular evidence of class A channels in islets. We have explored their expression and localization at the levels of RNA and protein, provided an initial description of their pharmacology and electrophysiology, and evaluated their role in insulin secretion. In situ hybridization methods were employed to examine the cellular localization of α1A mRNA in islets. A riboprobe was synthesized by PCR of reverse transcribed islet total RNA with class A calcium channel primers, generating a 587-bp carboxyl-terminal fragment (bp 5961–6548). No product was obtained if reverse transcriptase was omitted. This fragment, 100% identical to rbA-1 (23Starr T.V.B. Prystay W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5621-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), was subcloned and labeled with digoxigenin-UTP to generate both sense and antisense RNA probes. The majority of the cells, representing the islet core, were labeled with the antisense probe. This demonstrates that the α1A calcium channel mRNA is present in β cells, which comprise the core and ~80% of islet cells (Fig. 3 A).Islets remained unlabeled when the digoxigenin-sense probe was used (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether α1A channel protein was also present in β cells, immunohistochemistry was employed with an antipeptide antibody, CNA-1 (29Dubel S.J. Starr T.V.B. Hell J. Ahlijanian M.K. Enyeart J.J. Catterall W.A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5058-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes amino acids 865–881 of rbA-1 in the putative second intracellular loop. As the islet clones code for identical amino acids in this domain, we used CNA-1 to detect the expression of class A channels in islets. Intense staining was observed on the majority (>75%) of cells in the core of the islet, again indicating the presence of class A channel protein in β cells (Fig. 4, A and B). No staining was seen in control samples in which CNA-1 antibody had been omitted (data not shown). To test whether the rat islet class A transcripts give rise to functional channels in β cells, we recorded from dissociated islet cells using tight seal whole cell methods. Calcium channel currents were isolated with standard intra- and extracellular solutions (30Plant T.D. J. Physiol. 1988; 404: 731-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nimodipine (1 μm) was added to all extracellular solutions in order to suppress dihydropyridine-sensitive (class C/D) currents. Ba2+ (10 mm) was used as a charge carrier to enhance calcium channel currents over those observed in 1.2 mm Ca2+ (the normal extracellular concentration). β cells could be identified by the presence of small processes, as has been reported elsewhere (32Teitelman G. Dev. Biol. 1990; 121: 368-379Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following whole cell access, the cells were held at −80 mV, and 20 ms rectangular test pulses were applied. Inward Ba2+ current activated near −30 mV and was maximal at +10 mV. Peak currents (at +10 mV) varied from 50 to 400 pA. Activation was rapid (reaching peak in ~5 ms at 0 mV), inactivation was slow (with no decay in 20 ms), and deactivation was rapid (complete in ~300 μs). In these ways, the current resembled α1A currents expressed in other cell types (33Regan L.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2259-2269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34LlinaÖs R. Sugimori M. Lin J.-W. Cherksy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To determine whether these currents were, in fact, generated through class A calcium channels, we applied ω-agatoxin IVA (the selective class A channel antagonist). In 8 of 12 cells tested, ω-agatoxin IVA (1 μm) produced a significant reduction in inward current (Fig. 5, A and C). Inhibition ranged from 15 to 80% in the responsive cells with an average reduction of 48.4 ± 8.5%. The onset of toxin-induced blockade was slow (τ = 62.5 s) even at 1 μm; the dissociation rate was also slow with no recovery in 3 min (Fig.5 B). These results are consistent with the action of ω-agatoxin IVA on class A calcium currents in other cell types (35Mintz I.M. Adams M.E. Bean B.P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 36Artalejo C.R. Adams M.E. Fox A.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 37Randall A. Tsien R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2995-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrate the presence of functional class A channels in β cells. In addition, the percentage of responsive cells in the sample tested electrophysiologically is similar to that of the islet cells shown to express α1A mRNA and protein (Figs. 3and 4). The presence of significant class A current in β cells suggested the possibility that these channels play a role in exocytosis. To test this, we employed a radioimmunoassay to measure glucose-stimulated insulin release from islets, and evaluated the involvement of class A calcium channels using ω-agatoxin IVA. Islets were equilibrated for 90 min at 37 °C in KRB ± 500 nm ω-agatoxin IVA. Addition of 11 mm glucose evoked insulin release to a level of 1127% of that seen in basal glucose (2.8 mm) during a 60-min incubation period. ω-Agatoxin IVA (500 nm) diminished this glucose-stimulated insulin release to 811% of basal secretion (Fig.6 A). The inclusion of nimodipine (1 μm) in all solutions to block dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels reduced 11 mmglucose-evoked insulin release to a level 140% of that seen in basal glucose (2.8 mm). Thus, a portion of glucose-stimulated insulin release is dihydropyridine-resistant. All of the latter is mediated by Ca2+ influx through class A channels, since it is eliminated by 500 nm ω-agatoxin IVA (Fig.6 B). Control samples without islets, with ω-agatoxin IVA alone, had no counts above background, indicating the toxin does not interact with anti-insulin antibodies. These results demonstrate that class A calcium channels are effective co-regulators of insulin secretion. Our results demonstrate two new variants of the class A calcium channel in pancreatic islets and establish the presence of both mRNA and protein in β cells. We have begun to characterize the electrophysiology and demonstrate that currents through these channels resemble currents recorded through class A channels in other cells (33Regan L.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2259-2269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34LlinaÖs R. Sugimori M. Lin J.-W. Cherksy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, we show that, as in the nervous system, calcium influx through islet class A channels is coupled to exocytosis. Despite identification of several α1A splice variants and missense mutations (described below), little is known about the biophysical properties conferred by these changes. With the molecular information described here, we can begin to ascertain how specific amino acid changes influence electrical and functional properties of α1A channels. Certain of the variable regions reported here occur in clones described elsewhere, but the islet clones as a whole are unique. Zhuchenko et al. (27Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Bonnen P. Ashizawa T.

It is caused by mutations in the TGM1gene that encodes the transglutaminase 1 (TGase 1) enzyme, which is critical for the assembly of the cornified cell envelope in terminally differentiating keratinocytes. TGase 1 is a complex enzyme existing as both cytosolic and membrane-bound forms. Moreover, TGase 1 is proteolytically processed, and the major functionally active form consists of a membrane-bound 67/33/10-kDa complex with a myristoylated and palmitoylated amino-terminal 10-kDa membrane anchorage fragment. To understand better how point mutations, deletions, and truncations found in lamellar ichthyosis disease affect the structure and function of TGase 1, we have expressed in baculovirus and keratinocytes a number of reported TGase 1 mutants. The structural implications of these mutations were examined using a homology-derived three-dimensional model of TGase 1 generated from the known x-ray structure of the related coagulation factor XIIIa enzyme. The present studies demonstrate that loss of TGase 1 activity is not restricted to mutations that directly affect the enzymatic activity. We report a new class of mutations that impair the subsequent post-synthetic processing of the protein into its highly active functional forms.

The phenotype appears at birth often presenting as a translucent collodion membrane encasing the newborn but later progresses to a variety of clinical findings ranging between fine white scaling, often combined with erythroderma, to large plate-like brown scales without erythema. Other clinical findings include palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis, eclabium, ectropion, scarring alopecia, and diminished skin barrier function. Recent studies have revealed marked biochemical (7van Hoojdonk C.A.E.M. Steijlen P.M. Bergers M. Mier P.D. Traupe E. Happle R. Acta Dermato-Venerol. 1991; 71: 173-175PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hohl D.

However, all cases of the large brown plate scaling phenotype have been linked to 14q11, and several different mutations in theTGM1 gene located at this site have been identified (10Parmentier L.

The term lamellar ichthyosis (LI), the former umbrella name of the CRI group of diseases, should now be used exclusively for the CRI disease involving mutations in this gene (13Bale S.J. Russell L.J. Lee M.L. Compton J.G. DiGiovanna J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 808-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The TGM1 gene encodes transglutaminase 1 (TGase 1) which is a member of a class of enzymes that formN ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine or mono- or bis(γ-glutamyl)spermidine isopeptide bond cross-links between proteins, thereby forming stable, insoluble macromolecular assemblies (16Folk J.E.

TGase 1 is one of at least three such enzymes known to be involved in the formation of barrier function in stratified squamous epithelia, in particular in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a 15-nm thick layer of protein deposited just inside the cell periphery (18Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 107-150Google Scholar, 20Steinert P.M.

The cornified cell envelope is formed when TGases 1 and 3 (and perhaps TGase 2) cross-link a variety of structural proteins including desmosomal proteins, involucrin, the small proline-rich proteins, and loricrin in the epidermis, trichohyalin in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle, as well as other undefined proteins in the hair fiber cuticle. In vitrostudies have indicated that some substrates including loricrin and involucrin require both enzymes for apparent sequential cross-linking to form normal stabilized structures (22Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Candi E. Melino M. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This requirement may explain the phenotype of LI disease; the TGase 3 enzyme cannot replace the essential cross-linking performed by the absent TGase 1 enzyme. The TGase 1 enzyme itself shows a complex pattern of activities since it exists in multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound forms in terminally differentiating keratinocytes (25Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, whereas much of the enzyme remains in the intact, very low specific activity (zymogen) form of about 106 kDa, most activity resides in a proteolytically processed form of 67/33/10-kDa chains that are held together by secondary interactions while bound to the membrane through acyl myristate and palmitate adducts on the 10-kDa portion (26Steinert P.M.

Mutations in the TGM1 gene that produce a defective enzyme due to truncations, point substitutions, etc. are located on a number of sites along the protein. Patients can be either homozygous for a single mutation or compound heterozygous for two different mutations (10Parmentier L. Blanchet-Bardon C. Nguyen S. Prud-homme J.-F. Dubeertret L.

However, it is not yet clear how these changes affect the structure and function of TGase 1. To explore this, we have expressed in baculovirus and keratinocytes a number of reported mutant TGase 1 forms to study their activity and processing properties. Also we have examined the likely structural consequences of the mutations by comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of the related factor XIIIa (fXIIIa) enzyme. All recombinant DNA technology was done according to standard procedures (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmam J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

This was then used as a template for the eight mutant forms (see Table I) that correspond to mutations seen in LI patients selected in this study. The TransformerTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) based on the method described by Deng and Nickoloff (31Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal.

Protein sequence numbers were counted from the first amino acid following the initiation codon.1-b bp, base pair Open table in a new tab The TGase 1 cDNAs in the pVL1392 vector were under the transcriptional control of the strong baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. The nine TGase 1 recombinant virus clones (wild type and eight mutant forms) were obtained by co-transfection of each vector with the modified Autographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold DNA, PharMingen). BaculoGold DNA carries a lethal deletion and does not code for viable virus particles by itself. Co-transfection of this DNA with a complementing plasmid construct rescues the lethal deletion of this virus DNA and reconstitutes, by homologous recombination, viable virus particles inside the transfected insect cells (32Summers, M. D. & Smith, G. E. (1987) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vector and Insect Culture Procedures, Bulletin Number 1555, Texas Agricultural Experimental StationGoogle Scholar). Insect cells (Sf9, PharMingen) were grown in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). In the co-transfection experiments, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes. Two μg of each of the nine vectors was separately mixed with 0.5 μg of linearized viral BaculoGold DNA and incubated for 10 min at 23 °C. After incubation, 1 ml of transfection buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 125 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl) was added to each tube and mixed. The DNA/transfection buffer mixtures were added to plates that contained 1 ml of regular medium and incubated at 27 °C for 3–4 h. At the end of the transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh Grace's insect medium, and the cells were kept for 5 days at 27 °C. The medium containing the nine recombinant virus clones was amplified to produce a high titer stock solution, and the titers (1–8 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml) were evaluated by end point dilution. For protein production, cells were maintained and infected, either as monolayer or in suspension, in a rotary shaker, with 1–4 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml of culture at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells (>95% viability) per ml of culture. Expression of the nine recombinant TGase 1 clones was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Protein production was detected by Western blot using a specific polyclonal TGase 1 antibody (33Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Yoneda K. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For lipid modification experiments, Sf9 cells were metabolically labeled (1 mCi each/ml of medium) with [14C]palmitate or [14C]myristate (NEN Life Science Products, 650 Ci/mol). The labels were added 4 h prior to harvesting. The wild type and four mutant TGase 1 cDNA clones (R141H, R322Q, S41Y, and R314L) were excised at the NotI and XbaI sites from pVL1392 vector and directly subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV (CLONTECH), under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate enhancer/promoter. In addition, a tag of histidine residues had been attached to the carboxyl-terminal end of the wild type and the two active mutant TGase 1 clones (S41Y, R314L). We generated these clones by polymerase chain reaction amplifying with standard conditions (34Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from TGase 1 cDNA vectors used for baculovirus expression. The polymerase chain reaction primers were designed with an extension of 16 nucleotides containing NotI site at the 5′-end (plus primer, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCATGGATGGGCCACGTTCCGATGTGGGCCGTTG-3′) and an extension of 18 nucleotides that encode for six histidine residues followed by a termination codon TGA and BamHI site at the 3′-end (minus primer, 5′-TGCTCTAGACTAATGATGATGATGATGATGAGCTCCACCTCGAGATGCCATAGGGA-3′). The modified clones were sequenced to verify amplification efficacy and then assembled into the mammalian expression vector pCMV for transfection studies. These cultures were labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine as described below since we found that the polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (Sigma) also immunoprecipitated processed forms of profilaggrin and filaggrin that are expressed in cultured NHEK cells in differentiating conditions; these proteins do not contain cysteine or methionine (35Gan S.-Q. Idler W.W. McBride O.W. Markova N.G. Steinert P.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8432-9440Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cryopreserved normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were obtained fromCLONTECH (San Diego, CA) and grown in calf skin collagen (Sigma)-coated dishes in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics) at 0.05 mm Ca2+, supplemented with 60 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract. Third passage cells were used for transfection experiments. Transient transfections were performed in triplicate using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described previously (36Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly 2–3 × 105 cells were plated in each 35-mm well of six-well culture plates 16–20 h before transfection. Transfections were done when cultures had reached 70% confluency. Transfection efficiencies were always monitored by use of a cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase construct (pCMV-β,CLONTECH). Cells were washed once at 37 °C with phosphate-buffered saline and then preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with keratinocyte serum-free medium. For each well, 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β were mixed with 6 μg of Lipofectin and incubated for 20 min at 23 °C. The lipid/DNA mixture was then added into each well and incubated for 3–4 h. After that, medium was removed, and to improve transfection efficiencies, cells were shocked with 15% glycerol in keratinocyte serum-free medium for 3 min. Medium containing either 0.05 or 1.2 mmCa2+ was then replaced. Some transfection experiments were performed in 60- or 100-mm dishes, with proportional increase in seeding densities, amounts of plasmids, and Lipofectin. In some cases cells were harvested 50–120 h post-transfection, and in labeling experiments 6 h prior to harvesting, 2 μCi/ml of a mixture of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 14.3 mCi/ml) was added. In one set of experiments to measure half-lives, this amount of isotope was added to the cultures immediately following transfection (25Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

Cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim) that included 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml benzanidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and the suspension was homogenized by sonication. The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and particulate fractions. The particulate fractions were washed with lysis buffer, and then membrane-bound proteins were extracted into lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, solubilized proteins were separated by membrane debris and washed with lysis buffer to remove the detergent (37Michel S. Bernerd F. Jetten A.M. Floyd E.F. Shroot B. Reichert U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions were used for TGase assay, TGase immunoprecipitation, column chromatography, and for protein quantification, using methods described previously (25Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Where necessary, TGase activities were normalized by protein content and β-galactosidase activity. The final data are the average of at least three independent experiments, each with duplicate samples. Cross-linked cell bodies were harvested following exhaustive extraction in SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol as for the preparation of cornified cell envelopes (20Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 21Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

Membrane-bound TGase 1 was isolated from the particulate fraction of Sf9 cells exactly as described above. Recombinant 35S-loricrin was used as a complete substrate as described previously (24Candi E. Melino M. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

In the cross-linking experiment 25 μg of labeled loricrin (about 8 × 104dpm) was utilized in a 100-μl reaction volume, and the amount of recombinant baculovirus TGase 1 that incorporated 0.7 pmol/min [14C]putrescine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 118 mCi/mmol) into casein was used. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 mm CaCl2. Aliquots were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA after 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. The cross-linked products were separated on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography. The three-dimensional model of human TGase 1 was generated on the basis of the known atomic structure of human factor XIIIa (fXIIIa) as present in the Protein Data Base (38Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F.

By using loop-search and debumping options, the resulting model for TGase 1 was then optimized at positions where deletions (Ser125, Gly187, and Pro505) or non-conservative substitutions occurred, respectively. Residues Gly96-Gly106 of TGase 1 including the 97NAAGDG102 hexapeptide were modeled manually onto residues Asn18-Glu30 of the fXIIIa activation peptide. Pictures were generated with the INSIGHTII software. The purpose of the present work was to explore the structural-functional consequences of some of the known mutations of the TGM1 gene seen in LI. Data from protein expression and transfection studies were combined with structural information from a predicted three-dimensional model of the TGase 1 enzyme based on the known crystal structure of the related factor XIIIa enzyme. The TGase 1 mutations studied in the present work are listed in Table I, and as our data show, they offer a spectrum of alterations affecting the enzyme and afford new insights into the molecular basis of LI disease. We expressed in the baculovirus system the human wild type TGase 1 cDNA and the eight mutant forms that have been reported in LI which are listed in Table I. Protein expression was evident from 48 h postinfection and reached a maximum at 72 h (Fig. 1,A and B). Western blot analyses using a specific polyclonal anti-human TGase 1 antibody revealed that the recombinant enzymes were not proteolytically processed in this system and remained as the full-length protein with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The mutation M422stop generated a truncated protein of size about 55 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B). As has been observed in NHEK cells, the baculovirus-expressed TGase 1 (wild type and mutant forms) was present in both the cytosol and membrane-bound fractions. About 90% of each of eight recombinant proteins was retained in the latter (data not shown), which is very similar to the distribution of the TGase 1 enzymes in proliferating basal epidermal keratinocytes or stationary NHEK cells grown in low Ca2+ submerged liquid cultures (26Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The one exception was mutant form S41Y, in which about half of the protein was present in the cytosol (see Fig. 4 F). The recombinant baculovirus-expressed wild type TGase 1 was also modified by lipids (Fig. 1 C). The labeling of the cytosolic and membrane-bound enzyme forms with myristate indicates the protein was constitutivelyN-myristoylated as in keratinocytes (27Steinert P.M. Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I.

The weak incorporation of palmitate also implies partial S-acylation by myristate and palmitate. Similar data were obtained for the R141C"
https://openalex.org/W1990983590,"A large number of FAD-containing proteins have previously been shown to contain a signature sequence that is referred to as the dinucleotide binding motif. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO), the penultimate enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, is an FAD-containing protein that catalyzes the six electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX. Sequence analysis demonstrates the presence of the dinucleotide binding motif at the amino-terminal end of the protein. Analysis of the current data base reveals that PPO has significant sequence similarities to mammalian monoamine oxidases (MAO) A and B, as well as to bacterial and plant phytoene desaturases (PHD). Previously MAOs have been shown to contain FAD, but there are no publications demonstrating the presence of FAD in purified PHDs. We have carried out the expression and purification of PHD from the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and demonstrate the presence of noncovalently bound FAD. Sequence analysis demonstrate that PPO is closely related to bacterial PHDs and more distantly to plant PHDs and animal MAOs. Interestingly bacterial MAOs are no more closely related to PPOs, PHDs, and animal MAO's than they are to the unrelatedPseudomonas phenyl hydroxylase. All of the related sequences contain not only the basic putative dinucleotide binding motif that is found frequently for FAD-binding proteins, but they also have high similarity in an approximately 60-residue long region that extends beyond the dinucleotide motif. This region is not found among any other proteins in the current data base and, therefore, we propose that this region is a signature motif for a superfamily of FAD-containing enzymes that is comprised of PPOs, animal MAOs, and PHDs.

The ability to synthesize tetrapyrroles is one that is found almost universally in living organisms. One of the most abundant of the biological tetrapyrroles synthesized by Bacteria and Eucarya is protoporphyrin IX or one of its derivatives. Within organisms that possess the ability to synthesize protoporphyrin there appear to exist two mechanisms to catalyze the six electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin. For facultative or anaerobic bacteria there exists a multienzyme complex that is linked to the cell's respiratory chain (1Jacobs N.J. Jacobs J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Currently both systems are named protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) 1The abbreviations used are: PPO, protoporphyrinogen oxidase; MAO, monoamine oxidase; PHD, phytoene desaturases. although it is now clear that the biochemical properties of the proteins and the cofactor involvements are distinct. The oxygen-dependent PPO (EC 1.3.3.4) has been cloned, sequenced, expressed, and purified from both bacterial and mammalian sources (6Dailey T.A. Meissner P. Dailey H.A. J. Biol.

Res. 1997; 43: 67-73Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that this protein is an FAD-containing homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of approximately 50,000. This enzyme is of considerable interest for several reasons. In plants this protein is the target of a large class of commercial herbicides (13Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Sherman T.D. Duke S.O. Plant. Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 97: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Matringe M. Camadro J.M. Labbe P. Scalla R. Biochem.

In addition, PPO is interesting from a biochemical standpoint since it is an enzyme with only a single FAD, and yet it catalyzes a six electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX (11Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As one approach to learn more about this enzyme data base searches of Swiss Prot release 32, TIGR, and GenBankTM were carried out to determine if PPO was unique or if it is similar to another class of enzymes that are better characterized structurally. The analysis presented below demonstrates that there exists significant sequence similarities between PPO, monoamine oxidases (MAO), and phytoene desaturases (PHD). Although data have previously been presented demonstrating that PPO (7Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Dailey H.A. Dailey T.A. J.

Breakefield X.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 391-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) contain FAD, no such information was available for a PHD. Herein we report the expression, purification, and demonstration that the bacterial PHD fromMyxococcus xanthus contains an FAD. The finding of similarity between PPOs and PHDs is of interest since these two enzymes are the known targets of photoactive herbicides. Data presented also suggest that PPO, MAO, and PHD are members of a superfamily of FAD-containing proteins that possess a unique fingerprint motif spanning approximately 60 amino acid residues. The plasmid pMAR140, containing the coding region for M. xanthus phytoene desaturase, was a gift of Dr. L. J. Shimkets. Primers were designed to carry out the polymerase chain reaction of the gene introducing convenient restriction sites for cloning into the histidine-tagged expression vector pTrcHisC (Invitrogen). Specifically, the sense primer was 5′- GTTAAGGCTAGC AGTGCATCGACACAGGGCAGG-3′, where anNheI site, shown in bold, was introduced for cloning purposes. The coding region of the phytoene desaturase gene, corresponding to the first 7 amino acids after the 1st methionine in the sequence, are underlined. The antisense primer was 5′-GAAATCAAGCTTGTCACGCGGCCACCCCTTCCAG-3′, in which a HindIII site, shown in bold, was introduced for cloning purposes. The 3′-end of the gene, including the TGA stop codon, is underlined. The polymerase chain reaction conditions were as follows: 3 min 95° (1 min 95°, 1 min 62°, 2 min 72°) × 30, 7 min 72°, using 100 μm of each primer and Taqpolymerase (Fisher Biotech). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega) to facilitate cleavage by restriction enzymes, and the resulting plasmid digested with NheI and HindIII to release the phytoene desaturase DNA. The DNA fragment was then cloned into theNheI/HindIII site of pTrcHisC. The resulting plasmid was named pPDH. A 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli JM109 containing pPDH was grown at 37 °C overnight with shaking in Circlegrow (Bio101, Inc) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 60 ml resuspension buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.2% w/v β-octylglucoside). Additional β-octylglucoside was added to bring the final concentration to 1.0%, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The cells were sonicated 4 × 30 s on high power at 4 °C, and then centrifuged 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a Talon (CLONTECH) column that was formed from 3.5 ml of a 50% slurry that had been equilibrated with resuspension buffer. The column was then washed with 20 ml of resuspension buffer, 20 ml of resuspension buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, and then 30 ml of resuspension buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The purified protein was eluted in resuspension buffer containing 300 mm imidazole, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. An initial search of the Swiss Prot data base was done using BLASTP and Wordsearch (20Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8. Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin1994Google Scholar) with the sequence of human protoporphyrinogen oxidase (7Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as a probe. Elimination of all sequences lacking an obvious putative dinucleotide binding motif (21Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) yielded 54 unique protein sequences. Sequence comparisons were carried out by using GCG PileUp (20Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8. Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin1994Google Scholar) using the program's default values for gap creation and extension penalties. From this initial list those sequences with an amino-terminal dinucleotide binding motif, such as PPO possesses, were selected for further study. These 32 sequences along with the PPO sequence for Deinococcus radiodurans(from TIGR) were submitted to a second PileUp before being phylogenetically sorted using GCG Growtree. All known PPO sequences were included in this analysis. Phenol hydroxylase ofPseudomonas was included in this analysis as an outlying, nonrelated sequence to root the trees. This hydroxylase is an FAD-containing protein, but it lacks the dinucleotide binding motif that the other proteins in this analysis possess. Manipulations of sequence length (i.e. truncation of amino or carboxyl-terminal segments to obtain similar protein sizes) had no significant effect on the overall clustering, but for the analysis displayed, the amino-terminal ends (upstream from the dinucleotide binding motif) were truncated from the bacterial MAO sequences. Both Jukes-Cantor and Kimura distance corrections were employed and Growtrees for both neighbor-joining and unweighted pairs group method using arithmetic averages were created. After the cloning, expression, and purification of PPO (6Dailey T.A. Meissner P. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 813-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A.

Res. 1997; 43: 67-73Google Scholar) an analysis of the current data base was performed to identify any related proteins. The analysis yielded a number of interesting results. First of these was the similarity of PPO to both MAO A and MAO B, and PHD. Previously we had reported that PPO had physical properties similar to mammalian MAOs so a close association between PPOs and MAOs was anticipated (7Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Among the similarities are that both proteins are nuclear encoded, contain FAD as a cofactor, have a dinucleotide binding motif near the amino terminus, are homodimers with similar subunit molecular sizes, and are mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins that lack a typical amino-terminal targeting sequence. Two major differences between the enzymes are that MAOs catalyze a single two-electron redox step and contain a covalently bound FAD (see Ref.19Weyler W. Hsu Y.-P.P. Breakefield X.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 391-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), whereas the overall reaction catalyzed by protoporphyrinogen oxidase is a six-electron oxidation (Scheme I) and the protein contains a noncovalently bound FAD (see Ref. 11Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Protoporphyrinogen oxidaseprotoporphyrinogen+3O2→[tetrahydroprotoporphyrin→dihydroprotoporphyrin]→protoporphyrin+3H2O2Phytoene desaturasephytoene→[phytofluene→tetrahydrolycopene]→neurosporeneMonoamine oxidaseO∥R­CH2−NH2+H2O+O2→R­CH+H2O2+NH3SCHEMEITo facilitate presentation of over 30 protein sequences and to determine the amount of relatedness of other proteins, a Growtree analysis was performed. As described above, four different analyses were performed: two corrected neighbor-joining, and two corrected unweighted pairs group method using arithmetic averages. Although some variations in relative distances existed among the four trees, all produced the same clustering pattern. The data revealed that two distinct classes of enzymes have structural homology to PPO: animal MAO and PHD (dehydrogenases) (Fig. 1). The pattern places all PPOs in a cluster most closely linked to a cluster of bacterial PHD and more distantly related to mammalian MAO (A and B forms) and plant PHD. The finding of a close linkage between PPO and PHDs was not anticipated since published reports on PHDs had not demonstrated the presence of FAD. The genes for PHD have been cloned and sequenced from a number of plants and bacteria (see Refs. 22Sandmann G. Physiol. Plant. 1991; 83: 186-193Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 23Armstrong G.A. Hearst J.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The plant PHDs (referred to as pds type PHDs) catalyze the oxidation of phytoene to ζ carotene, a four-electron oxidation that may utilize molecular oxygen, whereas bacterial PHDs (referred to as CrtI type PHDs) convert phytoene all the way to lycopene (an eight-electron oxidation), or to neurosporene (a six-electron oxidation) in reactions that are not stimulated by molecular oxygen (see Ref. 23Armstrong G.A. Hearst J.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The protein from the bacteriaRhodobacter sphaeroides (24Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Gardiner A.T. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3859-3869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R. capsulatus(25Raisig A. Bartly G. Scolnik P. Sandmann G. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which both form neurosporene as product, have been cloned and expressed. The expressed R. capsulatus PHD has been purified to near homogeneity although purification yields were quite low (25Raisig A. Bartly G. Scolnik P. Sandmann G. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These enzymes are membrane associated and difficult to purify and assay. Because of these factors there are no definitive studies on the enzyme mechanism. Enzymatic studies on the CrtI protein of R. spheroides and R. capsulatus do, however, demonstrate that the enzyme catalyzes three desaturations of phytoene to yield neurosporene (Scheme I). In this regard it is similar to PPO, which also carries out a six-electron oxidation. Purified PHD of R. capsulatus was shown to be stimulated by FAD but not NAD(P) (25Raisig A. Bartly G. Scolnik P. Sandmann G. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because of the predicted sequence similarity of PHDs to PPOs and MAOs, and the lack of information on PHD, we chose to express and characterize a bacterial PHD from Myxococcus xanthus, which catalyzes a reaction similar to the R. capsulatus enzyme, to determine if its physical properties are similar to those of PPOs and MAOs. The expression of M. xanthus PHD as a histidine-tagged protein allowed for rapid purification of the protein when we used a procedure that our laboratory has worked out to purify PPOs. The molecular weight of purified PHD is 60,000 as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2), which is in agreement with the predicted size of 58,600. The calculated extinction coefficient for the apoprotein is 57,000 m−1at 278 nm and the pI is 9.7. The protein as purified contains noncovalently bound 0.5 flavin/monomer of PHD (Fig.3), and this was identified as FAD by the pH-dependent fluorescence (26Koziol J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18B: 2697-2701Google Scholar). No redox active metals were found associated with PHD. As isolated from the expression system inE. coli, PHD contains a small and variable amount of porphyrin. This amount of bound porphyrin represents a few percent of the total PHD present, but because of the presence of porphyrin and the similarities with PPO, PHD was assayed for PPO activity. PHD was found to have no significant PPO activity, and the PHD expression vector did not complement E. coli SAS38X cells, which lack PPO activity (27Sassarman A. Letowski J. Czaika G. Ramirez V.

However, the observations that carotenoid biosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria is maximal during anaerobic photosynthetic growth (28Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and that mRNA levels for this enzyme in R. sphaeroides are decreased under aerobic conditions (24Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Gardiner A.T. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3859-3869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but are unchanged under the same conditions in R. capsulata (29Armstrong G.A. Cook D.N. Ma D. Alberti M. Burke D.H. Hearst D.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) do raise questions that may be addressed experimentally now that the protein can be expressed and purified. As shown in the Growtree analysis (Fig. 1), mammalian MAOs cluster together as would be expected, but, interestingly, the bacterial MAOs are quite distinct phylogenetically. In fact the bacterial MAOs appear no more closely linked to animal MAOs than to phenol hydroxylase. One point of interest is the presence of an unidentified yeast open reading frame (P32614) in this analysis. Yeast PPO is identified and is present in this analysis, and yeast have been reported to not produce MAO, so the identity of this putative protein will be of interest when it is identified. Sequences for plant phytoene desaturases were also found in the present analysis even though it has previously been reported that these enzymes are biochemically distinct from the microbial phytoene desaturases (see Refs. 23Armstrong G.A. Hearst J.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and 30Linden H. Misawa N. Saito T. Sandmann G. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whereas it is clear from sequence analysis that these two groups of enzymes are distinct, it appears that they all are members of a protein superfamily. Examination of the putative dinucleotide binding motif sequences (Fig. 4) clearly shows that significant identity and close homologies exist among all of the enzymes and that this identity extends past the requisite Glu (or Asp) (21Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). When a Growtree analysis of this approximately 60-residue long segment is carried out using the same parameters described above the cluster pattern found in the tree is very similar to that obtained when one uses the complete protein sequences (Fig. 1). The only significant change is that the sequence for Myxococcushydroxyneurosporine dehydrogenase becomes clustered with protoporphyrinogen oxidase sequences. Such findings suggest that members of this superfamily arose via divergence from a common ancestor and did not acquire the dinucleotide motif from a gene fusion event. One interesting feature of the alignment examination is that a consensus sequence exists that includes the dinucleotide binding motif and spans approximately 60 residues (Fig. 4). The consensus sequence found is:U 4G(G/A)GUXGL(X 2)(A/S)(X 2)L(X 6–12)UX(L/V)UE(X 4)UGG(X 9–13)(G/V)(X 3)(D/E)XG, where X stands for any residue and U stands for a hydrophobic residue. This suggests that either the actual dinucleotide binding motif region is larger than previously considered (21Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) or that the currently demonstrated consensus sequence may represent a signature motif for this superfamily of proteins. Examination of the sequences of a variety of proteins other than PPO, MAO, and PHDs that have been shown to possess a dinucleotide binding motif indicates that the additional region of identity is not present (data not shown) and, therefore, this consensus sequence is a fingerprint motif for this particular superfamily of enzymes. Assigning a role to this motif is not easy without protein structure information but it is possible to reasonably rule out some possibilities based upon what we currently know about these three types of enzymes. It does appear clear that the motif region would not be involved specifically in interactions with molecular oxygen since not all PHDs utilize oxygen directly as an electron acceptor. A role in dinucleotide binding likewise seems unlikely since a large number of proteins are known to possess the currently identified dinucleotide binding motif (21Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) and do not contain the additional residues reported here, and a role for the motif in substrate recognition is unanticipated considering the wide variety of substrates utilized by the three enzymes. Perhaps then the answer lies simply in a structural role that links these proteins temporally in evolution. One point of interest concerning PPO and PHD are that these two enzymes are both sites of action of plant herbicides. PPOs are the target of diphenyl ether type of herbicides (13Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Sherman T.D. Duke S.O. Plant. Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1991; 97: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Matringe M. Camadro J.M. Labbe P. Scalla R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These compounds kill plants via a light-dependent destruction of plant cells that have accumulated free protoporphyrin. PHDs are the target of photobleaching herbicides that act by inhibiting PHD, and thus carotenoid synthesis (31Bo¨ger P. Sandmann G. Photosynthetica ( Prague ). 1993; 28: 481-493Google Scholar). Inhibition of PHD allows the build up of colorless saturated carotenoid precursor that absorb in the UV and generates singlet oxygen. These classes of herbicides comprise two of the largest groups of currently utilized plant herbicides, but at the present time their exact mode of action is unknown. It has been suggested that diphenyl ether herbicides may be substrate analogs for PPO but lack of purified PHD preparations has slowed research on these enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W1973596141,"Bombesin (Bn) receptor subtype 3 (BRS-3) is an orphan receptor that is a predicted member of the heptahelical G-protein receptor family and so named because it shares a 50% amino acid homology with receptors for the mammalian bombesin-like peptides neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide. In a recent targeted disruption study, in which BRS-3-deficient mice were generated, the mice developed obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. To date, BRS-3's natural ligand remains unknown, its pharmacology unclear, and cellular basis of action undetermined. Furthermore, there are few tissues or cell lines found that express sufficient levels of BRS-3 protein for study. To define the intracellular signaling properties of BRS-3, we examined the ability of [d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14), a newly discovered peptide with high affinity for BRS-3, and various Bn receptor agonists and antagonists to alter cellular function in hBRS-3-transfected BALB 3T3 cells and hBRS-3-transfected NCI-H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cells, which natively express very low levels of hBRS-3. This ligand stimulated a 4–9-fold increase in [3H]inositol phosphate formation in both cell lines under conditions where it caused no stimulation in untransfected cells and also stimulated an increase in [3H]IP1, [3H]IP2, and 3H]IP3. The elevation of [3H]IP was concentration-dependent, with an EC50 of 20–35 nm in both cell lines. [d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) stimulated a 2–3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i, a 3-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK with an EC50 of 0.2–0.7 nm, but failed to either stimulate increases in cyclic AMP or inhibit forskolin-stimulated increases. None of nine naturally occurring Bn peptides or three synthetic Bn analogues reported to activate hBRS-3 did so with high affinity. No high affinity Bn receptor antagonists had high affinity for the hBRS-3 receptor, although two low affinity antagonists for gastrin-releasing peptide and NMB receptors, [d-Arg1,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P and [d-Pro4,d-Trp7,9,10]substance P-(4–11), inhibited hBRS-3 receptor activation. The NMB receptor-specific antagonistd-Nal,Cys,Tyr,d-Trp,Lys,Val, Cys,Nal-NH2 inhibited hBRS-3 receptor activation in a competitive fashion (K i = 0.5 μm). Stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by hBRS-3 activation was not inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203X, or thapsigargin, alone or in combination. These results show that hBRS-3 receptor activation increases phospholipase C activity, which causes generation of inositol phosphates and changes in [Ca2+]i and is also coupled to tyrosine kinase activation, but is not coupled to adenylate cyclase activation or inhibition. hBRS-3 receptor activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, and it is not dependent on activation of either limb of the phospholipase C cascade. Although the natural ligand is not a known bombesin-related peptide, the availability of [d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14), which functions as a high affinity agonist in conjunction with hBRS-3-transfected cell lines and the recognition of three classes of receptor antagonists including one with affinity of 0.5 μm, should provide important tools to assist in the identification of its natural ligand, the development of more potent selective receptor antagonists and agonists, and further exploration of the signaling properties of the hBRS-3 receptor.

As opposed to GRP receptors and NMB receptors, which have widespread distribution in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues (1Tache Y. Melchiorri P. Negri L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In a recent study in which BRS-3-deficient mice were generated by targeted disruption, the mice were obese, developed hypertension, and had diabetes, suggesting the BRS-3 receptor is required for regulation of glucose metabolism, energy balance, and maintenance of blood pressure (40Ohki-Hamazaki H.

To date, the natural ligand for BRS-3 is undiscovered, and its intracellular signaling mechanisms are largely unknown. This uncertainty has occurred because no cells have been identified that natively express sufficient numbers of BRS-3 receptors to allow study of intracellular coupling, and no high affinity ligands have been discovered for this receptor. It is known, however, that when the BRS-3 receptor was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (35Fathi Z. Corjay M.H. Shapira H. Wada E. Benya R. Jensen R. Viallet J. Sausville E.A. Battey J.F. J. Biol.

To overcome these problems, we have recently used two different strategies to create two different cell lines stably expressing this receptor. These cell lines were used to screen various bombesin peptides for their ability to activate phospholipase C and a synthetic analogue of bombesin, [d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14), was identified which has high affinity for the BRS-3 receptor (42Mantey S.A.

Using an analogue of this peptide that could be radiolabeled, [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14), we demonstrated that both cells lines stably expressing the BRS-3 receptor share the same unique pharmacology for naturally occurring bombesin peptides and a high affinity for [d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (42Mantey S.A.

After rechromatography to achieve ≥97% purity, the peptides were characterized by amino acid analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy (Finnegan, Hemel Hemstead, United Kingdom). NCI-H1299 cells expressing stably transfected hBRS-3 were obtained using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) to introduce human BRS-3 cDNA containing an NH2-terminal flag epitope tag (5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3′) subcloned into the expression vectors pCD2 and pcDNA3 as described previously (42Mantey S.A.

Both wild-type BALB 3T3 cells and NCI-H1299 cell lines were grown in DMEM and RPMI 1640 respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS. The transfected cells were grown in their respective propagation media supplemented with 300 μg/ml G418 sulfate. All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were subcultured into 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in their respective propagation media. Total [3H]IP was determined as described previously (30Benya R.V. Wada E. Battey J.F. Fahti Z.

Briefly, after a 24-h incubation period at 37 °C, the cells were incubated with 3 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol in growth medium supplemented with 2% FBS for an additional 24 h. Incubation volumes were 500 μl of assay buffer/well containing 135 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm calcium chloride, 1.2 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm lithium chloride, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.05% BSA (v/v) with or without any of the peptides studied at 37 °C for 30 min. To determine the time course of [3H]IP1, [3H]IP2, and [3H]IP3 formation, 75-cm2 flasks of confluent hBRS-3-transfected BALB 3T3 cells labeled withmyo-[2-3H]inositol were scraped, centrifuged (300 × g, 10 min), resuspended in 10 ml of PBS with 20 mm lithium chloride, and incubated for 10 min (37 °C). After resuspension in 20 ml of assay buffer, 500-μl aliquots of cell suspension were added to tubes containing 100 nm[d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Experiments were terminated with 1 ml of ice-cold hydrochloric acid/methanol (0.1%, v/v).

Each of the eluates was collected and mixed with 10 ml of Hydrofluor scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Cells harvested by scraping were resuspended in an assay buffer (24.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 98 mm sodium chloride, 6 mm potassium chloride, 2.5 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm sodium fumarate, 5 mm sodium glutamate, 2 mm glutamine, 11.5 mm glucose, 1.45 mm calcium chloride, 1.15 μm magnesium chloride, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.2% (v/v) amino acid mixture, and 0.2% BSA) to a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing two times with assay buffer, 2 ml of cell suspension were placed in a Delta PTI Scan 1 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) equipped with a stir bar and water bath (37 °C). Fluorescence was measured at dual excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm using an emission wavelength of 510 nm. The calcium concentration was calculated using the method of Grynkiewicz et al.

Full-length constructs of the proteins of Neurospora crassa andSaccharomyces cerevisiae (ncVDAC and scVDAC) have been made with 20-residue-long, thrombin-cleavable, His6-containing N-terminal extensions. ncVDAC purified from bacteria or mitochondria displays a far-UV CD spectrum (in 1% lauryl dimethylamine oxide at pH 6–8) similar to that of bacterial porins, indicating extensive β-sheet structure. Under the same conditions, the CD spectrum of bacterially expressed scVDAC indicates lower β-sheet content, albeit higher than that of mitochondrial scVDAC under the same conditions. In phospholipid bilayers, the bacterially expressed proteins (with or without N-terminal extensions) form typical VDAC-like channels with stable, large conductance open states (4–4.5 nanosiemens in 1m KCl) and voltage-dependent transitions to a predominant substate (about 2 nanosiemens). A variant of scVDAC missing the first eight residues and having no N-terminal extension also has been expressed in E. coli. The truncated protein has a CD spectrum similar to that of mitochondrial scVDAC, but its channel activity is abnormal, exhibiting an unstable open state and rapid transitions between multiple subconductance levels.

Although VDAC proteins from different species have only weak sequence homology, their functional properties are highly conserved (1De Pinto V. Ludwig O. Krause J. Benz R. Palmieri F. Biochim.

In artificial lipid bilayers, the channel occupies a high conductance, anion-selective open state (4–4.5 nS in 1 mKCl) at small membrane potentials and switches, at potential amplitudes above 30–40 mV, to lower conductance substates (2–2.5 nS) that are cation-selective and less permeable to ATP and ADP (3Benz R.

The critical potential at which gating occurs is decreased in the presence of polyanions and a soluble mitochondrial protein fraction (6Colombini M. Yeung C.L. Tung J. Ko¨nig T. Biochim. Biophys.

VDAC sequences from a number of species contain numerous stretches of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (e.g. see Refs. 8Forte M. Guy H.R. Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg.

Analysis of VDAC sequences with the Gibbs sampler indicates the presence of numerous matches to a residue-frequency motif associated with transmembrane β-strands in bacterial porins (12Mannella C.A. Neuwald A.F. Lawrence C.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 161-167Google Scholar). Circular dichroism studies of VDAC purified fromNeurospora crassa in both lipids and nondenaturing detergents (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggest that ncVDAC has a high β-sheet content, consistent with a bacterial porin-like β-barrel structure (e.g. see Ref. 14Markovic-Housley Z. Garavito R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The main focus of our research is to determine the molecular basis for VDAC's functional properties, in particular, its permeability and mechanism of gating. In this report, we describe the bacterial expression of functional VDAC from Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand N. crassa and compare the effects of N-terminal extension and truncation on the properties of this channel protein. Mitochondria were isolated from liquid cultures of wall-less N. crassa (FGSC 326) and from blocks of dry S. cerevisiae (Red Star) (15Mannella C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Trembath M.K. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise, and solutions were made with reagent-grade deionized water (Milli-Q system, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). VDAC was purified using a procedure modified from that of Shao et al. (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial suspensions were solubilized at room temperature in 20 ml of 2× Buffer A (4% LDAO (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 20 mmTris·HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and centrifuged (27,000 × g, 30 min). (This and subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C.) The supernatant was diluted to a final concentration of 2% LDAO with TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.0) and loaded onto a prewashed (Buffer A) ceramic hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad). VDAC was eluted with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl and 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), and pooled fractions were concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon 30 tubes (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to 100–200 μg of protein/ml and stored at −70 °C. Four different VDAC constructs were generated using two different IPTG-inducible expression systems. Two constructs were made with the pMAL system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), which yields fusion proteins containing maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the N terminus, followed by a Factor Xa cleavage site. scVDAC cDNA was partially digested to make anEcoRV-HindIII fragment that was incorporated into the pMAL-c expression plasmid between StuI andHindIII sites (nucleases obtained from New England Biolabs). Factor Xa cleavage would yield scVDAC lacking the first 8 residues. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a 165-base pair fragment of ncVDAC cDNA encompassing residues 3–51, and silent mutations were made at nucleotide 9 to create a SnaBI site and at nucleotide 132 to remove a second BstEII site. This cDNA fragment and a BstEII-NsiI fragment containing residues 52–283 were cloned between the XmnI andPstI sites of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). Factor Xa cleavage of the resulting protein would be missing the first 2 residues. The pMAL-based plasmids were transformed into a competentEscherichia coli host strain, NM522, and grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Full-length constructs of ncVDAC and scVDAC were made by polymerase chain reaction amplification and in-frame insertion of the cDNAs into the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). These proteins contain a 20-residue N-terminal extension MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH that ends with a thrombin cleavage site. DNA sequences of the entire reading frames were determined and found to be identical to published sequences (8Forte M. Guy H.R. Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg.

The pET-15b based plasmids were transformed into the E. colihost strain BL21(DE3) and grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacterial growth and induction were carried out essentially according to plasmid manufacturers' instructions, and inclusion bodies were collected using a method based on that of Kaplanet al.

Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted 50-fold (1 liter final volume) into LB media (containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) and grown to a final A 600 of 0.5–0.6. After addition of 0.5 mm IPTG, the cells were grown for an additional 2.5 h, placed on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged (4080 × g, 10 min). The pellets were resuspended with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, and incubated with lysozyme (12.5 μg/ml, 22 °C, 10 min) and Triton X-100 (0.6%, 4 °C, 10 min). This lysate was sonicated (two 30-s pulses at a setting of 4 using a model 50 sonic dismembranator, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh PA), and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min). Pellets were washed with 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0 (containing 2 mmCaCl2 for the pET-based constructs), repelleted (12,000 × g, 15 min), and dissolved in 75 ml of solubilization buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, and 6 m GdnHCl). After stirring for 1 h, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min). LDAO (2% final concentration) was added to the solubilized inclusion bodies containing MBP-VDAC fusion proteins and GdnHCl was removed by dialysis against loading buffer (2% LDAO, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0). The protein suspension was loaded onto a prewashed ceramic hydroxylapatite column, and bacterial porins were eluted with a KCl gradient (100–500 mm) containing 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8). MBP-VDAC was eluted with 300 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) and treated with factor Xa (20 μg of enzyme/mg of protein in loading buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mmCaCl2) to cleave the MBP and VDAC polypeptides. Following dialysis against loading buffer, the sample was loaded onto a second hydroxylapatite column and VDAC was eluted with 100 mm KCl, 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8). Pooled fractions were concentrated to 2 mg/ml by centrifugation in Centricon 30 tubes. Solubilized inclusion bodies (75 ml) containing His6-VDAC proteins were diluted with 25 ml of solubilization buffer without GdnHCl and added to 20 ml (bed volume) of prepared TALON™ metal affinity resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After 30 min, the matrix was poured into a column (16 mm diameter) and washed with three volumes of column buffer (4.5m GdnHCl, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm imidazole. His6-VDAC was eluted with two volumes of column buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. Protein fractions were concentrated to 6–8 mg/ml by centrifugation in Centricon 30 tubes. LDAO was added to a final concentration of 2% and GdnHCl was removed by dialysis against loading buffer. Proteins were stored at −70 °C at a concentration of 1–5 mg/ml. For some experiments, the His6-containing VDAC constructs were treated with thrombin according to manufacturer's instructions (Novagen) and dialyzed overnight (Spectrapor membrane, 25,000 molecular weight cutoff) to remove N-terminal fragments. The extent of cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE (see below). Proteins in LDAO-containing fractions were precipitated with cold acetone and solubilized in 1% SDS-containing buffer prior to electrophoresis on either 10% or 12% polyacrylamide slab gels (Mini-Protein II, Bio-Rad) as described by Stanley et al.

The proteins were either visualized by Coomassie staining or electrotransferred (Mini-Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 mm, Bio-Rad). Electrotransfer and immunoblotting were done as described previously (19Stanley S. Dias J.A. D'Arcangelis D. Mannella C.A. J. Biol.

MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopic data were obtained with a Bruker (Billerica, MA) REFLEX II instrument using a matrix of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, WI). Spectra, typically the average of 50 shots, were acquired in linear mode and calibrated with carbonic anhydrase (molecular mass: 28,834 daltons) as both an external and internal standard. Electrophysiological measurements were made using planar bilayers composed of soybeanl-α lecithin phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) or synthetic diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). The method of Labarca and Latorre (20Labarca P. Latorre R.

Bacterially expressed proteins were incubated 30 min on ice with 10 volumes of an ergosterol suspension (1 mg/ml chamber buffer containing 2% LDAO) before being added to the bilayer system (21Popp B.

Channel activity was observed after adding 6–13 pmol of VDAC to one chamber, and resulting current traces were recorded and analyzed as described previously (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bilayers were voltage-clamped using a Dagan 3900A amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) in the “inside-out” mode. Mean open times were determined at −25 mV from current traces usually 40–60 s in duration, which were low pass-filtered to 2 kHz and stored at 5 kHz using Strathclyde Electrophysiological Data Analysis Software (courtesy of J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Strathclyde, United Kingdom). CD measurements were carried out on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD). Measurements were taken from VDAC suspensions (approximately 1 mg/ml) at 20 °C using path lengths of 0.5–0.05 mm. Spectra were recorded from 260 to 180 nm in 0.2-nm increments with a 1-s time constant. Each spectrum shown is the average of eight scans corrected for background by subtraction of the spectrum corresponding to the appropriate solvent minus protein. Mean residue molar ellipticities, θ (degrees·cm2·dmol−1), were based on protein concentrations measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma); a mean residue molecular weight of 106 was used (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Solutions were buffered with either 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.0–8.0) or 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.8–7.0). Estimates of secondary structure were computed from CD spectra by the self-consistent method (SELCON program) of Sreerama and Woody (22Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar). This algorithm was found to yield results comparable to those obtained by Shao et al. (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the variable-selection, single-value decomposition method of Manavalan and Johnson (23Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) when the same 33-protein data base (24Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) was used. First attempts to overexpress VDAC in E. coli employed the pMAL expression system, which offered, in principle, easy purification. Proteins are expressed as fusion proteins with MBP, fractionated over an amylose-containing matrix, and cleaved with factor Xa. Both MBP-scVDAC and MBP-ncVDAC were obtained in large quantities (20–30 mg/liter of cell culture) in inclusion body fractions. The MBP-ncVDAC fraction yielded two strong bands with SDS-PAGE at M r ≈ 70,000 and 66,000 (Fig. 1, lane 2). Both bands reacted with antibodies against both the N- and C termini of VDAC (data not shown), indicating that any significant truncation due to proteolysis probably occurred in the MBP part of the protein. Expression of MBP-scVDAC yielded a single strong band atM r ≈ 66,000 (Fig. 1, lane 3). Unfortunately, neither fusion protein bound to the amylose affinity matrix in the presence of LDAO or other detergents tested (e.g. octyl β-glucoside, Triton X-100, or SDS). Therefore, an alternative purification scheme was devised involving sequential fractionation of solubilized inclusion body fractions on hydroxylapatite columns before and after cleavage with factor Xa. The yeast protein, designated scVDACΔ1–8 since it lacked residues 1–8, gave a single band at M r ≈ 30,000 (Fig. 1, lane 5) and was labeled by both N- and C-terminal antibodies on Western blots (data not shown). The final yield of purified scVDACΔ1–8 obtained by this method was 1–2 mg/liter of cell culture, which represents less than 10% of the VDAC in the inclusion bodies but still a 10-fold increase over the yield of mitochondrial VDAC from fungal cultures (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conditions could not be found for quantitative cleavage of MBP-ncVDAC with factor Xa. Because of the difficulties encountered with the pMAL expression system, a hexahistidine-based expression system (pET) was tried (Fig.2). Using this system, full-length versions of both ncVDAC and scVDAC were obtained, each with a 20-residue, His6-containing extension at the N terminus. Following metal affinity chromatography, both proteins gave single bands with SDS-PAGE at M r ≈ 32,000 and were labeled by antibodies against both N- and C-terminal regions of VDAC antibodies on Western blots (data not shown). ncVDAC(His6) yielded a molecular mass of 32,170 by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, very close to the expected mass of 32,162. By this procedure, up to 40 mg of each protein could be purified per liter of bacterial culture. Of several nondenaturing detergents screened, including octyl β-glucoside, the only one in which the bacterially expressed VDAC proteins are soluble at concentrations above 1 mg/ml is LDAO. ncVDAC(His6) is soluble at 4–20 °C in 1% LDAO at concentrations above 5 mg/ml, while scVDAC(His6) has a solubility limit of around 2 mg/ml. Far-UV CD spectra of VDAC isolated from N. crassaand S. cerevisiae mitochondria are shown in Fig.3. The spectrum of ncVDAC in 1% LDAO at pH 6–8 (Fig. 3 A, solid curve) closely resembles those of the same protein (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and of bacterial porins like OmpF (14Markovic-Housley Z. Garavito R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in nondenaturing detergents. The CD spectrum of ncVDAC, containing a single broad minimum at 214 nm and a crossover to positive ellipticity at 205 nm, is consistent with high β-sheet content (45%) and low α-helical content (12%) (Table I). The far-UV CD spectrum of mitochondrial scVDAC in 1% LDAO (Fig.3 A, dashed curve) is considerably different, displaying two minima, at 220 and 208 nm, and a crossover to positive ellipticity at 200 nm. This CD spectrum is similar to that of ncVDAC in 2% octyl β-glucoside at pH < 5 (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and corresponds to lower β-sheet content (30%) and higher α-helical content (27%) relative to ncVDAC at pH 6–8 (Table I).Table ISecondary structure of VDAC variants inferred from CDVDAC type1-aVDAC variants are grouped according to characteristic CD spectra as described under “Results.”pHSecondary structure content1-bPercent content of secondary structural elements were computed from the CD spectrum of the first protein in each group using the SELCON program (22).β-Sheetα-Helixβ-TurnRandom coil%ncVDAC845121324ncVDAC(His6)8scVDAC(His6)835201728ncVDAC(His6)5scVDAC830271728ncVDAC4.5scVDACΔ1–88ncVDAC(His6) (SDS)822282229CD spectra were measured for proteins in 1% LDAO except for the last protein in the column, which was suspended in 1% SDS.1-a VDAC variants are grouped according to characteristic CD spectra as described under “Results.”1-b Percent content of secondary structural elements were computed from the CD spectrum of the first protein in each group using the SELCON program (22Sreerama N.

Open table in a new tab CD spectra were measured for proteins in 1% LDAO except for the last protein in the column, which was suspended in 1% SDS. When inserted from 1% LDAO into planar phospholipid bilayers, both mitochondrially isolated proteins display classic VDAC-like single-channel characteristics in terms of transition sizes, mean open times, and voltage dependence (Fig. 6 and TableII). Therefore, the different secondary structures of the two types of VDAC in nondenaturing detergents are not associated with obvious differences in activity of the ion channels formed by the proteins in bilayers.Table IISingle-channel properties of VDAC variantsVDAC typeOpen conductanceTransition sizeMean open timeG u/G oNSNSmsncVDAC4.3 ± 0.6 (11)2.2 ± 0.2 (26)106 (707)0.65 ± 0.2ncVDAC(His6)4.4 ± 0.4 (16)2.1 ± 0.3 (25)105 (698)0.7 ± 0.1scVDAC4.3 ± 0.3 (10)2.2 ± 0.6 (29)122 (567)0.6 ± 0.1scVDAC(His6)4.2 ± 0.2 (10)2.0 ± 0.1 (26)103 (953)0.6 ± 0.1scVDACΔ1–84.4 ± 0.6 (13)1–2 (55)1.6 (2959)1.1 ± 0.2All parameters correspond to a transmembrane voltage of −25 mV exceptG u/G o for whichG u is the conductance at −40 mV andG o is the conductance at −10 mV.

Indicated values are means ± standard deviations (where appropriate) for the number of determinations in parentheses, except for the transition-size determination for scVDACΔ1–8, in which case the range of observed values is given. The far-UV CD spectra of ncVDAC(His6) (Fig. 3 B,dashed curve) and of scVDACΔ1–8 (Fig.3 A,dotted curve) in 1% LDAO at pH 7 were found to be very similar to those of the corresponding mitochondrial VDAC proteins. In contrast, the CD spectrum of scVDAC(His6) in 1% LDAO (Fig. 3 B, dotted curve) differs significantly from that of mitochondrial scVDAC under the same conditions. In the region above 205 nm, the spectrum of scVDAC(His6) more closely resembles that of ncVDAC, having a single broad minimum at 216 nm. However, the crossover to positive ellipticity occurs at 202 nm, in between that of ncVDAC and scVDAC, and the ellipticity maximum is somewhat reduced compared with mitochondrial ncVDAC. The secondary structure content predicted from this spectrum is 35% β-sheet and 20% α-helix (Table I), indicating secondary structure intermediate between that of mitochondrial scVDAC and ncVDAC. The CD spectra of scVDAC(His6) and ncVDAC(His6) were unchanged after cleavage of the N-terminal extensions with thrombin and overnight dialysis (Fig.4). As shown in Fig.5 A, the far-UV CD spectra of the three bacterially expressed VDAC proteins in 1% SDS are very similar, closely resembling that of mitochondrial ncVDAC in this detergent (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The spectra, containing two minima (206–207 and 224 nm) and a crossover to positive ellipticity at 200 nm, are similar (but not identical) to those of ncVDAC in 1% LDAO at pH < 5 (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and scVDAC in 1% LDAO at pH 7 (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of the CD spectrum of ncVDAC(His6) in SDS indicates a correspondingly low β-sheet content (22%, Table I). The pH dependence of the CD spectrum of ncVDAC(His6) in 1% LDAO also was determined. As with mitochondrial ncVDAC (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the spectrum of ncVDAC(His6) does not change significantly over the range pH 6–8. At lower pH values, the crossover in ellipticity shifts somewhat, from 205 nm at pH 6.0 to 203 nm at pH 5.0 and 3.8 (Fig. 5 B), but the large changes observed with mitochondrial ncVDAC (13Shao L. Kinnally K.W. Mannella C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) do not occur. Instead, the low pH CD spectrum of ncVDAC(His6) is similar to that of scVDAC(His6) at pH 8.0. Both His6-containing proteins insert from LDAO suspension into phospholipid bilayers and form stable channels when the protein suspensions were preincubated with 0.1% ergosterol (see “Experimental Procedures”). Differences in channel-forming activities per mg of bacterially expressed and mitochondrial proteins fall within the normal variability of the bilayer reconstitution experiments. Typical current traces and amplitude histograms at −25 mV are shown in Fig. 6 and single-channel parameters are summarized in Table II. The results indicate that the ion channels formed by the full-length bacterially expressed VDAC proteins are comparable to those formed by the mitochondrial proteins in terms of conductance levels (around 4.3 and 2.1 nS in 1m KCl) and mean open times (around 100 ms). In contrast, the bacterially expressed truncated variant, scVDACΔ1–8, behaves atypically in bilayer experiments. Rather than forming stable open channels with discrete transitions to a lower subconductance level, scVDACΔ1–8 induces channels that flicker rapidly. The characteristic maximum conductance level corresponding to VDAC's fully open state (4–4.5 nS) is rarely observed at any voltage. Instead, the rapid current transitions appear to involve multiple states between two subconductance levels (S 1 and S 2 in Fig. 6), giving rise to two broad peaks in the current amplitude histogram. The larger subconductance level (S2) is similar to the partially closed state of full-length VDAC (2–2.5 nS), and its mean dwell time is only 1.6 ms (Table II). The relative open probabilities (G u/G o) of the mitochondrial and bacterially expressed VDAC channels as a function of transmembrane potential are plotted in Fig. 7. Both full-length, His6-containing bacterially expressed proteins display voltage-dependent closure like that of the mitochondrial proteins. The situation is very different for the truncated variant scVDACΔ1–8. The fully open state does not occur often enough to calculate its mean probability. Instead, the “open” probability plotted reflects the occupancy of the larger of the two subconductance states (S2), which appears to be somewhat favored at larger amplitude transmembrane potentials. Using the inducible pET expression system and metal affinity chromatography, we have been able to obtain and purify multi-milligram quantities of VDAC protein from bacterial inclusion bodies. In the case of ncVDAC, CD spectra and channel properties of the mitochondrial protein and His6-containing bacterial construct are virtually indistinguishab"
https://openalex.org/W1528573189,"Phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma) is the isozyme of PLC phosphorylated by multiple tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor receptors, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. In this paper, we present evidence for the association of the insulin receptor (IR) with PLCgamma. Precipitation of the IR with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from PLCgamma and coimmunoprecipitation of the IR and PLCgamma were observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To determine the functional significance of the interaction of PLCgamma and the IR, we used a specific inhibitor of PLC, U73122, or microinjection of SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from PLCgamma to block insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. We demonstrate inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated primary rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with U73122. Antilipolytic effect of insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is unaffected by U73122. U73122 selectively inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase, leaving the Akt and p70 S6 kinase pathways unperturbed. We conclude that PLCgamma is an active participant in metabolic and perhaps mitogenic signaling by the insulin receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

The uPA receptor is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein belonging to the Ly-6/uPAR superfamily and is the only multidomain member identified so far. We have now purified the three individual domains of a recombinant soluble uPAR variant, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, after limited proteolysis using chymotrypsin and pepsin. The glycosylation patterns of these domains have been determined by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Of the five potential attachment sites for asparagine-linked carbohydrate in uPAR only four are utilized, as the tryptic peptide derived from domain III containing Asn233 was quantitatively recovered without carbohydrate. The remaining four attachment sites were shown to exhibit site-specific microheterogeneity of the asparagine-linked carbohydrate. The glycosylation on Asn52 (domain I) and Asn172 (domain II) is dominated by the smaller biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides, while Asn162 (domain II) and Asn200 (domain III) predominantly carry tri- and tetraantennary complex-type oligosaccharides. The carbohydrate moiety on Asn52 in uPAR domain I could be selectively removed byN-glycanase treatment under nondenaturing conditions. This susceptibility was abrogated when uPAR participitated in a bimolecular complex with pro-uPA or smaller receptor binding derivatives thereof, demonstrating the proximity of the ligand-binding site to this particular carbohydrate moiety. uPAR preparations devoid of carbohydrate on domain I exhibited altered binding kinetics toward uPA (a 4–6-fold increase in K d) as assessed by real time biomolecular interaction analysis.

Although the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains to be elucidated, differences in the glycosylation pattern might be involved, since phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced differentiation of U937 cells is accompanied by an increase in the size heterogeneity of uPAR, presumably reflecting an altered processing of its glycan moieties (22Behrendt N. Rønne E. Ploug M. Petri T. Løber D. Nielsen L.S. Schleuning W.-D. Blasi F. Appella E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6453-6460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lund L.R. Rønne E.

In accordance with this speculation is the finding that abolishment of the N-linked glycosylation of Asn52 in uPAR domain I by site-directed mutagenesis (Asn52 → Gln) leads to an approximately 5-fold reduction in its binding affinity, when expressed in murine LB-6 cells (29Møller L.B. Po¨llänen J. Rønne E. Pedersen N. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11152-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present paper reports the first structural determination of the glycosylation pattern of uPAR and demonstrates in a purified system the direct influence of the carbohydrate moiety of uPAR domain I on real time receptor-ligand binding kinetics using surface plasmon resonance analysis. Guanidine hydrochloride was of ARISTAR grade from British Drug House (Poole, United Kingdom), (4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF) was from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was from Sigma, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (as a stock solution of 10 g/liter) was from Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA). A 17-mer peptide antagonist of the uPA-uPAR interaction, originally identified by bacteriophage display technology (30Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kauffman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 91: 7129-7133Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar) denoted AE78 (AEPMPHSLNFSQYLWYT) and a randomly scrambled, non-binding version thereof denoted AE79 (AEWSNLMQPYYPSTHFL), were synthesized and characterized as described previously (31Ploug M. Østergaard S. Hansen L.B.L. Holm A. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Water was drawn from a Milli-Q system with an Organex-Q cartridge. A soluble recombinant variant of uPAR (residues 1–277) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO dhfr−) cells, which secrete this protein to the culture medium due to the truncation of the COOH-terminal signal sequence responsible for the glycolipid membrane attachment of uPAR (16Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in the presence of 10 nm methotrexate and secrete approximately 0.5 mg of uPAR per liter of harvest fluid (32Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Nielsen H.J. Wo¨llisch E. Weidle U. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The uPAR protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody (18Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active two-chain uPA (EC 3.4.21.31) was from Serono (Aubonne, Switzerland) and recombinant pro-uPA expressed in Escherichia coli was a kind gift from Dr. D. Saunders (Grünenthal, Germany). The ATF of uPA was kindly provided by Drs. A. Mazar and J. Henkin (Abbott Laboratories, IL), whereas the growth factor-like domain (GFD) of uPA was produced by Glu-C digestion of two-chain uPA as described previously (33Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Ellis V. Roepstorff P. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12524-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Porcine pepsin A (EC 3.4.23.1) was from Sigma, lot 120H8095. Modified porcine trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) of sequencing grade was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) was purchased from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Purified lectin AAA fromAleuria aurantia that specifically binds to α(1–6)-linked fucose in complex-type N-linked carbohydrates and the following glycosidases were all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany): neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18) from Clostridium perfringens (0.1 units/μg), recombinant N-glycanase (EC 3.2.2.18) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum expressed in E. coli (25 units/μg), and a mixture of endoglycosidase F1 and F2 (EC 3.2.1.96) isolated from F. meningosepticum. The NH2-terminal domain I of uPAR (residues 1–87) was liberated from domain II + III by cleavage after Tyr87 in the linker region using limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin and subsequently purified by gel filtration on a SuperdexTM 75 HR10/30 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) essentially as described (18Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage in the linker region between domain II + III was accomplished by pepsin treatment, a procedure recently devised to generate domain I + II from intact uPAR (34Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present experiment, lyophilized domain II + III was dissolved in 0.2m acetic acid and treated for 2 h at 37 °C with pepsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:2000 (w/w). This digestion was terminated by injecting the sample directly onto a ProRPCTM HR5/10 column (Pharmacia) from which a sequential elution of the generated domains II and III was obtained by a 35-min linear gradient from 0 to 40% (v/v) 2-propanol in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 300 μl min−1(Fig. 1). Reversed-phase HPLC purified domain II and III (approximately 20 nmol) were taken to dryness by vacuum evaporation, redissolved in 150 μl of 6 m guanidinium HCl, 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm EDTA. After flushing the samples with argon, reduction proceeded for 2 h at 50 °C in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. Generated thiol groups were subsequently alkylated by incubation with 50 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min after which the alkylated domains were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column using 0.1 m NH4HCO3 as solvent. These preparations were directly subjected to trypsin cleavage by addition of porcine trypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:25 (w/w) followed by incubation overnight at 25 °C. The resulting degradation patterns were visualized by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography using a Brownlee Aquapore OD-300 C18 column with a linear gradient (50 min) from 0 to 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1 and 0.085% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. The flow rate was 250 μl min−1 and detection was at 214 and 280 nm. Identity of the eluted polypeptides was revealed by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and amino acid composition analyses. For structural analyses of the glycan moieties, sequential deglycosylation of reversed-phase purified domains of uPAR or isolated tryptic glycopeptides thereof was performed in 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3. Samples were initially incubated for 18 h with 5 milliunits of neuraminidase, followed by the withdrawal of 1 μl for MALDI-MS analysis. After subsequent addition of 125 milliunits ofN-glycanase, incubation was continued for another 18 h and 1 μl was withdrawn for a second MALDI-MS analysis. For functional binding studies of uPAR with differently processed glycan moieties, intact uPAR (approximately 1 nmol) was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of 50 mm Bistris-HCl, 45 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.1) containing either 50 milliunits of neuraminidase or 50 milliunits ofN-glycanase. The neuraminidase stock solution was pretreated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to avoid proteolytic cleavage of uPAR by trace protease contamination in the enzyme preparation. The following experiments were conducted to explore whether the accessibility of the glycan moiety on Asn52 in uPAR domain I toward enzymatic hydrolysis by N-glycanase was affected when the receptor was engaged in the formation of a bimolecular complex with various uPA derivatives. Receptor complexes were formed by preincubating uPAR (1 μm) for 5 min at room temperature with buffer alone or a 4-fold molar excess of either bovine serum albumin (as control) or various receptor binding uPA derivatives (pro-uPA, ATF, or GFD). Synthetic peptides (AE78 and AE79) were, however, preincubated with uPAR at a 20-fold molar excess. These mixtures were treated with 20 milliunits of neuraminidase and 100 milliunits of N-glycanase for 20 min at 37 °C, whereupon further deglycosylation was prevented by boiling for 5 min. The untreated sample also received the above deglycosylation mixture and was boiled immediately. Domain I was subsequently generated by incubation with 2 nm chymotrypsin for 10 min at room temperature and 1 μl of these mixtures were finally subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. These experiments were performed in 50 mm Bistris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA (pH 7.1), including 2 mm APMSF, the presence of which allows the subsequent chymotrypsin cleavage. The effects of various glycosidase treatments of uPAR on its ligand binding properties were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000TM equipment (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden). The carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip) was preactivated withN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-(diethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide, according to the manufacturers recommendations. Coupling of the ligands was achieved by subsequent injection of uPA (20 μg/ml) or lectin AAA (50 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1 for 6 min. Just prior to the kinetic analyses by real time BIA, the various uPAR preparations from the deglycosylations experiments were re-purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 3.2/30 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) using 50 mm Bistris-HCl, 45 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.1) as eluent to remove any aggregated or degraded material formed during the enzymatic deglycosylation (less than 10%). Sensorgrams (resonance units versus time) were recorded by the BIAcore 2000TM at a flow rate of 10 μl min−1 at 5 °C, using 6 different concentrations of these uPAR preparations in the range of 10–100 nm in running buffer (50 mm Bistris-HCl, 45 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.1) including 0.005% surfactant P-20). To reassure that no protein aggregation occurred while recording the sensorgrams, the individual samples were retrieved after analysis using the recovery function of BIAcore 2000TM and subjected to analytical rechromatography on Superdex 75. After enzymatic deglycosylation samples were kept at 5 °C and analyzed within 24 h. The sensor chip was regenerated at the end of each run by injection of 0.1 m acetic acid containing 0.5 mNaCl. Specific detection of glycopeptides containing α(1–6)-linked fucose was performed by carbohydrate-specific surface plasmon resonance detection using immobilized lectin AAA (35Blikstad I. Fägerstam L.G. Bhikhabhai R. Lindblom H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In such experiments regeneration of the sensor chip was obtained by injection of 100 mm fucose. Data obtained from parallel mock-coupled flow cells (non-protein) served as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of bulk refractive index background. The obtained sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.0 software (Pharmacia Biasensor, Uppsala, Sweden) assuming single-site association and dissociation models. ESI-MS was performed on a Sciex API III triple quadrupole instrument (Sciex, Thornhill, Canada) using an articulated ion-spray probe. The sample (2 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 volume of 1% (v/v) acetic acid in methanol and subjected to ESI-MS at a flow-rate of 3 μl/min. A sprayer voltage of 5,000 volts and an orifice potential of 80 volts were used. MALDI spectra were recorded on a linear time-of-flight instrument (Voyager™, PerSeptive Biosystems, MA) equipped with a 1.2-m flight tube and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. To minimize prompt as well as metastable fragmentation of sialic acids during sample desorption (36Huberty M.C. Vatn J.E. Yu W. Martin S.D. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 2800-2971Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), in particularly when α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as matrix, laser power levels were kept as low as possible, typically 1% above the threshold value for desorption of matrix ions. Although metastable fragmentation of sialic acids undoubtly occurs to a significant extent during this desorption protocol, this would not give rise to artifacts in mass assignments, since the time-of-flight instrument was operated in the linear mode only, where fragment and parent ions possess identical initial velocities (36Huberty M.C. Vatn J.E. Yu W. Martin S.D. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 2800-2971Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Karas M. Bahr U. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F. Tsarbopoulos A. Pramanik B.N. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 675-679Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The MS probes were precoated with a thin-layer of matrix by deposition of 1 μl of freshly prepared matrix solution (20 mg/ml in 98% (w/w) acetone) followed by fast solvent evaporation. Sandwich sample preparation (38Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar) occurred by consecutive deposition of 1 μl of the following solutions to the precoated target: 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, sample to be analyzed and finally 15 mg/ml matrix dissolved in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. After 1–2 min of crystallization, excess solvent was removed by aspiration and the probe surface was gently rinsed using 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The majority of samples were analyzed using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix, but sinapinic acid was used for intact uPAR to favor the formation of molecular ions (MH+) as well as reducing the MS induced fragmentation of sialic acid. One glycopeptide (T21) could, however, only be desorbed after deposition in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2 μl of 1:1 mixture of sample and matrix solution (10 mg/ml) was deposited on a clean MS probe surface). Amino acid analysis was performed on a Waters amino acid analyzer with post-columno-phthaldialdehyde detection. Acid hydrolysis was achieved by incubation in vacuo at 110 °C for 20 h in 6m HCl containing 0.05% (w/v) of both phenol and 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid (39Barkholt V. Jensen A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain I of uPAR was purified by gel filtration after mild chymotrypsin treatment of a recombinant uPAR (residues 1–277) secreted by CHO cells, as reported previously (18Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining domain II + III (residues 88–277) was subsequently treated with pepsin and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC purification, which yielded two distinct components representing isolated domains II and III (Fig. 1). Amino acid composition analysis and mass spectrometry (ESI and MALDI) confirmed the purity and identity of these preparations of the individual domains of uPAR (TableI and Figs.2 and 4). The pepsin treatment caused the liberation of domains II and III due to the specific cleavage in the interdomain linker region of the Glu183-Leu184peptide bond, in accordance with the major substrate specificity of this enzyme (40Wilkinson J.M. Dabre A. Practical Protein Chemistry, A Handbook.

https://openalex.org/W1994355762,"A type I topoisomerase has been purified to homogeneity from Mycobacterium smegmatis.

The enzyme is Mg2+ dependent and can relax negatively supercoiled DNA, catenate, and knot single-stranded DNA, thus having typical properties of type I topoisomerases. Furthermore, the enzyme makes single-stranded nicks and the 5′-phosphoryl end of the nicked DNA gets covalently linked with a tyrosine residue of the enzyme.

Partially purified Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I exhibits very similar properties with respect to size, stability, and reaction characteristics. Sequence comparison of topoisomerase I fromE. coli and M. tuberculosis shows the absence of zinc-finger motifs in mycobacterial enzyme.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that play a vital role in variety of cellular processes by maintaining the superhelical density of DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). There are two distinct subfamilies of topoisomerases. Type I subclass consists of prokaryotic and eukaryotic topoisomerase I and topoisomerase III enzymes, which effect topological changes in DNA by transiently cleaving one DNA strand at a time to allow the passage of another strand (2Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This results in the change in linking number of DNA by steps of one. Eukaryotic topoisomerase II, bacterial DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase IV belong to the type II subfamily. The enzymes of the latter group require ATP for catalysis and introduce transient double-stranded breaks, changing the linking number in steps of two (2Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Topoisomerases have been found to participate in nearly all cellular transactions involving DNA and thus can be the ideal target enzymes for clinical medicine. The identification of DNA gyrase as a target for chemical inhibitors, antibiotics, toxins (3Drlica K. Franco R.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2253-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J., Perspectives in Biochemistry, Neurath, H., 1, 1989, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar) illustrates this point well. The prokaryotic topoisomerase I has been extensively characterized fromEscherichia coli (7Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 8Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I from few other bacterial sources such as Micrococcus luteus (9Kung V.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5398-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Diplococcus pneumoniae (10Strol K. Strol H.J. Biomed. Biochem. Acta. 1989; 48: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar), and Fervidobacterium islandicum (11Tour C.B. de la Portemer C. Forterre P. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have also been studied. Prokaryotic type I topoisomerases catalyze the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA in an energy independent manner. Other reactions catalyzed by this class of enzymes include knotting and catenation of single-stranded DNA or duplex DNA having a nick in one of the strands. It is suggested that in prokaryotes, topoisomerase I plays a crucial role to maintain thein vivo superhelical density of DNA in conjunction with the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase (12DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I has been also implicated to have role in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination events (13Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). In certain pathogenic bacteria, regulation of virulence gene expression seem to be mediated by topoisomerases (14Dorman C.J. Bhriain N.N. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 92-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The genus Mycobacterium is of immense importance asMycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and other opportunistic pathogenic strains belong to this group. Two major diseases, tuberculosis and leprosy, continue to be serious health hazards in all the developing countries. Reappearance of tuberculosis in the Western world in the recent times and emergence of multiple drug resistant M. tuberculosis clinical strains have raised a global concern (15Rastogi N. David H.L. Res. Microbiol. 1993; 144: 103-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There has been a dramatic increase in the occurrence of tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected people, since the viral infection reduces the immunity in AIDS patients. These developments necessitate the identification of new molecular targets as a prelude to the drug discovery. While therapeutic agents targeted toward prokaryotic topoisomerase I have not been realized yet, this class of enzymes remain as potential targets for a new class of inhibitors. Compared with many other bacterial species very little is known about the macromolecular events in mycobacteria. Thus, in addition to exploring it as a molecular target, detailed characterization of topoisomerase I from mycobacteria is also important to understand the basic biology of the organism. Comparatively slow growth rate of mycobacteria and their ability to lay dormant in host macrophages (15Rastogi N. David H.L. Res. Microbiol. 1993; 144: 103-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is suggestive of some unusual regulatory features of DNA transaction events, which in turn may be related to the DNA modulating enzymes like topoisomerases. In this article we report the detailed characterization of topoisomerase I from M. smegmatis. The enzyme in many respects, is similar to that of the prokaryotic prototype, characterized from E. coli topoisomerase I. Yet, it exhibits some distinct properties. Our analysis, quite unexpectedly, indicates that cysteines do not play a role in DNA binding. Polyethyleneimine, NEM, 1The abbreviations used are: NEM,N-ethylmalamide; DTT, dithiothreitol; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein. MMTS, DTT, spermidine, yeast tRNA, proteinase K, o-phenanthroline, phosphoamino acid markers were obtained from Sigma. Buffers, solutions, and gel electrophoresis reagents were prepared using reagents from Life Technologies, Inc. SP-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose column materials were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and phosphocellulose from Whatman. Micrococcal nuclease was purchased from Worthington. SSB protein was purchased from Bangalore Genie Ltd., India. Radioactive nucleoside triphosphates with specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol were obtained from Amersham Corp. Plasmid pJW312-SalI which was used for overexpressingE. coli topoisomerase I, was a generous gift from James C. Wang, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. E. colitopoisomerase I was purified using the published protocol (16Lynn R.M. Wang J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I activity was purified from M. smegmatis. Growth of M. smegmatis SN2 and preparation of the cells for cell-free extracts are as described before (17Bhaduri T. Nagaraja V. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 31: 339-343PubMed Google Scholar). The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm and the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman type 50 Ti rotor for 3 h, to obtain 100,000 × g supernatant (S100). This S100 supernatant was brought to 1% final concentration of polyethyleneimine, in the presence of 50 mm NaCl. The polyethyleneimine supernatant was subjected to 0–67% ammonium sulfate fractionation. The pellet was dissolved in buffer A (50 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm KCl) and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (150 ml). The bound proteins were eluted with a salt gradient of 200 mm to 1 m KCl. The active fractions (eluted at 450 to 650 mm KCl) were pooled, dialyzed (against buffer A), and subsequently loaded on to a SP-Sepharose column (30 ml). Elution of the column was with a salt gradient of 400 to 750 mm KCl in buffer A and active fractions corresponding to 450 to 500 mm KCl were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm KCl) and finally loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (10 ml). The column was developed with linear gradient of buffer B having 50 to 600 mm KCl. The enzymatically active fractions eluted between 300 and 400 mm were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −20 °C. Topoisomerase I fromM. tuberculosis H37Ra was partially purified (phosphocellulose chromatography) employing the procedure described above. The topoisomerase relaxation assay was carried out as described before (17Bhaduri T. Nagaraja V. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 31: 339-343PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme catalyzes 50% conversion of 500 ng of supercoiled pUC19 DNA into different relaxed topoisomers at 37 °C in 30 min under standard assay conditions. Catenation of M13 single-stranded DNA was carried out in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 5 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 500 ng of DNA substrate. Incubation was at 37 and 52 °C for 1 h. Products were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with alcohol before loading onto 0.8% agarose gel. The relaxation reaction was carried out with one of the substrates with different concentrations of MgCl2 for 10 min, with limiting enzyme concentration (0.2 units). Then the second substrate was added and the reactions were continued for another 10 min. Reactions were stopped with 1% SDS containing buffer and fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel. Bands were visualized after ethidium bromide staining. pUC19 DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA was nick-translated using [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity of labeling was 2 × 107 cpm/μg of DNA). The DNA was denatured by adding NaOH to a final concentration of 50 mm. After 10 min at 37 °C, the DNA was neutralized with 50 mm HCl and 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A reaction mixture of 25 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmNaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 ng of denatured nick-translated DNA, and the topoisomerase I enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. NaOH was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. Following incubation for an additional 10 min at 37 °C, the pH of the sample was readjusted to 8.0. CaCl2and micrococcal nuclease were added to a final concentration of 1 mm and 5 units/ml, respectively. The mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The samples (protein-labeled nucleotide complex) were analyzed in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The experiment was carried out with minor modifications of the described procedure (18Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 ng of either 3′-end filled or 5′-end labeledSau3AI-digested pUC19 DNA (alkali denatured) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of purified topoisomerase I. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of a prewarmed solution containing 0.2 m NaOH, 2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml tRNA. Samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C, then neutralized by adding 50 μl of a solution containing, 0.4 m HCl, 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.25 m KCl and placed on ice for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended and washed with 200 μl of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml tRNA at 65 °C. After 10 min samples were cooled on ice and recentrifuged. After two washes, pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of water by heating to 65 °C. The radioactivity in the suspension was estimated in a scintillation counter. The protein-DNA complex, prepared as described in the earlier section, was precipitated with ice-cold acetone and free label was removed by repeated washing with 80% acetone. The precipitated protein-DNA complex was then proteolyzed with 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested product was vacuum dried and resuspended in 100 μl of 5.6m HCl. Hydrolysis was performed at 110 °C for 1 h. HCl was removed in vacuum and the dried hydrolysate was suspended in 15 μl of chromatographic buffer (375 ml of n-butanol, 250 ml of pyridine, 75 ml of acetic acid). Samples were spotted on a silica gel plate. Phosphoamino acid markers (phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine) were also spotted on the same horizontal line. Thin layer chromatography, ninhydrin staining, autoradiography of the resolved radiolabeled amino acids, etc. were carried out according to the published procedures (19Tse Y.-C. Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5560-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure topoisomerase I (2–5 μm) was denatured by 6 m guanidium HCl treatment at 37 °C for 1 h. One aliquot of this denatured protein was sequentially dialyzed against the assay buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 μm ZnCl2) containing 4, 2, of 1 m, and no guanidium HCl, respectively, to renature the protein. The remainder of the denatured protein was aliquoted and different aliquots were treated either with 1 mm NEM or 200 μm MMTS at 37 °C for 30 min. The NEM/MMTS-treated proteins were dialyzed in the same way against the assay buffer in the presence or absence of DTT. All the dialyzed fractions were assayed for DNA relaxation activity. Complete modification of cysteine residues was assessed by 5,5′-dithio(nitrobenzoic acid) estimation of free thiols (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21374) Google Scholar, 21Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Purified E. coli topoisomerase I (5 μm) was also subjected to similar treatments. Determination of the free thiols was carried out by Ellman assay (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21374) Google Scholar), essentially as described (21Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). 3 nmol of M. smegmatis topoisomerase I was diluted in 1 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer and treated with 100 μl of 10 mm 5,5′-dithio(nitrobenzoic acid). Molar concentration of cysteine was calculated from the ΔA 412 nmas described (21Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The value obtained was divided by the moles of the enzyme used to obtain the number of free thiols present in the protein. Protein concentration was estimated at different stages of purification using the procedure of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-gel electrophoresis were carried out according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Standard DNA manipulations and autoradiography was carried out using established protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). M13 single-stranded DNA was prepared using standard procedure and purified through a 5–30% sucrose density gradient (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of the protein was carried out in Central Protein Sequencing Facility of Indian Institute of Science using Shimadzu Gas Phase Sequenator PSQ-1. The purification scheme of a topoisomerase activity from M. smegmatis is presented in Fig. 1 a. The protein fractions from different purification steps were analyzed in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein appears to be homogeneous as it migrates as a single band corresponding to the molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa in a silver-stained gel (Fig. 1 b). Thus the enzyme appears to be larger than any of the prokaryotic type I topoisomerases characterized so far. The corresponding topoisomerase I from E. coli has a molecular mass of 98 kDa (25Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purified topoisomerase I fromM. smegmatis was subjected to N-terminal sequence determination by the Edman degradation method. The sequence obtained, AGGSRGSGGA, is different from the N-terminal sequence of the E. coli enzyme and does not correspond to any other topoisomerases. The DNA relaxation assay was used to monitor the enzyme activity at every stage of purification. The topoisomerase I activity was purified to 1263-fold and the specific activity of the enzyme was 2.17 × 105 units/mg of protein (TableI). The purified DNA relaxation activity had salient features of a prokaryotic type I topoisomerases. The enzyme has an efficient relaxation activity on negatively supercoiled DNA. Mg2+ is essential for the DNA relaxation activity, while nucleotide cofactor(s) and monovalent cations are not required. However, at higher salt concentrations (>250 mm) enzyme activity is abolished. DNA relaxation activity of M. smegmatis topoisomerase I was not inhibited at 0.5 or 1 mm spermidine (Fig. 2 a, lanes 3 and 4. This is in contrast to the properties ofE. coli topoisomerase I which is inhibited at intracellular concentrations of the spermidine (26Srivenugopal K.S. Morris D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our results with E. coli topoisomerase I is in agreement with the earlier findings (26Srivenugopal K.S. Morris D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Table IPurification of M. smegmatis topoisomerase IFractionsProteinActivity unitsSpecific activityPurificationmgunits/mg-foldS20584.65ND1-aND, not determined.NDS100419.12NDND(NH4)2SO4232.84.0 × 104171.8Phosphocellulose20.52.4 × 1041.17 × 10468.0SP-Sepharose0.1251.1 × 1048.0 × 104465.6Q-Sepharose0.04699822.17 × 1051263.050 g of M. smegmatis SN2 cells were used.1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab 50 g of M. smegmatis SN2 cells were used. To check the thermo-tolerance of the M. smegmatis topoisomerase I, standard assay mixtures were preincubated at different temperatures and the reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme. The results are presented in Fig. 2 b. The mycobacterial enzyme retains some relaxation activity at 65 °C (lane 11), while the E. coli enzyme loses its activity above 42 °C (lanes 4 and 5), indicating that the M. smegmatis topoisomerase I is a more thermostable enzyme. Similar behavior is observed with partially purified M. tuberculosistopoisomerase I (not shown). Topoisomerase I from E. coli catalyzes the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA but cannot use positively supercoiled substrates (7Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), whereas both kinds of DNA are relaxed with comparable efficiency by eukaryotic enzymes. The topoisomerase I from M. smegmatiswas tested for its ability to remove positive supercoils, by comparing its relaxation activity with that of the E. coli and calf thymus enzymes. Positively supercoiled DNA was prepared by incubating relaxed DNA with 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. This concentration is not inhibitory to the relaxation activity of the enzymes used. If the topoisomerase relaxes positive supercoils induced by ethidium bromide, the DNA would acquire negative supercoils after removal of the dye. On the other hand, if it failed to act on the positive supercoils, the product DNA would not show any topological changes following extraction of the dye molecule. This result shows that positive supercoiled DNA is not a substrate for the M. smegmatis topoisomerase I (Fig.3 a, lanes 5 and 6), unlike the calf thymus enzyme (lanes 7 and8). Prokaryotic topoisomerase I is known to catenate and knot single-stranded circular DNA (27Liu L.F. Depew R.N. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 b, shows the result of the catenation assay. M13 single-stranded DNA was used as the substrate. Catenated structures of higher molecular weight were observed at 52 °C (lanes 5 and 6). The catenanes were not detectable when the DNA was incubated with the buffer also at 52 °C (lane 2) or when the enzymatic reaction was carried out at 37 °C (lanes 3 and 4). Knotting assay was also performed with M13 single-stranded DNA as substrate, which led to the appearance of faster moving knotted molecules (data not shown). The enzymes which operate on DNA exhibit two different modes of interaction, distributive and processive. Appearance of a large number of partially relaxed topoisomers before fully relaxed product in a typical topoisomerase I reaction, could be considered as distributive. In contrast, appearance of fully relaxed product during the course of the reaction while some supercoiled substrate still remains, indicates a processive mode (2Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Arsene Der Garabedian P. Mirambeau G. Vermeersch J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9940-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The effect of NaCl on the mode of relaxation of M. smegmatis topoisomerase I is presented in Fig. 4. The enzyme shows a predominantly processive mode in the absence of monovalent salts and gradually shifts to a distributive mode with the increase in the salt concentration (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5). The results were similar when the influence of Mg2+ concentration on the relaxation activity of the enzyme is studied. With the increase in Mg2+ ion concentration there is an increase in the number of partially relaxed topoisomers, which reflects a distributive mode of action by the enzyme (not shown). The effect of Mg2+ in changing topoisomerase I reaction from processive to distributive mode was demonstrated by employing two plasmid substrates. The assay is initiated with one of the supercoiled DNA substrates. The other substrate was added during the course of the reaction as shown in the scheme (Fig.5 a). In presence of higher concentration of Mg2+ (5–7.5 mm) the enzyme shifts more efficiently to the second substrate indicating a distributive mode of relaxation (Fig. 5, b andc). The enzyme does not discriminate either of the plasmids as both serve as efficient substrate when incubated together (not shown). Furthermore, the distributive behavior is observed irrespective of the order of addition of the plasmids (Fig. 5, b andc). DNA topoisomerases have been shown to cleave the DNA phosphodiester bond and simultaneously get covalently linked to DNA at the cleavage site via a phosphotyrosine linkage (13Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). The formation of the covalent complex can be assessed by trapping the reaction intermediate followed by hydrolyzing the labeled DNA. This would result in transfer of the label in the nucleotide to protein (18Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site residue involved in the protein-DNA linkage can then be identified, upon hydrolysis of the protein. Nick-translated, denatured pUC19 DNA was incubated with M. smegmatis topoisomerase I and the DNA-protein covalent intermediate was trapped by denaturing the protein with alkali. The DNA part of the complex was removed with micrococcal nuclease treatment, so that only the covalently linked nucleotide is attached to the protein (Fig. 6 a). The partially purified M. tuberculosis topoisomerase I was subjected to such an analysis. The topoisomerase from both species have similar size and are larger than E. coli topoisomerase I. To identify the amino acid residue involved in the phosphoester bond formation with the DNA, the radiolabeled proteins (Fig. 6 a) were processed further as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The active site residue was identified by autoradiography of the thin layer chromatographic plate. Under our experimental conditions, the radiolabeled amino acids from E. coli and mycobacterial enzymes migrate at the same position (Fig. 6 b, lanes 1 and2). This result indicates that as in the case of other topoisomerases, M. smegmatis enzyme also has a tyrosine at the active site. The covalent complex formation described above could be mediated either by the 3′- or 5′-end of nicked DNA. All the known prokaryotic type I enzymes make 5′ covalent contacts while eukaryotic type I enzymes make 3′ covalent linkage (19Tse Y.-C. Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5560-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). The experimental strategy to determine the linkage of M. smegmatis enzyme is depicted in Fig.7 a. Determination of the linkage could be established by employing DNA substrates labeled either at 5′-end or 3′-end. Most of the radiolabel DNA-protein complex was precipitated with an increase in enzyme concentration when the 3′-end labeled DNA substrates were used. Proteinase K treatment of the reaction mixtures reduces the precipitable counts, indicating that recoverable radioactivity is due to protein mediated complex formation. When 5′-end labeled DNA substrates were used, no appreciable complex formation was observed (Fig. 7 b). These results demonstrate that covalent complex formation is mediated through the 5′-end of the nicked DNA. E. colitopoisomerase I has zinc-finger structures at the C-terminal domain of the enzyme which participates in DNA binding and cleavable complex formation (30Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14317-14320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This zinc coordination is via a cluster of 12 cysteine residues. When these cysteine residues are modified, the enzyme loses its relaxation activity (31Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Te"
https://openalex.org/W1993751070,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein forms a ternary complex on DNA in association with a host factor, the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). An understanding of the precise geometry of this complex has been elusive. We have used photocross-linking to investigate Tax-DNA contacts. Our data show that Tax contacts the DNA at two symmetric positions 14 nucleotides apart on either side of the Tax responsive element. The presence of symmetric, widely separated regions of contact suggests that at least two molecules of Tax are present in the complex. Mapping the contacts onto a three-dimensional model of the CREB-DNA binary complex shows that they lie on the same face of the DNA near the regions where the N termini of the CREB bZIP domains enter the major groove. This location correlates well with previous evidence that CREB amino acid residues immediately N-terminal to the bZIP domain are crucial for the formation of the ternary complex. The limited number of cross-links observed suggests that contacts are primarily with the phosphate backbone and does not support the idea that a major structural element of the Tax protein inserts into the major or minor grooves of the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2091047889,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) HBD must be bound to the protein chaperone hsp90 in order to acquire the high affinity steroid binding conformation. Despite this crucial role of hsp90, its binding site in GR remains poorly defined. Large portions of the GR HBD have been implicated and no similarity has been established between steroid receptor HBDs and the catalytic domains of the protein kinases (e.g. pp60src, Raf) that also form stable heterocomplexes with hsp90. Thus, it has been thought that some general property of the proteins, such as exposure of hydrophobic residues in partially denatured regions, determines the assembly of stable hsp90 heterocomplexes. In this work, we have studied fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) and very short amino-terminal truncations just before and at the beginning of the rat GR HBD that are otherwise intact to the carboxyl terminus. Overexpression in COS cells of the chimeras GST537C and GST547C was found to yield receptors that were bound to hsp90 and had wild-type steroid binding affinity. However, removal of 7 more amino acids to form GST554C resulted in a fusion protein that did not bind either hsp90 or steroid. Additional mutations revealed that the role of these 7 amino acids was neither to provide a spacer between protein domains nor to expose a protein surface by introducing a bend in the conserved α-helix. Instead, these observations support a model in which the sequence of the 7 amino acids directly or indirectly affects hsp90 binding to the GR HBD. Thus, a region of GR that has not been thought to be relevant for hsp90 binding is now seen to be of critical importance, and these data argue strongly against the commonly accepted model of receptor-hsp90 heterocomplex assembly in which the chaperone initially interacts nonspecifically with hydrophobic regions of the partially denatured HBD and subsequently assists its folding to the steroid binding confirmation.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hsp90 is a component of a multiprotein chaperone system (including hsp70, p60, and p23) that directs the ATP-dependent assembly of hsp90 into complexes with a variety of transcription factors and protein kinases (for review, see Refs. 5Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocrinol. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). It is not known what properties permit these proteins to form relatively stable complexes with hsp90, whereas most proteins do not. It is clear, though, that hsp90 binds directly to the GR HBD (7Pratt W.B. Jolly D.J. Pratt D.V. Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Cadepond F.M. Schweizer-Groyer G. Catelli M.G. Evans R.M. Baulieu E.E. J.

When the GR HBD is fused to another transcription factor, the fusion protein is bound to hsp90 and binds steroid (9Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons Jr., S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity of the fused transcription factor is usually controlled by steroid binding (for review, see Ref. 10Picard D. Freedman L.P. The Molecular Biology of Steroid and Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1998: 1-18Google Scholar). Several approaches have been taken to determine the region of the GR HBD involved in steroid binding and hsp90 binding. When GR was translated in reticulocyte lysates, only the full-length translation product was recovered in association with hsp90 (11Dalman F.C. Bresnick E.H. Patel P.D. Perdew G.H. Watson Jr., S.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19815-19821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the HBD is completely formed before the original hsp90 binding occurs. When GR mutants lacking increasing portions of the carboxyl terminus were translated in reticulocyte lysate, Dalman et al. (12Dalman F.C. Scherrer L.C. Taylor L.P. Akil H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3482-3490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a minimal region from 616–671 (rat GR) 2The amino acid numbering in this paper is for rat GR.2The amino acid numbering in this paper is for rat GR. that was required for a high yield of high affinity hsp90 binding. With the same approach, Howard et al. (13Howard K.J. Holley S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11928-11935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the region 568–616 was sufficient to yield some hsp90 binding. Taken together, these reports suggested a minimal hsp90-binding site of about 100 amino acids (568–671). However, Cadepond et al. (14Cadepond F. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Jibard N. Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Evans R.M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5834-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) divided the human GR HBD into three subregions of roughly equal length and showed that the fusion of each segment to GR with carboxyl-terminal truncation at amino acids 550 or 568 was sufficient to confer hsp90 binding. One of these regions sufficient for conserving hsp90 binding was the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the HBD (697–777 human or 715–795 rat), which lies completely outside of the minimal hsp90-binding region determined from carboxyl-terminal truncations. In a similar study, Schowalter et al. (15Schowalter D.B. Sullivan W.P. Maihle N.J. Dobson A.D.W. Coneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21165-21173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that three separate regions of the progesterone receptor HBD could confer hsp90 binding when fused to a mutant PR lacking the HBD. As with the GR (14Cadepond F. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Jibard N. Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Evans R.M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5834-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of any of these regions did not abolish hsp90 binding (15Schowalter D.B. Sullivan W.P. Maihle N.J. Dobson A.D.W. Coneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21165-21173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for the last several years, it has been the conclusion that several regions throughout the GR and PR HBDs are involved in hsp90 complex formation. No critical sequences or motifs required for hsp90 binding have been identified, and no similarity has been established between steroid receptor HBDs and the catalytic domains of protein kinases, such as pp60src and Raf, that are also assembled into hsp90-containing heterocomplexes by the same hsp90-based chaperone machinery (16Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3190-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to bear in mind that the previously identified hsp90 binding sequences may represent only a final product and bear little relationship to the region of the HBD, or even the whole receptor, required for the initial interaction with the multiprotein chaperone machinery. In any case, it is thought that some general property, such as exposure of hydrophobic residues in partially denatured regions (18Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1606-1614Crossref Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 19Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 20Ruddon R.W. Bedows E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), must account for the ability of the steroid receptor HBDs to form relatively stable complexes with hsp90. Unfortunately, none of the above approaches could provide convincing evidence regarding the site of hsp90-GR interaction involved in ligand binding because steroid binding was not concomitantly determined. Using a series of such fusion proteins containing dihydrofolate reductase and HBD fragments with deletions at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, Xu et al. (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found that some sequence, which did not have to be that of the GR, fused to the amino terminus of the HBD was absolutely necessary for the production of stable protein, even when the resulting protein could not bind steroid. Furthermore, the boundaries of the steroid-binding domain were localized to 550–795 of the rat GR (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results raised the question of whether the loss of steroid binding upon deletion of amino acids beyond 550 was due to the absence of sequences necessary for interaction with steroid or to the lack of residues required for hsp90 binding. In this work, we decided to examine the steroid-binding and hsp90-binding properties in parallel for a series of fusion proteins containing very short amino-terminal truncations of, or before, the HBD that are otherwise intact to the carboxyl terminus. We show that the chimeric proteins lose all hsp90 binding activity and all steroid binding activity with the removal of a region amino-terminal to any sequences previously thought to be involved in hsp90 binding to GR. Additional mutations allowed us to discard structural explanations for this behavior. These results are discussed in terms of a model in which some or all of these 7 specific amino acids are required for hsp90 binding to GR. [6,7-3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (TA, 42.8 Ci/mmol) and 125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from NEN Life Sciences Products and [3H]dexamethasone was from Amersham Corp. Goat anti-mouse IgM and the monoclonal anti-GST antibody (clone GST-2) were from Sigma. The AC88 monoclonal IgG against hsp90 was from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia), and the 3G3 monoclonal anti-hsp90 IgM was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Anti-GR antibody (aP1) was a gift from Dr. Bernd Groner (Friedrich Miescher-Institut, Basel, Switzerland). The sources of enzymes used in cloning were: EcoRI (Stratagene), SphI (New England Biolabs), T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Taq polymerase (Promega). All enzymatic manipulations were performed according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The constructs were transformed into DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Digene Diagnostics, Inc.), and grown in Superbroth (Quality Biologicals, Inc.). The plasmid DNAs were extracted and purified by the Qiagen Mini or Maxi Kits. The construction of pMTGST537C, which contains a thrombin cleavage site between GST and the GR receptor sequences, was described previously by Xu et al. (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pMTGST520C was constructed on the backbone of plasmid pdhfr537C (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pdhfr537C was digested with EcoRI to generate two fragments (a 4.7-kilobase vector fragment and a 1.3-kilobase fragment containing DHFR and amino acids 537 to 781 of the rat GR). The sequence containing full-length GST was generated by PCR using pMTGST537C as the template. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′ primer is 5′-GCCAGAATTCATGTCCCCTATACTAGG-3′; 3′ primer is 5′-TATAGCATGCGGATCCACGCGGAA-3′. Amino acids 520 to 795 of GR were amplified by PCR using pSVLGR (22Miesfield R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) as the template. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′ primer is 5′-GTATAGCATGCCAGCAAGCCACTG-3′; 3′ primer is 5′-CGGAATTCAACTTTCTTTAAGGCAAC-3′. Both PCR products were digested with EcoRI plus SphI, and ligated to the 4.7-kilobase vector described above to generate pMTGST520C. pMTGST547C, pMTGST552C, and pMTGST554C were derived by exchange of amino acids 520 to 781 (SphI to EcoRI) in pMTGST520C with amino acids 547, 552, or 554 to 781 (SphI toEcoRI) in plasmid pdhfr547C, pdhfr552C, or pdhfr554C, respectively. The 5′ primer that was used to prepare pdhfr547C was originally (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) incorrectly reported and is 5′-GTATAGCATGCACCCCTACCTTGGTG-3′. All the constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (Amersham). pMTGST547C/ACA8C, pMTGST554C/ACA5C, and pMTGST554C/APA5C were prepared by first digesting pMTGST547C and pMTGST554C withBglII/BstXI. The excised sequences of GST547C and GST554C were ligated into the BamHI/BstXI linearized Bluescript K+ expression vector (Stratagene). The primers 547ACA8a+b (5′-CGCAGCTGCGGCCGCTGCAGCAGCATG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTGCAGCGGCCGCAGCTGCGCATG-3′, respectively) and primers 554ACA5a+b (5′-CGCTGCGGCCGCTGCATG-3′ and 5′-CAGCGGCCGCAGCGCATG-3′, respectively) were inserted between the GST and receptor sequences of BSGST547C and BSGST554C vectors after linearization with SphI. Sequencing was performed to identify correct insertion, orientation, and number of the alanine linkers. The sequences GST547C/ACA8 and GST554C/ACA5 were then excised from the Bluescript vector using EcoRI and were used to replace the corresponding regions in pMTGST547C and pMTGST554C, respectively. The pMTGST554C/ACA5 vector was used to convert the linker ACAAAAAC to APAAAAAC. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the specification of the GeneEditor kit (Promega) using oligo ACA5/554PRO (5′-TGGATCCGCACCAGCTGCGGCCGCT-3′). A unique PvuII restriction site was created at the site of the Pro mutation, andPvuII digestion was used to confirm mutant. pSPGST537C and pSPGST547C were prepared from the pMTGST537C and pMTGST547C vectors, respectively, by BglII/SacI double digestion. The excised GST/GR sequences were then ligated with the pSP73 vector (Promega), after linearization byBglII/SacI double digestion, by using T4 ligase. pSPGST547C/ACA8, pSPGST554C, and pSPGST554C/ACA5 constructs for TNT studies: GST547C/ACA8, GST554C, and GST554C/ACA5 were removed from pMTGST547C/ACA8, pMTGST554C, and pMTGST554C/ACA5, respectively, bySacI/BglII double digestion and ligated into aSacI/BglII linearized pSP73 vector. Monolayer cultures of COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum. All the fusion proteins were expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells as described previously (23Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosol of transiently transfected COS-7 cells containing the steroid-free receptors was obtained by the lysis of cells at −80 °C and centrifugation at 15,000 ×g as described previously (24Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6876-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). [3H]Dexamethasone or [3H]TA binding assays and competition binding assays all contained 20 mm sodium molybdate. Briefly, 30% cytosol was incubated at 0 °C for 2.5 h with 50 nm [3H]steroid, mixed with dextran-coated charcoal, and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was counted in Hydrofluor. Scatchard analyses were conducted at 0 °C for 18 h with various concentrations of [3H]dexamethasone ± 100-fold excess of non-radioactive Dex. Unbound [3H]dexamethasone was removed with dextran-coated charcoal and the samples processed as above. Aliquots (200 μl) of undiluted cytosol from transfected COS-7 cells were immunoadsorbed with 15% anti-GST antibody or nonimmune IgG and subsequently incubated with 8-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoadsorbed GST fusion proteins were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immune pellets an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 m NaCl, followed by one wash with 1 ml of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Immune pellets containing stripped fusion proteins were suspended in 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Dithiothreitol (1 μl) was added to each incubation to a final concentration of 5 mm, and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mmcreatine phosphate, 2 mm MgOAc, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) were added to all assays to yield a final assay volume of 56 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 5 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate), and GST fusions and hsp90 were assayed in each sample by Western blotting. A portion of each immune pellet was assayed for steroid binding by incubation overnight in 100 μl of TEGM buffer plus 4 mmdithiothreitol and 50 nm [3H]TA. Samples were then washed twice with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described previously (25Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The steroid binding is expressed as counts/minutes [3H]TA bound/anti-GST immune pellet prepared from 100 μl of cytosol. For assay of GST fusion proteins and associated hsp90, immune pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with 0.2% anti-GST or 0.01% aP1 for fusion proteins and 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with 125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Cell-free transcription and translation of pSPGST537C and pSPGST547C was performed using a TNT kit (Promega) according to the procedure of the manufacturer. Aliquots of translation mixture containing [35S]methionine-labeled fusion protein were immunoadsorbed with the 3G3 monoclonal IgM against hsp90 as described by Dalman et al. (11Dalman F.C. Bresnick E.H. Patel P.D. Perdew G.H. Watson Jr., S.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19815-19821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled fusion protein co-adsorbed with hsp90 was detected by autoradiography. The immunoblot was cut just above the full-length fusion protein translation product and probed with AC88 for hsp90. The blot was incubated a second time with 125I-labeled counterantibody and developed by autoradiography. The fusion protein and hsp90 bands were excised and counted for 35S and 125I radioactivity, respectively. Nonradioactive translation mixture was used for quantitation of [3H]dexamethasone binding as described above. We previously utilized a series of DHFR/GR constructs with deletions at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends to determine the boundaries of the HBD of the rat GR to be amino acids 550–795 (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Attempts to examine the hsp90 binding properties of the DHFR/GR fusions adsorbed to methotrexate-agarose were unsuccessful due to high nonspecific binding of hsp90 to the matrix. Thus, we constructed the series of GR HBD fusions with GST shown in Fig. 1. As noted previously, plasmids encoding GR segments 537–673 or 537–795 did not yield stable polypeptides but stable proteins were obtained when β-galactosidase or dihydrofolate reductase were fused upstream of these segments (21Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 1, the four GST/GR HBD fusions also produced stable proteins of similar abundance as determined by Western blotting (data not shown; see also below). The GST537C fusion bound dexamethasone to the same extent and with the same affinity as the wild-type GR. The GST547C fusion also displayed the same steroid binding affinity as the wild-type GR but had only about 50% of its binding activity. Deletion of 5 additional amino acids from the amino terminus almost completely eliminated steroid binding activity. After minor correction for the amount of fusion protein present in cytosol from cells transfected with pMTGST552C, the steroid binding capacity was found to be ~5% of GST547C and ~2% of GST537C. Deletion of two more amino acids to yield GST554C further reduced even this trace of steroid binding activity. COS cell-expressed receptor chimeras were assayed for associated hsp90 by immunoadsorbing the fusion protein from transfected cell cytosol with anti-GST, washing the immune pellet, and Western blotting the pellet-bound fusion protein and the co-immunoadsorbed hsp90. As shown in lanes 1 of Fig. 2, both GST537C (Fig. 2 A) and GST547C (Fig. 2 B) were recovered in native heterocomplexes with monkey (i.e. COS cell) hsp90. The immune pellet of GST547C contained less hsp90 than that of the GST537C pellet, which was expected in view of the lower steroid binding activity (Fig. 2 B). The GST552C immune pellet (Fig. 2 C) included only a very small amount of hsp90 (visible in the original photograph), consistent with the trace steroid binding, and no hsp90 was recovered with GST554C (Fig. 2 D). The loss of hsp90 binding between 547 and 554 suggests that some feature of the HBD that is required for the hsp90-based chaperone machinery to form a stable HBD·hsp90 heterocomplex has been eliminated. Two possible explanations were considered for the decreased binding of steroid to receptors lacking the 7 amino acids 547–553. First, the further deletion could bring the GST molecule too close to the GR HBD and thus sterically interfere with hsp90, and consequently, steroid binding to the chimera. Second, the deleted sequences might be required for either a structural role and/or specific protein-protein interactions. To investigate these questions, an 8-amino acid α-helical linker (ACAAAAAC) was placed just amino-terminal to the receptor sequence of 554–795 to give GSTACAAAAAC554C (GST554C/ACA5C; Fig.3 A). This chimera approximates GST547C as an 8-amino acid α-helix will now separate the GST and GR HBD domains. For a positive control, a similar 11-amino acid α-helical linker (ACAAAAAAAAC) was inserted just amino-terminal to the receptor sequences to give GSTACAAAAAAAAC547C (GST547C/ACA8C), thus approximating GST537C (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the α-helical linker did not increase the binding activity of the chimera containing just receptor sequences of 554C (Fig. 3 A). This was not due to lack of expression of the fusion protein (Fig.3 B). Nor was the absence of binding due to some detrimental effect of an α-helical linker insert, as seen by the unaltered steroid binding affinity and only modest reduction in binding capacity for the control construct GST547C/ACA8C (Fig. 3 A). On the basis of a general model based on the x-ray structures of retinoic acid receptor and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) HBDs (26Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nature Structural Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of amino acids 547–553 of the rat GR is thought to be that of an α-helix. However, the presence of two prolines in this region suggests that a kink may be present near the beginning of this helix (helix 1). Such a kink could move the rest of the receptor (or GST in the fusion protein) out of the way of a surface required for hsp90 binding to GR. To test this hypothesis, a proline was introduced into GST554C/ACA5C to cause a break near the beginning of the introduced α-helix (Fig.3 A). This new chimera (GST554C/APA5C) contains the linker APAAAAAC. As indicated in Fig. 3 A, the presence of this kinked linker still did not cause any increase in steroid binding over that seen for GST554C. Again, this was not due to the absence of expressed proteins in the transfected COS cells (Fig.3 B). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains the multicomponent chaperone system that forms stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and reactivates steroid binding activity (4Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocrinol. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, when the monkey hsp90 was stripped from the GST537C fusion protein, steroid binding activity was lost (lane 2). Incubation of the stripped immune pellet with reticulocyte lysate resulted in reassociation of a portion of the GST537C with rabbit hsp90 and there was ~30% reactivation of steroid binding activity (lane 4). The reticulocyte lysate system is dynamic in that receptor-hsp90 heterocomplexes are constantly being assembled and disassembled (27Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that incubation of GR with reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [3H]TA allows detection of complexes that would otherwise have been disassembled and thus not be in a steroid binding state by the end of the incubation (28Stancato L.F. Hutchison K.A. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, in lane 5 of Fig. 2 A, when [3H]TA was present during the incubation to bind the fusion protein as soon as complexes with rabbit hsp90 were formed, about 52 ± 9% (±S.D., n = 4) of the GST537C was restored to the steroid binding state.

https://openalex.org/W1992945920,"An oligodeoxynucleotide-dependent method to generate nascent polypeptide chains was adopted for use in a cell-free translation system prepared from Escherichia coli. In this way, NH2-terminal pOmpA fragments of distinct sizes were synthesized. Because most of these pOmpA fragments could be covalently linked to puromycin, precipitated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and were enriched by sedimentation, they represent a population of elongation-arrested, ribosome-associated nascent chains. Translocation of these nascent pOmpA chains into inside-out membrane vesicles of E. coli required SecA and (depending on size) SecB. Whereas their translocation was strictly dependent on the H+-motive force of the vesicles, no indication for the involvement of the bacterial signal recognition particle was obtained. SecA and SecB, although required for translocation, did not mediate binding of the ribosome-associated pOmpA to membrane vesicles. However, SecA and SecB cotranslationally associated with nascent pOmpA, since they could be co-isolated with the ribosome-associated nascent chains and as such catalyzed translocation subsequent to the release of the ribosome. These results indicate that in E. coli, SecA also functionally interacts with preproteins before they are targeted to the translocase of the plasma membrane. An oligodeoxynucleotide-dependent method to generate nascent polypeptide chains was adopted for use in a cell-free translation system prepared from Escherichia coli. In this way, NH2-terminal pOmpA fragments of distinct sizes were synthesized. Because most of these pOmpA fragments could be covalently linked to puromycin, precipitated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and were enriched by sedimentation, they represent a population of elongation-arrested, ribosome-associated nascent chains. Translocation of these nascent pOmpA chains into inside-out membrane vesicles of E. coli required SecA and (depending on size) SecB. Whereas their translocation was strictly dependent on the H+-motive force of the vesicles, no indication for the involvement of the bacterial signal recognition particle was obtained. SecA and SecB, although required for translocation, did not mediate binding of the ribosome-associated pOmpA to membrane vesicles. However, SecA and SecB cotranslationally associated with nascent pOmpA, since they could be co-isolated with the ribosome-associated nascent chains and as such catalyzed translocation subsequent to the release of the ribosome. These results indicate that in E. coli, SecA also functionally interacts with preproteins before they are targeted to the translocase of the plasma membrane. Protein export across the plasma (cytoplasmic, inner) membrane ofEscherichia coli is achieved by the concerted action of a distinct set of Sec proteins (summarized in Ref. 1Duong F. Eichler J.

Ras controls the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), while Rac and Cdc42 regulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). In this study, we investigated whether small G protein/MAPK cascades contribute to signal transduction by transforming variants of c-Fes, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase implicated in cytokine signaling and myeloid differentiation. First, we investigated the effects of dominant-negative small G proteins on Rat-2 fibroblast transformation by a retroviral homolog of c-Fes (v-Fps) and by c-Fes activated via N-terminal addition of the v-Src myristylation signal (Myr-Fes). We observed that dominant-negative Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 inhibited v-Fps- and Myr-Fes-induced growth of Rat-2 cells in soft agar, indicating that activation of these small GTP-binding proteins is required for fibroblast transformation by Fps/Fes tyrosine kinases. To determine whether MAPK pathways are activated downstream of these small G proteins, we measured ERK and JNK activity in the v-Fps- and Myr-Fes-transformed Rat-2 cells. Both ERK and JNK activities were elevated in the transformed cells, suggesting that these pathways are involved in cellular transformation. Dominant-negative mutants of Ras (but not Rac or Cdc42) specifically inhibited ERK activation by v-Fps and Myr-Fes, demonstrating that ERK activation occurs exclusively downstream of Ras. All three dominant-negative small G proteins inhibited JNK activation by v-Fps and Myr-Fes, indicating that JNK activation by these tyrosine kinases requires both Ras and Rho family GTPases. These data demonstrate that multiple small G protein/MAPK cascades are involved in downstream signal transduction by Fps/Fes tyrosine kinases.

Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins regulate diverse cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Katz M.E.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). One key function of these small GTP-binding proteins is to link upstream protein-tyrosine kinases with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase. pathways. Perhaps the best characterized MAPK pathway involves Raf/MEK/ERK activation downstream of Ras (5Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 6Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). Raf binds to the GTP-bound, active form of Ras at the plasma membrane and becomes activated. Active Raf phosphorylates and activates the dual specificity MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2 which in turn activate the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERKs can then translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate a number of transcription factors. In this way, the Ras/ERK pathway provides a critical link between tyrosine kinase signal transduction and transcriptional events in the nucleus. In addition to the Ras/ERK cascade, recent work has revealed parallel small G protein/MAPK pathways to the nucleus. Small GTPases of the Rho family including Rac and Cdc42 (but not Rho itself) are linked to a kinase cascade leading to the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), an ERK-related serine kinase that specifically phosphorylates and activates the c-Jun transcription factor (8Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). This cascade is also linked to a related kinase known as p38. Both p38 and JNK are activated in response to cytokines as well as cellular stress. Rac and Cdc42 are connected to JNK via intermediate MEKK (analogous to Raf) and SEK (analogous to MEK) activities. The Rac/Cdc42/JNK cascade also includes additional kinases upstream of MEKK, such as p21-activated kinase 65, which may represent the direct targets of active Rac and Cdc42 (7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 8Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus in addition to their roles in the regulation of cytoskeletal architecture (3Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar, 11Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar), Rac and Cdc42 can control transcriptional events in the nucleus as well. Activation of small GTPase/MAPK pathways is a common feature of both normal and oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinase signal transduction (12Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The biochemical connection between tyrosine kinases and the activation of small GTPases downstream often involves recruitment and activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. In the case of Ras, autophosphorylation of activated tyrosine kinases can create binding sites for the SH2 domains of adaptor proteins such as Shc and Grb-2, which serve as intermediates in the recruitment of the SOS guanine nucleotide exchange factor to the plasma membrane, focal adhesions, or other sites of tyrosine kinase signaling (13Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 14Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1996; 19: 130-140Google Scholar). The translocation of SOS to these sites allows for Ras activation and subsequent stimulation of the MAPK pathway downstream. In the case of Rho family GTPases, tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor may be essential for activation. For example, recent studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation stimulates the exchange activity of Vav, leading to activation of the JNK pathway (15Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A.

In addition, products of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway have recently been shown to regulate the exchange activity of Vav and SOS toward Rho family GTPases (17Han J.W. Luby-Phelps K.

Previous studies have identified Bcr, Ras GAP, and Shc as substrates for c-Fes and its transforming viral homolog, v-Fps (31Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T.

For example, Bcr has a C-terminal GAP domain for Rac and Cdc42 (36Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) as well as a central guanine nucleotide exchange region with homology to Dbl (37Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N.

Previous work from our laboratory has shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr in v-Fps-transformed fibroblasts induces its association with Grb-2/SOS, suggesting that Bcr may couple Fps/Fes tyrosine kinases to both the Ras and Rho signaling pathways downstream (34Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that small G proteins of both the Ras and Rho families are required for Fps/Fes-induced fibroblast transformation and that small G protein activation is coupled to the ERK and JNK pathways downstream. These data provide strong evidence that activation of multiple small G protein/MAPK cascades is critical to Fps/Fes signal transduction. The full-length cDNAs for N17Ras, V12N17Rac, and N17Cdc42 containing a C-terminal Myc epitope tag were the generous gift of Dr. Alan Hall, MRC, London (39Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were subcloned into the retroviral vector pSRαMSVtkneo (40Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau R.N. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Addition of the N-terminal myristylation signal sequence of v-Src to the N-terminal region of c-Fes to create the transforming oncoprotein Myr-Fes was accomplished using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach and will be described in detail elsewhere. 2J. A. Rogers, N. A. Dunham, and T. E. Smithgall, manuscript in preparation. Construction of a full-length human c-fes cDNA with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag is described elsewhere (42Rogers J.A.

A similar polymerase chain reaction-based procedure was used to add the FLAG coding sequence to the C-terminal region of v-Fps and Myr-Fes. The coding sequence of the v-src oncogene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a Rous sarcoma virus template obtained from the ATCC and subcloned into the pSRαMSVtkneo and pCDNA3 expression vectors described above. Retroviral stocks were prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells (43Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar) with the pSRαMSVtkneo constructs together with an ecotropic packaging vector (40Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau R.N. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were grown to 50–80% confluence in 10-cm2 dishes and transfected using a calcium phosphate method as described previously (42Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Culture medium containing the recombinant retroviruses was harvested from 2 to 5 days post-transfection. Viral supernatants were pooled and stored in frozen aliquots at −80 °C. Negative control retroviruses were prepared using the parent vector alone. Rat-2 cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses in the presence of polybrene as described (44Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). G418 was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml 48 h later, and the cells were grown under G418 selection for 2–4 weeks. The expression of N17Ras, V12N17Rac, and N17Cdc42 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, 9E10 (39Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Stable expression of c-Fes was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2 (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). Rat-2 cells (5 × 104) stably expressing N17Ras, V12N17Rac, N17Cdc42, or theneo marker alone were plated in 6-well dishes. Cells were infected with v-Src, v-Fps, or Myr-Fes retroviruses 24 h later as described above and incubated for 2 additional days. The cells were then trypsinized, and 1 × 104 cells were replated in triplicate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.3% agar and 20% fetal calf serum. Transformed colonies were counted after 2 weeks. To establish Rat-2 cell lines stably expressing each of the tyrosine kinases, single transformed colonies were isolated from the soft agar plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. The expression of v-Src was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with an anti-Src antibody (N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Myr-Fes and v-Fps expression were confirmed with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Rat-2 or 293T cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium prior to harvesting. Clarified cell lysates were prepared as described previously (35Li J. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32930-32936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For some experiments, a solid phase JNK assay was employed (45Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (75 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 μg of an immobilized GST-Jun fusion protein (Jun amino acids 1–72) in a final volume of 300 μl of HBB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4 °C. The GST-Jun fusion protein was then washed with four 1.0-ml aliquots of HBB buffer and incubated with 35 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 40 μm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 μm Na3VO4) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) for 20 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by storage phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager). Alternatively, JNK activity was assessed by immune complex kinase assay. Clarified cell lysates (75 μg) were incubated with 0.8 μg of JNK1 antibody (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in HBB buffer at 4 °C for 3 h. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, washed with HBB buffer, and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was tested for JNK activity using the in vitro kinase assay conditions described above for the solid phase assay. The second aliquot was immunoblotted with the JNK antibody to verify equivalent levels of the JNK protein in each reaction. Clarified cell lysates (75 μg) were incubated with MAPK lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and immunoprecipitated with ERK1 and ERK2 antibodies (0.4 μg each; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, washed three times with 1.0 ml of MAPK lysis buffer and twice with MAP kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 25 μm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was assayed for ERK activity in 40 μl of MAP kinase buffer containing 2 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and labeled MBP was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by storage phosphorimaging. The second aliquot was immunoblotted with the ERK1 antibody to verify equivalent amounts of ERK protein in each immunoprecipitate. In this study, we used fibroblast transformation as a model system to study small G protein/MAPK signaling by v-Fps and Myr-Fes, two activated forms of the Fps/Fes tyrosine kinase family. v-Fps is a potent transforming homolog of c-Fes found in the chicken sarcoma virus, FSV (46Shibuya M. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1982; 30: 787-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47Hanafusa T. Wang L.-H. Anderson S.M. Karess R.E. Hayward W.S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Myr-Fes is a form of human c-Fes that is activated by N-terminal addition of the v-Src myristylation signal sequence, which results in membrane targeting (22Greer P. Haigh J. Mbamalu G. Khoo W. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6755-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 are involved in fibroblast transformation by fps/fes oncogenes, we inhibited the function of these small G proteins in Rat-2 cells with dominant-inhibitory mutants in which the Ser residue at position 17 was changed to Asn (N17 mutants). These mutants bind preferentially to GDP and act as dominant inhibitors of endogenous small G protein function presumably by blocking their access to exchange factors (39Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 48Cai H. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 49Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Populations of Rat-2 fibroblasts stably expressing each of these mutants were infected with v-Fps and Myr-Fes retroviruses and assayed for soft agar colony formation as a measure of transformation. As a control, we also examined transformation by v-Src in these cell lines, because previous work has shown that dominant-negative mutants of Ras and Rac interfere with transformation by this oncogenic tyrosine kinase (10Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, we observed that v-Src, v-Fps, and Myr-Fes consistently produced fewer transformed colonies from cells expressing the dominant-negative small G proteins as compared with control cells. Control immunoblots demonstrate equivalent expression of v-Src, v-Fps, or Myr-Fes in all four cell lines (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that fibroblast transformation by oncogenically activated Fps/Fes tyrosine kinases as well as v-Src requires the activation of Ras and Rho family GTPases. To verify that the dominant-negative small GTPases did not induce a general suppression of cellular proliferation, the growth rates of the Rat-2 cell populations stably expressing each of the mutants were compared with that of the control cells expressing only the drug-selection marker. As shown in Fig.2 A, Rat-2 cells stably expressing dominant-negative Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 grew at the same rate and to the same saturation density as the vector control cells. Expression of the dominant-negative small G proteins was verified by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig.2 B). As an alternative experimental approach to investigate the effect of dominant-negative small G proteins on Fps/Fes-mediated transformation, soft agar colony-forming assays were performed on Rat-2 fibroblasts following co-infection with recombinant retroviruses carrying the transforming oncogenes and the dominant-negative GTPase mutants. As shown in Fig. 3, this approach also led to strong suppression of transforming activity. These results are in good agreement with those observed using the Rat-2 cell populations stably expressing the dominant-negative mutants (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data support the conclusion that Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 play essential roles in transformation signaling downstream from oncogenic Fps/Fes tyrosine kinases as well as v-Src. Activation of many tyrosine kinase families is linked to stimulation of ERK activity (see Introduction). To determine whether the ERK pathway is activated by Fps/Fes kinases, we measured ERK activity in v-Fps- and Myr-Fes-transformed Rat-2 cell lines derived from single transformed soft-agar colonies. We also examined ERK activation in a Rat-2 cell line stably expressing c-Fes and in control G418-resistant Rat-2 cells. Endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates and an in vitro kinase assay was conducted with MBP and [γ-32P]ATP as co-substrates. As shown in Fig.4, ERK activity was increased 6–7-fold in the v-Fps- and Myr-Fes-transformed cells. In contrast, stable expression of c-Fes, which is nontransforming, resulted in only a 2-fold increase in ERK activity. These results suggest that transformation by activated forms of Fps/Fes kinases may require sustained ERK activation. In contrast, no activation of ERK was observed in the v-Src transformants, suggesting that maintenance of the v-Src-transformed phenotype does not require constitutive MAPK activation. The surprising result that transformation by v-Src was not associated with constitutive ERK activation led us to investigate the effects of v-Src and Fps/Fes kinases on this pathway under transient expression conditions. For these experiments, we employed the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293T (43Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar), and the in vitro ERK assay described above. As shown in Fig. 4, both v-Src and v-Fps stimulated ERK activity in this system. However, both c-Fes and Myr-Fes were unable to stimulate ERK activity in 293T cells. This lack of activation may reflect the tight regulation of both c-Fes and Myr-Fes tyrosine kinase activity in this cell line, despite the high level of protein expression (42Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).2 A nearly identical pattern of ERK activation was also observed in Rat-2 cells transiently expressing v-Fps, Myr-Fes, c-Fes, and v-Src, validating the use of 293T cells as a model system for the investigation of small G protein/MAPK signaling following transient expression of these tyrosine kinases (data not shown). Recent studies have shown that JNK is activated downstream of Rac and Cdc42 (see Introduction). To determine whether the JNK pathway is activated by v-Fps and Myr-Fes, JNK activity was measured in the v-Src-, v-Fps-, and Myr-Fes-transformed Rat-2 cells. Endogenous JNK was precipitated from cell lysates with an immobilized GST-Jun fusion protein and kinase activity of substrate-bound JNK was assayed by addition of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.5, JNK activity was elevated in the v-Src-, v-Fps-, and Myr-Fes- transformed Rat-2 cells, suggesting that constitutive JNK activation may contribute to transformation by these oncogenes. In contrast, no increase in JNK activity was observed in nontransformed Rat-2 cells stably expressing c-Fes. Thus, JNK activation correlates with the transforming activity of these tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Endogenous JNK activity was also measured in 293T cells transiently expressing v-Src, v-Fps, Myr-Fes, and c-Fes. As shown in Fig. 5, expression of v-Src and v-Fps readily stimulated JNK activity in 293T cells. In contrast to Rat-2 cells, JNK activity was only modestly increased by Myr-Fes in 293T cells. Similar differences were observed for Myr-Fes-induced activation of ERK in Rat-2 versus 293T cells (Fig. 4), and are consistent with the hypothesis that cells responding with activation of these pathways are selected for during transformation. c-Fes also slightly activated JNK over background in 293T cells, suggesting that JNK may be more sensitive than ERK to the low level of Fes tyrosine kinase activity resulting from the overexpression of Fes in this cell line (42Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given that ERKs are often activated downstream of Ras, we tested whether dominant-negative Ras selectively blocks ERK activation in response to transforming signals from v-Fps and Myr-Fes.

https://openalex.org/W2120536656,"The N-(deoxyguanosine-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (dG-C8-AAF) lesion is among the most helix distorting DNA lesions. In normal fibroblasts dG-C8-AAF is repaired rapidly in transcriptionally active genes, but without strand specificity, indicating that repair of dG-C8-AAF by global genome repair (GGR) overrules transcription-coupled repair (TCR). Yet, dG-C8-AAF is a very potent inhibitor of transcription. The target size of inhibition (45 kilobases) suggests that transcription inhibition by dG-C8-AAF is caused by blockage of initiation rather than elongation. Cockayne's syndrome (CS) cells appear to be extremely sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of dG-C8-AAF and are unable to recover inhibited RNA synthesis. However, CS cells exhibit no detectable defect in repair of dG-C8-AAF in active genes, indicating that impaired TCR is not the cause of the enhanced sensitivity of CS cells. These and data reported previously suggest that the degree of DNA helix distortion determines the rate of GGR as well as the extent of inhibition of transcription initiation. An interchange of the transcription/repair factor TFIIH from promoter sites to sites of damage might underlie inhibition of transcription initiation. This process is likely to occur more rapidly and efficiently in the case of strongly DNA helix distorting lesions, resulting in a very efficient GGR, a poor contribution of TCR to repair of lesions in active genes, and an efficient inhibition of transcription."

Plasma coagulation factor XI is a glycoprotein present in human plasma at a concentration of ~30 nm as a zymogen that, when converted by limited proteolysis to an active serine protease, participates in the contact phase of blood coagulation. This zymogen is an unique plasma coagulation enzyme because it exists as a homodimer (M r ~143,000) consisting of two identical polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds (1Kurachi K. Davie E.W.

Exon I encodes the 5′ untranslated region, and exon II encodes a signal peptide. The next eight exons (III–X) encode four tandem repeat sequences of 90 or 91 amino acids (Apple domains) that are present in the amino-terminal region of the mature protein. The carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, which contains the catalytic domain, is encoded by five exons (XI–XV) that are interrupted by four introns. Factor XI coagulant activity and antigen are present in well-washed platelet suspensions, and the activity accounts for about 0.5% of the total factor XI activity in blood (5Walsh P.N. Br. J.

Taken together, these findings suggest that platelet factor XI is either a disulfide-linked tetramer or, alternatively, aM r 55,000 protein disulfide linked to a platelet membrane protein and that platelet membranes contain an endogenous factor XI-like activity structurally distinct from plasma factor XI. These facts and the observation that platelet factor XI has plasma factor XI activity and antigenic similarity (9Tuszynski G.P. Bevacqua S.J. Schmaier A.H. Colman R.W. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1982; 59: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with the possibility that this protein may be an alternatively spliced product of the gene for circulating plasma factor XI. Enzymatic amplification (utilizing the polymerase chain reaction) of platelet-specific mRNA after treatment with reverse transcriptase (RT) has been previously reported (12Newman P.J. Gorski J. White G.C., II Gidwitz S. Cretney C.J. Aster R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we used this method to amplify the vestigial amounts of mRNA corresponding to platelet factor XI. In situ amplification and hybridization has been successfully accomplished in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (13Bagasra O. Seshamma T. Pomerantz R.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 158: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this method, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be performed in situ in fixed cells on specially designed glass slides. After the reaction, the amplified products can be detected byin situ hybridization utilizing specific biotinylated probes. We used this technique to confirm the cell type expression of factor XI mRNA. The length of factor XI mRNA in a megakaryocytic cell line (Meg-01) was 1.9 kb, and in liver cells, 2.1 kb, by Northern hybridization, confirming the results from RT-PCR experiments and in situ amplification and hybridization. This paper reports the presence of an alternatively spliced factor XI in human platelets and presents the complete sequence of all exons coding for platelet factor XI (including exons I and II). Hep G-2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Human Meg-01 cells (a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line) were generously supplied by Dr. Hidehiko Saito (Nagoya, Japan). Plasma factor XI cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. Dominic Chung, Kazuo Fujikawa, and Earl Davie (Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Proteinase K, DNase, RNase inhibitor, dNTP, Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT, andTaq polymerase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Biotinylated probes were obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Streptavidin-peroxidase and 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole were purchased from Pierce. RNAzol was obtained from Biotecx (Houston, TX). Two tubes of 50 ml of blood containing 7 ml of acid citrate dextrose solution (15 g/liter citric acid, 25 g/liter trisodium citrate, 20 g/liter dextrose) were collected from each donor. Prostaglandin E1 was added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. The blood samples were centrifuged (1000 rpm for 20 min at room temperature). Platelet-rich plasma, obtained from the upper one-third of the blood sample, was transferred to a new tube for another centrifugation (1000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature) to avoid contamination with leukocytes. The lower part of blood sample was saved for the preparation of monocytes and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes. The platelet-rich plasma was then transferred to another tube and centrifuged (1800 rpm for 15 min at room temperature). The plasma supernatant was carefully removed from the platelet pellet. The pellet was resuspended in Hepes buffer (consisting of 15 mmHepes at pH 6.8, 8.6 mm dextrose, 0.376 mmNaH2PO4, 0.98 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 126 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), centrifuged (1800 rpm for 10 min at room temperature), and finally resuspended in the same buffer and centrifuged again. For the isolation of human PMN leukocytes and monocytes, PolymorphprepTM (Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo, Norway) was used. Three to 5 ml of the blood from the above procedure was layered carefully over 3–5 ml of PolymorphprepTM in the tube. The tube was centrifuged at 450 × g for 30 min at 20 °C. After centrifugation, there were two visible bands. The upper band, at the sample/medium interface, consisted of monocytes, and the lower band consisted of PMN leukocytes. The cells were diluted by addition of 0.45% NaCl. The platelet pellet obtained from the above procedure was resuspended in 3 ml of RNAzol (Biotecx), and RNA was isolated as recommended by the manufacturer. Aliquots of the total RNA preparation were frozen at −20 °C until they were further used in experiments employing RT-PCR as described below. Based upon the published nucleotide sequence of plasma factor XI (3Asakai R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), two oligonucleotide primers were prepared for each exon using a model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a scale of 0.1 μmol per synthesis from the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory at Temple University School of Medicine. A total of 26 primers were synthesized for the 13 exons of factor XI (Table I).Table IOligonucleotides corresponding to plasma factor XI in PCR amplificationsExon5′ primer: 5′ → 3′3′ primer: 5′ → 3′IIIAATGTGTGACTCAGTTGTTGAAAGCATCGGGTGGGATCCTCAGATIVGTTTACTTGTGTCCTGAAAGACAGGCTTATTTGGTGTGAGCATTGCTTVCTTGCAACAAAGACATTTATGTGCGATGCTCCAGGCTGGGAAACVIAACATTTGTCTACTGAAGCACACCCAGATTAGAAAGTGCACAGGATTTVIICTTGTATTAGGGACATTTTCCCTTTTGAGATTCTTTGGGCCATTCCTVIIIAAATCTTTGTCTCCTTAAAACATCTGTGGGATGCTGTGCCTGCAGCTIXTGTTTCTGCCATTCTTCATTTTACTCCCTTCGTTGCAGGATGCTTGXGGCAAGTGTTACTTAAAGCTTTCTTATTATCCATTTTACACAACCTTAATGXIAGTGTACCACCAAAATCAAGCCATAGAAACAGTGAGCGGCTGATAAXIIGGTAGAGTCACCTAAGATTTTTGTGTAATTCACTGTGGTTTCCAGXIIIATTCTCAACGACCCATATGCCTTCTTAGTTTTCTGTACCCCCATCXIVACAAAATACAAAATACTCTCCAGAACTTGCAAGCGTCCTTCCCTCCXVGGAGATTCGGGAGGCCCTCTCACTGCTTGAGTTTTCTCCAGAAT Open table in a new tab Total platelet RNA was analyzed by modifications of the method for RT-PCR originally described by Newman et al.(12Newman P.J. Gorski J. White G.C., II Gidwitz S. Cretney C.J. Aster R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The SuperScriptTM preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for first strand cDNA synthesis. The RT reaction was carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.,) using incubation conditions as follows: room temperature for 10 min, 42 °C for 50 min, 90 °C for 5 min, and 0 °C for 10 min. The cDNA obtained from the RT reaction was used for PCR amplification. Both 5′ and 3′ primers were added to a final concentration of 0.1 μm. Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units) (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) was then added. Water was used in place of cDNA in negative control experiments. The cDNA from human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G-2) cells was also used in place of cDNA from platelets in positive control experiments. The PCR was carried out using the following sequence of cycling conditions: 1) 95 °C for 150 s; 2) 95 °C for 30 s; 3) 58 °C for 45 s; 4) 72 °C for 45 s; 5) repeat of steps 2–4 for 35 cycles; and 6) 72 °C for 7 min. PCR amplification products were visualized on 3% agarose gel electrophoresis (ethidium bromide staining). Amplified DNA was purified using the Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) purification kit. Nucleotide sequences for PCR products were obtained using the dsDNA Cycle Sequencing System (Life Technologies, Inc.). This kit contains a number of modifications based on the sequencing method of Sanger et al. (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Primers used for sequencing were the same as those used for PCR amplification. A modification of the original sequencing electrophoresis method (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar), using 40% formamide in the sequencing gel, was used to overcome gel compression caused by the secondary structure of sequencing products during gel electrophoresis. Cells and platelets isolated from each individual donor were prepared for in situ hybridization and amplification (16Ou C.Y. Kwok S. Mitchell S.W. Mack D.H. Sninsky J.J. Krebs J.W. Feorino P. Warfield D. Schochetman G. Science. 1988; 239: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) utilizing PCR primers and biotinylated probes for exon III or exon V. Cells (monocytes, PMN leukocytes, erythrocytes, buffy coats, Hep G-2 cells, or platelets) were seeded into the wells of a specially designed slide containing three 8-mm wells/slide. Approximately 1000–10,000 cells in a 10-μl volume were added to each well. Slides were heat-fixed at 105 °C for 90 s and then were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h. Paraformaldehyde was inactivated by incubating slides in 3× phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7 H2O, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4) for 10 min and then washing slides two times in 1× PBS. The endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubating slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS overnight. These slides were treated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml) at 55 °C for 10–20 min. During the proteinase K treatment, cells were observed microscopically (× 400 magnification) for appearance of microbubbles on the plasma membranes of the cell surface. Once the microbubbles appeared, the proteinase K treatment was terminated by incubating slides on a heat block at 95 °C for 10 min. The cells were treated with RNase-free DNase, 10 units in DNase buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.4 and 10 mm MgCl2 with 10 mm dithiothreitol and 50 units of RNase inhibitor) overnight. DNase was inactivated by exposing cells to 95 °C heat over a heat block. The RT reaction was accomplished by adding to the wells 10 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.07 m KCl, 0.03 m Tris, pH 8.3, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm of all four dNTPs, and 15 mmMgCl2, with Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT and 20 μm downstream primers at 37–42 °C for 1 h. A slide well without RT was used as a negative control to test for DNA contamination. After 1 h incubation, the slides were washed in 1× PBS and then twice in distilled water. The cells were then subjected toin situ PCR. The amplification mixture was prepared containing exon III or exon V primers and Taq polymerase (50 mm Tris buffered at pH 8.3, 6 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase, and 200 μm of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate). For positive internal controls, we amplified the conserved region of HLA-DQA1 by using primers (HLA-DQ-GH-26/27, Synthetic Genetics). Ten microliters of amplification mixture containing exon III or exon V primers was added to wells 1 and 2, and a mixture containing no primers was added to well 3. Slides were covered with coverslips and sealed with clear nail polish. These slides were placed in the specifically designed heat block of a thermocycler (M. J. Research, Boston, MA). Exon III- or exon V-specific gene sequences were amplified in the individual intact cell structures by adding amplification mixture containing primer pairs representing the conserved regions of these gene segments. Thirty cycles of amplification in an automatic thermal cycler, set at 94, 45, and 72 °C, were employed. Hybridizations were performed with DNA probes biotinylated at the 5′ end (Midland Certified Reagent Co.): the exon III probe was 5′-ACATTTATGTGGACCTAGACATGAAGGGCATAAACTATAACAGCTCAGTGCCAAGAGTGCTCAAGAATGCCAAGAAAGATGCACGGATGACGTCCACTG-3′ and the exon V probe was 5′-GGACACCTGCTTTGAAGGAGGGGACATTACTACGGTCTTCACACCAAGCGCCAAGTACTGCCAGGTAGTCTGCACTTACCACCCAAGATGTTTACTCTTC-3′. HLA-DQA1 cells were identified by biotinylated probe GH64 (5′-TGGACCTGGAGAGGAAGGAGACTG-3′). Negative controls for each assay were monocytes, erythrocytes, PMN leukocytes, and buffy coats, as well as RT-untreated but DNase-treated cells amplified for exon III or exon V. Positive controls were a mixture of the DNase treated cells with non-DNase-treated monocytes in a 10:1 ratio. Hybridization was carried out in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, 100 μg/ml of fragmented salmon sperm DNA, 1 mg/ml ofEscherichia coli tRNA, and 0.5 pg of probes at 90 °C for 6 min and then at 48 °C for 4 h. These cells were washed to remove unbound probes and incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase for 1 h at 37 °C. Color was developed with 0.3% H2O2, 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole dissolved in 50 mm acetate buffer. Microscopic examination usually reveals cytoplasmic staining versus nuclear staining. Percentage of labeled cells, by morphologic type, were counted on each slide. Multiple areas of the slides were viewed, and the entire slide was surveyed for localized staining or the presence of >1:106 positive cells. Counting was done on blindly labeled slides by at least three observers, including two experienced pathologists. Total RNA from human Meg-01 cells was prepared by suspension and lysis of cells in RNAzol. The Meg-01 cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of RNAzol and aliquoted into three RNase-free Eppendorf tubes. Poly(A)+ mRNA was obtained from total RNA of Meg-01 cells by using the Oligotext mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc.). Liver poly(A)+ mRNA was purchased from CLONTECHLaboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Procedures followed for Northern hybridization were standard protocols as described previously (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). A cDNA library prepared from CHRF-288–11 cells (17Zieger B. Hashimoto Y. Ware J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by Dr. Jerry Ware (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The library was screened using standard procedures (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) using radiolabeled factor XI cDNA as a probe. pBK-CMV was excised from plague purified recombinant phage by the ExAssit/XLORO system (Stratagene). The cDNA insert was sequenced using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It was critical to ensure that the platelet preparation contained no other contaminating cells, such as PMN leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, or erythrocytes. To verify that platelets were the only detectable cells in the suspension, a hemocytometer (American Optical Corp., Buffalo, NY) was used to count the ratio of white cells to platelets. When a series of dilutions of platelet suspension were made (dilutions of 1-, 10-, 200-, and 400-fold), no white cells were found in the hemocytometer chamber. When 7.5 × 105 platelets were present in the hemocytometer chamber and 10 separate chambers were carefully examined, no other contaminating cells were observed. Therefore, the platelet preparations were more than 99.9999% pure; i.e. there was less than 1 leukocyte per 7.5 × 106 platelets. The cDNA from platelet mRNA was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PCR amplification was carried out by using different pairs of primers for each exon. On the basis of the published nucleotide sequence of plasma factor XI (3Asakai R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), there are 13 exons coding for factor XI. Representative results utilizing platelets from two different donors are presented in Fig. 1and demonstrate that platelet factor XI consists of 12 exons out of a total of 13 (all except exon V: Fig. 1, lane 3) that encode for plasma factor XI. Similar results were consistently observed in 17 separate experiments utilizing platelets obtained from six separate blood donors, including one (P. N. W.) whose platelets have consistently and repeatedly shown positive results for platelet factor XI activity (5Walsh P.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Lipscomb M.S. Walsh P.N. J. Clin.

Blood. 1982; 59: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results (Fig.2) show that all 13 exons coding for plasma factor XI were amplified (including exon V; Fig. 2, lane 4) by PCR from HepG-2 cells.Figure 2DNA amplification products of human factor XI by RT-PCR from Hep G-2 cells. Lane 1, pBR322 DNAMsp-I digest marker; lanes 2–9, PCR amplification products of factor XI from Hep-G2 cells (lane 2, exon III; lane 3, exon IV; lane 4, exon V; lane 5, exon VI; lane 6, exon VII; lane 7, exon VIII; lane 8, exon IX; lane 9, exon X); lanes 10–14, PCR amplification products of factor XI from Hep G-2 cells (lane 10, exon XI; lane 11; exon XII; lane 12, exon XIII; lane 13, exon XIV; lane 14, exon XV).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Utilizing RT-PCR, exon III and exon IV (which encode the Apple 1 domain) were consistently amplified from platelet mRNA utilizing a 5′ primer for exon III and 3′ primer for exon IV (Fig. 3, lane 2). This result eliminates the possibility of contamination of platelet RNA with genomic DNA from other cells. It also demonstrates that exons III and IV are present in platelet mRNA in the “correct” orientation, encoding a functional Apple 1 domain (4Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Sequencing of DNA amplification products was accomplished using both the 5′-primer and the 3′-primer for each individual exon of factor XI in a separate sequencing reaction. Full-length sequences were obtained for all 12 exons amplified from platelet mRNA. All of the nucleotide sequences (data not shown) were identical to those reported for plasma factor XI cDNA (3Asakai R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because RT-PCR determined that exons III-IV and exons VI-XV are present in human platelets, whereas exon V is absent, we next examined both platelets and other blood cells for the presence of factor XI mRNA. In situ amplification and hybridization were used to determine the cell type expression of factor XI mRNA using primers and biotinylated probes specific for exons III and V. The experiments were performed three times, each in duplicate, and read blindly by two pathologists and two other observers without knowledge of the primers and probes used for amplification and detection. For all samples, platelets were positive for exon III and negative for exon V, whereas other cells (monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes) were negative for both exons III and V. Representative results are shown for illustrative purposes in Fig.4. The results were positive for exon III (Fig. 4 A) and negative for exon V (Fig. 4 B) in human platelets. Monocytes and PMN leukocytes (DNase-treated) were also used for negative controls to prove that the mRNA that we amplified is not from white cells. The results were negative for both monocytes (Fig. 4, C, exon III and D, exon V), PMN leukocytes (Fig. 4 E, exon III, and F, exon V), erythrocytes, and lymphocytes (data not shown). Hep G-2 cells were also used as positive controls, and the results were positive for both exons III and V (Fig. 4, G and H). Northern hybridization was used to confirm the presence in platelet progenitors of factor XI mRNA and to determine the length of mRNA in Meg-01 cells and in liver cells by using a full-length “oligolabeled” (18Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar) factor XI cDNA as a probe. The results (Fig. 5) show the presence of an mRNA transcript of ~1.9 kb in Meg-01 cells (Fig.5, lane 1) and a factor XI mRNA of ~2.1 kb in liver cells (Fig. 5, lane 2). When a mixture of Meg-01 and liver poly+A mRNA was loaded on the same lane of the gel, two separate bands (~1.9 and ~2.1 kb) could be visualized using the same factor XI cDNA probe as above (data not shown). These results are consistent with the results from RT-PCR experiments and in situ amplification and hybridization: the length of mRNA for factor XI in human platelets is shorter by ~200 bases (i.e. the approximate size of exon V) than the length of mRNA for factor XI in the human liver cells. A CHRF-288–11 cDNA library (a generous gift from Dr. Jerry Ware) was obtained from a human megakaryoblastic cell line (19Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce maturation and differentiation into the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage. The fact that these cells express platelet peroxidase, platelet factor 4, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (19Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provides evidence that the CHRF-288–11 cell line is a megakaryocytic cell line. The CHRF-288–11 cDNA library has been reported to contain ~1 × 106 recombinant phage, with an average insert size of ~0.8 to ~4.0 kb (17Zieger B. Hashimoto Y. Ware J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The titer of this library was 1 × 106 plaque-forming units/μl before screening. During primary screening of the CHRF-288–11 cDNA library, 16 positive clones were initially identified. Twelve of these 16 clones remained positive after secondary and tertiary screening. One (λXI3-2-3-1-1) (Fig. 6) contained a cDNA insert of 361 base pairs (nucleotides 1727–2087), and the other one (λXI12-1-1-1) (Fig. 6) contained a cDNA insert of 1069 base pairs (nucleotides 1019–2087). However, these two sequences represent only a partial sequence for factor XI. To avoid selecting the same clones on subsequent screening, a probe was constructed representing the 5′ 43% of total factor XI cDNA (nucleotides 1–908). Eight positive clones were identified on the primary screening; four of those eight clones remained positive after secondary and tertiary screening. The DNA inserts of each of those four clones were sequenced. One clone (λXI10) (Fig. 6) contained an insert of 1567 base pairs, with a nucleotide sequence identical to that for factor XI cDNA encompassing nucleotides 359–2087, which excludes exon V (nucleotides 367–528).

EGF receptor-expressing NIH3T3 cells (HER1 cells) were infected with a retrovirus containing coding sequences for the human CD2 antigen and for secreted alkaline phosphatase in the U3 region. By selecting for and against CD2 expression, we obtained clones in which the gene trap had integrated into genes selectively repressed by EGF. Two of these clones encoded for the secreted extracellular matrix proteins TIMP3 and COL1A2. We show here that both genes are downstream targets of RAS and are specifically repressed by EGF-induced transformation. Moreover, this strategy tags tumor suppressor genes in their normal chromosomal location, thereby improving target-specific screens for antineoplastic drugs.

Gene fusions between promoterless and/or enhancerless genes encoding easily assayable gene products with the controlling elements of cellular genes have provided valuable tools for studying gene function and regulation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Vectors developed for use in mammalian cells, referred to as “gene traps,” insert a reporter gene into mostly random chromosomal sites, including transcriptionally active regions. By selecting for gene expression, recombinants are obtained in which the reporter gene is fused to the regulatory elements of endogenous genes. Transcripts generated by these fusions faithfully reflect the activity of the tagged cellular gene and thus provide an effective means to study the expression of genes in their normal chromosomal location. Moreover, gene traps are highly mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo and provide molecular tags to clone any gene whose function is linked to an observable phenotype (1von Melchner H. DeGregori J.V.

To extend these observations, we sought to determine whether gene trapping would enable the recovery of genes with growth inhibitory and/or tumor suppressing functions. The basic assumption was that fusion transcripts induced between the selectable marker gene of a gene trap and the cellular sequences of a putative tumor suppressor gene would be repressed by an oncogenic signal. Such events can then be selected for by using a marker gene which allows selection for and against expression. Moreover, reporter genes expressed from the promoters of putative tumor suppressor genes should provide natural molecular targets for drug screening assays, thereby improving discovery of new anti-neoplastic drugs. To test the suitability of this approach, a conditional transformation system was chosen that is based on a reversible activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; COL1A2, collagen type I α2; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; LTR, long terminal repeat; kb, kiolobase pair(s); SRBC, sheep red blood cells; Atc, anhydrotetracycline.1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; COL1A2, collagen type I α2; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; LTR, long terminal repeat; kb, kiolobase pair(s); SRBC, sheep red blood cells; Atc, anhydrotetracycline./HER1) signal transduction pathway. EGFR belongs to the HER family of tyrosine kinase receptors that have been implicated in the development and progression of several types of human cancer (14Bacus, S. S., Zelnick, C. R., Plowman, G., and Yarden, Y. (1994) Am. J. Clin. Pathol.102,Suppl. 1, 13–24Google Scholar, 15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells, EGFR transforms in a ligand-dependent manner and thus functions as an oncogene. A gene trap retrovirus vector carrying coding sequences for the human CD2 cell surface receptor and for secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) in its U3 region was used to infect a subclone (HER1KA1) of an EGFR-expressing NIH3T3 cell line (16Di Fiore P.P.

Selection for and against CD2 expression yielded clones in which the cell-provirus fusion transcripts were repressed by EGF-mediated transformation. Analysis of upstream proviral flanking sequences revealed that in two instances the gene trap integration had disrupted known genes. These genes code for the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (Timp3) (18Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Kim H. Sithanandam K. Li H. Watts R. Colburn N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19312-19319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and for procollagen type α2 (Col1A2) (19Phillips C.L. Lever N.W. Pinnell S.R. Quarles L.D. Wenstrup R.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 980-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We show here that Timp3 and Col1A2 are downstream targets of c-RAS within the EGF/EGFR signal transduction pathway. Both genes inhibit oncogenic transformation and are specifically repressed in EGF-transformed cells. The pGgU3CD2SEAPen(−) plasmid was derived from pGgU3HisTkNeoen(−) (2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the Hiscoding sequences in the U3 region of the 3′-LTR with CD2-IRES-SEAP.CD2 sequences were obtained from πPH3CD2 (20Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar).IRES-SEAP sequences were recovered from pSBC2-SEAP (21Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). pGgU3CD2SEAPen(−) was transfected into GP + E86 producer cells as described previously (2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A clonal cell line producing 1 × 105 NeoR colony-forming units/ml was isolated and used to infect HER1KA1 cells at a multiplicity of infection = 3. Timp3 sequences obtained from BSTIMP3TM (NMI, San Diego, CA) were ligated as EcoRI fragments into the corresponding sites of the pBabepuro polylinker. pBabeTIMP3 was transfected into BOSC23 cells and virus containing supernatants were used to infect HER1KA1 and HER1KA1/6.1 cells as described previously (22Russ A.P. Friedel C. Grez M. von Melchner H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4927-4932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human Ha-RASLeu-61 coding sequences were recovered from pZIPNeoSVH-ras-leu61 (23Binétruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and cloned into theEcoRI/HindIII sites of the expression vector pTBC1 downstream of a tet07/CMV promoter (24Gossen M. Bujard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) to obtain pTBC-Ha-RASLeu-61SEAP. NIH3T3-HER1 cells (17Riedel H. Massoglia S. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were grown in agar cultures containing 25 ng/ml EGF (Sigma), and subclones were isolated after 14 days of incubation. Transformation efficiency of each subclone was assessed by estimating anchorage-independent growth in agar cultures. One clone (HER1KA1) with a stable transformation efficiency of 40% colony-forming units was chosen for further analysis. For agar cultures, 105 cells suspended in 5 ml of 0.25% (w/v) agar/DMEM were plated into 100-mm bacterial dishes on top of a gelified 0.5% (w/v) agar/DMEM bottom layer. Both layers contained 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum. Developing colonies were counted after 14 days incubation. Inducible Ha-RAS expressing cell lines were obtained by co-transfecting pTBC-Ha-RASLeu-61SEAP, pUHD15.1 and pTBC1-Hygro into NIH3T3 cells and selecting in 125 μg/ml hygromycin as described previously (25Baasner S. von Melchner H. Klenner T. Hilgard P. Beckers T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 901-911PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated clones were tested for anhydrotetracycline (Acros Chimica, Nidderau, Germany)-regulated p21-Ha-RAS expression by Western blotting, using the polyclonal anti-Ha-RAS antibody C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and by reversible tumorigenicityin vitro and in vivo. 2T. Beckers, E. Thoenes, and P. Hilgard, manuscript in preparation. The cell line N59.4/15, with tightly regulated Ha-ras expression, was selected for further experiments. HER1-v-src cells were obtained by electroporating the expression plasmid pMSsrc (26Schuermann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4945-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) into 3T3-HER1 cells and selecting for transformation using standard focus forming assays (25Baasner S. von Melchner H. Klenner T. Hilgard P. Beckers T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 901-911PubMed Google Scholar). For panning, 100-mm bacterial plates were first treated with 10 ml of a 20 μg/ml solution of anti-human IgG antibody (Cappel/Organon-Teknika, Durham, NC). After incubating for 1.5 h, the plates were washed with 0.15m NaCl and overlaid with 10 ml of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS. After incubating overnight at 4 °C, the bovine serum albumin was removed, and plates were treated with 3 ml of a LFA3-IgG1 containing supernatant from COS 6 cells transfected with pCDM8IgG1-LFA3 as described (27Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were placed onto the antibody-treated plates and allowed to bind for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound cells were removed by gently washing the plates with PBS. Bound cells were recovered in DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) after trypsinizing for 5 min at 37 °C. Typically, over 95% of the recovered cells expressed CD2 as estimated by SRBC rosetting and fluorescent antibody staining. For complement lysis, Leu5b antibody (Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) was first allowed to bind the CD2 receptor by incubating 1–2 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of PBS with 10 μl of Leu5b antibody for 30 min on ice. Cells were lysed by adding 1 ml of a 50% solution of rabbit complement (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) as suggested by the manufacturer. Following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the complement was removed by several washings, and surviving cells were recovered in DMEM. In typical experiments, more than 90% of the cells were killed by antibody plus complement treatment. SRBC rosetting was performed by incubating aminoethylthioronium bromide-treated sheep red blood cells (SRBC) with CD2 expressing cells for 30 min at room temperature as described (28Coligan, J. E., Kruisbeek, A. M., Margulies, D. H., Skevach, E. M., and Strober, W. (eds) (1991) Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). CD2 receptor density was estimated as described by Lischke et al. (29Lischke A. Pagany M. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104cells were treated in 100 μl of PBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 10 μl of Leu5b antibody. Following incubation for 30 min on ice, cells were centrifuged at 400 × g and recovered in 100 μl of PBS containing 100 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). After 30 min on ice, cells were washed 3 × in PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Fifty microliters of a solution containing the horseradish peroxidase-specific substrate were added to the cells, and light emission was measured for 1 s in a Micro-Lumat LB96 P luminometer (Berthold). SEAP activity was estimated in supernatants derived from 1 × 104 cells incubated in 0.5 ml of DMEM for 48 h at 37 °C. SEAP levels were quantified using the PhosphaLight kit (Tropix, Bedfort, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed in milliunits/ml calculated from a standard of human placental alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem) as described (25Baasner S. von Melchner H. Klenner T. Hilgard P. Beckers T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 901-911PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using the 5′-RACE kit from Life Technologies, Inc., following the manufacturer's instructions. The specific CD2 reverse primers were as follows: 5′-CAAGTTGATGTCCTGACCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGTTTCCAAGGCATTCGTAATCTC-3′ (nested). Amplification reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, and 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The RACE products were cloned into pCR2.1 vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced as described previously (8DeGregori J. Russ A. von Melchner H. Rayburn H. Priyaranjan P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A U3CD2SEAP gene trap vector was derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based pGgtkNeoU3His(en−) (2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the His gene with coding sequences for the human cell surface receptor (CD2) and for the secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) (20Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 21Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To enable translation of both genes from dicistronic transcripts, theSEAP gene was separated from CD2 by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (21Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This gene trap allows positive and negative selection as well as a quantitative monitoring of transcriptional activity. To enable selection for high virus titer producer cells, the viral construct also contained an independent selectable marker gene (neo) controlled by an herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter between the LTRs (Fig.1 A) (2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was transfected into GP + E86 helper cells, and supernatants from neomycin-resistant lines producing recombinant virus were used to infect HER1KA1 cells. As has been shown in previous studies, virus replication and long terminal repeat (LTR)-mediated duplication places the sequences inserted into U3 just 30 nucleotides downstream from the flanking cellular DNA. This enables their expression from integrations into transcribed genes (Fig.1 A) (2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30von Melchner H. Reddy S. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3733-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HER1KA1 cells infected with U3CD2SEAP retrovirus were selected for CD2 expression by “panning” using a fusion protein that contained the natural ligand of CD2 (LFA3) and human IgG1 (LFA3-IgG1) (20Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 31Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The recovered cells, comprising at least 2 × 104 transcribed integrations, were exposed to transforming concentrations of EGF (25 ng/ml) (16Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Hazan R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) for 72 h and then treated with monoclonal anti-CD2-antibody and complement. This was expected to eliminate integrations into constitutively expressed genes and thus enrich for integrations into genes repressed by transformation. The surviving cells were subdivided into 48 pools which were assayed for EGF-regulated integrations by estimating at least two of the following parameters: (i) binding of aminoethylisothioronium bromide-treated SRBC to the CD2 receptor (SRBC rosetting) (28Coligan, J. E., Kruisbeek, A. M., Margulies, D. H., Skevach, E. M., and Strober, W. (eds) (1991) Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar); (ii) CD2-receptor density using a recently described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cell-surface receptors (29Lischke A. Pagany M. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); and (iii) measuring SEAP levels in culture supernatants using a chemoluminometric assay (25Baasner S. von Melchner H. Klenner T. Hilgard P. Beckers T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 901-911PubMed Google Scholar). Two pools were selected and plated into semi-solid cultures to isolate clones. Twelve clones of each pool were expanded and analyzed by Southern blotting. The clones HER1KA1/6.1, HER1KA1/11, and HER1KA1/3 were unique and had 5, 1, and 1 proviral integrations, respectively (data not shown). Since HER1KA1/6.1 and HER1KA1/11 were particularly sensitive to EGF, they were chosen for further analysis (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). To exclude the possibility that more than one provirus had disrupted an expressed gene in the HER1KA1/6.1 clone, mRNA recovered from both EGF-treated and untreated cells was analyzed by Northern blotting. When hybridized to an IRES-specific probe, two major transcripts were detected in absence of EGF, e.g. a 4.3-kb cell-provirus fusion transcript initiating in a nearby cellular promoter and terminating in the polyadenylation site of the 5′-proviral LTR, and a 5.5-kb transcript initiating at the internal thymidine kinase promoter and terminating in the polyadenylation site of the 3′-LTR (Fig.1 A). Although this suggests that CD2 might be translated from both transcripts, previous studies have clearly shown that only the reporter genes of the 5′-LTR are efficiently translated from cell-provirus fusion transcripts (1von Melchner H. DeGregori J.V. Rayburn H. Reddy S. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hicks G.G. Shi E. Li X.M. Li C.H. Pawlak M. Ruley H.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Reddy S. DeGregori J.V. von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the proviral transcripts that continued to be expressed in EGF-treated cells, fusion transcripts disappeared almost completely, suggesting that they were repressed by EGF (Fig. 1 C). The results indicate that in HER1KA1/6.1 cells only one out of five proviral integrations is expressed from a nearby cellular promoter. To ascertain that the gene traps had disrupted expressed cellular genes in HER1KA1/6.1 and HER1KA1/11 cells, the cellular components of the respective cell-provirus fusion transcripts (Fig.1 C) were amplified by 5′-RACE by using CD2-specific primers (8DeGregori J. Russ A. von Melchner H. Rayburn H. Priyaranjan P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When the amplification product from HER1KA1/6.1 was hybridized to RNA from wild type HER1KA1 cells, it detected a major cellular transcript of 4.5-kb which was readily repressed by EGF (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and2). Similarly, sequences amplified from HER1KA1/11 cells hybridized to a cellular transcript of 5.2 and 5.7 kb (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). Sequence analysis of the cloned HER1KA1/6.1 and HER1KA1/11 amplification products revealed a 100% homology to the first exon of the Timp3 gene (18Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Kim H. Sithanandam K. Li H. Watts R. Colburn N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19312-19319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to the first exon of the Col1A2 gene (Fig.3) (19Phillips C.L. Lever N.W. Pinnell S.R. Quarles L.D. Wenstrup R.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 980-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both RACE products exhibited a 103-nucleotide deletion that included the cell DNA-provirus junctions, the translation initiating AUG ofCD2, and the signal peptide encoding sequence ofCD2. This resulted in an in frame fusion of the cellular sequence to the remaining CD2 sequence, suggesting that the gene trap was activated by mRNA splicing. Indeed, as has been previously observed with other marker genes inserted into U3 regions, 3H. E. Ruley, personal communication. the CD2gene contains a 3′-splice consensus sequence exactly at the site of fusion (Fig. 3). Thus, in both cases the gene trap must have integrated into the first introns of the respective cellular genes (Fig. 3). Moreover, the fusion proteins were still capable of LFA3 and anti-CD2 antibody binding. This suggested that the CD2 moiety was directed to the membrane by the fused signal sequences of the secreted TIMP3 and COL1A2 proteins. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3, both RACE products contained the signal sequences of the respective proteins (Fig. 3,underlined) (34Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5590-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Sun J. Hegamyer G. Colburn N. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1139-1144PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether TIMP3 and COL1A2 repression was linked to EGF or instead was a consequence of cellular transformation, we analyzed their expression in presence of the EGF receptor kinase-specific antagonist PD153035 (36Fry D. Kraker A. McMichael A. Ambroso L. Nelson J. Leopold W. Connors R. Bridges A. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 3 and 4), PD153035 prevented Timp3 and Col1A2 transcripts from responding to EGF, indicating that EGFR signaling is required for repression. To address the possibility of nonspecific repression, we transformed the original EGFR overexpressing HER1 cells with the v-SRConcogene using the expression plasmid pMSsrc (26Schuermann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4945-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Highly transformed cells were isolated from a focus, exposed to EGF, and analyzed by Northern blotting. Fig. 4 Ashows that HER1v-src cells continued to express Timp3 andCol1A2. More importantly, both transcripts were readily repressed by EGF, indicating that v-src-induced transformation does not modify the response to EGF. We conclude that down-regulation of Timp3 and Col1A2 requires EGFR activation. Since downstream EGFR signaling involves at least two distinct pathways, one of which includes the protooncogene c-ras (37Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar,38Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether activated RAS could mimic the EGF-mediated suppression of Timp3 and Col1A2expression. To this end, the transforming human Ha-RAS Leu-61 oncogene (39Yuasa Y. Srivastava S.K. Dunn C.Y. Rhim J.S. Reddy E.P. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1983; 303: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) was transduced in NIH3T3 cells using an expression vector with a tetracycline-repressible promoter (24Gossen M. Bujard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). A cell line (N59.4/15) expressing a tightly controlled Ha-RASLeu-61 was used to analyze Timp3 andCol1A2 transcription. Withdrawal of anhydrotetracycline (Atc) resulted in oncogenic transformation associated with a 20-fold increase in p21Ha-RAS-Leu-61 (data not shown) and in a significant reduction of Timp3- and Col1A2mRNA (Fig. 4 B). A similar repression was observed in cell lines conditionally transformed with oncogenic c-raf1which is a downstream target of ras (data not shown). These results suggest that EGF engages c-ras to suppress Timp3and Col1A2 expression. While overexpression of COL1A2 has recently been shown to repress ras-induced transformation in NIH3T3 cells (40Travers H. French N.S. Norton J.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether TIMP3 has a similar effect in fibroblasts. Since TIMP3 has been implicated in both oncogenic transformation and tumor suppression in systems ranging from chicken embryo fibroblasts to human colon carcinoma cells (18Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Kim H. Sithanandam K. Li H. Watts R. Colburn N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19312-19319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Anand-Apte B. Bao L. Smith R. Iwata K. Olsen B.R.

A. 1992; 89: 10676-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it was important to determine whether TIMP3 would revert a transformed phenotype induced by EGFR signaling. To this end, Timp3coding sequences were cloned into the retrovirus expression vector pBabepuro (44Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) to obtain pBabeTIMP3 (Fig.5 A). pBabeTIMP3 was packaged into virus particles by transient transfection into BOSC23 cells (12Russ A.P. Friedel C. Ballas K. Kalina U. Zahn D. Strebhardt K. von Melchner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15279-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and supernatants thereof were used to infect HER1KA1, HER1KA1/6.1, and tetracycline-inducible Ha-RAS expressing N59.4/15 cells (Fig.5 A). Mixed populations of infected cells were recovered following selection in puromycin and assayed for focus formation and anchorage-independent growth in the presence or absence of EGF or tetracyclin. A 2–3-fold reduction of colony growth was observed in TIMP3 expressing HER1KA1 and N59.4/15 cells in which endogenousTimp3 expression was repressed by EGF and activatedras, respectively. However, this effect was reduced in HER1KA1/6.1 cells both in the presence or absence of EGF (TableI, Fig. 5 B). Since these cells exhibited a transformed phenotype even in absence of EGF (Table I, Fig.5 B), it is likely that mutations acquired by other genes antagonize the tumor suppressor function of TIMP3. Such mutations could have been induced by one or more of the multiple proviruses that had integrated in this clone. However, this seems quite unlikely because we and others (2von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Reddy S. DeGregori J.V. von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Chang W. Hubbard C. Friedel C. Ruley H.

In line with this, HER1KA1/6.1 cells expressed only one cell-provirus fusion transcript (Fig. 1 C). Nevertheless, the ability of TIMP3 to suppress focus formation and anchorage-independent growth of all cell lines tested strongly suggests that TIMP3 has a growth inhibitory function in this system.Table IRepression of focus formation and colony growth in soft agar by TIMP3Cells−TIMP3+TIMP3Focus formationGrowth in soft agarEfficiency of colony formation in soft agarFocus formationGrowth in soft agarEfficiency of colony formation in soft agar%%HER1KA1 −EGF15 ± 7003 ± 100 +EGF205 ± 740,000 ± 2,00040100 ± 2221,000 ± 2,00021HER1KA1/6.1 −EGF64 ± 14940 ± 850.9438 ± 17700 ± 280.70 +EGF393 ± 3054,000 ± 2,00054325 ± 6544,000 ± 2,00044N59 4/15 −Atc000000 −Atc900 ± 8259,000 ± 7,00059350 ± 14721,000 ± 7,00021105 cells were analyzed for focus formation and growth in soft agar as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EGF concentrations were 25 ng/ml.

TIMP3 expressing cells were obtained by infecting with pBabeTIMP3 and selecting in puromycin. Results are means ± S.D. of 2–4 independent experiments. In the present study, a gene trap strategy has been used to identify genes that are repressed by an oncogenic signal. NIH3T3 cells undergoing EGF-mediated transformation were infected with a retrovirus carrying coding sequences for human CD2 and SEAPin the U3 region. By selecting for and against CD2 expression, two cell clones were isolated in which the gene traps had disrupted known genes with tumor suppressor function. These genes encoded the secreted proteins TIMP3 and COL1A2, which are both components of the extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix is increasingly implicated in the pathology of degenerative and/or neoplastic diseases. For example, TIMP proteins, which normally inactivate matrix metalloproteinases involved in degrading the structural components of the extracellular matrix (e.g. collagens, fibronectins, and gelatins), were found to prevent cell migration and metastasis (Refs.46Brown P. Giavazzi R. Ann. Oncol. 1995; 6: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and 47Kohn E.C. Liotta L.A.

Moreover, depending on the experimental model, TIMP proteins can either promote or inhibit oncogenic transformation, suggesting that their function is cell type-specific (18Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Kim H.

Müller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that can cause degenerative eye disease (51Weber B.H.F. Vogt G. Pruett R.C. Sto¨hr H. Felbor U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Similarly, collagens participate in a variety of cellular processes such as differentiation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis (52Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Mutations in collagen genes can lead to a variety of degenerative disorders ranging from scorbut and osteogenesis imperfecta and in mice they cause recessive lethal phenotypes (reviewed in Ref. 53Olsen B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of COL1A2 suppresses tumorigenesis induced by RAS-transformed NIH3T3 cells (40Travers H. French N.S. Norton J.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the gene trap strategy described here is well suited for tagging genes with tumor suppressor function, and it substantiates previous observations showing that putative tumor suppressor genes are often repressed in transformed cells (42Bian J.

A. 1992; 89: 4879-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the gene trap employed here seems to require a signal sequence for its activation, thereby enriching for integrations into genes encoding membrane and/or secreted proteins. A similar gene trap has been successfully used to identify membrane and secreted proteins important for mouse development (57Skarnes W. Moss J. Hurtley S. Beddington R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition to antagonizing transformation in NIH3T3 cells, the present experiments have shown that Timp3 and Col1A2 are specific targets of the EGF/EGFR signal transduction pathway. Since EGF-mediated repression of both genes could be duplicated by oncogenicras but not by v-src, it is likely that TIMP3 and COL1A2 are downstream targets of c-ras. Moreover, the persistence of Timp3 and Col1A2 expression in cells transformed by v-src seems to suggest that transformation by v-src does not require RAS (58Aftab D.T. Kwan J. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In summary, Timp3 and Col1A2 are specifically repressed by EGFR signaling, thereby facilitating oncogenic transformation. Therefore, it is likely that TIMP3 and COL1A2 interfere with the progression of human carcinomas expressing aberrant forms of one or more EGFR family receptor tyrosine kinases (14Bacus, S. S., Zelnick, C. R., Plowman, G., and Yarden, Y. (1994) Am. J. Clin. Pathol.102,Suppl. 1, 13–24Google Scholar, 15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar). A collection of cell lines with gene trap integrations in genes repressed by transformation are potentially highly useful as targets in automated screening assays for antineoplastic drugs. In particular, the easily quantifiable CD2 and SEAP marker proteins qualify such lines as faithful indicators of gene expression. Moreover, since the reporter genes are expressed from the normal chromosomal location of the trapped genes, the indicator lines avoid the problems encountered with conventional targets transcribed from random chromosomal sites. Finally, since the assays are based on gene activation, only target inducing drugs such as the EGFR antagonist PD153035 described in this study will score positively in a screen. This effectively eliminates all compounds with nonspecific toxic effects. We thank Drs. A. Ullrich for providing the HER1 cell line and H. Bujard for the tetracycline-inducible system."

The H,K-ATPase and the Na,K-ATPase consist of two tightly associated but noncovalently linked subunits, a large α or catalytic subunit, which contains the phosphorylation and ATP-binding domains, and a smaller heavily glycosylated β subunit. The coordinate synthesis of both subunits is obligatory for functional expression and plasma membrane targeting of the H,K-ATPase as well as the Na,K-ATPase (24Geering K.

Expression of the gastric H,K-ATPase in mammalian cell lines appears to require simultaneous expression of both subunits. Inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase is used in the medical treatment of congestive heart disease, whereas inhibition of the gastric H,K-ATPase is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This latter inhibition is achieved by substituted pyridyl methylsulfinyl benzimidazoles like omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole. These are weak bases with a pK a of about 4.0–5.0 that accumulate in the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell, which has a pH of about 1.0. In this acidic environment the compounds convert to cationic, tetracyclic, planar sulfenamides. These are strong electrophiles that form stable disulfides with cysteine groups on proteins. The sulfenamides formed in the secretory canaliculus or on the interior face of isolated acid transporting vesicles are therefore targeted to cysteines accessible from the extracytoplasmic surface of the H,K-ATPase α subunit (31Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). There are two cysteines (Cys813 and Cys822) in the region encompassing M5 and M6 and one cysteine (Cys892) in the loop region between TM7 and TM8 that have been implicated in omeprazole inhibition of the ATPase. In the gastric H,K-ATPase of the two cysteines present in the TM5/loop/TM6 region, one is surrounded by relatively hydrophobic amino acids (Cys813), and one is in the middle of a hydrophilic pocket, Glu-Leu-Cys-Thr-Asp. Recent work has shown that one of the two cysteines in M5/6 is probably the cysteine essential for inhibition. Labeling of the gastric H,K-ATPase with radioactive omeprazole under acid transport conditions, digestion with trypsin, and SDS solubilization with labeling of unreacted SH groups with fluorescein 5-maleimide was followed by Tricine gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Then isolation of the fragment containing M5/6, thermolysin digestion, and SDS Tricine gradient gel electrophoresis was used in order to define which cysteine of the two present in M5/6 was labeled. These data were interpreted as showing that Cys813 was the stable covalent binding site for omeprazole (31Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Similar data were obtained using reaction withN-ethylmaleimide after omeprazole binding, reduction, and FMI labeling. 2J. M. Shin, personal communication. Because protonated omeprazole and its reactive sulfenamide are relatively bulky cations, it is likely that the labeled cysteine is exposed to the luminal surface of the ATPase. Mutational analysis of hydrophilic amino acids in the Na,K- and Ca-ATPases has provided the basis for a topographic model of the M5/6 region of these enzymes. Alignment of the H,K-ATPase with these models of the Na,K- and Ca-ATPases would make Cys813 the more exposed of the two in the loop connecting M5 and M6, consistent with the labeling data. In the absence of N-ethylmaleimide added during digestion and solubilization, the incorporated label is relatively unstable. It is possible that either cysteine could react and that the disulfide bond on Cys813 survives more effectively than the disulfide bond on Cys822 during the isolation procedure. Disulfide exchange during the different steps in the isolation procedure or unrecognized variability in cleavage of the region between the two cysteines by thermolysin are other possibilities raising questions as to the role or location of Cys813. In the case of pantoprazole, it appears that both cysteines are able to react (32Shin J.M. Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1148: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is also possible that both cysteines are accessible and that a transmembrane hairpin model for M5 and M6 is an oversimplification. An alternative strategy for identification of the cysteine important for omeprazole inhibition is to remove the cysteines in extracytoplasmic region of the C-terminal domain by site-directed mutagenesis and determine which mutation prevents omeprazole inhibition of 86Rb transport in cells transfected with the H,K-ATPase while retaining cation stimulated ATPase activity and inhibition of ATPase and cation transport by the K competitive reagent, SCH 28080. The construction of a gastric H,K-ATPase composed of a fusion protein of the α and β subunit, done successfully for the Na,K-ATPase (33Emerick M.C. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23455-23459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was accomplished in order to bypass the complexities of co-translational assembly and post-translational processing of a two-subunit heterodimer. These α-β fusion vectors were made with different mutations in Cys813, Cys822, and Cys892. These fusion vectors were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. NH4+-stimulated, SCH 28080-inhibited ATPase activity and Western blot analysis as well as confocal microscopy were used to confirm enzyme activity and plasma membrane expression. Inhibition of 86Rb uptake by acid-activated omeprazole as compared with inhibition of uptake by SCH 28080 was used to determine which cysteine was essential for inhibition by the compounds after acidification of the drugs. None of the cysteines were essential for enzyme activity or cation transport, but the cysteine at position 822 must be present for omeprazole inhibition of transport by the gastric H,K-ATPase. If this cysteine is the more exposed of the two and is in the loop connecting M5 and M6, an unconventional model for this region of the enzyme ensues. cDNAs coding for the rabbit H,K-ATPase α and β subunit (34Bamberg K.

A modified DNA coding for the full-length β subunit with Glu instead of Met at amino acid position 1 was generated by using polymerase chain reaction and a mutagenic sense primer. This resulted in the introduction of XhoI restriction site at the beginning of the β sequence. Using theXhoI/XbaI restriction sites, the polymerase chain reaction product was then ligated into the pcDNA3.1 vector containing the cDNA for the α subunit. A synthetic oligonucleotide coding for the last 17 amino acids of the α subunit was extended by DNA encoding an additional 18 amino acids as had been done for the Na,K-ATPase (33Emerick M.C. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23455-23459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligation into theHindIII/XhoI restriction site resulted in a cDNA coding for a polypeptide with α and β subunits linked by a hydrophilic sequence of 18 amino acids (Fig.1). The coding sequence of the H,K α-β fusion protein was cloned into aCLONTECH pALTER-EX1 vector. Amino acid substitutions for these cysteines were selected based on the amino acids in the Na,K-ATPase. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer (CLONTECH, pALTER Mutagenesis System). The mutagenic primer used for Cys813 → Thr was GGGCACCATCACCATCCTCTTCAT, that for Cys822 → Gly was TCATAGAACTCGGCACCGACATT, and that for Cys892 → Leu was CTGGTTCCCGCTGCTGTTAGTGG. Mutants were prepared containing single mutations in each of the three cysteines. Four additional mutants were prepared containing the mutations Cys813 → Thr + Cys822 → Gly, Cys813 → Thr + Cys892 → Leu, Cys822 → Gly + Cys892 → Leu, and Cys813 → Thr + Cys822 → Gly + Cys892 → Leu. The mutant cDNAs were cloned back into pcDNA3.1. Each final construct was sequenced before use for transfection using dideoxy sequencing. HEK 293 (ATCC CRL 1573) cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 95% O2/5% CO2 in Dulbecco's essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Single cells were plated on 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes. Cells were grown until the monolayer covered ~70% of the surface of the dish. Transfection was done by the calcium phosphate method (36Graham F.L. Eb A.J. v. d. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of plasmid for each culture dish. For transient transfections, maximal expression of recombinant protein was achieved after 48–72 h. Stable cell lines were selected by addition of 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) 60 h after transfection. This concentration was maintained until single colonies appeared. Colonies were isolated and grown in 6-well Falcon plates containing culture medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml Zeocin. Each clone was screened by Western blot analysis as described below. Cells from transient transfections or stable cell lines, grown to confluence, were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm PIPES/2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Homogenization was performed using a N2 cavitation bomb. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was layered onto 40% (w/v) sucrose and spun in a Beckman SW41 swinging bucket rotor at 25,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The fraction at the interface was collected and resuspended in 15 ml of the buffer A. Membranes were collected by centrifugation in a Beckman 75Ti rotor (35,000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min). Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A and analyzed for total protein by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217421) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stored at −80 °C. Deglycosylation of membranes was performed by incubation of 20 μg of membranes with endoglycosidase H and F for 12 h in the presence of 0.1% SDS according to the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Gel sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue (w/v), 20% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 6.8) was mixed with 20 μg of membranes and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The sample was loaded on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As a standard for native α and β subunits, 200 ng of purified gastric vesicles (G1 fraction; Ref. 40Rabon E.C. Im W.B. Sachs G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were used. High molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were loaded on each gel. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioPlot-NC, Costar, Cambridge, UK). Membranes were washed twice with TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween (v/v)) and incubated in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). After 30 min, the membranes were incubated in the primary antibody solution (monoclonal antibody 12.18 against amino acids 666–689 of the α subunit of the H,K-ATPase diluted 1:4000 in TBS or monoclonal antibody 2B6 against amino acids 236–281 of the β subunit of the H,K-ATPase diluted 1:4000 in TBS) (38Mercier F. Bayle D. Besancon M. Joys T. Shin J.M. Lewin M.J. Prinz C. Reuben M.A. Soumarmon A. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Sadis G. Biochim. Biophys.

After 1 h, membranes were washed twice with TBS and incubated with the secondary antibody solution (anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, Promega, Madison, WI, diluted 1:4000 in TBS). After 1 h, membranes were washed twice and incubated for 15 min in TBS. After a final wash, the membranes were incubated for 15 min in AP buffer (100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5) containing 0.3% nitro blue tetrazolium solution (v/v) and 0.15% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-1-phosphate solution (v/v) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). An estimate of the specific activity of the expressed fusion protein can be achieved by optical quantitation of Western blots of expressed protein as compared with a hog gastric H,K-ATPase standard. Various amounts (100 ng to 1 μg) of purified hog gastric H,K-ATPase (40Rabon E.C. Im W.B. Sachs G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were loaded side by side with 20 μg of membranes containing the expressed α-β fusion protein onto a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for quantitative Western blot analysis. Protein transfer on to nitrocellulose membranes and Western analysis was carried out as described above. All blots were scanned using the AMBIS optical imaging system (AMBIS Inc., San Diego, CA), and the optical density of the bands was quantified. The amount of the α-β fusion protein was calculated by comparison with the densities of the H,K-ATPase standards on the same blot. ATPase assays were performed by the method of Yoda and Hokin (41Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Membranes (20 μg of protein) were added to a reaction mixture containing (final concentrations) 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2 with or without 60 mm NH4Cl. NH4+ is an effective surrogate for K+ in the gastric H,K-ATPase and does not require an ionophore for access to the extracytoplasmic face of vesicular enzyme (6Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Inhibitors including 1 mm EGTA (Ca-ATPases), 1 mm ouabain (Na,K-ATPase), 1 μm oligomycin (mitochondrial ATPase), 10 nm bafilomycin (V-type ATPases), and 100 nm thapsigargin (endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase) were added to suppress the activities of possible contaminating ATPases. Specific H,K-ATPase activity was measured for basal enzyme and the NH4+-stimulated enzyme by addition of 10 μm SCH 28080, a selective competitive inhibitor of the gastric H,K-ATPase (42Wallmark B. Briving C. Fryklund J. Munson K. Jackson R. Mendlein J. Rabon E. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2077-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were started by adding 2 mm ATP. The reactions were terminated after 10 min at 37 °C by adding an equal volume of stop solution containing 4.5% ammonium molybdate (w/v) and 14% perchloric acid. Reaction mixtures were extracted with butyl acetate, and Pi released was quantified by A 320 nm. The specific activity was expressed in μmol Pi/mg/h. The results of quantitative Western blot analysis were used to calculate the approximate specific activity of the expressed α-β fusion protein. Ion transport in stably transfected HEK 293 cells (or untransfected cells) was measured by uptake of 86Rb+ as a surrogate for K+. A similar method has been used by Blostein et al. (43Blostein R. Zhang R. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown until confluence in 6-well Falcon plates, the medium was removed, and the wells were washed once with 4 ml of ice-cold wash solution containing 144 mm NaCl and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Each well was incubated in the presence of 1 mm ouabain (to inhibit Na,K-ATPase) and 10 μm furosemide (to inhibit NaKCl2co-transport) for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of a solution containing 144 mm NaCl, 5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 50 μm phenolphthalein, 1 mm Rb+, and 3 × 106 cpm 86Rb+. After 10 min the supernatant was removed, and each well was washed three times with 4 ml of ice-cold wash solution. Rubidium transport was carried out in the absence and in the presence of 100 μm SCH 28080. Omeprazole is 5-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole and requires an acidic pH for rapid conversion to the active sulfenamide. Acid activation was achieved by dissolving 1 mm omeprazole in 1 n HCl. The sulfenamide is relatively stable at pH 1.0. 50 μl was added to the appropriate wells to give a final concentration of 10 μm and after 5 s a pH of 7.4 was restored by addition of 50 μl of 1 mTris. Rb+ uptake experiments were then carried out as described above. At the end of the experiments, cells were dissolved by incubation for 1 h with 2 ml of 0.5 n NaOH. Solutions (1 ml) were counted using Cerenkov radiation. Total protein/well was measured using the Bradford assay as described above. Rb+ uptake by the cells was expressed as nmol 86Rb+/min/mg total protein. Inhibitor-sensitive flux was calculated by subtracting Rb+ uptake with inhibitor for the H,K-ATPase from Rb+ uptake without inhibitor. Cells showing expression of the α-β fusion protein as shown by Western blot analysis were chosen for immunofluorescence studies. Cells were transferred to chamber slides (LabTek, Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) and grown to confluence in culture medium containing 0.1 mg/ml Zeocin. Cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C. Slides were washed three times in phosphate buffer (0.1m, pH 7.4) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (v/v) dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody solution, which was either monoclonal antibody 12.18 or monoclonal antibody 2B6, diluted 1:250 in phosphate buffer. The solution was removed, and the slides were washed for 20 min in phosphate buffer. The secondary antibody solution (anti-mouse IgG, raised in goat against heavy and light chains, conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, 1:50 diluted in phosphate buffer) was added, and the slides were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After a final wash with phosphate buffer for 20 min, coverslips were mounted using 90% glycerol (v/v) in phosphate buffer as mounting medium. Immunofluorescent images were analyzed using a Leitz/Leica Fluovert FU inverted microscope fitted with the Leica CLSM and a confocal fluorescence scanning adapter. The objective used was a PL Fluotar 100x/1.32. Photomultiplier amplification was kept constant in each experiment. Images we"

Flow cytometric analysis and enzymatic assays were used to quantify the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of NDPK. Bone marrow CD34+ progenitors contained the highest intracellular levels of both nm23-H1 and nm23-H2. Lower levels were measured in more mature bone marrow cells, whereas peripheral blood leukocytes had the lowest expression of nm23. These data suggest a function of NDPK in early hematopoiesis and a down-regulation of NDPK upon differentiation. In addition, an up-regulation of nm23 expression was observed in lymphocytes after induction of proliferation with phytohemagglutinin. Multiparameter flow cytometry demonstrated that this up-regulation occurred during the G0/G1-transition. Flow cytometric analysis also revealed a weak surface expression of nm23 on a number of hematopoietic cell lines, which was not detected on normal hematopoietic cells. Our data also demonstrated the presence of NDPK in human plasma, probably due to a limited in vivo lysis of red blood cells.

Beside their function to maintain the cellular GTP level (5Otero A.D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), several other functions and properties have been assigned to the NDPK family. These include the identity of nm23-H2 to PuF, a transcription factor of the proto-oncogene c-myc (6Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), the ability of nm23-H1 to suppress the metastatic potential of several tumors and cell lines (1Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G.

(13Okabe-Kado J. Kasukabe T. Honma Y. Hayashi M. Henzel W.J. Huzomi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), who identified NDPK B as a differentiation inhibiting factor (I-factor) in the conditioned medium of the differentiation-resistant mouse M1 cell line and demonstrated that both nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 can inhibit the in vitro induced differentiation of several hematopoietic cell lines. This inhibition was independent of the phosphotransferase activity as demonstrated with nm23 mutants lacking the enzymatic activity (13Okabe-Kado J. Kasukabe T. Honma Y. Hayashi M. Henzel W.J.

In lymphoma and monocytic leukemia, overexpression of nm23-H1 was correlated with a higher tumor aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy, respectively (16Aryee D.N.T. Simonitsch I. Mosberger I.

Up-regulation of nm23-H1 and -H2 was observed in normal lymphocytes induced to proliferate with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (18Keim D. Hailat N. Melhem R. Zhu X.X. Lascu I. Veron M. Strahler J. J. Clin.

Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Studies on the localization of nm23 mRNA in mouse embryos by “in situ” hybridization with nm23-H1 probes showed an overall staining and an increased expression in differentiating tissue (20Lakso M. Steeg P.S. Westphal H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). NDPK phosphotransferase activity has also been observed in the cytosol and membrane fraction of neutrophils (21Guignard F. Markert M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These studies support the hypothesis that nm23 is ubiquitously expressed in cells. Using enzymatic assays, surface-bound NDPK has been observed on platelets (22Adler J.R. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3866-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several hematopoietic tumor cell lines stained positive for NDPK in flow cytometric analysis (23Urano T. Furukawa K. Shiku H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar). So far, the presence of NDPK in extracellular fluids has not been demonstrated. In this article we studied the nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 expression in cells of human hematopoietic origin and demonstrated that both isoforms are highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors. A decrease in expression levels was observed during myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. Surface expression of nm23 was not detected on normal hematopoietic cells and was only observed on tumor cell lines of hematopoietic origin. We also provide evidence for the presence of NDPK in human plasma. Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Tris were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

The hematopoietic cell lines K562, HL-60, U937, KG-1, Jurkat, Molt3, Molt4, SupT1, and HSB2 were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in IMDM containing 10% (v/v) FCS. Blood of healthy volunteers was collected in CTAD-tubes (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium), without using a tourniquet and placed on ice for at least 10 min in order to avoid platelet activation. Umbilical cord blood was collected from the placenta of healthy full-term infants. Bone marrow samples were aspirated by sternal puncture from hematologically normal patients undergoing cardiac surgery after informed consent. Umbilical cord blood and bone marrow samples were collected in tubes containing 2 ml of IMDM with 10% (v/v) FCS and 5 units/ml preservative-free heparin (Novo Industries, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The middle part of the plasma column was collected and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm microfilter (Millipore, Molsheim, France). White blood cells were isolated from normal blood or bone marrow by a 1/100 dilution of the sample in hemolysis buffer (155 mm NH4Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KHCO3, pH 7.3). After an incubation for 5–10 min at room temperature, cells were washed three times with PBS and labeled for flow cytometric analysis. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from normal blood by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and washed three times with IMDM. Purified lymphocytes were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 20% (v/v) FCS and 5 μg/ml PHA. Platelets were isolated from normal blood samples, collected in CTAD-tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 400 × gfor 15 min and the intermediate, platelet-containing fraction of the plasma collected. Platelets were washed three times with PBS containing 3.7 mm adenosine, 15 mm theophylline, and 0.198 mm dipyridamole and pelleted by a 10-min centrifugation at 700 × g (24Contant G. Gouault-Heilmann M. Martinoli J.L. Thromb. Res. 1983; 31: 365-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were isolated by repeated (3 times) centrifugation of normal blood samples at 400 ×g for 15 min and removal of the buffy coat and supernatant. Cell lysates were obtained by four repetitive cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication for 5 min in the presence of 0.02% (w/v) CHAPS. Based on an exploratory screening, plasma samples and cell lysates were diluted with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) casein to approximately equal NDPK phosphotransferase activities. The diluted samples were incubated at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm CDP, and 0.1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). At relevant time intervals, samples were taken and the reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA. Radiolabeled ATP and CTP were separated by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography in 750 mm KH2PO4 (pH 3.65). The spots were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The protein content was measured by the biuret method in a Vitros 750XRC analyzer (Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostics Inc., Rochester, NY). Free plasma hemoglobin was determined according to Crosby and Furth (25Crosby W.H. Furth F.W. Blood. 1956; 11: 380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μl of plasma was added to a solution of 1% (w/v) benzidin in 90% (v/v) acetic acid. The reaction was initiated by addition of 1 ml of 1% (w/v) H2O2 and stopped after an incubation of 20 min at room temperature by addition of 10 ml of 10% (v/v) acetic acid. After 10 min, the optical density (OD) of the samples was measured at 595 nm. In this assay, 0.1% (w/v) hemoglobin has an OD of 1.5. Cells were washed three times with PBS. For the detection of membrane-bound NDPK, 5 × 105 nucleated cells or 107thrombocytes or erythrocytes, were suspended in a volume of 50–200 μl, blocked for aspecific staining with 10 μg of unlabeled mouse gamma globulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 10 min and incubated for an additional 15 min with 0.5 μg of antibody, washed with PBS, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium). For detection of intracellular NDPK, 5 × 105 cells were suspended in 50–200 μl, fixed, and permeabilized with Fix&Perm (An-der-Grub, Kaumberg, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were labeled with 0.5 μg of antibody and washed once before analysis. FITC-labeled mouse IgG1 and IgG2awere used as isotype-matched controls for the anti-nm23-H2 and anti-nm23-H1 antibodies, respectively. All data were obtained with the same batches of antisera. Nm23 expression and DNA content were simultaneously measured according to the method of Clevenger et al. (26Clevenger C.V. Bauer K.D. Epstein A.L. Cytometry. 1985; 6: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In brief, 4 × 106cells were fixed in 1 ml of 0.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (BDH Chemicals, Poole, UK) for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was divided in four equal parts: one part was incubated with 0.5 μg of anti-nm23-H1-FITC antibody, one part with 0.5 μg anti-nm23-H2-FITC antibody, and the two remaining parts with 0.5 μg of the isotype-matched control antibodies, mouse-IgG2a-FITC, and mouse-IgG1-FITC, respectively. After an incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, all samples were washed with PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 0.1% (w/v) RNase A. After an incubation at room temperature for at least 20 min, cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer with standard optics except for the 515 ± 4.5 nm bandpass filter in front of the Fl-1 photomultiplier. Proteins in the lysates of 15 × 106 platelets or 106 erythrocytes were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on a 20% (w/v) gel (27Anciaux K. Van Dommelen K. Willems R. Roymans D. Slegers H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The gel was electroblotted onto a Hybond-C cellulose membrane and nm23 immunodetected with either anti-nm23-H1 (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) or anti-NDPKα/nm23-H2 antibody (Dr. Kimura, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Japan). After an additional incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), visualization was performed by ECL. Comparisons of nm23 expression in different cell types was performed with a paired Student'st test using Statview 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, Berkely, CA).p Values smaller than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Regression analysis was performed in Excel 7.0 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). NDPK was measured in the physiological medium of hematopoietic cells. Platelet-free plasma was prepared from human peripheral blood, bone marrow, and umbilical cord blood and was assayed for NDPK phosphotransferase activity, protein content, and free plasma hemoglobin. NDPK assays were performed in conditions of linear kinetics. The activity in bone marrow plasma exceeded by far that in peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood plasma. All plasma samples contained approximately equal amounts of protein and a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.01) between NDPK activity and free hemoglobin was observed (Fig.1). However, peripheral blood samples containing very low levels of hemoglobin still contained NDPK activity. Extrapolation to zero hemoglobin revealed a basal NDPK phosphotransferase activity of 33 ± 5 milliunits/ml in peripheral blood plasma (p = 0.05). The NDPK activity was also quantified in several protein solutions routinely used in cell cultivation, i.e. FCS, horse serum, BSA, and casein. With the exception of casein, all assayed solutions contained NDPK activity (Table I).Table INDPK activity in plasma and culture mediaProtein solutionNDPK activityProtein contentNDPK activitymilliunits/mlmg/mlmilliunits/mg proteinPeripheral blood plasma1-aMean ± SD; n, number of samples.46 ± 862 ± 30.74 ± 0.15 (n = 10)Bone marrow plasma1-aMean ± SD; n, number of samples.1139 ± 54850 ± 323 ± 11 (n = 12)Umbilical cord blood plasma1-aMean ± SD; n, number of samples.58 ± 1238 ± 61.53 ± 0.24 (n = 9)Fetal calf serum1-bGibco BRL, catalog number 10081–164, lot 30A1263A.239386Horse serum1-cSera Lab, catalog number S-0004a, lot 104020.8562110% (w/v) BSA1-dSigma, catalog number A-4503, lot 66H0674.701000.710% (w/v) BSA1-eMerck, catalog number 12018, lot 231ZA1094118.31000.0310% (w/v) Casein1-fServa, catalog number 16260.Not detectable100Not detectable1-a Mean ± SD; n, number of samples.1-b Gibco BRL, catalog number 10081–164, lot 30A1263A.1-c Sera Lab, catalog number S-0004a, lot 104020.1-d Sigma, catalog number A-4503, lot 66H0674.1-e Merck, catalog number 12018, lot 231ZA1094118.1-f Serva, catalog number 16260. Open table in a new tab Intracellular nm23 in blood and bone marrow cells was monitored by flow cytometry after intracellular staining with FITC-conjugated anti-nm23-H1 and anti-nm23-H2 antibodies. In peripheral blood leukocytes, distinction between lymphocytes and granulocytes was made by the scatter profile of the cells. Monocytes were identified by labeling with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody (Fig.2 A). In bone marrow, a distinction was made between mononuclear and myeloid precursors by their scatter profile. CD34+ progenitors were identified by labeling with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD34 antibody (Fig.2 B). All analyzed cells showed a positive intracellular immunofluorescence for nm23-H1 and nm23-H2. The results presented in Fig. 3 demonstrated that the expression of nm23 is high in bone marrow CD34+ cells and lower in more differentiated cell types. In addition, peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells have a higher expression of nm23-H1 than lymphocytes, which in turn express more nm23-H2 than polymorphonuclear cells. Among the peripheral blood leukocytes, monocytes have the highest nm23 expression. Due to cell lysis of platelets and red blood cells during fixation and permeabilization, the intracellular nm23 expression of these cells could not be measured by flow cytometry. Therefore, the presence of NDPK was measured by enzymatic assays and Western blotting. In lysates of red blood cells and platelets, a NDPK phosphotransferase activity of 1.3 ± 0.6 nanounits/cell and 0.40 ± 0.08 nanounits/cell (mean ± S.E., n= 3) was measured, respectively. Both nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 were identified in these cells by Western blotting (data not shown).Figure 3Decrease in nm23 expression upon maturation of hematopoietic cells. Nm23 expression is determined from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) measured by flow cytometric analyis of cells, labeled with FITC-conjugated antibodies for intracellular nm23. The plotted MFI is the measured value substracted with the MFI of cells labeled with isotype-matched control antibodies. Nm23-H1 expression is indicated in the upper bar chart, nm23-H2 expression in the lower bar chart. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Note that nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 cannot be compared due to different affinities and fluorescence intensities of the used antibodies. Statistical analysis using the Student's t test revealed a significantly different expression of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 in all cells, except when mononuclear precursors are compared with monocytes and granulocytes. pValues smaller than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nm23 was rapidly up-regulated in lymphocytes after induction of proliferation by PHA. Using single parameter flow cytometry on fixed and permeabilized lymphocytes, we observed a more than 10-fold increase in immunoreactivity of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 72–96 h after PHA stimulation (Fig. 4). Cells were also simultaneously examined for nm23 and DNA content using a multiparameter flow cytometric approach. From the obtained data, we were able to correlate the nm23 content with the cell cycle phase. The results presented in Fig. 5, are representative of five independent experiments. The most important conclusions which can be drawn from these data are: (i) unstimulated lymphocytes in G0 phase have a basal level of nm23 expression; (ii) the onset of proliferation takes place between 24 and 48 h after stimulation; (iii) there is an up-regulation of nm23 expression after 24 h; (iv) cells that enter the S-phase have a nm23 content which exceeds that of unstimulated cells; (v) there is no further up-regulation of nm23 during the S-phase. The obtained results were similar for nm23-H1 and nm23-H2.Figure 5Cell cycle-dependent expression of nm23.Dot plots of multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes labeled for their DNA content (ethidium bromide fluorescence, FL2-A) and for nm23-H1 (upper panel) or nm23-H2 (middle panel) using FITC-conjugated antibodies.

In five independent experiments, we could not demonstrate nm23 on the surface of any normal hematopoietic cell,i.e. bone marrow CD34+ progenitors, mononuclear precursors (lymphoid and erythroid), myeloid precursors, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and purified thrombocytes and erythrocytes. Apart from the latter two, cells were identified by flow cytometric analysis of the scatter profiles and the CD34 membrane marker (Fig. 2,C and D). PHA stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation did not induce surface expression of nm23. In contrast, of the hematopoietic cell lines examined for surface-bound nm23, the myeloid cell lines (K562, KG1, HL-60, and U937) showed a weak but reproducible positive staining for nm23-H1, whereas the lymphoid ones (HSB2, SupT1, Jurkat, Molt3, and Molt4) were negative for both isoforms. K562 also showed a comparable positive staining for nm23-H2. Four representative examples are shown in Fig.6. Flow cytometric and enzymatic analysis were used to study the NDPK/nm23 expression in several plasma types and in all cells of hematopoietic origin. This article is mainly focused on the nm23 isoforms nm23-H1 and nm23-H2. They have a molecular mass of 21 and 19 kDa, respectively, are encoded by separate genes, colocalized on chromosome 17q21.3, which are probably independently regulated (28Backer J.M. Mendola E. Kovesdi I. Fairhurst J.L. O'Hara B. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Mathew S. Murty V.V.V.S. Chaganti R.S.K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar,29Okada K. Urano T. Baba H. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Shiku H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1937-1943PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two new isoforms, DR-nm23 and nm23-H4, have been characterized and localized on chromosome 16q13 and 16p13, respectively (4Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M.-F. Munier A. Erent M. Lascu I.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1180-1187PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting extracellular property of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 is their ability to inhibit the induced differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines, independently of their enzymatic activity (13Okabe-Kado J. Kasukabe T. Honma Y. Hayashi M. Henzel W.J. Huzomi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Okabe-Kado J. Kasukabe T. Hozumi M. Honma Y.

Acta. 1995; 1267: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated the presence of NDPK in plasma from peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, and bone marrow. The highest activity was measured in bone marrow plasma. However, the observed correlation between the hemoglobin content and the NDPK phosphotransferase activity in the plasma samples indicated that the presence of nm23 in plasma is probably due to lysis of red blood cells. In the latter cells, a relatively high level of NDPK was detected. The high activity observed in bone marrow plasma is probably due to the harsher treatment of cells during bone marrow sampling. However, even in vivo, a limited lysis of senescent red blood cells occurs and causes release of hemoglobin and NDPK in the plasma. In addition, a basal level of 33 ± 5 milliunits/ml was estimated in human peripheral blood plasma. These data suggest that in vivo, NDPK is present in plasma, and may have a physiological significance. We also demonstrated the presence of NDPK in several protein solutions, often used in cell cultivation. These findings emphasize that studies on the effect of extracellular nucleotides or on the differentiation inhibitory effect of exogenous NPDK should be performed in serum-free conditions, and with NDPK-free serum substitutes. Previously, extracellular NDPK has been reported on the cell surface of several cell lines (23Urano T. Furukawa K. Shiku H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar). These results were confirmed in our study, although the observed cell surface immunoreactivity was always small and close to the flow cytometric detection limit (±1000 molecules/cell). In contrast, the presence of ecto-NDPK on platelets (22Adler J.R. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3866-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not confirmed in our study. Moreover, we could not detect any nm23 surface expression on normal hematopoietic cells. Apparently, malignant cells seem to express more surface NDPK than normal cells. Probably this expression is not due to the proliferating state of the cell, since PHA-stimulated lymphocytes or CD34+ progenitors did not express detectable surface-bound NDPK. In addition, nm23 surface expression seems to occur on tumor cells in a lineage specific way, since we detected this expression on all myeloid cell lines and could not demonstrate any on lymphoid cells. Whether nm23 surface expression can be used as a marker for certain hematopoietic malignancies remains to be determined. Our data demonstrated the presence of NDPK in all investigated cells of hematopoietic origin, indicating the constitutive expression of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 in these cells in agreement with the hypothesis that nm23 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (20Lakso M. Steeg P.S. Westphal H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). However, the main finding of our study is the inverse correlation between nm23 expression and hematopoietic maturation. In fact, hematopoietic CD34+progenitors express high levels of both nm23-H1 and -H2, and their expression decreases in more differentiated cell types. Previously, high levels of DR-nm23 mRNA have also been reported in CD34+ progenitors (3Venturelli D. Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point to an important role for nm23 in the early stages of hematopoiesis. The CD34+ compartment represents a population of proliferation inducible and early proliferating cells, therefore the expression of NDPK might reflect the proliferative potential of hematopoietic cells. The data generated with PHA-stimulated lymphocytes also supported this hypothesis and demonstrated that during the G0/G1 transition, peripheral blood lymphocytes up-regulate nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 approximately 10-fold, a level which is maintained during further cell cycle progression. Although our findings indicate a correlation between nm23 expression and the proliferation of nucleated hematopoietic cells, the specific function of nm23 in this process remains unknown. Several non-enzymatic functions have been proposed for NDPK. Nm23-H2 has been identified as PuF, a transcription factor which positively regulates c-mycexpression in Burkitt's lymphoma (6Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 31Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13392-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This proto-oncogene is well known to be overexpressed in proliferating cells (32Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro and in vivo terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells is accompanied by down-regulation of c-myc expression (33Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 352-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Nguyen H.Q. Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2439-2444PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the high nm23 expression in proliferating hematopoietic cells could be responsible for the constitutive expression of c-myc. However, in contrast to nm23, c-myc is not ubiquitously expressed in all cells. This apparent contradiction indicates that the transcriptional activity of nm23 must be strictly regulated. Regulatory mechanisms may include their subcellular localization, post-translational modifications, or changes in the oligomeric structure (35MacDonald N.J. De La Rosa A. Benedict M. Freije J.M.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4436-4442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another important hypothesis concerning the level of nm23 expression is the necessity for cells of guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) or other triphosphate nucleotides. In the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, a down-regulation of the intracellular GTP level after vitamin D3-induced granulocyte differentiation was demonstrated (38Pilz R.B. Huvar I. Scheele J.S. Van den Berghe G. Boss G.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar). In this cell line, the down-regulation of nm23 expression upon granulocyte differentiation has also been reported (39Caligo M.A. Cipollini G. Petrini M. Valentini P. Bevilacqua G. Leukemia Res. 1996; 20: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, the high expression of nm23 in normal proliferating hematopoietic cells may reflect their necessity for a high intracellular GTP level. As proposed previously, NDPK may be involved in providing GTP for the activation of G-proteins, for the activation of the translation apparatus or for the polymerization of microtubuli (5Otero A.D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Sonnemann J. Mutzel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As induction of proliferation requires a reorganization of the cytoskeleton, it is not unlikely that the nm23 up-regulation is correlated with the latter process. Research is in progress to elucidate the function of NDPK in the G0/G1 transition upon induction of proliferation in lymphocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2148814680,"In monocyte/macrophage cells, the translation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA is tightly controlled. In unstimulated cells, TNF-α mRNA is translationally repressed. However, upon stimulation of the cells with various agents (e.g. lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and viruses), this repression is overcome and translation occurs. The key element in this regulation is the AU-rich sequence present in the 3′-untranslated region of TNF-α mRNA. Several groups have described the binding of proteins on AU-rich elements (AREs). We have previously reported the binding of two cytosolic protein complexes (1 and 2) to the TNF-α mRNA ARE, one of which (complex 2) is observed only following induction of TNF-α production by LPS. In this report, we have demonstrated that complex 1 involves a long fragment of the ARE, whereas the formation of the LPS-inducible complex 2 requires a minimal sequence which corresponds to the nonanucleotide UUAUUUAUU. Furthermore, we show that the RNA-binding protein involved in complex 2 has an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. Finally, we tested other AREs for their ability to form complex 2. We observed that the ARE derived from granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA, which does contain the nonanucleotide, is able to sustain the LPS-induced binding of the 55-kDa protein. However, c-myc mRNA, which does not contain the nonanucleotide, is unable to promote the formation of any LPS-induced complex.

Translational control is now considered to be an important means of gene regulation. The expression of many mRNAs, including those encoding the p53 protein (1Fu L. Benchimol S.

In each of these cases, the sequences responsible for this effect have been mapped to the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich element; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; nt, nucleotide(s). of the genes. AU-rich elements (AREs) are found in the 3′-UTRs of many oncogene and cytokine mRNAs (6Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Originally, these motifs, in particular the AUUUA pentanucleotide, were shown to destabilize messages when placed downstream of the coding sequence (7Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). ARE-containing mRNAs have been divided into two classes based on the number and distribution of the AUUUA pentamer. Oncogene mRNAs generally fall into class 1, having one to three AUUUA sequences spaced throughout the 3′-untranslated region. The poly(A) tails of these mRNAs are degraded synchronously. Class 2 is mainly composed of cytokine mRNAs, and is defined by the presence of multiple clustered pentamers. This confers a processive mechanism of poly(A) tail decay (8Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). AREs in cytokine mRNAs are also implicated in translational control (3Kruys V. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 9Espel E.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is not expressed in most cell types or in unstimulated monocyte-derived cell lines. Using a reporter gene linked to a series of deletions of the TNF-α 3′-UTR, the sequences mediating this repression were localized to an ARE. In macrophages, TNF-α production is rapidly induced following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Although part of this induction can be accounted for by an increase in both the transcription of the TNF-α gene and the stability of the mRNA, it has been shown that the most important event following LPS stimulation is a relief from the ARE-mediated translational blockade (4Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that several proteins can complex with the ARE of the TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated cells (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol.

Furthermore, an additional protein complex is recruited to this region following cell activation, suggesting a role in TNF-α mRNA translational derepression (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that this inducible complex contains a previously undescribed protein of 55 kDa and demonstrate that it binds to a single UUAUUUAUU sequence, but not to the AUUUA pentanucleotide. Enzymes used for construction of the different plasmids were purchased from Promega or Life Technologies, Inc. RNase T1 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. RNase A and LPS (Escherichia coli strain 0.127:B8) were obtained from Sigma. Synthetic RNAs were purchased from Eurogentec (Belgium). RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were maintained as described previously (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml for 2 h in all experiments. The TNF-α ARE probes have been previously described (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GM-CSF ARE probe was synthesized by inserting the 227-base pair NcoI-BglII fragment corresponding to the distal part of the GM-CSF mRNA 3′-UTR (3Kruys V. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) into the SP64 plasmid previously cut by PstI, blunted, and cut byBamHI. The c-myc 3′-UTR construct was a kind gift of Dr. Blanchard, Montpellier, France. To construct the 3′-PCR-generated deletions of the TNF-α ARE, the primer 5′-CGGTACCAGATCTCAGGCCTTCCTAC-3′ was used with the following primers: 5′-CCACTAGTATCGATAATAAATAAATAATAAATAATAAGTGC-3′ (3′-d1), 5′-CCACTAGTATCGATAATAAATAATAAGTGC-3′ (3′-d2), and 5′-CCACTAGTATCGATAAGTGCAAATATAAAT-3′ (3′-d3). To construct the 5′-d1 construct the following primers were used: 5′-CCACTAGTTCAGCTCCGTTTTCACAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGTACCATCGATTATTTATTTGCTTATGA-3′. The TNF-α ARE was used as a template. The resulting DNA fragments were subcloned into theKpnI and SpeI sites of the pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). All plasmids were sequenced. To synthesize riboprobes, the pBluescript derived plasmids were linearized with XbaI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.); the TNF-α ARE and GM-CSF plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and transcribed using SP6 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the c-myc plasmid was linearized with XhoI and transcribed using T3 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). All reactions were carried out as described previously (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) probes, and with [α-32P]UTP (100 μCi; 3000 Ci/mmol) for the UV cross-linking probes. Unlabeled RNAs were synthesized using 0.5 mm amounts of each nucleotide. TNF-α ARE probe was digested with RNase T1, which cleaves at the 3′ side of G residues, yielding three major fragments of 39, 20, and 10 nucleotides (nt), respectively (Fig. 1 a). The fragments of 39 and 20 nucleotides were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. We confirmed the identity of the two fragments by demonstrating that neither was susceptible to further RNase T1 digestion (data not shown). S100 macrophage extracts and EMSA were carried out exactly as described previously (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that migration was performed at 220 V for 150 min. Unless specified, 10 fmol of labeled probe (approximately 30,000 cpm) was added to each reaction. To elute RNA, bands were excised from the wet gel and placed into oligonucleotide elution buffer (2 mammonium acetate, 1% SDS, 25 μg/ml tRNA) for 2 h at 37 °C. RNA was precipitated and, following resuspension in water, was analyzed on 6 m urea, 20% acrylamide gels. To elute UV cross-linked RNA-protein complexes, dried gel slices were rehydrated in 4% ammonium bicarbonate, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Samples were left overnight on a rotating wheel and then centrifuged to remove the debris. The supernatants were concentrated using Ultrafree-MC columns (Millipore) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were prepared exactly as for EMSA, except that 500,000 cpm of probe and 20 μg of protein was used and 10 μg of tRNA was included in the binding reaction. Following RNase T1 digestion (60 units) and addition of heparin, samples were placed on ice at a distance of 4 cm from a UV light source (Stratalinker) for 10 min. Samples were then treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature, before loading onto either native gels for EMSA analysis or 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 cross-linking ratio). We have shown previously that in S100 extracts of unstimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, a single protein complex (complex 1) binding a 70-nucleotide ARE in the 3′-UTR of the TNF-α mRNA can be detected by EMSA. In similar experiments using extracts prepared from LPS-stimulated macrophages, an additional complex (complex 2) was observed that runs with a higher mobility than complex 1 (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further delineate the exact sequence requirements for complex 1 and 2 formation, we digested the ARE probe with T1 ribonuclease, yielding three major fragments of 39, 20, and 10 nucleotides (Fig. 1 a). The purified 39- and 20-nt T1 products were used in an EMSA with S100 macrophage extracts as described previously (10Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2 (; Correction (1996) Mol. Med.2, 786): 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 39-nucleotide fragment supports the formation of the same complexes as those observed previously using the complete TNF-α ARE (Fig. 1 b). Binding to the 20-nt fragment is also detectable but at a much reduced level. These results show that both complexes 1 and 2 can form with a RNA fragment containing clustered AUUUA pentamers. However, neither complex forms strongly with a RNA fragment containing a single AUUUA pentamer. To gain information on the RNA species present in complexes 1 and 2, we performed a binding reaction with the TNF-α ARE probe and protein S100 extract. The samples were subsequently digested with RNase T1 and loaded on a non-denaturing gel. After migration, the RNA-protein complexes were eluted from the gel and the purified RNA fragments were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Complex 1 mostly bound to the 39-nt fragment (see Fig. 1 a). Complex 2, however, bound a number of fragments, the strongest band corresponding to a 10-nt digestion product. This could not be further digested with RNase T1 following elution and purification, identifying it as the UAUUUAUUUG fragment found in the 3′ end of the TNF-α ARE. Surprisingly, only a small amount of the 39-nt fragment was eluted. Presumably, in the conditions used for the EMSA experiment, complex 1 has a higher affinity for this sequence or is more abundant and efficiently competes for binding. In addition, the 20-nt fragment was clearly present, together with a 24-nt fragment that is probably a partial digestion product containing this 20-mer sequence. These results are consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 b, with complex 2 having a low affinity for the 20-nt sequence, and suggest that complex 2 is able to bind a RNA sequence containing the pentanucleotide AUUUA flanked by several U residues. PCR primers were designed to generate DNA fragments with deletions at either the 5′ or 3′ end of the TNF-α ARE (Fig.3 a). These constructs were subcloned and used as template for generation of labeled riboprobes. These probes were used in EMSA analysis. Probe 3′-d1, which has the 3′ end of the TNF-α ARE deleted, supports formation of both complexes 1 and 2 in a similar fashion to the complete TNF-α ARE probe (Fig.3 b). A probe with a deletion of a further eleven nucleotides (3′-d2) binds to complex 2, but binds very weakly to complex 1. Deletion of another 10 nucleotides (3′-d3) resulted in a probe that did not bind, or bound weakly, to complexes 1 or 2. A construct bearing a deletion of the 5′ end of the TNF-α ARE (5′-d1) also bound to an LPS-inducible complex, but no complex was detectable with extracts from unstimulated cells. The mobility of this inducible complex was consistently lower than that of complex 2 formed with the TNF-α ARE probe. However, when unlabeled 5′-d1 RNA was used as a competitor with labeled TNF-α ARE probe, complex 2, but not complex 1, was specifically competed (Fig. 3 c). Moreover, UV cross-linking experiments confirmed that the complex formed with the 5′-d1 probe is highly related to complex 2 (see below and Fig. 5). These results indicate that complex 1 binding requires larger RNA fragments with multiple AUUUA motifs. Complex 2 forms with smaller fragments, but its inability to complex strongly with 3′-d3 suggests that a single AUUUA pentamer is not the optimal binding motif.Figure 5Characterization of the protein present in complex 2 by UV cross-linking experiment. Left panel, S100 extract from either unstimulated (−) or LPS-stimulated cells (+) were incubated with the indicated labeled RNA species, UV cross-linked, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Right panel, S100 extract from LPS-stimulated cells were incubated with the indicated labeled RNA species, UV cross-linked, and run on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Proteins present in the band corresponding to complex 2 were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both 5′-d1 and 3′-d2 fragments contain the UUAUUUAUU nonamer motif. This sequence has been described previously as being important in the regulation of mRNA degradation (8Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In order to test whether this sequence is sufficient for complex 2 formation, we synthesized an artificial RNA consisting of this nonamer motif. This oligoribonucleotide was used in competition experiments with a labeled TNF-α ARE probe. We observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of labeled complex 2 formation (Fig.4, upper panel). As expected, there was no change in complex 1 binding. Further synthetic RNA nonamers were synthesized with mutations in the sequences flanking the central AUUUA pentamer. Again, these oligoribonucleotides were used in competition experiments with a labeled TNF-α ARE probe. Mutation of the two outer U residues to C residues significantly reduced the ability of the RNA to compete for complex 2 binding (Fig. 4,upper panel). Changing all four of the flanking U residues to C completely abolished the competition. In addition, no competition was observed with a nonamer consisting only of U residues (Fig. 4,lower panel). These observations further indicate that the protein(s) forming complex 2 require(s) UUAUUUAUU sequences for high affinity binding and that the pentameric AUUUA motif is not sufficient. Moreover, the reduced affinity observed for the CUAUUUAUC sequence explains why complex 2 can form on the 20-nt T1 digestion product (Fig.1), albeit with a lower affinity. We have used the specificity of the 5′-d1 probe for complex 2 as a means of determining the molecular size of its protein constituents. S100 extract from either unstimulated or stimulated macrophages was incubated with 5′-d1 probe labeled to a high specific activity. Binding was carried out in the presence of tRNA to reduce nonspecific binding (data not shown). Following T1 digestion and addition of heparin to reduce nonspecific electrostatic interactions, the samples were exposed to short wavelength UV irradiation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were autoradiographed to visualize proteins that had become cross-linked to the radiolabeled 5′-d1 probe. A single band of approximately 55 kDa was observed with stimulated but not with unstimulated extracts (Fig. 5, left panel). This 55-kDa band was not detected in the absence of UV irradiation (data not shown). The same experiments were carried out using a radiolabeled TNF-α ARE probe. Again, an inducible protein of approximately 55 kDa was observed. In addition, proteins of 48 kDa and greater than 200 kDa cross-linked to the TNF-α ARE in a constitutive manner. The above results suggest that the 55-kDa protein may be a constituent of complex 2. To confirm this, we ran the UV-irradiated samples on native gels and excised complex 2. Protein and RNA was eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE as before. The same 55-kDa protein eluted from complex 2 formed with both the 5′-d1 and TNF-α ARE probes (Fig. 5,right panel). From the results shown in Fig. 3, we predicted that complex 2 should form on the GM-CSF ARE, which contains several nonamer motifs, but not on the c-myc ARE, which contains only AUUUA pentameric motifs (Fig. 6 a). To test this hypothesis, we used riboprobes containing the AREs of the GM-CSF and c-myc mRNAs in EMSA experiments. It can be seen in Fig. 6 b that the GM-CSF probe supports formation of an inducible complex. No complex formation was observed using the c-myc riboprobe. In addition, a 55-kDa protein could be cross-linked to the GM-CSF probe, but only in LPS-induced extracts (Fig. 6 c). TNF-α mRNA translational regulation is governed by the AU-rich sequence present in its 3′-UTR. In a previous report, we showed by gel retardation experiments that this AU-rich sequence is able to form two different complexes (1 and 2) with proteins present in the cytosolic fraction of macrophage cell extracts. Complex 1 is characterized by a low electrophoretic mobility, is constitutively formed, is present in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions, and probably corresponds to previously reported complex A (11Hel Z. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5579-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and AU-A (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Complex 2 has a higher electrophoretic mobility and is only detected with cytosolic extracts obtained from cells stimulated to produce TNF-α. In this study, we characterized the sequence requirements for the formation of these two complexes. Consistent with data concerning the specificity of complex A (11Hel Z. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5579-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we showed that complex 1 is able to form with the 39-nt fragment generated by RNase T1 digestion of the TNF-α ARE probe but not with a 20-nt fragment (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, the 39-nt fragment contains five overlapping AUUUA pentamer motifs, whereas only one pentamer is present in the 20-nt fragment. A progressive deletion of the TNF-α ARE within the 39-mer region rapidly abolishes the formation of complex 1 (Fig. 3 b). Furthermore, complex 1 could not bind to a synthetic UUAUUUAUU sequence. Altogether, these results suggest that complex 1 formation requires a large fragment of the TNF-α ARE containing clustered AUUUA pentamers. The functional significance of complex 1 remains to be elucidated. TNF-α mRNA is both unstable and translationally repressed in quiescent macrophages (14Han J.H. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As complex 1 is constitutively formed with cytosolic macrophage extract, this complex could mediate one of these effects. AU-rich regions, but not single AUUUA pentamers, are associated with mRNA instability (12Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Hence, there is a correlation between the sequence requirements for mRNA degradation and those required for complex 1 formation. However, Han and co-workers (4Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a UUAUUUAU sequence alone is a poor mediator of translational repression. This is consistent with the translational repression being mediated by complex 1. Further experiments will be required to elucidate the exact relationship between complex 1, translational repression, and mRNA destabilization. Several lines of evidence point to the target RNA sequence involved in the formation of the LPS-inducible complex 2 being composed of a single (U)UAUUUAU(U) motif, but not an AUUUA pentanucleotide. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that this nonamer is by itself a recognizable sequence motif. First, the purification of the RNA product present in complex 2 in a gel shift experiment leads to the isolation of a major product identified as a UAUUUAUUUG. Second, gel shift experiments using different probes derived from the TNF-α ARE demonstrate that RNA sequences containing the UUAUUUAUU motif can form an LPS-inducible complex (probes 3′-d2 and 5′-d1; Fig. 3). Complex 2 formation is poorly supported by a probe containing only a UAUUUAU motif (probe 3′-d3). Third, competition experiments between an RNA nonanucleotide and the complete TNF-α ARE show that a UUAUUUAUU motif is more efficient than a CUAUUUAUC motif at competing for the formation of the complex 2, whereas the CCAUUUACC nonamer does not compete at the concentrations used (Fig. 4). We have shown that the class II GM-CSF ARE also binds complex 2. Most Class II AREs derived from cytokine mRNA 3′-UTRs contain at least one copy of the nonanucleotide UUAUUUAUU (8Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Class I AREs, which are found in several oncogene mRNAs, do not contain nonamer motifs. It is therefore unlikely that these could support complex 2 formation. Indeed, we have failed to observe an LPS-inducible complex forming on the c-myc ARE in gel retardation experiments (Fig.6 b). From our data, it is clear that the presence of the nonamer UUAUUUAUU motif could be a key factor in the differential recognition of class I and II AREs by some proteins. The stabilities of class I and II ARE-containing mRNAs are differentially regulated (8Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 15Schuler G.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1988; 55: 1115-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis has suggested that the key feature of class II AREs that leads to this physiological difference is reiterated AUUUA motifs, and not UUAUUUAUU sequences. As our data show that complex 2 forms readily on this nonamer sequence, it suggests that complex 2 is not involved in the regulation of TNF-α mRNA stability. Other class II-specific binding activities may be responsible for this differential regulation of mRNA stability (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since formation of complex 2 tightly correlates with translational derepression of the TNF-α mRNA, the nonamer motif may be a key element for translational control. It may be that the exact physiological function of class II AREs arises from a complex interplay between the number and positioning of reiterated pentamers and individual nonamer motifs. UV cross-linking experiments using the 5′-d1 probe specific for complex 2 clearly demonstrate that this complex contains a 55-kDa protein. Using the same technical approach, several groups have described proteins that bind to the AU-rich element of cytokine mRNAs in different cellular systems. With the exception of the work of Bohjanenet al., all these data concerned constitutive ARE binding activities. Bohjanen et al. (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) described 30-kDa (AU-B) and 43-kDa (AU-C) class II ARE-specific binding activities that were only present following activation of T cells. Unlike complex 2, these activities co-migrated with a constitutive ARE binding activity in gel retardation experiments. On these bases, we believe that complex 2 contains a previously undescribed inducible 55-kDa ARE-binding protein. This work forms the basis of an analysis into the relationship between translational control and mRNA stability in macrophages, and demonstrates further differences between cytokine and oncogene AREs. Isolation of the 55-kDa protein by using the specific RNA probes described in this report should provide further information as to its role in the translational control of TNF-α mRNA.

Unlike most seven-transmembrane receptors, it is composed of two halves of equal size, the N-terminal extracellular exodomain and the C-terminal membrane-associated endodomain. The exodomain is exclusively responsible for high affinity hormone binding, whereas receptor activation occurs only in the endodomain.

To determine the hormone/receptor contact sites, we have examined the receptor using progressive truncation from the C terminus, Ala scanning, immunofluorescence microscopy, and antibody binding.

Therefore, the high affinity interaction of the exodomain and hCG is the crucial first step leading to signal generation and hormone action.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequenced again to verify mutation sequences. This procedure does not involve polymerase chain reaction. To produce truncated receptors, a stop codon was introduced at the 3′-end of the exons. Mutant and truncated LH/CG receptor constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Stable cell lines were established in minimal essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 500 μg/ml G418. These cells were used for hormone binding, cAMP production, antibody binding, and fluorescence microscopy. All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated four to five times. Means ± S.D. were calculated. Stable cells were assayed for 125I-hCG binding in the presence of 150,000 cpm of 125I-hCG (14Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG. The K dvalues were determined by Scatchard plots. hCG (batch CR 127) was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. For intracellular cAMP assay, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 μg/ml) for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of hCG were then added, and incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After removing the medium, the cells were rinsed once with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of cAMP assay buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cAMP concentrations were determined with a 125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions and validated for use in our laboratory. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Cells were scraped on ice, collected in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mmEDTA), and pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min. Cells from a 10-cm plate were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and the above protease inhibitors; incubated on ice for 15 min; and diluted with 5.4 ml of buffer A containing 20% glycerol plus the protease inhibitors. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (500 μl) was mixed with 150,000 cpm of125I-hCG and 6.5 μl of 0.9% NaCl and 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG. After incubation at 4 °C for 12 h, the solution was thoroughly mixed with 250 μl of buffer A containing bovine γ-globulin (5 μg/ml) and 750 μl of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, samples were pelleted at 1300 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were removed. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, centrifuged, and counted for radioactivity. For fluorescence labeling of LH/CG receptors, the Flag epitope (15Prikett K. Amberg D. Hopp T. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar), Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (5′-GAC TAC AAG GAC GAT GAC GAT AAG-3′), was inserted between the C terminus (Ser26) of the signal sequence and the N terminus (Arg27) of mature receptors. The Flag epitope (16Hopp T. Prikett K. Price V. Libby R. March C. Cerretti P. Urdal D. Conlon P. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) has successfully been used as a marker to identify, trace, and purify recombinant proteins carrying the tag without significantly impairing their biological activities (17Guan X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chiang C. Roeder R. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). For labeling intact cells, cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates for 2 days and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 25 °C. For labeling permeabilized cells, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. Fixed intact or permeabilized cells were washed five times with PBS for 2.5 min each at 25 °C. They were sequentially treated with 0.4% type IV gelatin isolated from calf skin (Sigma) in modified Eagle's medium free of phenol red for 10 min at 25 °C and then with 5% goat serum and 1% fetal calf serum in the same medium for 20 min at 25 °C. The treated cells were incubated with 500 μl/well primary antibody solution (25 μg of mouse anti-Flag antibody in 1 ml of modified Eagle's medium containing 5% goat serum and 1% fetal calf serum) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS for 2.5 min each at 25 °C and treated with a 400-fold dilution of Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Finally, the cells were washed with PBS six times for 2.5 min each at 25 °C. The coverslip containing processed cells was mounted on slide glass using 50% glycerol in PBS and sealed using nail polish. Specimens were examined under a Leica TCS-4D laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with Scanware analysis software. Entire experiments were completed in 1 day to prevent increasing background fluorescence. Mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) was iodinated with125I according to the published procedure for radioiodination of hCG (14Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and 125I-anti-Flag antibodies were purified on a Sephadex G-150 column. Binding of125I-anti-Flag antibodies to 293 cells expressing Flag-LH receptors was carried out according to the 125I-hCG binding assay described above. The LH/CG receptor is encoded by 11 exons (19Koo Y.B. Ji I. Slaughter R.G. Ji T.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Xie X.Z. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11355-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exons 1–10 comprise most of the exodomain, whereas the endodomain is encoded in exon 11. As an initial step to define important regions for hCG binding, individual exons from 11 to 2 were progressively truncated from the C terminus (Fig.1 D). These truncated receptor fragments represent exons 1–10, 1–9, 1–8, 1–7, 1–6, 1–5, 1–4, 1–3, 1–2, and 1. None of the stably transfected cells bound hCG, and therefore, they were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and assayed for hCG binding (Fig. 1, A and B). All of the expressed receptor fragments, 1–10, 1–9, 1–8, 1–7, 1–6, 1–5 1–4, 1–3 and 1–2, except for the exon 1 fragment, were capable of binding hCG, but were trapped in cells. Interestingly, K d values for the fragments increased stepwise in groups rather than continuously as the C terminus was progressively truncated (Fig. 1 C). Truncation of exon 11 to produce the exon 1–10 fragment slightly reduced theK d value compared with that of the wild type. In contrast, the exon 1–9 fragment, resulting from truncation of exons 10 and 11, showed a ~20-fold higher K d value. As the C terminus was successively truncated, the K d values increased in several discrete steps. This result suggests that the ultimate effects of the truncated exons on hCG binding are not equal. There are four potentially important regions around the junctions between exons 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, and 9 and 10 (Fig.1 D). Among the four, the region near the exon 1–2 junction appears to be most crucial for hCG binding. Therefore, the region was further investigated by Ala scanning. As a first step to identify important residues near the exon 1–2 junction, Asp17-Gly18-Ala19-Leu20-Arg21-Cys22-Pro23-Gly24-Pro25-Arg26was Ala-scanned (Fig. 2). Ala substitution for Arg21, Pro23, Pro25, or Arg26 did not impair hCG binding to intact cells but increased the K d values approximately 5–6-fold (Fig. 2, A and B). All of the mutant receptors that bound hCG on intact cells were capable of inducing cAMP production (Fig. 2 C). Their EC50values for cAMP induction were similar to the wild type value except, the R26A mutant, which has a 2.4-fold higher EC50 value (Fig. 2, table). In contrast, Ala substitution for Asp17, Gly18, Leu20, Cys22, or Gly24 impaired hCG binding to intact cells. EC50 values for cAMP production are generally lower than K d values of the corresponding receptors. This is thought to be due to the fact that receptors are activated before they are fully occupied by hormone. Sometimes, it happens when <5% of receptors are occupied. Furthermore, the maximum receptor activation is reached long before receptors are fully occupied. To determine whether the non-binding mutants are defective in hCG binding or trapped in the cytoplasm, cells expressing the mutants were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and assayed for hCG binding (Fig.3). hCG bound to the D17A and G18A mutants. Their K d values are comparable to those of the R21A, P23A, P25A, and R26A mutants, but ~5–8-fold higher than the wild type value. This result suggests that the D17A and G18A mutants are trapped in cells. In contrast to these binding-competent mutants, the L20A, C22A, and G24A mutants failed to bind hCG. Therefore, the L20A, C22A, and G24A mutants either were not synthesized or were synthesized but incapable of binding hormone. Even if they were expressed, our data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 could not pinpoint whether the mutants were located either on the cell surface or within the cells. To distinguish these possibilities, we utilized two independent immunological methods, immunofluorescence microscopy and125I-antibody that should bind to receptors expressed on the cell surface and in cells. For immunological studies, the Flag epitope (16Hopp T. Prikett K. Price V. Libby R. March C. Cerretti P. Urdal D. Conlon P. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) was inserted between the C terminus of the signal sequence and the N terminus of mature receptors. The resulting receptors are the Flag-wild type LH/CG receptor, Flag-LH/CG-RD17A, Flag-LH/CG-RG18A, Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, and Flag-LH/CG-RG24A. Cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding receptors carrying the Flag epitope. They were either examined intact or after treatment with Triton X-100 to permeabilize the plasma membrane and to allow the antibody to enter the cytosol. The cells were treated sequentially with mouse anti-Flag and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies. Confocal laser fluorescence microscopy showed bright fluorescence of the Flag-wild type receptor on intact cells and in permeabilized cells (Fig.4). Cells expressing the wild type receptor lacking the Flag tag did not show fluorescence, regardless of permeabilization. In addition, the cells expressing the Flag-wild type receptor did not show fluorescence when treated for fluorescence labeling without anti-Flag antibody. These controls demonstrate that the fluorescence staining is specific for the Flag epitope and that the Flag-wild type receptor is expressed both on the cell surface and within cells. Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, and Flag-LH/CG-RG24A were also observed on intact and permeabilized cells, indicating they were expressed on the cell surface and within cells. On the other hand, Flag-LH/CG-RD17A and Flag-LH/CG-RG18A were observed in permeabilized cells, but not intact cells, indicating that they were not transported to the cell surface. 125I-Anti-Flag antibody was used to verify the surface expression of receptors. Fig. 5shows that 125I-anti-Flag antibody bound to cells expressing the Flag-wild type receptor, Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, or Flag-LH/CG-RG24A, but not to those expressing Flag-LH/CG-RD17A or Flag-LH/CG-RG18A. The K d values were 29, 96, 106, and 135 nm for the Flag-wild type receptor, Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, and Flag-LH/CG-RG24A, respectively. The numbers of binding sites on the cell surface (27,000 and 187,000 per cell) are significant, and therefore, these bindings are likely to be specific. Taken together, these and the fluorescence microscopy results demonstrate that the Flag-wild type receptor, Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, and Flag-LH/CG-RG24A were expressed on the cell surface, whereas Flag-LH/CG-RD17A and Flag-LH/CG-RG18Awere trapped in the cells. To test whether the Flag epitope might have interfered with normal processing so that the mutant receptors carrying the Flag epitope were fortuitously expressed on the cell surface, the activities of the Flag-LH/CG receptors (hCG binding, and cAMP induction) were determined. The Flag-wild type receptor and the wild type receptor on intact cells bound hCG with the same affinity (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, the Flag-wild type receptor was capable of hCG-dependent cAMP induction, although the EC50value for cAMP induction was ~3-fold higher than the value of the wild type receptor (Fig. 6 C). These data show that the Flag-LH/CG receptors are active, although their potency is somewhat different compared with LH/CG receptors lacking the Flag epitope. With this in mind, we examined Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, and Flag-LH/CG-RG24A. They did not bind hCG or induce cAMP production (data not shown). These results, along with the results obtained from the non-Flag mutants, demonstrate that LH/CG-RL20A, LH/CG-RC22A, and LH/CG-RG24A are expressed on the surface of intact cells, but are defective in hCG binding. In contrast, LH/CG-RD17A, LH/CG-RG18A, LH/CG-RR21A, LH/CG-RG24A, LH/CG-RP25A, and LH/CG-RR26A are capable of binding hCG. Truncation at several discrete regions of the exodomain, near the boundaries of exons 1–2, 4–5, 6–7, and 9–10, noticeably influences hormone binding. It is unclear whether these regions represent hormone contact sites or whether their truncation has allosteric effects on the global structure of the exodomain and thus indirectly impacts hormone binding. In the sequence near the exon 1–2 junction, three alternate residues (Leu20, Cys22, and Gly24) are important for hormone binding. It has been speculated that a primary hCG-binding site is the putative crescent structure (21Jiang X. Dreno M. Buckler D. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W. Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Couture L. Naharisoa H. Grebert D. Remy J.J. Pajot-Augy E. Bozon V. Haertle T. Salesse R. J. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar) that is composed of Leu-rich motifs (24Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). However, the three residues are upstream (but not part) of the Leu-rich motifs and crescent structure of the exodomain. Therefore, this upstream region near the N terminus of the receptor appears to be at least equally important for hormone binding as the crescent structure. It will be interesting to see whether this upstream sequence is a hormone contact site and, if so, how it interacts with the hormone. The data in this work suggest two general possible roles for the region covering the three residues. It may contact hCG or be important for the exodomain to assume a structure necessary for hormone binding without directly interacting with the hormone. The latter possibility could be a result of misfolding of the L20A, C22A, or G24A mutant. However, the results of our specific photoaffinity labeling of both hCG α- and β-subunits by a peptide mimic of the receptor region indicate the direct interaction of the receptor region with hCG (12Phang T. Kundu G. Hong S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13841-13847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Besides, several observations described in this study are consistent with the interaction of the receptor region with hCG. The effect of Ala substitutions for the three alternate residues on hormone binding are remarkably consistent with, yet strikingly different from, the effects of Ala substitutions for the intervening and flanking residues. For example, Ala substitutions for the flanking and intervening residues of Leu20, Cys22, and Gly24 reduced the hormone binding affinity approximately 5–8-fold, but never abrogated hCG binding. Therefore, the flanking and intervening residues appear to be important for hormone binding, but are not as crucial as Leu20, Cys22, and Gly24. The three residues are 20 amino acids from the N terminus, and the Flag epitope was recognized in the Flag-wild type receptor as well as in Flag-LH/CG-RL20A, Flag-LH/CG-RC22A, and Flag-LH/CG-RG24A. These results suggest that the structure of the N-terminal region including Leu20, Cys22, and Gly24 is similar regardless of Ala substitutions for the three residues. The alternate sequence of Leu20, Cys22, and Gly24suggests a β-like structure, orienting the three residues on one side where hCG might contact. Our results are consistent with other reports that the presence of the peptide mimic of receptor Arg21–Pro38 (10Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), substitution for Cys22 (25Zhang R. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5755-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), or deletion of exon 1 (11Thomas D. Rozell T. Liu X. Segaloff D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar) interferes with hormone binding. In addition to the three residues, our data and the peptide mimic (10Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and deletion (11Thomas D. Rozell T. Liu X. Segaloff D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar) studies predict the importance of the boundaries of exons 1–2 and 4–5 in hormone binding. On the other hand, our data and the peptide mimic study (10Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggest the potential role of the exon 9–10 boundary in hormone binding. In contrast, the deletion of residues 212–341 covering the exon 9–10 boundary from the receptor increased the K d value merely by ~2-fold (11Thomas D. Rozell T. Liu X. Segaloff D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar). Our study and the deletion study (11Thomas D. Rozell T. Liu X. Segaloff D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar), but not the peptide mimic study (10Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggest a role of the exon 6–7 boundary in hormone binding. These results suggest the usefulness and limitations of individual methods by themselves. Some of the mutant receptors such as R21A, P23A, P25A, Flag-L20A, Flag-C22A, and Flag-G24A were expressed at significantly higher levels compared with expression of the wild type receptor. It is unclear whether the higher expression levels are caused by better plasmid preparation, better transfection, more efficient translation and/or processing, or a reduced degradation rate. We have experienced that the expression level is dependent on the transfection efficiency, which, in turn, is affected by the quality and amount of plasmid preparation as well as the cell condition. If the transfection efficiency is equal, it is possible that mutations could impact on the expression level. Similarly, substitutions for a crucial amino acid can diversely influence the machinery for the surface expression depending on the side chain of the amino acid (26Ryu K.-S. Gilchrist R.L. Ji I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When either Asp17 and Gly18 was substituted with Ala, the corresponding mutant receptors were trapped within cells and could not be detected on the cell surface. This total lack of their surface expression implies the importance of these residues in targeting the receptor to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the targeting machinery is extremely sensitive to a change in the structure of this sequence. At least in the case of the D17A and G18A substitutions, the targeting mechanism appears to be more sensitive than hormone binding is. Therefore, targeting to the cell surface could be used as an indicator of structural changes of the receptor including mutant receptors."

To gain deeper insight into the postulated apoE-mediated amyloid formation, we have characterized the three common apoE isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4) regarding their binding to amyloid precursor protein (APP). We employed the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cell culture supernatants of COS-1 cells, ectopically expressing apoE isoforms and APP751 holoprotein or a COOH-terminal Aβ deletion mutant protein, designated APPtrunc. We found that all three apoE isoforms were able to bind APP751holoprotein in an Aβ-independent fashion. The interacting domains could be mapped to the NH2 termini of APP (amino acids 1–207) and apoE (amino acids 1–191). As a functional consequence of this novel APP751 ectodomain-mediated apoE binding, the secretion of soluble APP751 is differentially affected by distinct apoE isoforms in vitro, suggesting a new “chaperon-like” mechanism by which apoE isoforms may modulate APP metabolism and consequently the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

The effect ofAPOE4 appears to be dependent on gene dosage,i.e. homozygotes for the APOE4 allele tend to develop AD at an earlier age then heterozygotes (11Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J.

Interestingly, the apoE2 isoform seems to demonstrate a protective effect in AD, emphasizing the significant influence of the APOE genotype as a modifier of AD progression (17Corder E.H.

Differential binding of apoE isoforms to the amyloid Aβ peptide has been suggested as a mechanism. In our study the three common apoE isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, have been biochemically characterized regarding their differential binding to APP holoprotein in vitro. pAS2-1/apoE2, pAS2-1/apoE3, pAS2-1/apoE4, and pAS2-1/apoE3 NH2 (amino acids 1–191) were constructed by cloning the full-length or partial apoE cDNA (lacking the leader sequence) into the EcoRI/SalI sites of GAL4-DBD vector pAS2-1 using PCR and recombinant PCR primers apoE-SENSE: 5′-GGA TGC GAA TTC AAG GTG GAG CAA GCG GTG GA-3′ and apoE-ANTISENSE: 5′-AGG CTT GTC GAC TCA GTG ATT GTC GCT GGG CAC-3′ or apoE-NH2/1–191 ANTISENSE: 5′-GCC CAC GTC GAC CTA CCG CAC GCG GCC CTG TTC CA-3′, respectively, engineered to create proper compatible ends and the correct reading frame for expression as fusion proteins in the context of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Similarly, pACT2/APP751 were cloned into SmaI/SalI of pACT2, respectively, using APP-SENSE: 5′-GAC GGT CCC GGG GCT GGA GGT ACC CAC TGA T-3′ and APP-ANTISENSE: 5′- GAT GAC GTC GAC TTC AGC TAT GAC AAC ACC GCC C-3′. pACT2/APPtrunc (amino acids 1–635) was constructed by COOH-terminal deletion using the endogenousBglII site, 5′ of the Aβ sequence in the APP cDNA. pACT2/APP COOH-terminal deletion mutants, amino acids 1–342 and 1–207, have been constructed employing the endogenous restrictions sites XhoI and BbsI, respectively. The plasmids pEF-apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 were constructed by shuffling the full-length coding regions (including the leader sequence) from pUC-apoE3 (obtained from J. Smith, Rockefeller University, NY), pCTV-apoE2, pCTV-apoE4 (obtained from K. Weisgraber, University of California San Francisco, CA), and apoE3-NH2 cDNA (amino acids 1–191, generated by PCR using recombinant PCR primers apoE-LEADER: 5′-CCA ATC TCT AGA GTC GAC ATG AAG GTT CTG TGG GCT GCG TTG-3′ and apoE-NH2/1–191 ANTISENSE: 5′-GCC CAC ACT AGT CTA CCG CAC GCG GCC CTG TTC CA-3′) into expression plasmid pEF-neo (a kind gift from Y.

Human APP full-length cDNA was loned into the HindIII/SalI sites of the CMV expression vector pTAG-CMVneo (25Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Couture C. Telford D. Giampa L. Altman A.

Similarly, APP-trunc was cloned into pTAG-CMV using PCR primers APP-Leader (see above) and APPtrunc-TAG-COOH: 5′-CTT CAC GTC GAC GAT CTC CTC CGT CTT GAT ATT TG-3′. Correct constructs have been identified and confirmed by restriction analysis and partial DNA sequencing using vector-specific primers (5′-GAL4-DBD: 5′-CAT CGG AAG AGA GTA G-3′, 3′-GAL4-DBD: 5′-CCT AAG AGT CAC TTT AAA A-3′, 5′-GAL4-AD: 5′- TAC CAC TAC AAT GGA TG-3′, 3′-GAL4-AD: 5′- ATA AAT GAA AGA AAT TGA GAT-3′, 5′-EF-1α: 5′-TGG ATC TTG GTT CAT TCT CAA GCC-3′, 5′-T7: 5′- TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TA-3′ and 3′-SP6: 5′- ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TA-3′). The genotype of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain HF7c used for the two-hybrid screening, is MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3:: (GAL4, 17-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ (CLONTECH). Stains were grown under standard conditions in rich or synthetic medium with appropriate supplements at 30 °C. For the yeast two-hybrid screening, DBD-apoE baits were co-transformed with the APP-AD fusion cDNA in the pACT vector (CLONTECH) into the HF7c yeast strain as described by the manufacturer, and the transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by transferring individual colonies on filters placed on selection medium. The plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C, the filters lifted and immersed in liquid nitrogen for 10 s. After thawing at room temperature, the filters were placed on filter circles saturated with X-gal solution in a Petri dish (permeabilized cells up) and incubated overnight. For quantitative analysis, β-galactosidase reporter protein was measured in the cell extracts using a β-galactosidase ELISA (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). The results shown are obtained with different preparations of expression plasmids and represent the mean ± S.E. from four representative experiments done in triplicate. 5 ml of transformed yeast cells grown overnight in selective medium lacking tryptophan were used to inoculate 15 ml of YPD medium. At an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5, the cells were pelleted, washed, resuspended at 5 × 108 cells/ml in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and frozen at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Vienna), and fusion proteins were detected using a GAL4-DBD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or GAL4-AD (Upstate Biotechnology) specific antibodies, followed by a rabbit anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate and a chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cell line COS-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured as recommended by ATCC. For transient transfections, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well in 10-cm Petri plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. One day later, the cells were transfected with 20 μg of circular plasmid DNA/dish by electroporation (BTX, San Diego, CA) with the following settings: 100 V, 48 Ohm and 1275 μF, or by LipofectAMINETM in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm NaP2P, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 2% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). Similarly, cell culture media were harvested by precipitation in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cell culture media were precleared by incubating with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies at 5 μg/ml final antibody concentration followed by addition of 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for the last 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C in an Eppendorf microfuge and washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% Tween buffer. Immuno-precipitates were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and separated on 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). Immunoblot analysis using apoE (Calbiochem), APP (Boehringer Mannheim 22C11 or WO-2, obtained from K. Beyreuther, Heidelberg) and TAG-specific (H902, Ref. 25Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Couture C. Telford D. Giampa L. Altman A. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 94-98PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies was performed. COS-1 cells transfected with apoE and APP expression plasmids were treated with minimum essential medium lacking methionine, supplemented with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany) for 1 h. For pulse-chase analysis, the chase was performed with 1 mml-methionine in minimum essential medium for various periods of time as indicated before standard cell lysis and immunoprecipitation analysis of APP holoprotein employing mAb WO-2 (anti-Aβ1–16). In our study the three common apoE isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, have been biochemically characterized regarding their binding to APP in vitro. In contrast to previous studies employing synthetic Aβ peptides (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the role of the Aβ region in a potential direct interaction of apoE and APP holoprotein, initially employing the GAL4 two-hybrid system. As result, a specific and direct physical association of apoE and APP holoprotein could be demonstrated (Fig.1 A). Additionally and to our surprise, an Aβ-independent interaction of apoE and APPtrunc, a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of APP (amino acids 1–635) devoid of the Aβ region, was observed (Fig.1 B). Interaction results were strictly dependent on the combined presence of one of the GAL4-apoE isoform baits plus one of the GAL4-APP ligands. Specificity controls employing GAL4-p53 and GAL4-SV40 ligands or empty vector in exchange of either apoE or APP and APPtrunc did not activate the β-galactosidase expression (data not shown). To biochemically confirm the relevance of this putative apoE and APP751 interaction, we used COS-1 cells, which do not express apoE, for transient transfection with expression plasmids encoding distinct apoE isoforms and APP751 holoprotein or APPtrunc, the COOH-terminal Aβ deletion mutant, respectively (Fig. 2) First, overexpressed and, due to endoproteolytic processing, soluble (s)APP751 was immunoprecipitated from cell culture media, and the resultant precipitates, e.g. apoE-APP complexes, were detected by immunoblotting with antisera specific to apoE or APP. As shown in Fig. 2 A, apoE specifically co-immunoprecipitates with sAPP751, indicating an interaction of these two proteins. In another set of experiments, ectopically expressed apoE isoforms (and apoE-associated APPtrunc) were immunoprecipitated from cell culture media, and the resultant precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with either mAb αTAG, specific for the epitope-TAG engineered into the recombinant sAPPtrunc (see cartoon in Fig. 2 C) or anti-apoE antibodies. Consistently with the apoE-APP interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid results, a specific and Aβ-independent interaction of apoE and sAPP could be demonstrated in these co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2 B). Again, all three apoE isoforms were able to form complexes with sAPP751. Since the APPtrunc used for transfections lacks the Aβ region, the findings of Fig. 2 B demonstrate that the observed apoE-APP interaction requires domains of APP upstream of the Aβ region. Recently, a physical interaction of sAPP and baculovirus-expressed apoE3 and apoE4 has been reported (26Barger S.W. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), an observation consistent with our co-expression studies reported here. To define the critical domains in the apoE-APP interaction, APP and apoE3 COOH-terminal deletion mutants have been employed in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig.3 A, the initial definition of the binding pockets could be assigned to the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1–207) of APP and the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1–191) of apoE. This has been independently demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation assays of ectopically expressed apoE and APP COOH-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 3 B), confirming the binding of sAPPtrunc to the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1–191) of apoE3. To investigate whether this novel interaction may affect APP processing, we used COS-1 cells for transient co-transfection with apoE2, apoE3, apoE4, and APP holoprotein. 24 h post-transfection, COS-1 cell culture media were investigated for apoE and sAPP protein concentrations. As shown in Fig.4 A, a significant apoE isoform-dependent inhibition of sAPP751secretion could be observed. ApoE2 demonstrated the strongest effect on sAPP followed by apoE3 and apoE4. Reduced concentrations of the soluble form of APP in the cellular supernatant may be explained by intracellular retention of APP. This was indeed demonstrated by the apoE-mediated accumulation of mature APP in the Triton X-100 soluble cellular fraction (Fig. 4 B). No significant amount of APP could be detected in the detergent-resistant fraction (not shown). Similar effects could be seen with APP695 (data not shown). ApoE isoforms therefore influence secretion and/or retro-endocytosis of APP from transfected COS-1 cells in an isoform-specific manner. Again, this apoE isoform-specific effect on sAPP751 was Aβ-independent since they were also observed with APPtrunc (Fig. 4 C). To further distinguish between apoE-mediated retention of sAPP or retro-endocytosis of sAPP, pulse-chase experiments have been performed over chase periods between 30 and 150 min. A representative result is shown in Fig. 5 demonstrating, only in the presence of apoE2, a significant intracellular accumulation of the APP holoprotein up to 90 min. Similar albeit reduced retention effects on APP holoprotein could be observed with apoE3 and apoE4 (data not shown). Due to the time frame of intracellular APP accumulation, apoE isoforms seem to mediate retention of APP mainly by reducing its secretion rate, an observation consistent with the postulated chaperon-like function of intracellular apoE. Additionally, however, apoE-mediated APP retro-endocytosis may also contribute to the observed intracellular APP accumulation. Undoubtedly, more work is necessary to determine the precise mechanism utilized by apoE isoforms, but our data represent an important step toward the identification and characterization of this novel apoE function involved in modulation of APP metabolism. Consistently, we found that the effect of apoE/APP751interaction is bilateral, since APP751 prevents apoE secretion to the culture medium (Fig.6 A) and furthermore leads to an apparent reduction of intracellular apoE (Fig. 6 B). This appears to be mediated in part by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, since N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, a potent inhibitor of this degradation pathway, can block apoE degradation by ≈30% (data not shown). The effects shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 are not due to different expression levels of apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 6, see for control apoE the lanes lacking APP (−)). Additionally, no similar apoE effect was observed with other glycoproteins besides APP, e.g. β-2 glycoprotein I secretion was not inhibited by apoE2 co-expression (data not shown). This further indicates a physiological association of apoE isoforms with APP, suggesting a potential chaperon-like function of apoE isoforms in APP processing in the order apoE2≫apoE3≈apoE4. In conclusion, apoE was demonstrated to directly bind via its NH2 terminus to APP holoprotein within the ectodomain, independent of the Aβ region in vitro. This was independently shown by the yeast two-hybrid system and by co-immunoprecipitation assays from ectopically transfected COS-1 cell culture media. Co-expressed apoE affects sAPP secretion in an apoE isoform-specific way in vitro. This novel apoE-APP ectodomain interaction may reflect a new potential physiological role of distinct apoE isoforms in APP metabolism, e.g. in astrocytes and microglia cells, endogenously co-expressing apoE (27Boyles J.K.

https://openalex.org/W2009888091,"The solution structure of a murine-human chimera of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a 180-residue cytokine with a molecular mass of 20 kDa, has been determined using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques. The protein contains four α-helices, the relative orientations of which are well defined on the basis of long-range interhelical nuclear Overhauser effects. The helices are arranged in an up-up-down-down orientation, as found in other four-helix bundle cytokines, and the overall topology of the chimera is similar to that of the crystal structure of murine LIF (Robinson, R.

Differences between the structures are evident in the N-terminal region, where the peptide bond preceding Pro17 has atrans-conformation in solution but acis-conformation in the crystal, and in the small antiparallel β-sheet encompassing residues in the N terminus and the CD loop in the crystal structure, which is not apparent in solution. There are also minor differences in the extent of the helices. Other than at the N terminus, the main difference between the two structures occurs at the C-terminal end of the CD loop. As this loop is close to a receptor-binding site on LIF that makes a major contribution to high affinity binding to the LIF receptor α-chain, these differences between the solution and crystal structures should be taken into account in structural models of LIF receptor interactions.

Nicola N.A. Gough N.M. Metcalf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9238-9243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIF is produced, however, in a diverse array of cell types and is a highly pleiotropic cytokine, exerting a range of actions on a number of cell types, including hepatocytes; adipocytes; megakaryocytes; neuronal, muscle, and embryonic stem cells; and osteoblasts (2Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These actions include the induction of cell proliferation (in myoblasts and megakaryocytes), the induction (in M1 cells) or suppression (in embryonic stem cells) of differentiation, and the induction of mature cell function (in neurons, adipocytes, and hepatocytes) (2Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Leroith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 613-668Google Scholar). Although it has multiple activities, LIF appears to be absolutely necessary only for embryo implantation. Male mice lacking the gene for LIF are apparently normal, whereas the corresponding female mice are infertile, and the deficiency can be corrected by injection of purified LIF (4Stewart C.L. Kasoar P. Brunet L.J. Bhatt H. Gadi I. Kontgen F. Abbondanzo S.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice lacking the LIF receptor have multiple placental, skeletal, neural, and metabolic disorders, which lead to perinatal death (5Ware C.B. Horowitz M.C. Renshaw B.R. Hunt J.S. Liggitt D. Koblar S.A. Gliniak B.C. McKenna H.J. Papayannopoulou T. Thoma B. Cheng L. Donovan P.J. Peschon J.J. Bartlett P.F. Willis C.R. Wright B.D. Carpenter M.K. Davidson B.L. Gearing D.P. Development ( Camb. ). 1995; 121: 1283-1299PubMed Google Scholar). The explanation for these observations, at least in part, is that several other cytokines share components of the LIF receptor, the functional form of which consists of the LIFR α-chain and a common β-chain, gp130 (3Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Leroith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 613-668Google Scholar). The β-chain is shared with interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-11, and both chains form part of the receptor complexes for oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1. With its range of biological functions and activity against a variety of target cells, LIF also has potential therapeutic applications. Its ability to induce the growth and differentiation of peripheral and central nerve cells indicates a potential use in the treatment of peripheral nerve damage (6Cheema S.S. Richards L. Murphy M. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci Res. 1994; 37: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and motor neuron disease. Furthermore, the receptor subunit gp130, which is shared among the IL-6 family of cytokines, is a potential target for antagonists that could be used in treating certain cancers and autoimmune diseases associated with overproduction of these cytokines (7Peppard J.V. Loo P. Sills M.A. Munster D. Pomponi S.A. Wright A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7281-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A knowledge of the structures of the cytokines and their receptor complexes will open the way for the design of cytokine antagonists or agonists directed toward specific tissues. Despite the low sequence identity among the four-helix bundle cytokines (17–24%) (8Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), there are common features of their three-dimensional structures. On the basis of their sequences and tertiary structures, they have been divided into two classes (9Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Nicola N.A. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Sambrook and Tooze, New York1994: 1-7Google Scholar, 11Mott H.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which share a common motif consisting of four helices (referred to as the A, B, C, and D helices) arranged in an antiparallel up-up-down-down fashion, with long loops between the A and B helices and the C and D helices. The short-chain molecules are distinguished from their long-chain counterparts by the lengths of their helices, which span only 15 or so residues compared with ~25 in the long-chain class, and by the secondary structure elements in the long AB and CD loops, with the short-chain molecules typically having a small β-sheet and the long-chain molecules having α-helices. We have undertaken an investigation by NMR spectroscopy of the solution structure of LIF. Mature LIF has three disulfide bonds and is heavilyN-glycosylated, with an apparent molecular mass range of 32–62 kDa in the glycosylated state, but only 20 kDa in the non-glycosylated state (12Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Sambrook and Tooze, New York1994: 124-126Google Scholar). Samples for NMR were obtained fromEscherichia coli, where the protein is not glycosylated, but it has been shown that glycosylation is not important for activity (2Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,13Gearing D.P. Gough N.M. King J.A. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Simpson R.J. Nice E.C. Kelso A. Metcalf D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3995-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The solution structure was determined for MH35-LIF, a murine-human chimera of LIF consisting of residues 1–47 and 83–180 of mLIF and residues 48–82 of hLIF, except for residues 107, 112, 113, 155, and 158, which are from hLIF (Fig. 1). hLIF binds both the human and murine receptors with high affinity, whereas mLIF binds strongly only to the murine receptor (14Owczarek C.M.

Treutlein H.R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although MH35-LIF has a greater sequence similarity to murine LIF than to human LIF, it has essentially the same biological activity as hLIF (15Layton M.J. Owczarek C.M Metcalf D. Clark R.L. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, it was of interest to determine its structure to characterize changes in the receptor-binding domains of the protein. MH35-LIF also expressed at high levels in E. coli grown on minimal medium and could be labeled efficiently (16Maurer T. Smith D.K. Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Zhang J.-G. Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The preparation of 13C- and15N-labeled MH35-LIF and the chemical shift assignments and secondary structure of MH35-LIF have been reported previously (17Hinds M.G. Maurer T. Zhang J.-G Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). NMR data were acquired on samples at pH 4.4 and 40 °C. A two-dimensional NOESY spectrum was acquired on unlabeled MH35-LIF with a 150-ms mixing time, and the following spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled MH35-LIF: three-dimensional1H,15N NOESY-HSQC (18Marion D.

NMR. 1993; 3: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were acquired on the13C,15N-labeled sample to obtain further distance constraints, further stereospecific assignments, and limits on the φ and ψ angles. Pulsed-field gradients were used to suppress unwanted coherences and the water resonance (26Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Approximate interproton distances were derived from two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional13C- and 15N-edited NOESY spectra. Peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak on the basis of contour levels and translated into upper distance bounds of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 Å, respectively, and corrections for pseudoatoms were added. A total of 1599 interresidue and 900 intraresidue constraints were used in the final structure calculations. Hydrogen bond restraints were employed for backbone amide protons where there was a slowly exchanging amide proton (27Smith, D. K. (1996) Structural Studies of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and Its Receptors. PhD. thesis, University of MelbourneGoogle Scholar), a low NH–CαH coupling constant, and medium-range NOEs consistent with the presence of an α-helix (28Barnham K.J. Dyke T.R. Kem W.R. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 886-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each hydrogen bond was constrained by an NH–O distance restraint of 2.3 Å and an N–O distance of 3.3 Å, yielding a total of 156 constraints in the structure calculations. The disulfide bonds were constrained by setting ranges of 2.0–2.1 and 3.0–3.1 Å, respectively, for the Si–Sj and Si–Cβjdistances of each bond. Backbone NH–CαH coupling constants were determined from the cross-peak to diagonal intensity ratio in an HNHA experiment or from a HMQC-J experiment and were used to constrain backbone φ angles as follows: 3JNHα < 5.5 Hz, φ = −60 ± 30°; and 3JNHα ≥ 8 Hz, φ = −120 ± 30°. A total of 107 φ angle constraints were obtained in this way, 80 of which were within the four major α-helices. An additional 25 restraints were obtained from the relative sizes of the1 J CαH coupling observed in a HCACO experiment (25Vuister G.W. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments were made using HNHB and HACAHB experiments, but only 20 were obtained due to a combination of low cross-peak intensities and resonance overlap; only 15 χ1 restraints were included in the structure calculations. Initial structures were generated with the torsion angle dynamics program DYANA (29Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 278: 283-298Crossref Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Several rounds of structure calculation were carried out using DYANA to resolve violated distance constraints and to determine possible assignments for ambiguous NOE cross-peaks. This process was repeated until all the distance and angle restraints produced a set of structures that had no NOE distance violations >0.3 Å or dihedral angle violations >5°. Once the final set of restraints had been obtained, a new family of structures was generated using DYANA; the 50 structures with the lowest penalty functions were selected from a calculation of 1000 structures, and these were refined in X-PLOR (30Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using dynamical simulated annealing (31Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) and energy minimization, as described previously (28Barnham K.J. Dyke T.R. Kem W.R. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 886-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but without neutralization of charged side chains. The 20 best structures, on the basis of their stereochemical energies, were chosen for structural analysis. Structures were analyzed using MOLMOL (32Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR (33Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds were identified in MOLMOL using a maximum C–N distance of 2.4 Å and a maximum angular deviation of 35° from linearity. Structural figures were generated using MOLMOL. Structural restraints were determined from a combination of two- and three-dimensional double- and triple-resonance experiments using both 15N- and13C,15N-labeled samples as well as unlabeled protein. A representative region of a three-dimensional 13C NOESY-HSQC spectrum, from which numerous distance restraints were obtained, is shown in Fig. 2. There were very few constraints for the first nine residues, which are apparently disordered in solution. Structures were determined initially using DYANA, then refined by simulated annealing in X-PLOR, and finally energy-minimized. Parameters characterizing the final 20 structures are plotted in Fig.3; structural statistics are summarized in Table I; and a superposition of the final 20 structures is shown in Fig. 4. The best defined regions of the structure, residues 25–48, 75–133, and 153–180, correspond to the A helix, the B and C helices and the short BC loop, and the D helix including the C terminus, respectively. The structures shown in Fig. 4 were superimposed over the backbone atoms nitrogen, α-carbon, and carbon of the four helices that define the α-helical bundle.Table IStructural statistics and mean pairwise RMSDs for the 20 best structures of MH35-LIF in aqueous solutionExperimental distance restraints Total2499 Sequential (∣i−j∣ = 1) 525 Medium range (1 < ∣i−j∣ ≤ 5) 722 Long range (∣i−j∣ > 5) 352 Intraresidue1-aApproximately half of these intraresidue restraints are redundant with the covalent geometry. 900 Hydrogen bonds78RMSD from experimental dihedral restraints (degrees) (147)0.4942 ± 0.0922RMSD from idealized covalent geometry Bonds (Å)0.0121 ± 0.0004 Angles (degrees)2.693 ± 0.024 Impropers (degrees)0.4006 ± 0.0131Energies (kcal mol−1) E NOE60 ± 2 E cdih1.6 ± 0.6 E bond69 ± 3 E angle515 ± 11 E improper20 ± 1 E LJ−725 ± 22 E elec−2811 ± 56 E dihed957 ± 16Residues superimposedMean pairwise RMSDBackbone heavy atomsAll heavy atomsÅ 1–1803.06 ± 0.863.50 ± 0.72 9–1801.57 ± 0.252.34 ± 0.27 ABCD0.65 ± 0.081.44 ± 0.09 A0.56 ± 0.121.30 ± 1.20 B0.46 ± 0.091.42 ± 0.12 C0.42 ± 0.091.32 ± 0.17 D0.48 ± 0.121.38 ± 0.20 AB loop1.50 ± 0.472.16 ± 0.47 CD loop2.14 ± 0.843.32 ± 1.031-a Approximately half of these intraresidue restraints are redundant with the covalent geometry.

The eight N-terminal residues are not shown due to their poorly defined structure. The helices are colored as follows: A, red; B,green; C, cyan; and D, yellow. The loops are colored as follows: AB, purple; and BC and CD,magenta. Residues 9–24 are in blue. The crystal structure of mLIF (34Robinson R.C. Grey L.M. Staunton D. Vankelecom H. Vernallis A.B.

Cell. 1994; 77: 1101-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) is shown in white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data in Table I show that the ensemble of NMR structures is energetically reasonable and has acceptable covalent geometry. Indeed, 90% of the residues have φ-ψ values in the allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot, and there is good clustering of residues in the most favored α-helical region (φ = −60°, ψ = −60°), as would be expected for a four-helix bundle protein. The mean pairwise RMSD for the backbone heavy atoms is 0.65 Å over the four-helix bundle and 3.06 Å for the entire molecule (including the disordered N terminus). The corresponding values for all heavy atoms are 1.44 and 3.50 Å, respectively. A measure of the quality of the three-dimensional structure is the consistency of the RMSDs determined by alignment over alternative combinations of individual secondary structure elements. If the tertiary structure is well defined, then a superposition over the major elements of secondary structure should give consistent RMSDs. In MH35-LIF, alignment over any one of the major helices gave low RMSD values over the whole bundle, with the mean being 0.71 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.46 Å for all heavy atoms. The overall topology is a four-helix bundle, with the helices arranged in an up-up-down-down left-handed fashion. The N-terminal region is distinguished by its lack of long-range order, with the first nine residues being unstructured and residues 10–22 being poorly ordered. The A helix begins at residue 24 and contains a marked kink in the vicinity of residues 34–36. This kink, which was also observed in the crystal structure of mLIF (34Robinson R.C. Grey L.M. Staunton D. Vankelecom H. Vernallis A.B. Moreau J.F. Stuart D.I. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 1101-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), is reflected in the backbone amide exchange behavior of the amides (27Smith, D. K. (1996) Structural Studies of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and Its Receptors. PhD. thesis, University of MelbourneGoogle Scholar) 2S. Yao, manuscript in preparation. and the chemical shifts for residues in this region (17Hinds M.G. Maurer T. Zhang J.-G Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The first of the two long interhelical loops, the AB loop, connects the C terminus of the A helix with the N terminus of the B helix. The AB loop contains some elements of secondary structure near its N terminus, with two irregular turns preceding a short helix between residues 55 and 60. This loop is well packed against the helical bundle, with long-range NOEs observed between residues in the loop (Leu56, Leu59, and Cys60) and residues in the A and D helices. There is a very short, well ordered loop linking the B and C helices. The C and D helices are connected by the second long loop. In contrast to the AB loop, the CD loop has no regular secondary structure and is less ordered overall, as judged by the angular order parameters and RMSD values over these residues compared with the AB loop (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows the residue by residue RMSD from the crystal structure of mLIF (34Robinson R.C. Grey L.M. Staunton D. Vankelecom H. Vernallis A.B. Moreau J.F. Stuart D.I. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 1101-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The overall RMSD when the two structures are aligned over the backbone of the common helical bundle residues is 1.55 Å, indicating good agreement. Comparison of the uncertainty in the positions of the atoms as measured by crystallographic B factors in mLIF (Fig. 3 G) with the backbone RMSDs of the solution structure (Fig. 3 D) shows that they follow a similar pattern, emphasizing the similarity between the two structures. The lengths of the four main helices in the solution structure differ slightly from those of the x-ray structure, with the limits for the helices (according to PROCHECK_NMR) being 24–45, 76–104, 108–133, and 154–176 for the A, B, C, and D helices, respectively, compared with 22–48, 76–104, 109–135, and 155–177 in the crystal structure. The short helix involving residues 55–60 is also present in the crystal structure. Analysis of the crystal structure using PROCHECK shows that there is a short antiparallel β-sheet involving residues 10–12 in the N-terminal tail and residues 140–142 in the CD loop, but this is not present in solution. The main differences occur, as expected, in the loop regions. Near the N terminus, Pro17 adopts a trans-conformation in the solution structure of MH35-LIF (17Hinds M.G. Maurer T. Zhang J.-G Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in contrast to thecis-conformation in the crystal structure. The N-terminal eight residues were not observed in the crystal structure due to the lack of order in this region, which is consistent with the lack of long-range NOEs in this region and the sharper NH resonances from the N-terminal residues in two-dimensional HSQC spectra. The other region where differences were evident is the CD loop, especially at its C-terminal end (Fig. 3 F). These differences are close to one of the receptor-binding sites, as discussed below. In mLIF, the AB loop crosses the D helix roughly one-third of the way down its length (34Robinson R.C. Grey L.M. Staunton D. Vankelecom H. Vernallis A.B. Moreau J.F. Stuart D.I. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 1101-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), rather than at its N terminus as in growth hormone. In MH35-LIF, the crossing point is only slightly closer to the N terminus of the D helix than in mLIF. A number of structures have been determined for four-helix bundle cytokines or related molecules by either NMR or x-ray crystallography. Six of these, G-CSF, growth hormone, CNTF, IL-6, leptin, and LIF itself, are in the “long-chain” class of cytokine. The sequence identity among these molecules is low, but they share common structural motifs and similar receptor systems. In particular, LIF, IL-6, and CNTF all share the signal-transducing protein gp130, and this is reflected in at least one common receptor-binding site among this group of cytokines. The solution structure of MH35-LIF is in good agreement with that of mLIF determined by x-ray crystallography (34Robinson R.C. Grey L.M. Staunton D. Vankelecom H. Vernallis A.B. Moreau J.F. Stuart D.I. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 1101-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As well as sharing the overall antiparallel four-helix bundle motif, structural details similar to those determined for MH35-LIF have been observed for G-CSF (35Hill C.P. Osslund T.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), CNTF (36McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), IL-6 (37Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 38Xu G.-Y. Yu H.-A. Hong J. Stahl M. McDonagh T. Kay L.E. Cumming D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and human leptin (39Zhang F. Basinski M.B. Beals J.M. Briggs S.L. Churgay L.M. Clawson D.K. DiMarchi R.D. Furman T.C. Hale J.E. Hsiung H.M. Schoner B.E. Smith D.P. Zhang X.Y. Wery J.-P. Schevitz R.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The A helix has a kink approximately half way along its length, as also found for CNTF, IL-6, and leptin in a similar although not identical position. Although there is no three-dimensional structure available for oncostatin M, differences from chemical shift patterns expected for a purely α-helical conformation have been observed in its A helix (40Hoffman R.C. Moy F.J. Price V. Richardson J. Kaubisch D. Frieden E.A. Krakover J.D. Castner B.J. King J. March C.J. Powers R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 273-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making it likely that this molecule also has a kink here. This structural feature serves to maximize the close contact between the A and C helices (39Zhang F. Basinski M.B. Beals J.M. Briggs S.L. Churgay L.M. Clawson D.K. DiMarchi R.D. Furman T.C. Hale J.E.

Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CNTF, G-CSF, leptin, and mLIF have kinks or bends in their D helices, whereas growth hormone and IL-6 have kinks in their B helices. The AB loop in LIF differs from those in IL-6 and CNTF in that it is relatively well defined in both the solution and crystal structures and it contains two irregular turns preceding a short helix. The AB loop in IL-6 contains only two β-turns, and these occur at the C-terminal end of the loop, whereas the AB loop is poorly ordered in CNTF. In comparison with the AB loop, the CD loop in LIF is not as well defined in the NMR and crystal structures and does not contain any ordered secondary structure. Leptin (39Zhang F. Basinski M.B.

https://openalex.org/W2021403637,"H-kininogen is a multifunctional protein: it inhibits cysteine proteases, plays a role in contact activation of the coagulation cascade, and is the precursor of the potent proinflammatory peptide bradykinin. In the experiments described here, we identify H-kininogen as a ferritin-binding protein. Ferritin is a cellular and serum protein that is elevated in acute and chronic inflammation and many cancers. Despite numerous reports of ferritin-binding protein(s) in human serum, the nature and function of these proteins remain unclear. As a first step in characterizing the interaction between ferritin and its binding protein(s), we devised a ligand blot assay and used it to guide purification of a ferritin-binding protein from human serum. Edman degradation of the purified protein determined the sequence HNLGHGHK(H)ERDQGHG, a sequence with identity to residues 421–436 of human H-kininogen. These results were confirmed by demonstrating that commercially purified H-kininogen possessed ferritin binding activity and that ferritin binding could not be detected in plasma from kininogen-deficient individuals. Ligand blot assays mapped the ferritin binding domain to the light chain of H-kininogen chain, and revealed that both H and L recombinant ferritins possess H-kininogen binding activity. The unexpected identification of H-kininogen as a ferritin-binding protein may link ferritin in the complex chain of interactions by which H-kininogen mediates its multiple effects in contact activation and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2086533520,"The Rel family of transcriptional activators form a large diverse group of proteins that are involved in the activation of genes involved in immunity, development, apoptosis and cancer. So far, none of the rel genes cloned in mammals appear to be required for embryonic development. We have cloned and characterized a cDNA from an embryonic cDNA library that encodes a novelXenopus Rel protein, called Xrel3. Xrel3 is a member of the cRel subfamily and is most closely related to but distinct from otherXenopus Rel members. The expression of Xrel3 mRNA was investigated using Northern analysis, RNase protection assay, reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction and in situhybridization. Messages are present maternally and are slightly enriched in the equatorial region of the blastula stage embryo. At gastrulation, the accumulation of Xrel3 messages declines to undetectable levels but then increases after neurulation. In situ RNA hybridization was used to determine the spatial location of Xrel3 messenger RNA in embryos. Messages are localized to the developing forebrain, dorsal mid-hindbrain region, the inner ear primordium, or otocyst, and in the notochord. Overexpression by microinjection of Xrel3 RNA induced tumors in the developing embryo that appeared after gastrulation. The location of the tumors depended on the location of the injection site. These results suggest that Xrel3 might have a generalized role in regulation of cell differentiation in the embryo. The Rel family of transcriptional activators form a large diverse group of proteins that are involved in the activation of genes involved in immunity, development, apoptosis and cancer. So far, none of the rel genes cloned in mammals appear to be required for embryonic development. We have cloned and characterized a cDNA from an embryonic cDNA library that encodes a novelXenopus Rel protein, called Xrel3. Xrel3 is a member of the cRel subfamily and is most closely related to but distinct from otherXenopus Rel members. The expression of Xrel3 mRNA was investigated using Northern analysis, RNase protection assay, reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction and in situhybridization. Messages are present maternally and are slightly enriched in the equatorial region of the blastula stage embryo. At gastrulation, the accumulation of Xrel3 messages declines to undetectable levels but then increases after neurulation. In situ RNA hybridization was used to determine the spatial location of Xrel3 messenger RNA in embryos. Messages are localized to the developing forebrain, dorsal mid-hindbrain region, the inner ear primordium, or otocyst, and in the notochord. Overexpression by microinjection of Xrel3 RNA induced tumors in the developing embryo that appeared after gastrulation. The location of the tumors depended on the location of the injection site. These results suggest that Xrel3 might have a generalized role in regulation of cell differentiation in the embryo. The Rel family of transcriptional activators is a group of higher eukaryotic proteins that participate in cell differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M.

Science. 1996; 273: 735-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The family includes the c-Rel oncoprotein, RelB, NF-κB (both p65 or RelA, and p50 subunits), and the DORSAL patterning morphogen of Drosophila. They are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and transactivate genes that are involved in the immune response, apoptosis, cancer, and development. Rel transcription complexes exist as homo- or heterodimers, but only specific dimer pairs have been demonstrated in vivo. Although there are different levels of rel gene regulation in different cells, the activity of all of the proteins is determined by their subcellular localization. Thus, Rel proteins are active in the nucleus, but are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive state. Depending on the cell type, Rel complexes activate transcription from target genes in either a constitutive or inducible manner. Inducible complexes are retained in the cytoplasm by a regulatory subunit (1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 2Baeurele P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar, 3Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5581) Google Scholar). Upon induction, the regulatory subunit releases the Rel complex and allows it to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to target DNA sequences. Rel proteins share motifs required for their similar functions. The amino terminus contains the highly conserved Rel Homology Domain (RHD) 1The abbreviations used are: RHD, Rel Homology Domain; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction. of about 300 amino acids, which is required for DNA binding, dimerization with other Rel proteins, and a nuclear localization signal. The remainder of the protein is variable and is necessary for transcriptional activation (8Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In some cases, such as the p50 subunit of NF-κB, the activation domain is absent so that the protein is essentially an RHD. The DORSAL protein of Drosophila is localized to the nuclei of ventral cells that form the embryonic body axis (9Stein D. Roth S. Vogelsang E. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1991; 65: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that DORSAL activates body patterning genes such as twist and snail (6Wasserman S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In mice, Rel/NF-κB activity is detected at the fetal stage and in the developing brain (10Schmidt-Ullrich R. Memet S. Lilienbaum A. Feuillard J. Raphael M. Israel A. Development. 1996; 122: 2117-2128PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient for c-rel andrelB develop defects in their immune systems while NF-κB(p50)-defective mice die of liver failure before birth (for review, see Ref. 11Attar R.M. Caamano J. Carrasco D. Iotsova V. Ishikawa H. Ryseck R.P. Weih F. Bravo R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These fetuses develop apparently normal bodies suggesting that rel genes are not required for embryogenesis. It is possible, however, that redundant pathways exist to compensate for the loss of specific rel gene function. Furthermore, there are likely other undiscovered vertebrate embryonic patterning rel-related genes since homologues totwist and snail are expressed in axis-forming tissues of the postimplantation mouse embryo (12Smith D.E. Del Amo F.F. Gridley T. Development. 1992; 116: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stoetzel C. Weber B. Bourgeois R. Bolcato-Bellemin A.L. Perrin-Schmidt F. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and since humantwist is associated with congenital defects of the mesoderm (14Dixon M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Xenopus homologues of twist (15Hopwood N.D. Pluck A. Gurdon J.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 893-903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) andsnail (16Sargent M.G. Bennett M Development. 1990; 109: 967-973PubMed Google Scholar) are expressed in tissues that form the body axis. None of the Xenopus genes, Xrel2 (17Tannahill D. Wardle F. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar),XrelA (18Bearer E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kao K. Hopwood N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 2697-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Richardson J.C. Garcia-Estrabot A.M. Woodland H.R. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and XrelB (21Suzuki K. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4664-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), have significant spatiotemporal restriction of mRNA expression in embryos. The lack of an embryonic patterning phenotype in Rel-defective mice is paradoxical since both twist and snail homologues are expressed and/or required for correct body patterning in frogs, mice, and humans. In this paper, we identify a new Xenopus rel family member,Xrel3, that is a version of c-rel, but unlike any other rel gene, messenger RNA encoding Xrel3 protein is expressed in two phases of early development. Xrel3 messenger RNA is present in embryos up to the late blastula stage followed by a dramatic decline to undetectable levels at gastrulation. Messages then accumulate in the forebrain and otic placode of neurula-stage embryos and in the dorsal part of the mid-hindbrain, the forebrain, the otocysts, and finally the notochord of tailbud and later stage embryos. This novel expression pattern indicates a new role for relgenes in vertebrate embryonic development. Interestingly, overexpression of Xrel3 mRNA in the animal hemisphere of 2-cell embryos results in the formation of tumors. The size of the tumors is proportional to the dosage of RNA injected, and their position on the embryo depends on the location of injection: epidermal tumors develop from animal pole injection (prospective ectoderm) while tumors in the endoderm (digestive system) develop from vegetal pole injection. Recent evidence indicates that Rel protein overexpression directly causes oncogenesis in mammalian cells. Our results support this observation and suggest that Xrel3 might function in the decision for cells to differentiate or proliferate in the embryo. Hybridization and washing of filters at high stringency were performed as described previously (18Bearer E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs retrieved from library screening were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced on both strands at least twice by the dideoxynucleotide method as described (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52688) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and oligonucleotide primers corresponding to overlapping regions of sequence. Wild-type and albino Xenopus embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization as described (23Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Embryos were raised at room temperature and dissected in normal amphibian medium (24Kao K. Lockwood A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 58: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). RNA from embryos was prepared as described (15Hopwood N.D. Pluck A. Gurdon J.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 893-903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Northern blots and RNase protection assays were performed as described (19Kao K. Hopwood N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 2697-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Krieg P. Melton D. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). For RNase protection assays, anEcoRI-DraI fragment from the entire 5′-nontranslated region of d10 that protects a 210-base pair region inXrel3 was subcloned into pBluescript. As a control, anXrelA probe was added to the hybridization mix, which protected a 229-base pair region (19Kao K. Hopwood N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 2697-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed as described with 32P-ATP trace labeling (24Kao K. Lockwood A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 58: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Melton D Cell. 1994; 77: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and gene-specific primers for Xrel3 (forward primer, 5′-TCCTTGGAGATATTTGTGGGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTTAAACCGGCCATGTTGATG-3′), Vg1 (Ref. 27Rebagliati M.R.

Steinbesser H. DeRobertis E.M. Science. 1994; 263: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cycling parameters were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 26 cycles for Xrel3and Vg1 (19 for histone) with the program: 30 min at 94 °C, 30 min at 62 °C, and 30 min at 72 °C. Reactions were then extended at 72 °C for 5 min. Whole mount in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim) incorporated probes was carried out as described (29Harland, R. (1991) in Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 36, pp. 685–695Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was detected by alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-digoxigenin antibodies using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a chromogenic reagent. Microinjection of embryos was done as described (24Kao K. Lockwood A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 58: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using capped, synthetic Xrel3 mRNA made using the Ribomax kit (Promega). The Xrel3 coding domain was subcloned into the CS2+ expression vector, linearized with EcoRI, and used as a template. Control RNA was made using the D10 cDNA subcloned into CS2+ and linearized with NotI. D10 lacks a significant region (~30 amino acids) of the carboxyl terminus which represents the transcriptional activation domain. We searched for rel genes in Xenopus by screening a neurula stage λ cDNA library (a gift from Dr. H. Sive, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) with XrelA cDNA sequences at high stringency. Several of the largest cross-hybridizing clones were used as templates for RNA probes for whole mount in situhybridization on neurula stage embryos. One of the probes, clone d10, hybridized to embryos in a pattern of interest, localizing to anterior neural structures (see below). When completely sequenced, d10 revealed an open reading frame truncated at the carboxyl terminus. By screening a Xenopus stage 8 λ ZAP library (30Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) at very high stringency with d10, we isolated a larger clone with identical overlapping sequence to d10 (Fig.1). The putative protein generated from translation of this cDNA was most similar to that of Xrel2 and mammalian cRel (Fig. 2, Refs. 31Brownell E. Mittereder N. Rice N. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar and 32Rice N.R. Mackichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The start of translation codon does not appear to be within the context of a typical Kozak consensus, but it predicts a protein size in line with in vitro synthesized protein made from this clone (not shown), putative translation of upstream sequences reveals multiple stops in all three reading frames, and it is in the same position as that of other related Rel family members.Figure 2Comparison of the predicted protein sequence of Xrel3with that of other cRel proteins.

Pos., position number starting at 1 at start of translation; %ID, percent identical amino acids compared with Xrel3. B, amino acid sequence analysis of Xrel3 with other members of the cREL and RELA members indicates its most probable relationship to this branch of the family.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence of Xrel3 is most closely related to Xrel2 at 64% identical amino acids (Fig. 2 A). Within the RHD, the two proteins share 81% identity. Throughout their respective coding regions, there are significant divergent stretches of coding sequence (Fig. 2 A). The acid-rich region in the carboxyl terminus of Xrel3 contains a high level of proline and serine residues, consistent with the proposed role of this region as a transactivation domain (8Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). At the nucleotide level, the sequences between Xrel2 andXrel3 are completely different outside their respective coding regions. To determine the temporal pattern of Xrel3 message accumulation during early embryonic development, we probed Northern blots of total RNA extracted from embryos at various stages. Probes made from d10 cDNA hybridized to a message of about 3 kilobase pairs in length. The signal was present in RNA extracted from pregastrula embryos but declined rapidly at gastrulation (Fig. 3). Because embryonic transcription is considered to begin at the 12th cleavage division (about stage 8, Ref. 33Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, 34Richardson J.C. Gatherer D. Woodland H.R. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we expect that the early accumulation of Xrel3 mRNA must be maternal in origin. Limited hybridization was observed in later stages, but the resolution was poor on our Northern analyses, perhaps due to increasing genomic DNA levels in our preparations that caused the signal to smear. The more sensitive RNase protection assay using an RNA probe made from a unique 5′-untranslated sequence of Xrel3 confirmed its later expression. The probe protected a single fragment of the expected 229 nucleotide size upon digestion of hybrids with RNase A and RNase T1 (Fig. 4). These assays confirmed the presence of message in pregastrula embryos. The message level drops significantly during gastrulation (stages 10 and 11) to nil but then increases once again during late neurula through to the early tadpole stage (stage 33). Probes made against XrelA (19Kao K. Hopwood N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 2697-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whose RNA is present throughout development, were added to the hybridization mix to determine the levels of Xrel3 mRNA relative to this known message. Comparison of the mRNA levels between these two genes indicates that the maximal level of Xrel3 mRNA is about one-third that of XrelA mRNA. In previous studies with XrelA (19Kao K. Hopwood N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 2697-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Xrel2 (17Tannahill D. Wardle F. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar),in situ hybridization of mRNA was not performed because dissected embryo pieces showed roughly equivalent distribution throughout the embryo. Our original strategy for obtaining Xrel3 was based on screening according to spatial restriction of mRNA expression. In this sense, Xrel3 represents a distinctly different gene from other Xenopus rel genes. The whole mount analysis was extended to a range of stages to determine more finely the progression of mRNA localization during development. Early cleavage embryos show digoxigenin staining in all cells (Fig. 5 A). As expected, late gastrula stage embryos do not stain for digoxigenin, confirming the low level or absence of message at these stages (Fig.5 B). Postgastrula embryos earlier than stage 23 did not stain using our probes even though RNase protection assays indicated presence of message, albeit at a low level prior to this stage. This may be due to differences in detection sensitivity between the two methods. Also, RNA equivalent to five embryos was used in the protection assays, greatly increasing the potential number of transcripts in the assay compared with in situ analysis. At about stage 23, message accumulation appears in the forebrain and in a small region adjacent to the mid-brain/hindbrain junction (Fig.5 C). We believe this latter staining to correspond to the prospective ear vesicle, or otocyst, based on its anatomical position, and because in later stages (30+), the otocyst is clearly labeled, along with the forebrain, the dorsal part of the mid- and hindbrain, and the notochord (Fig. 5 D). Accumulation of messages in the notochord progresses gradually with staining absent in stage 30 embryos but is apparent in embryos a few hours older (Fig. 5 E). Probes made from sense templates do not stain embryos, further confirming the specificity of our probe (Fig. 5 F). Whole mount RNA analysis of pregastrula embryos is relatively unreliable due to significant amounts of yolk that may hinder the hybridization and staining process. To confirm expression in blastula-stage embryos, we applied RT-PCR analysis using oligonucleotide primers specific to Xrel3 mRNA on total RNA extracted from dissected blastulae. PCR of RNA alone did not amplify a product, indicating that the products we observed were not due to genomic DNA. Our analysis confirmed the in situ, Northern, and RNase protection assays, showing amplification of Xrel3 cDNA in pregastrula and postneurula embryos, with a decline in expression during gastrulation (Fig. 6 A). Animal, vegetal, and equatorial zones all express Xrel3 mRNA in stage 8 blastulae, indicating that it is present all along the animal-vegetal axis (Fig. 6 B). There is a modest (2–3-fold) increase in Xrel3 mRNA accumulation in the equatorial zone as compared with the vegetal and animal zones (Fig. 6 B), based on laser densitometric analysis normalized using histone mRNA levels. Microinjection of up to 500 pg of Xrel3 synthetic mRNA into the animal or vegetal pole did not prevent embryos from gastrulating normally. However, after gastrulation, the embryos develop abnormal growths or tumors whose location and size depend on the site of injection. Tumors (Fig.7, arrowheads) generally develop in the epidermis from animal pole injection (Fig. 7,A-D). They appear at the neurula stage first as a patch of pigmented tissue on the ventral side (Fig. 7 A), and the region quickly enlarges into a tumor (Fig. 7 B,arrowhead). Abnormal head and facial development is also associated with animal pole injection, as might be expected since these structures also develop from animal cells (data not shown). In some cases, the tumors are so large, they inhibit normal development of, for instance, anterior (Fig. 7 E, a) head structures. Injection into the vegetal pole or endoderm (prospective digestive system) also caused tumor formation, but these tumors were below the surface of the embryo after having been covered over by ectoderm during gastrulation (Fig. 7 E). Control embryos injected with 1 ng of a nonfunctional truncated Xrel3 message develop normally (Fig.7 F). The size of tumors also correlated with the dose of injection. The minimum concentration that gave any indication of tumor formation was 100 pg. At this dosage, only a small percentage of embryos developed tumors (8%, n = 88), and these appeared only in the epidermis, covering less than 1% of the surface of the embryo in the ventral region. At 200 or 300 pg, the tumors were larger, covering about 5–10% of the embryo surface (Fig. 7 D) and appeared in every embryo injected (n = 121). Many tumors (n = 82) appeared in the anterior ventral epidermis (Fig. 7 D, lower two embryos), and the remainder appeared on the head (n = 20) or ventral posterior epidermis (n = 9). At 500 pg, the tumors appeared in every embryo examined (n = 255) and covered most of the ventral epidermis (Fig. 7 A). The tumors that form are very large and typically interfere with the development of normal axial tissues when examined histologically. We have identified a novel rel gene, Xrel3, whose RNA is expressed in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. The Xrel3 predicted protein is most similar to the previously identified Xrel2 protein. The differences in nucleotide sequences outside their respective coding regions suggest that Xrel3and Xrel2are two separate genes with different regulatory regions. At the protein level, in the most highly conserved amino-terminal RHD, Xrel2 has a unique insert very close to the start of translation (Fig.2 A, positions 5–22), whereas at positions 37 to 58 of Xrel3 (Fig. 2 A), there is a stretch of residues that are only found in Xrel3 and not shared by any other Rel member. These two regions span the putative DNA binding and dimerization domain. These differences suggest that Xrel3 and Xrel2 might dimerize with different partners to form a transcription complex, and/or they bind to different DNA targets. Outside of the RHD, Xrel2 and Xrel3 also vary considerably in amino acid residue sequence. There are numerous substitutions with a large stretch of unique residues spanning positions 434 to 474 of Xrel3 corresponding to the predicted transcriptional activation domain of Rel proteins (9Stein D. Roth S. Vogelsang E. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1991; 65: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, the combination of nucleotide and amino acid differences indicates thatXrel3 and Xrel2 are distinct genes. The mRNA expression data also indicates that Xrel3 is distinct from other Xenopus genes. Xrel3 mRNA is expressed in all cells maternally but is restricted to anterior neural structures after gastrulation. The DORSAL morphogen ofDrosophila shows limited spatio-temporal expression during development. Although its RNA and protein are present throughout the entire embryo, DORSAL protein is localized only to ventral nuclei of early Drosophila embryos (8Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). XrelA protein may also be localized to nuclei of blastula and neurula embryos but not gastrula stage embryos (18Bearer E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar). This observation correlates with the temporal expression pattern of Xrel3 mRNA, and it will be interesting to determine the interaction between XrelA and Xrel3. We are presently raising antibodies against Xrel3 to determine if, like Dorsal and XrelA, it is localized to nuclei of specific structures of the embryo. The formation of tumors by Xrel3 overexpression provides a convenient model to study mechanisms of neoplasia. Similar tumors can be induced by overexpression of Gli1 (35Dahmane N. Lee J. Robins P. Heller P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Nature. 1997; 389: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), a zinc-finger transcription factor that is also involved in neural differentiation inXenopus (36Lee J. Platt K.A. Censullo P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Development. 1997; 124: 2537-2552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is up-regulated in human basal cell carcinoma (35Dahmane N. Lee J. Robins P. Heller P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Nature. 1997; 389: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We are presently testing whether Xrel3 up-regulates Gli1, but there is no precendent linking Gli andrel gene activity. The effectiveness of tumor induction by Xrel3 mRNA, however, is much greater than that of Gli1 since much lower doses of Xrel3 (200–500 pg) as compared with Gli1 mRNA (2000 pg, Ref. 35Dahmane N. Lee J. Robins P. Heller P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Nature. 1997; 389: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), induce much larger tumors. Also, Xrel3 mRNA induced tumors when it was injected into the vegetal pole (prospective digestive system), suggesting that it may have a more generalized role in tumor formation. Rel protein overexpression also has been shown to be associated with or directly cause mammalian tumors. For instance, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase p210BCR-ABL is involved in leukemia and activates the p65 subunit of NF-κB (RelA) in leukemic cells (37Hamdane M. David-Cordonnier M-H. D'Halluin J.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A constitutively active form of NF-κB (Lyt-10) causes tumors to form in murine fibroblasts (38Ciana P. Neri A. Cappellini C. Cavallo F. Pomati M. Chang C-C. Maiolo A.T. Lombardi L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1805-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and RelA expression is significantly up-regulated and required for the transformed phenotype of thyroid carcinoma cell lines (39Visconti R. Cerutti J. Battista S. Fedele M. Trapasso F. Zeki K. Miano M.P. deNigris F. Casalino L. Curcio F. Santoro M. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our results are not inconsistent with these observations. However, tumor formation by Xrel3 overexpression in embryos is likely similar to the formation of teratocarcinomas, which result from prevention of differentiation. In this sense, our results indicate that Xrel3 may be involved in regulation of the decision for embryonic cells to undergo differentiation. Finally, if we hypothesize that Xrel3 is involved in regulating differentiation, then perhaps its role in selected tissues in which it is expressed normally is to allow limited proliferation of those tissues before they differentiate. This hypothesis is consistent with Xrel3 mRNA expression in the pregastrula embryo when it is undergoing cleavage. In any case, the formation of tumors by Xrel3 overexpression in embryos provides a useful model to study the earliest steps in neoplastic transformation.

Since growth stimuli evoke its preferential association with chromatin and nuclear matrix, we examined the dynamics of CK2 in nucleosomes fractionated on the basis of their transcriptional activity in the rat prostate. In this model, androgens induce expression of androgen-dependent genes but inhibit the androgen-repressed genes, whereas absence of androgens has the reverse effect. The level of CK2 was higher in the active than in inactive nucleosomes from normal prostate. Differential alterations in the levels of CK2 activity in the transcriptionally activeversus inactive nucleosomes were evoked by androgen deprivation or administration. Comparison of the distribution of CK2 in active and inactive nucleosomes under varying androgenic conditions showed that the relative CK2 activity intrinsic to the transcriptionally active nucleosomes remained fairly stable, concordant with gene activity specific to the androgenic status. However, CK2 associated with inactive nucleosomes declined to a minimal level on androgen deprivation but increased rapidly on androgen administration (reflecting expression of multiple androgen-dependent genes). We suggest a role for CK2 in promoting the conformational transition of inactive nucleosomes to the active form and in the function of transcriptionally active nucleosomes.

(formerly known as casein kinase 2 or II) is a ubiquitous protein serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, including growth control and proliferation. The enzyme is a tetramer consisting of α, α′, and β subunits (42, 38, and 28 kDa, respectively) with the possible α2β2, αα′β2, or α′α′β2 configuration. There appear to be several substrates for CK2 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Among the putative nuclear substrates are RNA polymerases, topoisomerase II, protein B23, nucleolin, SV40 large T antigen, certain protooncogene products, and growth factors, as well as certain chromosomal nonhistone proteins (1Pinna L.A.

The involvement of CK2 in phosphorylation of these growth-related proteins has provided additional support for its role in growth control. CK2 appears to be dynamically regulated with respect to its nuclear localization (7Tawfic S. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell.

The association of CK2 with these compartments is modulated in response to growth stimuli (7Tawfic S. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell.

Nuclear matrix, the structural framework that represents residual components of the nuclear lamina-pore complex, nucleoli, and fibrogranular internal matrix, is believed to play a fundamental role in chromatin organization, regulation of gene activity, and cell proliferation (13Berezney R.

The transcriptional machinery resides in chromatin, and the nucleosome is its repeating subunit structure. As might be expected, nucleosomes appear to undergo dynamic conformational transition from inactive to active forms under specific conditions (for reviews see Refs. 18Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 1-213Google Scholar and 19Beato M. SaÖnchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes can be fractionated on the basis of their conformation, as reflected by the accessibility of thiol groups in the histone H3 (20Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,21Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S.Y. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure has been successfully employed to fractionate nucleosomes from yeast, 3T3, HeLa S3, COLO 320, and rat liver cells (20Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S.Y. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the dynamic association of CK2 with the nuclear matrix and chromatin (9Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4426-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24615-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to examine the role CK2 plays in the nucleosomes in relation to their transcriptional activity by employing the experimental model of androgenic regulation of the prostate. Withdrawal of androgen from adult rats results in apoptosis in the prostate epithelial cells, whereas androgen administration to castrated rats evokes a regrowth of the gland with activation of genomic activity within 1–4 h (22Williams-Ashman H.G. DeGroot L., J. Cahill Jr., G.G. Martini L. Nelson D.H. Odell W.D. Potts Jr., J.T. Steinberger E. Winegard A.I. Endocrinology.

Kokontis J. Sai T. Hiipakka R.A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of this model is that during regression of the gland (and overall cessation of the androgen-dependent gene activity), certain genes called androgen-repressed genes (e.g.clusterin) are activated. On the other hand, androgenic stimulation evokes early expression of genes such as C3 and, over time, of a large number of prostatic androgen-dependent genes, whereas the androgen-repressed genes are suppressed (25Saltzman A.G. Hiipakka R.A. Chang C. Liao S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 432-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Leger J.G. Montpetit M.L. Tenniswood M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These markers can thus be used to differentiate the type of nucleosomes isolated from prostatic tissue under varied androgenic conditions. We have used this paradigm previously to demonstrate that CK2 is preferentially associated with the chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions isolated from purified nuclei and that this association is dynamically regulated in a spatiotemporal manner in response to altered androgenic status (7Tawfic S. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 165-171Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar,9Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have documented that CK2 is associated to a greater extent with the transcriptionally active than the inactive nucleosomes. However, androgenic alterations in the transcriptional activity of the prostate evoke a differential regulation of CK2 associated with the active and inactive nucleosomes suggesting a possible role for CK2 in nucleosome organization and function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 295–325 g (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were used as the source of ventral prostate or liver. The animals were maintained under standard conditions and were orchiectomized via the scrotal route under Metofane anesthesia as described previously (9Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4426-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For restoration of androgens, animals were injected with 5α-DHT in sesame oil (1 mg/100 g of body weight); control animals received an appropriate volume of the vehicle alone. Synthetic dodecapeptide substrate (Arg-Arg-Arg-Ala-Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp) for assay of CK2 activity was purchased from Peptide Technologies Corp. (Gaithersburg, MD). Affi-Gel 501 was purchased from Bio-Rad. Micrococcal nuclease was supplied by Worthington. Mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the last 262 amino acids of the C-terminal end of the CK2-α was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). All reagents were of the highest purity available. Nuclei were isolated from pooled ventral prostate tissue (15 prostate glands from normal, 15 from 2-day castrated, or 45 from 6-day castrated rats) or from liver as described previously (9Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4426-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24615-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 5 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm EPNP, and 0.5 mm PMSF were included throughout the preparative procedure. DNA content was assessed by measuring the A 260 or by the Burton method (28Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10840) Google Scholar), as appropriate. Nucleosomes were isolated from purified nuclei by adapting previously described procedures (20Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S.Y. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified nuclei were suspended at a concentration of 1 mg of DNA/ml in buffer A (consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mmKCl, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm EPNP, and 0.5 mm PMSF). This suspension was warmed at 37 °C for 2 min followed by addition of micrococcal nuclease at a final concentration of 10 units/ml. The nuclease digestion was carried out for 5 min at 37 °C and was terminated by the addition of 0.2 m EGTA, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 2 mm. These conditions were established so as to strictly ensure that 10–11% of the DNA was digested. After the tubes stood on ice for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant phase containing the released nucleosomes was collected. The supernatant fraction was treated with 0.2 m EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. The sample was then loaded onto an organomercurial agarose column (Affi-Gel 501) equilibrated with buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm EPNP, and 0.5 mm PMSF). To remove the unbound nucleosomes, the column was eluted at a flow rate of 20 ml/h with buffer B until A 260 reached the base line. This fraction represented the transcriptionally inactive nucleosomes. The organomercurial-bound nucleosomes were then eluted with buffer C (buffer B with 0.5 m NaCl). Column fractions were monitored for A 260 to identify the peak. Fractions corresponding to the peak were pooled. Finally, elution with buffer C containing 10 mm DTT was used to isolate the bulk of transcriptionally active nucleosomes. The pooled fractions from various peaks were concentrated with the aid of a Centricon 10 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and then washed twice with 10 volumes of TMED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.9) containing 0.2m NaCl. The final protein and DNA concentration were determined as described previously (28Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10840) Google Scholar, 29Ahmed R.L. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 237: 76-79Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Sephacryl S-300 Superfine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column chromatography was carried out to determine if there was a contamination of free CK2 in the nucleosomal preparations. The resin was equilibrated in buffer B in a 0.9 × 12 cm column, and the nucleosomal sample was loaded in a volume of 200 μl in buffer B. The elution was carried out with buffer B at a flow rate of 8 ml/h, and 2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed forA 260 and CK2 activity. Assay of CK2 activity in various nucleosomal preparations was carried out by employing a synthetic dodecapeptide (30Marin O. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The reaction medium consisted of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 50 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm dodecapeptide substrate, 0.05 mm[γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity 3 × 106 dpm/nmol of ATP). The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme source (e.g. various nucleosome preparations). A paper-binding method was used to assay the32P incorporated into the dodecapeptide substrate (9Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4426-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol.

All assays of CK2 were carried out in triplicate over a time course to ensure the linearity of the reaction. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Immunoblot for the CK2-α was carried out by standard procedures. In brief, nucleosomal protein (20 μg) was subjected to electrophoretic separation on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and urea. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet and treated with the mouse monoclonal IgM anti-CK2-α antibody. The second antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM polyclonal from Boehringer Mannheim. Antibody was detected using the standard nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate method for color development (10Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24615-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the prostatic transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes, the DNA in various preparations was probed with cDNAs for C3 and clusterin genes, as these genes are expressed in a testosterone-dependent or testosterone-repressed manner, respectively. DNA was prepared from nucleosomes by following standard purification procedures. Briefly, nucleosomes were digested with 50 μg/ml RNase A (DNase-free) at 37 °C for 30 min. After SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), the samples were digested with 100 μg/ml Proteinase K (DNase-free) at 37 °C for 2 h and then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform. The DNA was precipitated by the addition of 50% isopropyl alcohol, 2.0m ammonium acetate (final concentrations) at −20 °C overnight, and the pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and air-dried prior to being dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). Genomic DNA was also isolated by using a kit (Puregene, Minneapolis, MN). The DNA concentration was measured by the Burton method (28Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10840) Google Scholar). A sample of DNA (20 μg) was slot-blotted onto Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and used for hybridization with C3 and clusterin probes. The C3 cDNA probe used is a 150-base pair PstI fragment from pA34 (received from Dr. Malcolm Parker, London), and the clusterin probe is a 1560-base pair EcoRI fragment from pGEMB4 (received from Dr. Martin Tenniswood through Dr. Mark Rosenberg, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by the random priming method. The blotted membranes were incubated overnight with the radiolabeled probes in a standard hybridization buffer at room temperature, washed under high stringency conditions at 50 °C, and exposed on Kodak BioMax MR film for 12 days. Fig. 1 shows the chromatographic profile of the active and inactive nucleosomes isolated from rat ventral prostate nuclei by utilizing the Affi-Gel 501 column fractionation. The first peak (flow-through) represents the transcriptionally inactive nucleosomes, whereas the second large peak represents the transcriptionally active nucleosomes eluted with 10 mm DTT (Fig. 1). Unlike the previous experience (20Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S.Y. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), elution with 0.5 m NaCl yielded only a negligible peak and was not investigated further. A somewhat larger peak was observed with NaCl elution for liver nucleosomes (result not shown). Theinset shows analysis of the DNA pattern of the fractionated nucleosomes as determined by electrophoretic separation of DNA on a 1.6% agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining. As expected from previous observations (20Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S.Y. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inactive and active nucleosomes yielded a similar profile. Because our studies involved analyses of the prostatic tissue from rats subjected to altered androgenic status, we also established that isolation profiles of the inactive and active nucleosomes were similar from animals castrated for 48 or 144 h, or 144 h and then treated with 5α-DHT for 4 h (not shown). The transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes from normal and 48-h castrated rats were characterized by probing for sequence abundance of C3 (Fig. 2 A) and clusterin (Fig. 2 B) genes. As shown, clusterin gene sequences were detected on the inactive nucleosomes from normal rats and on the active nucleosomes from castrated rats. The C3 gene sequences were detected only on the active nucleosomes of normal rat prostate and on the inactive nucleosomes from castrated rats. Thus, the nucleosome preparations from prostatic tissue of rats under different androgenic conditions (i.e. with varied gene activities) reflect tissue-specific characteristics of transcriptional activity. In previous work, we have shown the translocation of CK2 to the chromatin of rat prostate in response to androgenic stimulus (9Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4426-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to examine the nature of CK2 association with the transcriptionally inactive and active nucleosomes isolated from rat prostate. As expected, the amount of DNA in the inactive nucleosome fraction was 2–3 times greater than that in the active nucleosomes. Associated CK2 activity was detected in nucleosomes (inactive as well as active) isolated from normal prostate and liver (TableI), but a severalfold greater amount of CK2 was present in the transcriptionally active than in the inactive nucleosomes. The results are similar when calculated per unit of the DNA or protein in each nucleosome preparation.Table IDistribution of DNA and protein kinase CK2 activity in transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes isolated from rat liver and ventral prostateTissueNucleosome fractionTotal DNACK2 activityCK2 activityμgtotal unitsunits/mg DNALiverInactive150 ± 62.10 ± 0.2613.9 ± 1.7Active70 ± 75.68 ± 0.4681.3 ± 6.6ProstateInactive197 ± 252.41 ± 0.2512.3 ± 1.3Active75 ± 83.22 ± 0.2342.8 ± 3.0Transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes were isolated from rat liver nuclei (equivalent to 2.4 mg of DNA) and ventral prostate nuclei (equivalent to 2.9 mg of DNA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of CK2 in each fraction was determined using the specific peptide substrate.

Open table in a new tab Transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes were isolated from rat liver nuclei (equivalent to 2.4 mg of DNA) and ventral prostate nuclei (equivalent to 2.9 mg of DNA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of CK2 in each fraction was determined using the specific peptide substrate. CK2 activity units are defined as micromoles of 32P/h. The CK2 activity (total units) refers to the total units in the nucleosomal fraction. The data are based on three experiments and are expressed as means ± S.D. Control experiments were undertaken to establish that CK2 activity measured in the inactive and active nucleosomes did not reflect artifacts due to the presence of free CK2 (i.e. that which may not be intrinsic to the inactive and active nucleosomes). First, a purified sample of CK2 was subjected to column chromatography identical to that for nucleosome fractionation. The results in Fig.3 A show that part of this CK2 was eluted in the flow-through fraction (peak a) and that the remaining activity was eluted by 0.5 m NaCl (peak b); the activity corresponding to the peak eluted by DTT (peak c) was negligible. This result would suggest that if free CK2 were present in the unfractionated nucleosomal preparation, it would not be eluted with the active nucleosome fraction (eluted by DTT). However, CK2 measured in the inactive nucleosome fraction would be unreliable if free CK2 were present in the sample prior to fractionation. To address the above issue, we subjected the unfractionated nucleosomal preparation to Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. Any free CK2 released during the deoxyribonuclease treatment of nuclei (maximal 11% digestion of DNA) would be separated from the nucleosomes by the method. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the elution profile indicates a single sharp peak of CK2 activity which corresponds precisely to the nucleosomal peak. The total CK2 activity associated with these nucleosomes prior to chromatography was 13.2 ± 0.3 units and that recovered in the nucleosomal peak was 13.6 ± 0.3 units. This indicates an absence of free CK2 in the nucleosomal preparations that were employed to isolate inactive and active nucleosomes. A comparison of the recovery of protein, DNA, and CK2 activity in the inactive and active nucleosomes on Affi-Gel 501 column chromatography of representative samples, with and without prior Sephacryl S-300 chromatography, gave identical results (not shown). Thus, the CK2 activity measured in the isolated active and inactive nucleosome fractions represents the activity intrinsic to these fractions. On androgen deprivation, the CK2 activity in the inactive nucleosomes declined precipitously so that compared with the control values it was reduced by 94 and 98% at 48 and 144 h post-orchiectomy, respectively (TableII). The active nucleosomes under these conditions also showed a decline in associated CK2; however, this decline was of a relatively smaller magnitude, being on average 78 and 87% at 48 and 144 h post-orchiectomy, respectively. The persistence of CK2 in the transcriptionally active nucleosomes may reflect ongoing activity related to expression of androgen-repressed genes such as clusterin after androgen deprivation (25Saltzman A.G.

Our results confirm the doubts raised about monophyletic origin of the Mollusca, which was first observed using SSU rRNA as a molecular marker. Nonvertebrate Hbs occur episodically in most but not all nonvertebrate phyla and exhibit a much greater variability in their primary and quaternary structures and in their functional properties than their vertebrate counterparts (1Vinogradov S.

Within this structural/functional variability, two major groups can be distinguished: (i) intracellular (myoglobin-like) hemoproteins that occur in tissues and function as oxygen storage molecules and (ii) intra- or extracellular (hemoglobin-like) hemoproteins that transport oxygen between tissues. Intracellular globins mainly have lowM r values, whereas the extracellular Hb of nonvertebrates show a wide variety of M r values. Their extracellular location makes a high M radvantageous in minimizing loss by excretion. A highM r has been achieved by different routes, exemplified in Annelida by the aggregation of many lowM r chains into a functional Hb or, as proposed for some Mollusca and Arthropoda, by duplication of the lowM r chains into polymeric globins. Despite this variability, there is compelling evidence that all globins are derived from a common ancestor that consists of a polypeptide chain of ~150 amino acids displaying the “globin fold” (4Lewin R.

Open table in a new tab The gene encoding the ancestral globin chain is assumed to be interrupted by three introns inserted in the B (B12.2), E (E15.0), and G (G7.0) helix, as in plant legHbs. However, the conservation of this intron pattern and the exact insertion positions of the introns during evolution is a matter of ongoing debate. These features may reflect the ancestral configuration (that may be masked by subsequent intron removal and/or displacement exemplifying the introns early hypothesis), new insertion events (introns late hypothesis), or a combination of all these (7Stoltzfus A.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 135: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Intron location and sequence may also shed light on the origin of polymeric globin genes occurring in molluscs and arthropods (12Jellie A.M. Tate W.P. Trotman C.N.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Globin and SSU rRNA sequences are commonly used to trace molecular evolution and phylogeny (13Hillis D.M. Dixon M.T. Q. Rev. Biol. 1991; 66: 411-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar, 14Woese C.R. Selander R.K. Clark A.G. Whittam Evolution at the Molecular Level.

Evol. 1988; 27: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The origin of molluscs as well as the phylogenetic relationships between the molluscan classes remain controversial. Recent molecular studies, using SSU rRNA as a parameter, failed to provide unambiguous results and suggest that Mollusca may not be a monophyletic group (e.g. Refs. 16Winnepenninckx B. Backeljau T. De Wachter R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 1306-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and 17Norén M. Jondelius U. Nature. 1997; 390: 31-32Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The gastropod mollusc, Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni, contains an extracellular Hb in its hemolymph. This Hb has aM r 1.75 106 and pI 4.6 (18Almeida A.P. Neves A.G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 371: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and is composed of multidomain globin chains of M r~180,000 with a minimum M r of 17,700 per iron atom (19Arndt, M. H. L., Naves, C. F., and Santoro, M. M. (1996) XI International Conference on Supramolecular Organization and Functional Regulation of Invertebrate Dioxygen Binding Proteins, Padova, Italy, July 1–5, 1996, Abstr. A2, University of PadovaGoogle Scholar). It is a glycoprotein containing 2 mol of hexoses (mannose, galactose, and fucose) and 1 mol of glucosamine perM r 17,700 (20Afonso A.M.M. Santoro M.M. Neves A.G.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 67B: 143-146Google Scholar). Mbs are well characterized in several molluscs (1Vinogradov S. Walz D. Pohajdak B. Moens L. Kapp O.H. Suzuki T. Trotman C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106B: 1-26Google Scholar). However, the presence of a Mb-like molecule inB. glabrata tissue has not been reported. We here describe the structure of B. glabrata Mb and its coding gene, use it to study intron evolution as well as the origin and phylogeny of the Mollusca, and report its oxygen binding characteristics. The snails, B. glabrata, were kindly donated and identified by Dr. CecıÖlia Pereira de Souza from Instituto René Rachou (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz) and were maintained in glass aquariums. A B. glabrata neural tissue cDNA library in λZAP, as well as a partial cDNA sequence of a putative myoglobin clone (RBGDA16T981) was provided by BRI and TIGR, respectively. A specific 5′ forward 20-mer BIO1 (5′-TACTGTCACACAACCAGCCC-3′) was designed upstream of the start codon based on that sequence information. The library was screened for a full-length myoglobin cDNA clone by PCR using the BIO1 primer and either the M13/pUC universal left or universal right primer. One μl of the cDNA library was added to a 50-μl PCR reaction mix (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase) containing 100 ng of each primer. The PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified product was purified and subcloned in pBluescript KS. Recombinants were confirmed by PCR and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. A 3′ reverse 20-mer BIO2 (5′-GAGTTGGACAGGATCCGTGG-3′) was designed downstream of the stop codon based on the obtained cDNA sequence. After identification and sequencing the B. glabrata Mb at the cDNA level, the expressed protein was localized in the radular tissue and extracted. Freshly collected radulas from B. glabrata were homogenized in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl. The protease inhibitors phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, iodoacetamide, EDTA, and pepstatin A were used to the following final concentrations: 1 mm, 100 μm, 50 μm, 5 mm, and 1 μm, respectively. Sodium nitrite was added to 0.8% final concentration in order to convert the Mb to metmyoglobin, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. After centrifugation, this sample was applied to a Superose 12 HR gel filtration column (0.5-cm diameter; 25-cm length) and eluted in the same buffer used for homogenization. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and monitored at 415 and 280 nm. Sample homogeneity was tested by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The purified protein was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C4 column developed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN. Some of the peptides were sequenced in an ABI 471-B sequencer operated as recommended by the manufacturer. The circular dichroism was conducted in a JASCO J20 spectropolarimeter with a constant flux of ultrapure N2 (White Martins). The myoglobin sample at 0.117 mg/ml in phosphate buffer 100 mm pH 7.0 was used in a 0.01-cm quartz cuvette. The spectropolarimeter was calibrated with respect to wavelength and signal amplitude using D-10 camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 and 192.5 nm and d-pantolactone at 219 nm (22Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 23Konno T. Meguro H. Tuzimura K. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 67: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The data were converted to a residual molecular ellipticity and analyzed using the software Dicroprot version 2.3d using the Varselec procedure to evaluate the secondary structure content of this myoglobin (24Deleage, G. (1995) Dicroprot, Version 2.3d, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protines, Lyon, FranceGoogle Scholar, 25Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). All spectra from the data bank of the program were used as reference for the calculations. The myoglobin concentration was estimated by absorbance at 278 nm using the extinction coefficient of Aplysia kurodai myoglobin (33.6 cm−1·mm−1) and by the Lowry method, giving similar results (26Shikama K. Suzuki T. Sugawara Y. Katagiri T. Takagi T. Hatano Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 138-141Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Mb used for oxygen equilibrium measurements was reduced by dialysis at 5 °C against O2-free, N2- and CO-equilibrated 0.01m HEPES buffer, pH 7.68, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.1% sodium dithionite and further dialyzed against the same buffer in the absence of sodium dithionite. It was then concentrated by centrifugation in Ultrafree-MC Millipore tubes with 10,000 NMWL filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Oxygen equilibria were measured using a modified diffusion chamber, where absorption of ultrathin layers of the Mb solution are recorded continuously during stepwise increases in the oxygen tension of equilibration gases supplied by cascaded Woesthoff pumps for mixing pure (>99.998%) nitrogen, oxygen, and air (3Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This procedure showed high reproducibility (P 50 = 4.73 ± 0.04, n = 6, for stripped human Hb at 25 °C and pH 7.4) (29Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Values of P 50 andn 50 were interpolated from Hill plots. Genomic DNA was isolated from muscle tissue of B. glabrata by theN-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammoniumbromide method (30Winnepenninckx B. Backeljau T. De Wachter R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 409Google Scholar) and used as template in an asymmetric PCR reaction usingTaq extender (Stratagene) with the primers BIO1 and BIO2. The first 10 cycles were carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 5 min in the presence of the BIO2 primer only, and then BIO1 primer was added and another 25 cycles were carried out. Positively amplified products were purified and cloned in the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Genomic DNA was digested separately withPstI and HindIII. Restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and denatured DNA was transferred to a Hybond N membrane (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After immobilizing by ultraviolet irradiation and prehybridization (in 40% formamide, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's, 0.9 m NaCl) at 42 °C for 3–4 h, the filter was hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same prehybridization mixture with the denatured probe added. A genomic PCR fragment from the Mb of B. glabrata 32P-labeled by nick translation was used as a probe. The filter was washed subsequently at 65 °C, 1 × 15 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1 × 15 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 2 × 15 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to autoradiography for 4 h at −70 °C. SSU rRNA sequences of species related to those for which globin sequences are available were taken from the Van de Peer et al. (32Van de Peer Y. Nicolaı¨ S. De Rijk P. De Wachter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 86-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) alignment. Globin sequences were aligned according to the nonvertebrate globin template (6Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Van de Peer Y. Peeters K. Kapp O. Czelusniak J. Goodman M. Blaxter M. Vinogradov S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the basis of globin and SSU rRNA sequences, neighbor-joining (33Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and maximum parsimony trees were constructed, using the computer programs TREECON (34Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar) and PAUP (35Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, Version 3.1. Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar), respectively. For SSU rRNA data, neighbor-joining trees were derived on the basis of distance matrices calculated using the formula of Jukes and Cantor (36Jukes T.H. Cantor C.R. Munro H.N. Mammalian Protein Metabolism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969: 21-132Crossref Google Scholar). Gaps were not taken into account. For globin amino acid sequences, neighbor-joining trees were derived on the basis of distance matrices calculated using the formula of Poisson as implemented in TREECON without taking gaps into account. Maximum parsimony trees of both globin amino acid and SSU rRNA sequences were constructed using the heuristic search option, with the tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping option invoked. Gaps and phylogenetically uninformative sites were excluded from the maximum parsimony analyses. The confidence of neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony trees was tested by bootstrap analyses, running 1000 replicates. According to Hillis and Bull (37Hillis D.M. Bull J.J. Syst. Biol. 1993; 42: 182-192Crossref Scopus (3758) Google Scholar), nodes are considered to be reliable if they have a bootstrap value of at least 70%. A B. glabrata cDNA library was used as template in a PCR with primer BIO1 and vector-derived primers. A full-length cDNA fragment of ~1500 base pairs was amplified, subcloned, and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). The initiation codon is preceded by an incomplete untranslated region of 45 base pairs. Nevertheless, the absence of a leader sequence is obvious. This classifies the encoded protein as intracellular. The open reading frame extends for 148 codons and is followed by an exceptionally long (970-base pair) 3′-untranslated region. A normal polyadenylation signal is present. The cDNA translated amino acid sequence can be aligned unambiguously with globins with known tertiary structure, including those from three molluscan species (Scapharca inaequivalvis I, Aplysia limacina, and Lucina pectinata I), using the nonvertebrate globin template (6Moens L.

The alignment is confirmed by (i) the exclusion of polar residues from 33 invariant nonpolar sites listed in Lesh and Chothia (43Lesh A. Chothia C. J. Mol.

This results in a low total penalty score for the sequence presented (TableII) and confirms the globin nature of the protein (6Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Van de Peer Y. Peeters K. Kapp O. Czelusniak J.

As shown by the low penalty score for each motif, the presence of all the standard helical segments including a short D-helix can be accepted. Deviations of the standard pattern can be localized in the E-helix (penalty score: 1.7). This is mainly due to the presence of the hydrophobic Ile at external position E5 and of Val residues at positions E8 and E10, where normally a larger side chain is observed. The alignment of Fig. 2 was extended with 29 other molluscan globin sequences, and the penalty scores against the nonvertebrate template were calculated. 2The alignment and penalty scores are available upon request. The penalty scores of the other molluscan globin sequences are low, with the exception of the Hbs of the primitive deep sea clam Calyptogena soyoae (44Suzuki T. Takagi T. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 993: 254-259Google Scholar), suggesting that they follow closely the standard globin fold (43Lesh A. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 225-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). When B. glabrata Mb is compared with molluscan globin sequences, the highest similarity (30.2%) is observed with Cerithidea rhizophorarum Mb. The hydrophobic lining of the heme pocket of B. glabrata Mb is normal but is less occupied by aromatic side chains than that ofA. limacina and L. pectinata Mb. In B. glabrata, Mb-specific side chain substitutions occur at several positions. In the B-helix, Val-B10 and Trp-B12 are unprecedented. Position B10 is usually occupied by a large hydrophobic residue (nonvertebrate globins studied (3Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have Leu (27.8%), Phe (27.8%), Tyr (27.8%), Met (11.0%) and Trp (5.6%)). Its side chain can be turned into the heme pocket and become involved in the control of O2 affinity through stabilization of ligand binding, as shown for nematode and trematode Hbs (45De Baere I.

It is very unlikely that the small Val can fulfill such a ligand stabilization role in B. glabrata Mb. However, the nature of the B10 side chain is correlated to the nature of the distal (E7) residue. Indeed, when a Gln-E7 is present, 80% of the nonvertebrate globins display a Tyr-B10. The adjacent residue at position E11 is also important in determining oxygen affinity. However, no correlation could be found between residues at positions E7/E11 and B10/E11. The Gln-E7 of B. glabrata is shared with C. soyoae and L. pectinata, whereas Aplysiidae (A. limacina, A. juliana, and A. kurodai) display Val-E7 and all other mollusc globins His-E7. The Val-E7 of the monomeric Mbs of the Aplysiidae, Bursatella leachii andDolabella auricularia, does not contact the heme directly (39Bolognesi M. Onesti S. Gatti G. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J.

Biol. 1993; 233: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Solution 1H NMR indicates that the hydrogen bonding of the bound ligand by the standard His-E7 is taken over by Arg-E10. This hydrogen bonding is responsible for the relatively high ligand affinity and the slow dissociation rate (48Qin J. La Mar G. Ascoli F. Bolognesi M. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 49Yamamoto Y. Iwafune K. Chujo R. Inoue Y. Imai K. Suzuki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence of the dimeric Mbs of Busycon canaliculatum,C. rhizophorarum, Nassa mutabilis, andBuccinum undatum shows the classic His at the distal position and consequently no Arg-E10. Neither the monomeric nor the dimeric Mbs of the gastropods have residues capable of hydrogen binding with the ligand at position B10 (45De Baere I. Perutz M. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 50Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is clear that the ligand stabilization system in B. glabrata Mb differs from the unique mechanism described in the Aplysiidae. A combination Val-B10, Gln-E7, and Ile-E11 is unprecedented. It can be assumed that in B. glabrata Mb Ala-B5, Leu-B9, and Met-B13 and Asn-B8, Trp-B12, and Asn-B16 form two ridges between which a single ridge of the G-helix (Phe-G15, Asn-G11, and Pro-G7) is packed to form the B/G-helical contact (43Lesh A. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 225-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). As such, a strong hydrophobic interaction can be expected among Leu-B9, Phe-G15, and Trp-B12 to stabilize the helical contact. The observation that Cys (EF8) (which is considered to be responsible for dimerization and is conserved in all dimeric Mbs) is absent in theB. glabrata sequence confirms its monomeric nature. Since the B. glabrata Mb was identified starting from a cDNA clone, its expression in the animal itself was verified. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a heme-containing protein with an apparent M r ~17,000 could be isolated from the radular muscle (Fig.3). Sequencing of the intact protein clearly proves that the amino terminus is inaccessible for Edman degradation, suggesting that the mature protein is acetylated as in all other mollusc Mbs observed so far (Table I). The amino acid sequences of several tryptic peptides clearly indicate the sequence identity of the isolated protein with the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of the B. glabrata Mb (Fig. 2). The circular dichroism analysis of the B. glabrata Mb shows 46% of α-helices, 17% of β-sheets, 14% of turns, and 23% of coil (Fig. 4). This α-helix content is low if compared with the vertebrate globins but is quite consistent with the circular dichroism data obtained for A. kurodai Mb (26Shikama K. Suzuki T. Sugawara Y. Katagiri T. Takagi T. Hatano Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 138-141Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, t"

In an effort to characterize the interactions between the Zn2Cys6 class transcriptional activator proteins and their DNA-binding sites, we have replaced in the full-length GAL4 protein small regions of the Zn2Cys6 domain with the analogous regions of another Zn2Cys6 protein called PPR1 an activator of pyrimidine biosynthetic genes. Alterations between the first and third cysteines abolished binding to GAL4 (upstream activation sequence of GAL (UASG)) or PPR1 (upstream acitvation sequence of UAS) DNA-binding sites and severely reduced transcriptional activation in yeast. In contrast, alterations between the third and fourth cysteines had only minor effects on binding to UASG but led to substantial decreases in activation in both yeast and a mammalian cell line. In the crystal structure of the GAL4 DBD-UASG complex (Marmorstein, R., Carey, M., Ptashne, M., and Harrison, S. C.

The GAL4 protein is an 881-amino acid transcriptional activator of the GAL and MEL1 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mechanism by which GAL4 activates transcription is conserved because GAL4 also activates transcription in plant,Drosophila, and mammalian cells if GAL4 DNA-binding sites (UASG) 1The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activation sequence; UASG, UAS of GAL; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; UASu, UAS of URA. are present in the promoter of appropriate reporter genes (reviewed in Ref.1Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). GAL4 is a member of a large family of fungal transcriptional activators that contain within their DNA-binding domains a conserved cysteine-rich region encoding six cysteine residues that coordinate two atoms of zinc (the Zn2Cys6 domain). The DNA recognition sequences to which these activators bind have been identified and all have in common a CGG or related triplet in each of the two symmetrically opposed half-sites (2Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 3Vashee S. Xu H. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The sequences between the triplets as well as the spacing of the triplet sequence are highly variable, indicating that these variables may in large part determine specific recognition. Based on the extent of homology between the Zn2Cys6 activators, it was hypothesized that the Cys-rich region performs a function common to all members of this class of proteins and the region immediately adjacent, which encodes divergent sequences, determines DNA binding specificity (5Salmeron Jr., J.R. Johnston S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7767-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that this model is essentially correct (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All but one (Lys23) of the 28 amino acids in the Zn2Cys6 region of GAL4 can be replaced by the analogous sequences of PPR1, an activator of pyrimidine biosynthetic genes (7Kammerer B. Guyonvarch A. Hubert J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 180: 239-250Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), without changing DNA binding specificity. In contrast, replacing the 14 amino acids immediately adjacent to the Zn2Cys6 region resulted in switching the DNA binding specificity to that of PPR1. Similar results were obtained when hybrids of LAC9, PPR1, and PUT3 were used (8Witte M.M. Dixon R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5128-5137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Science. 1993; 261: 909-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent structural characterizations of GAL4 (10Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), PPR1 (11Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and PUT3 (12Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece J.R. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) complexes with their respective UAS were consistent with the biochemical characterization and revealed that the Zn2Cys6regions act as CGG-binding modules whose spacing and thus specificity is determined by the linker regions immediately adjacent to the Zn2Cys6 region. In an effort to further characterize the interactions between Zn2Cys6 class transcriptional activators and their DNA-binding sites, we have revealed a region within the conserved Zn2Cys6 module of GAL4 that, when structurally altered, drastically affects transcriptional activation in yeast and a mammalian cell line but has only minor effects on DNA binding. Within the crystal structure of GAL4-UASG, this region is accessible to the environment and thus may make a contact crucial for activation. Production of single-stranded DNA, site-directed mutagenesis of full-length GAL4, cloning into the multicopy plasmid YEp351, and sequencing were performed as detailed earlier (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GAP71 and GAP72 were constructed from GAP1 and GAP2 using oligonucleotide 4PPR1-11. GAP100 and GAP110 were made from GAL4 and GAL4 Gln23, respectively, using oligonucleotide 4PPR1-13. GAL4 Gln23 was made using oligonucleotide 4PPR1-12. The GAL4, GAP100, GAP110, GAP71, and GAP72 amino acid sequences 1–10 were replaced with the analogous sequences from PPR1 by replacing the wild-type BamHI-SphI fragment with the BamHI-SphI fragment from GAP3N/pUC119 to give the corresponding N derivative. The GAP3N mutant was made from GAP3 (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide 4PPR1-8. Plasmids used for transfection into the COS-1 cells were made by amplifying the DNA-binding domains with oligonucleotides PAL-30 and PAL-32, cutting with BamHI and XhoI, and cloning into the uniqueBglII and XhoI sites of the plasmid pSGVP (13Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). All constructions were confirmed by sequencing. The sequence of all oligonucleotides used in this study are available upon request. Fragments of DNA encoding amino acids 1–147 of the DNA-binding domains of GAL4 or GAPs were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase and the GAL4 or GAP genes on the plasmid YEp351 as starting templates for polymerase chain reaction. The DNAs were amplified in the presence of oligonucleotide PAL-4, which defines the 3′ end, and oligonucleotides that incorporate the T3 RNA polymerase recognition site into the 5′ end (PAL-1 for GAL4 N-terminal amino acids or PAL-2 for hybrids containing PPR1 amino acids at the N terminus). The PPR1 coding region amino acids 25–171 was amplified with PAL-2 and PAL-6. Transcription reactions were performed using T3 RNA polymerase, and translation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates according to the supplier's instructions (Promega). The same RNA was used to program synthesis in two parallel reactions, one containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the other containing cold methionine. The 35S-labeled proteins were analyzed on denaturing SDS 15% polyacrylamide gels (19:1, acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Prestained low molecular weight protein standards were from Stratagene. Assays of protein-DNA interactions were performed as described earlier (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Yeast culture conditions and α-galactosidase assays were performed as described (14Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the yeast extracts were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin to generate the standard curve. All assays were performed with at least three independent transformants with standard deviations less than 20%. For illustrative purposes, the activities of the GAL4-PPR1 hybrids are presented as percentages of the activity of wild-type GAL4. All plasmids were tested for level of production of GAP proteins in the B80Sstrain (α GAL4 GAL80 S -100 ura3-52 leu2-3 112 MEL1) by assaying growth on galactose (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method, extracts were prepared, and CAT activity was measured using standard methods (15Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 16.30–16.36 and 16.59–16.63, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). To gain insight into the sequences important in determining DNA binding specificity as well as structure of the Zn2Cys6 domain, mutants of full-length GAL4 were made by replacing different regions of the GAL4 Zn2Cys6 domain and N-terminal flanking region with the analogous sequences from PPR1. The sequence changes in the Zn2Cys6 region of GAL4 were grouped into two subregions (Fig. 1). Subregion A is highly conserved in the Zn2Cys6 class of activator proteins (Fig. 1 A, bottom). There are three amino acid differences between GAL4 and PPR1 within this region. Lys17 and Lys18 in GAL4 (10Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) or Lys40 and Lys41 at the equivalent positions in PPR1 (11Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) make specific contacts with the CGG motif within the UASG or UASu, respectively. Subregion B is less well conserved and includes three amino acid differences clustered between the third and fourth cysteines. Replacement of the two subregions had pronounced but contrasting effects on transcriptional activation in yeast and DNA binding in vitro. Replacing the three amino acids in subregion A of GAL4 with those of PPR1 produced the GAP100 protein, which had severely decreased ability to activate MEL1 (Fig. 1 A). Usingin vitro transcribed and translated proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, binding of GAP100 to UASG was not detected (Fig. 1 B). In our DNA binding experiments with GAL4 and mutants that exhibited UASG binding, two DNA-protein complexes were observed: a major complex (bottom arrowhead) and a slower-migrating, more labile complex that was not consistently observed (top arrowhead). Both complexes contained GAL4 DBD, as shown by supershift experiments using anti-GAL4 DBD antibodies (data not shown). Compared with earlier studies of interactions between GAL4 and UASG (16Xu H.E. Johnson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21177-21183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the lower complex is most likely a dimer of the GAL4 DBD bound to 1 UASG. The upper complex may then be a GAL4 DBD dimer complexed to an additional protein. In addition a minor faster migrating GAL4-UASG complex may represent a degradation product of GAL4 DBD. Replacement of subregion A and an additional amino acid in subregion B (Gln23) to give GAP110 abolished the ability to activate MEL1. Loss of UASGbinding was not replaced by UASu binding because none of the hybrid proteins examined in this study were able to bind to UASu (data not shown). These data indicate that the structures of subregion A of GAL4 and PPR1 are not interchangeable. In contrast to the subregion A changes, replacement of the three amino acids in subregion B (GAP71) or subregion B plus four adjacent C-terminal amino acids (GAP72) had less drastic or no effects on UASG binding, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Despite significant binding to UASG, GAP71 and GAP72 were severely compromised in their ability to activate MEL1. The defects in activation by the GAL4-PPR1 hybrids were not unique to theMEL1 gene, which is under control of one UASG, but were also observed when a reporter gene under control of two UASGs from the GAL1-GAL10 promoter region was assayed (data not shown). Large differences in the ability of the different GAL4-PPR1 hybrids to bind UASG could not be attributed to differences in protein expression because expression of all of the hybrids examined in this study varied by no more than ~4-fold (Fig. 1 C). Differences in in vivoexpression and stability of the hybrid proteins were tested in a GAL80S mutant strain that cannot grow on galactose because of constitutive repressive effects of a mutant of GAL80. Titration of the GAL80S protein by either wild-type GAL4 or any of the GAL4-PPR1 hybrid proteins allowed equal growth on galactose, indicating that expression of the proteins in vivo was indistinguishable. The empty vector or the vector expressing PPR1, which does not bind GAL80, did not allow growth (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that alterations within subregion A drastically affect DNA binding, whereas alterations within subregion B preferentially affect activation. The region N-terminal to the Zn2Cys6 region is highly variable in both length and sequence between the Zn2Cys6 family members. Only the amino acids immediately adjacent to the Zn2Cys6 region have been conserved to an appreciable extent (Fig. 1 A,bottom). Very little is known about the role of this region in supporting the structure of the Zn2Cys6domain or in DNA binding. Replacing the GAL4 N-terminal sequences with those from PPR1 had different effects on DNA binding and transcriptional activation depending on which GAL4 subregions contained PPR1 sequences. Replacement of the GAL4 N-terminal region with the analogous sequences from PPR1 in wild-type GAL4 (GAL4N) had no detectable effect on DNA binding, as shown earlier (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but did have a small negative effect on activation of MEL1 (Fig.1 A). Replacing the N-terminal sequences of GAP100 with that of PPR1 to give GAP100N did not appreciably change the ability of the protein to activate or bind DNA. In contrast, addition of the PPR1 N-terminal sequence enabled the hybrids containing one (GAP110N) or three (GAP71N and GAP72N) PPR1 amino acids in subregion B to activateMEL1 better (2.7–51-fold). The ability of the hybrids containing PPR1 N-terminal sequences to bind DNA was unaffected. Minor differences in binding could be explained by differences in the amount of expressed protein. These data indicate that PPR1 amino acids in the N-terminal region were able to enhance the activation activities of hybrids containing PPR1 amino acids in subregion B but not subregion A. Despite this enhancement, all of the hybrid proteins containing changes in subregion B were moderately to severely defective in transcription activation. To determine whether mutations in subregion B also affect transcriptional activation in a mammalian context, the DBDs from the GAL4-PPR1 hybrids (Fig. 2 A) were fused to the VP16 activation domain (13Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids were cotransfected into a green monkey kidney cell line, COS-1, with a plasmid encoding the reporter gene CAT under control of one UASG (Fig. 2 A). Compared with GAL4-VP16, the GAL4N-VP16 exhibited a minor decrease in ability to activate the reporter gene (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the GAP72-, GAP72N-, GAP71-, and GAP71N-VP16 proteins activated the CAT gene to only a fraction of that activated by GAL4-VP16. Notably, the pattern of activation in COS-1 cells paralleled the activation in yeast,i.e. GAP71 activated less than GAP72 and both mutants were partially corrected by the PPR1 N-terminal sequences. Thus, the structural defects in subregion B that affect activation in yeast also have parallel effects on activation in a mammalian cell line. In an effort to define the amino acids responsible for conferring DNA binding specificity and protein stability on Zn2Cys6 class proteins, we have identified a short sequence within the GAL4 DBD that, when altered, results in a preferential decrease of transcriptional activation in yeast and a mammalian cell line but only minor effects on DNA binding. All of the proteins that exhibited this phenotype possessed at least four PPR1 amino acids replacing the analogous GAL4 amino acids between the third and fourth cysteines. In addition, the N-terminal region containing PPR1 amino acids was shown to be important in restoring the ability of hybrids containing PPR1 amino acids in subregion B to activate transcription. This could be only partly attributed to increased UASG binding. The close proximity of the N terminus and subregion B in the GAL4-UASG co-crystal structure (10Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) supports the idea that the compensatory effects of the N-terminal sequences are through direct interaction with subregion B. Although the structure of the Zn2Cys6 modules from GAL4, PPR1, and PUT3 are similar (10Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 11Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece J.R. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and can be exchanged between the proteins without altering DNA binding specificity (6Corton J.C. Johnston S. Nature. 1989; 340: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Witte M.M. Dixon R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5128-5137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Science. 1993; 261: 909-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), our work indicates that replacing amino acids within the Zn2Cys6 module of GAL4 with analogous amino acids from PPR1 can lead to two types of defects. Alterations of amino acids in proximity (e.g. GAP100) to Lys17 and Lys18 that make direct contact with the CGG triplets within the UASG can disrupt DNA binding, possibly by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within the module. Alterations within the amino acids between the third and fourth cysteines can preferentially disrupt transcriptional activation without adversely affecting DNA binding. The subregion B mutants characterized in this study are similar to the positive control (pc) mutants first isolated in λ repressor (17Hochschild A. Irwin N. Ptashne M.

The mutational changes in ADR1 and human glucocorticoid receptor map to the amino acids in the C-terminal half of the first or second zinc fingers, respectively, in regions analogous to subregion B in GAL4. Although these regions do not share any significant sequence or structural homologies with GAL4, a commonpc-like mutation occurs in which Lys23 in GAL4, Arg115 in ADR1, or Arg488 in glucocorticoid receptor was changed to Gln. Examination of the environment of this region in crystal structures of Zif268 (21Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O.

Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) reveals that at least some of the amino acids that were altered in thepc-like mutants are not making contact with the DNA and are accessible to the surrounding environment. In the GAL4-UASGco-crystal structure (10Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) subregion B is also exposed to the environment (Fig. 3). Three of the four amino acids within this region (Ser22, Glu24, and Lys25) are directed away from the DNA. Lys23 forms a hydrogen bond with a phosphate in the UASG (10Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The amino acids between the third and fourth cysteines of PPR1 (11Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and PUT3 (12Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece J.R. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also do not make contact with the DNA and are directed out toward the surrounding environment based on the protein-UAS crystal structures. Taken together, these data indicate that a number of DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins that coordinate zinc possess a region within the DNA-binding domains important in determining optimal gene activation. How do mutations in GAL4 subregion B lead to defects in transcriptional activation? One possibility is that GAL4 pc mutants simply have an altered conformation that inhibits the activation domain. Examples of this mechanism comes from work on pc mutants of the glucocorticoid receptor (24Lefstin J.A. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2842-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and another Zn2Cys6 protein, HAP1 (25Ha N. Hellauer K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which indicated that appropriate transcription factor-UAS interactions are necessary for optimal transcriptional activation. Another possibility is that subregion B or a region affected by changes in subregion B defines an interactive site with another protein important in transcriptional specificity. Physical interactions have been characterized between coactivators EIA (26Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or SWI3 (27Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and the DBDs of transcriptional activators. A number of proteins exhibit genetic or biochemical properties that make them candidates for interacting with the GAL4 DBD. A mutant of one protein GAL11, called GAL11P, potentiates transcriptional activation by proteins containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and weak transcriptional activation domains from other transcription factors (28Himmelfarb H.J. Pearlberg J. Last D.H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1299-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The positive effect of GAL11P is reversed by a GAL4 mutation (Lys20 to Glu) in close proximity to the subregion B amino acids. However, there is no evidence for a direct interaction between wild-type GAL11 and the GAL4 DBD. Secondly, subregion B may be interacting with components of the nucleosome. Mutations in histones H3 (29Mann R.K. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and H4 (30Durrin L.K. Mann R.K. Kayne P.S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1023-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) allow hyperactivation or reduced activation, respectively, of a number of GAL4-regulated genes. In this scenario, the GAL4 subregion B might operate like a histone plow, as proposed earlier (5Salmeron Jr., J.R. Johnston S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7767-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Lastly, other regions of GAL4 itself could be interacting with subregion B. The conserved region between the DBD and activation domains in Zn2Cys6 class protein (or middle homology region) has been proposed to bridge interactions between the Zn2Cys6 module and the activation domain and to enhance DNA binding specificity (2Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In a recent study, however, DNA binding and transcriptional activities of GAL4 mutants that lack the middle homology region were not adversely affected (31Ding W.V. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intensive investigation is presently focused on identifying the protein target(s) of the activation domains from different types of transcriptional activators. Our work demonstrates that the GAL4 DBD possesses a region that determines optimal transcriptional activation. Thus, to completely understand the mechanism of transcriptional activation by intact GAL4 in yeast or by GAL4 activation domain hybrids in mammalian cells, it will be necessary to determine the interactions made between the DBD and other proteins. Selection of suppressors of GAP71 or GAP71N activation defects in yeast should identify the protein(s) important in determining transcriptional specificity of GAL4 and allow for determination of conservation in higher eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W1983025199,"The β recombinase, in the presence of a chromatin-associated protein such as Hbsu, catalyzes DNA resolution or DNA inversion on supercoiled substrates containing two directly or inversely oriented six sites. Hbsu stabilizes the formation of the recombination complex (Alonso, J. C., Weise, F., and Rojo, F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2938–2945). In this study we show that resolution by β recombinase strictly requires supercoiled DNA, but inversion does not. On a substrate with two inversely oriented six sites, β recombinase catalyzed both resolution and inversion if the DNA was supercoiled but only inversion if the substrate was relaxed or linear. Hbsu was critical for the formation of synaptic complexes; its concentration relative to that of the supercoiled DNA substrate determined whether resolution or inversion products were preferentially formed. The results suggest that the β recombinase forms unproductive short-lived synaptic complexes between two juxtaposed inversely oriented six sites; the presence of 3 to 13 Hbsu dimers per supercoiled DNA molecule would stabilize a synaptic complex with a relative geometry of the six sites allowing β recombinase preferentially to achieve resolution. Supercoiling probably helps to overcome an energetic barrier, since resolution does not occur in relaxed DNA. The presence of >30 Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule probably favors the formation of a recombination complex with a different geometry since the reaction is directed preferentially toward DNA inversion. The β recombinase, in the presence of a chromatin-associated protein such as Hbsu, catalyzes DNA resolution or DNA inversion on supercoiled substrates containing two directly or inversely oriented six sites. Hbsu stabilizes the formation of the recombination complex (Alonso, J. C., Weise, F., and Rojo, F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2938–2945).

The presence of >30 Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule probably favors the formation of a recombination complex with a different geometry since the reaction is directed preferentially toward DNA inversion. Site-specific recombinases of the Tn3/γδ family can be divided into three major subfamilies: DNA resolvases, DNA invertases, and DNA resolvase-invertases (reviewed in Refs. 1Grindley N.D.F. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 236-267Google Scholar, 2Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. Sherratt D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements.

The members of the three subfamilies normally require supercoiled DNA substrates containing two recombination sites (reviewed in Refs. 4Kanaar R. van de Putte P. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 147-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Stark W.M. Sherrat D.J. Boocock M.R.

While DNA resolvases and DNA invertases are highly specialized in catalyzing resolution or inversion, respectively, members of the resolvase-invertase subfamily do not have this bias and catalyze both kinds of reactions efficiently (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The major difference between the enzymes of these three subfamilies lies in the DNA site required for recombination. Theres site of DNA resolvases contains a crossover site (subsite I) and two essential accessory sites (subsites II and III) to which the recombinase binds (reviewed in Refs. 1Grindley N.D.F. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 236-267Google Scholar and 2Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. Sherratt D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements. Oxford University Press, 1995: 101-129Google Scholar). In the case of DNA invertases, the crossover site is analogous to the subsite I of DNA resolvases. The accessory site (sis or enhancer), which is not targeted by the recombinase, is located at some distance from the recombination site and is targeted by the sequence-specific DNA-binding and DNA-bending protein FIS (reviewed in Refs. 2Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. Sherratt D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements. Oxford University Press, 1995: 101-129Google Scholar, 8Johnson R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, and 9van de Putte P. Goosen N. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The recombination site (six site) of resolvase-invertases includes a crossover site (subsite I) and an essential accessory site (subsite II). The accessory site(s) to which a sequence-independent chromatin-associated protein binds is not well defined (3Alonso J.C. Ayora S. Canosa I. Weise F. Rojo F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 142: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The β recombinase is a well characterized member of the latter subfamily. Both in vitro and in vivo, the activity of the β recombinase depends upon the presence of a chromatin-associated protein such as Bacillus subtilis Hbsu, theEscherichia coli HU, or eukaryotic HMG1, both when the protein mediates deletions between two directly oriented sixsites, or inversions between inversely oriented six sites (7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Canosa I. Rojo F. Alonso J.C.

We have shown that, for DNA resolution, the role of the chromatin-associated protein is to facilitate the formation of the recombination complex (11Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our current model holds that the chromatin-associated protein works by recognizing and stabilizing a DNA structure at the six site. Our previous work had indicated that resolution occurred when the two six sites for the β recombinase are directly oriented and two or more Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule are present. The inversion reaction, which is less defined, takes place in the presence of 40 Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule and requires a substrate with two inversely oriented six sites (7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Canosa I. Ayora S. Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). With the aim of characterizing in detail the inversion reaction, we have studied the effect of the β recombinase on substrates containing two inversely oriented six sites. We have found that when such a substrate is supercoiled, both DNA inversion and DNA resolution can occur. The Hbsu concentration could determine the final direction of the reaction on a supercoiled DNA substrate. Relaxation of the DNA substrate totally inhibited the resolution activity of the β recombinase but did not affect its ability to catalyze inversion reactions. DNA inversion was observed even on linear DNA substrates. Therefore, the combination of the β recombinase six site and Hbsu allows an unprecedented flexibility of the DNA substrate, making it competent for the assembly of productive recombination complexes of different geometries. The Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (13Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used as host for DNA manipulations. Plasmids pCB8 and pCB12 (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were used as substrates for site-specific recombination. The β protein was overexpressed and purified as described previously (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Rojo F. Weise F. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purified Hbsu protein was a gift from Prof. U. Heinemann (Max-Delbrück-Centrum für Molekulare Medizin, Berlin). Since both wild-type β (14Rojo F. Weise F. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and Hbsu (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) proteins are dimers in solution, their concentration is expressed as mol of protein dimers. Plasmids pCB8 and pCB12 were relaxed with topoisomerase I in the presence of ethidium bromide concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μm, essentially as described (15Meiklejohn A.L. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mean superhelical densities of the samples obtained were calculated, as described (16Wang J.C. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 85-91Crossref Google Scholar), from the linking number difference between the center of the topoisomer distribution of a given sample and the center of the topoisomer distribution corresponding to relaxed DNA. The amount of DNA is expressed as mol of plasmid molecules. Plasmids pCB8, which contains two directly oriented six sites for the β recombinase separated by about 2.3 kb, 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase; DTT, dithiothreital; bp, base pair; six, site of crossing over. and pCB12, in which the two six sites are inversely oriented and separated by about 1.4 kb, were used as substrates for site-specific recombination. Reaction mixtures contained, in a total volume of 25 μl, 10 nm substrate plasmid, in 10 mm bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT and proteins Hbsu and β recombinase at the concentrations indicated in the Fig. legends. The β protein-catalyzed resolution was saturated after 30 min of incubation, whereas saturation of the inversion reaction was achieved after 3 h. Hence, all reactions were incubated 3 h at 30 °C. To visualize the reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis, the DNA was digested with the KpnI andEcoRV endonucleases. When working at higher ionic strength, reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and the Hbsu and β recombinase concentrations indicated in the Fig. legends (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A sample containing supercoiled or linear DNA (10 nm) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, in the absence or presence of β protein (500 nm) and/or Hbsu (800 nm), in a solution containing 10 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT in a total volume of 25 μl. Glutaraldehyde was then added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and allowed to react for 2 h at 30 °C. Samples were diluted with a buffer containing 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2 to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml of DNA. Samples were directly adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica, stained with 2% uranil acetate for 2 min and washed in double distilled water. After floating the samples in water, these were deposited onto copper grids covered with toluol. After being rotary shadowed with platinum at 10−5 torr, a carbon film was deposited. Finally, replicas were obtained as described previously (17Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. de Bernardin W. Losa R. Koller T. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 61-79Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken at 80 kV, routinely at a magnification of × 50,000. Contour length measurements were carried out on photographic prints using a Summagraphic-type digitizer tablet. Previously, we have demonstrated that β recombinase, in the presence of Hbsu at concentrations corresponding to about 40 Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule, catalyzes a DNA inversion reaction on a supercoiled DNA substrate (plasmid pCB12) with two inversely orientedsix sites (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study we found that both DNA resolution and DNA inversion can occur on supercoiled DNA substrates with two inversely oriented six sites and that the Hbsu concentration present in the reaction mixture influenced whether resolution or inversion products were formed preferentially. In the presence of 10 nm supercoiled DNA substrate containing twosix sites in an inverse orientation (plasmid pCB12) and an excess of β recombinase (670 nm), the addition of 3–13 Hbsu dimers (30–130 nm) per DNA molecule (1 Hbsu dimer per 1600 to 370 base pairs) led to the appearance of recombination products corresponding preferentially to a resolution process rather than to the expected inversion reaction. Nevertheless, at higher Hbsu concentrations (>150 nm, corresponding to about 15–200 Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule), the amount of resolution products decreased while inversion products became predominant (Fig.1, A and B). About 42 and 30% of the total DNA substrate was converted to resolution and inversion products, respectively, in 3 h at 30 °C. An additional unexpected DNA fragment of about 2.6 kb, apparently associated to the resolution process, was also detected, although its nature is at present unknown. The amount of β recombinase present (from 30 nm to 2 μm) did not seem to bias the reaction in either direction (resolution or inversion) (data not shown). The addition of 2 μm Hbsu (200 Hbsu dimers per DNA molecule, or 1 dimer per 25 nucleotides) neither nicked nor unwound pCB12 DNA (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2, and data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the decrease in resolution efficiency at high Hbsu concentrations could be due to nicking or unwinding of the substrate DNA (see below). It is likely, therefore, that the effect of β recombinase on supercoiled DNA substrates containing two inversely oriented six sites is different from that of the enzymes of the other subfamilies (see the Introduction) that are very selective for the orientation of the recombination sites and generate only one product from a particular substrate; DNA invertases catalyze only inversions and DNA resolvases are highly specialized in resolution. When the substrate of β recombinase is a supercoiled plasmid containing two directly orientedsix sites (pCB8 plasmid DNA), the role of Hbsu is to facilitate the joining of distant recombination sites to form a recombination complex (11Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Hbsu has the same function in the inversion reaction, recombination complexes formed with plasmid pCB12 (10 nm) under conditions which favor DNA inversion (an excess of Hbsu) were analyzed by electron microscopy after fixation of the protein-DNA complexes with glutaraldehyde. When the DNA was incubated separately with β recombinase or Hbsu, neither recombination complexes nor protein bound to DNA were observed (Fig.2, A-C). Furthermore, the addition of 50 dimers of β recombinase (500 nm), or 80 dimers of the Hbsu (800 nm) protein per DNA molecule, did not seem to affect the level of supercoiling or to relax pCB12 DNA (Fig. 2, A-C). When both Hbsu and β recombinase were present in the reaction mixture, about 30 to 40% of the DNA molecules showed a dot-like complex that held together two DNA segments of the molecule, dividing the plasmid into two discrete domains. From the length of the DNA segments in each domain, we infer that the dot-like structures is located at the position expected for a recombination complex (Fig. 2, D-F). The proportion of DNA molecules containing a dot-like structure correlates with the amount of recombinant products observed by gel electrophoresis. Although these assays do not allow us to discriminate whether the complexes observed correspond to resolution or inversion reactions, they indicate that Hbsu is essential for the joining of two distant inversely oriented six sites into a recombination complex, as was previously shown to be the case when the two sixsites are in direct orientation (11Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Supercoiling of the substrate DNA is essential for site-specific recombinases of the Tn3/γδ family (reviewed in Refs. 1Grindley N.D.F. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 236-267Google Scholar and 2Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. Sherratt D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements. Oxford University Press, 1995: 101-129Google Scholar). In the case of β recombinase, resolution with a plasmid containing two directly oriented six sites (plasmid pCB8) occurs efficiently if the molecule is supercoiled but is undetectable if the substrate is relaxed (7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether differences exist in the supercoiling requirements of the inversion and resolution reactions, we relaxed plasmid pCB12 with topoisomerase I and tested whether the relaxed DNA is a substrate for the inversion or resolution reactions. Fig. 3 shows that the relaxed pCB12 did not support the resolution reaction but was as good a substrate for the inversion reaction as the supercoiled form. To analyze this aspect in more detail, we prepared plasmid populations with different supercoiling densities from plasmids pCB8 and pCB12 and scored for DNA recombination. Under standard conditions (10 nm substrate DNA, 500 nm β protein, 300 nm Hbsu), resolution with pCB8 was efficient only for plasmids having superhelical densities between –0.03 and –0.07; below and above these values, the reaction efficiency decreased sharply (Fig.4). Resolution was the only recombination product observed with pCB8 DNA (Ref. 7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar; data not shown). Plasmid pCB12 showed that the resolution reaction between two inversely orientedsix sites has a DNA supercoiling requirement similar to that of a substrate with two directly oriented six sites. Nevertheless, efficient inversion was observed at all supercoiling densities tested (Fig. 4). It seems, therefore, that β recombinase does not strictly require DNA supercoiling for the inversion reaction. Recombination was not detected between two negatively supercoiled or linear plasmid substrates, each containing a single six site (intermolecular recombination; data not shown). Since, as shown above, the β recombinase efficiently catalyzed DNA inversion on a relaxed substrate containing two inversely oriented six sites, we asked whether this reaction could also take place when the substrate was in linear form. Plasmid pCB12 was linearized with KpnI and used as substrate for recombination. As revealed in Fig.5, under standard conditions inversion products were readily observed. The reaction efficiency was similar, or even higher, than that obtained with a supercoiled pCB12 DNA. DNA recombination between two inversely oriented six sites on linear DNA strictly required the presence of the accessory protein Hbsu (data not shown). To investigate the recombination products formed with linear pCB12 substrates, the protein-DNA complexes were fixed with glutaraldehyde and analyzed by electron microscopy. When the linear DNA was incubated separately with either β recombinase (500 nm) or Hbsu (800 nm), neither recombination complexes nor protein dots sitting on DNA were observed (data not shown). In the presence of both β (500 nm) and Hbsu (800 nm), about 30 to 40% of total DNA molecules were complexed with proteins. The gallery presented in Fig. 6, which is representative of the results obtained, was assembled with those DNA molecules in which a dot-like structure was located at the position expected for a recombination complex (77% of complexed molecules,n = 90). The length of the DNA segments at each side of the dot-like structure was measured in 39 molecules. The length of the long arm was about 2821 ± 216 bp, that of the loop was 1,889 ± 197 bp, while the short arm was 167 bp ± 67 in length; the length measured for the protein-free plasmid was 4,984 ± 55 bp. It is likely, therefore, that the dot-like structures represent a synaptic complex formed by the joining of the two distant inversely oriented six sites present in the linear molecule. In three cases (3.3%), the protein dot was bound to one DNA strand, whereas in the remaining 20% of the cases (n = 18), two or more individual DNA molecules bound to a protein dot were observed (data not shown). These complexes, which are probably preparation artifacts, were not further analyzed. From these results, we conclude that the role of Hbsu with linear substrates is to facilitate the formation of a recombination complex, as it does with supercoiled plasmids (see Fig. 2). The control of the reaction directionality of DNA resolvases and DNA invertases results from the formation of higher order protein-DNA complexes which control the DNA geometry within the synaptic complex. This discrimination is further enhanced by the free energy associated with DNA supercoiling (reviewed in Refs. 1Grindley N.D.F. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 236-267Google Scholar and 2Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. Sherratt D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements. Oxford University Press, 1995: 101-129Google Scholar). Our results show that β recombinase can catalyze both DNA resolution and DNA inversion on negatively supercoiled DNA substrates containing two inversely oriented six sites, and that the type of reaction (resolution or inversion) is determined to a significant extent by the amount of Hbsu available relative to DNA substrate. The effect of Hbsu in the directionality of the reaction is not the consequence of a nicking of the DNA by contaminant nucleases since addition of an excess of Hbsu did not nick the DNA. Previously, it has been shown that 10–13 dimers of HU (E. coli counterpart of Hbsu, see the Introduction) per DNA molecule are required to generate a superhelical turn on a relaxed DNA molecule (reviewed in Ref. 19Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The results reported in this work show that the efficiency of β-mediated DNA resolution on a substrate with two inversely oriented sixsites decreases in the presence of an excess of Hbsu (Fig. 1), or at superhelical densities above or below the optimal values (between –0.04 and –0.07; Fig. 3). It is likely, therefore, that the decrease in resolution efficiency observed at high Hbsu concentrations occurs, at least in part, because Hbsu increases the DNA supercoiling above the optimum limits for resolution. Unlike DNA resolution, DNA inversion was not sensitive to the level of negative supercoiling of the substrate DNA, which suggests that Hbsu can probably favor the formation of recombination complexes with two different geometries, one of them leading to resolution and the other one to inversion products. If this hypothesis is correct, whether β recombinase will catalyze resolution or inversion on these substrates will depend on the DNA geometry within the synaptic complex rather than on DNA site orientation discrimination. It should be taken into account that this model would hold only when the substrate has two inversely oriented six sites since, when the two six sites are directly oriented, only DNA resolution occurs, independently of the Hbsu concentration (6Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analysis of recombination complexes by electron microscopy showed that, both in the inversion and resolution reactions, the role of Hbsu is to stabilize the formation of the recombination complex (Ref. 11Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; this work). Since β protein catalyzes DNA inversion between two inversely oriented sites on linear DNA, we can rule out that the role of Hbsu is solely to increase the supercoiling of the DNA substrate. The stabilization of the recombination complex requires overcoming an energy barrier to stabilize a DNA conformation that allows the proper alignment of the two inversely oriented six sites in a productive recombination complex which, after strand exchange, generates recombination products. The results reported show that the presence of 3 to 13 Hbsu protein dimers per supercoiled DNA molecule helps to stabilize preferentially a complex with a geometry leading to resolution products. When 15–200 Hbsu dimers per supercoiled molecule are present, a recombination complex with a different geometry is stabilized which, after strand exchange, yields inversion products. We have previously shown that a mammalian HMG1 protein, which shares neither sequence nor structural homology with Hbsu, or even plastid HlpA, can stimulate β-mediated recombination (11Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Grasser K.D. Ritt C. Krieg M.E. FernaÖndez S. Alonso J.C. Grimm R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These chromatin-associated proteins bind preferentially to DNA sequences showing bent or altered conformations (21Pontiggia A. Negri A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22Bianchi M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Bonnefoy E. Takahashi M. Yaniv J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the way through which the chromatin-associated protein participates in the reaction is by stabilizing one or more bent DNA conformations that arise upon the assembly of a recombination complex. This complex should be stable enough to allow the recombinase molecules to assemble and undergo the conformational changes necessary to adopt a catalytically active state. A role for Hbsu in binding bent or altered DNA structures would allow a high flexibility for its positioning in the recombination complex: it may bind to more than one position, provided that the DNA can be distorted, and that the protein can physically fit into the complex. We believe that it is this characteristic which confers less selectivity to the β recombinase with respect to the final direction of the recombination reaction (resolution or inversion) when the two β protein six sites are in an inverted orientation. As discussed above, the β recombinase requires negative supercoiling of the DNA substrate for the resolution reaction but not for the inversion reaction. Productive recombination complexes were formed even on linear DNA molecules containing inversely oriented six sites. This behavior is different from that of the DNA resolvases or DNA invertases. The analysis of the role of DNA supercoiling on the recombination reactions catalyzed by DNA resolvases and DNA invertases has led to the conclusion that the critical mechanistic assistance provided by supercoiling leading to the formation of a synapsis depends on conformational effects while the transition to postsynapsis and strand exchange relies on torsional stress; the latter process requires a higher superhelical density than synapsis (24Benjamin K.R. Abola A.P. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Watson M.A. Boocock M.R. Stark W.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA invertases require an accessory protein, FIS, to mediate inversion and reaction selectivity (26Johnson R.C. Glasgow A.C. Simon M.I. Nature. 1987; 329: 531-539Crossref Google Scholar). FIS-independent mutant derivatives of the Gin invertase do not require supercoiled DNA and are even active on linear DNA substrates, albeit with a low efficiency. Those mutations lie in the dimer interface and may render a constitutively active recombinase (27Klippel A. Cloppenborg K. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3983-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Klippel A. Kanaar R. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). FIS-independent Gin mutants have also lost the selectivity for inversion. Furthermore, the requirement for supercoiling by DNA resolvases can be circumvented by using special “permissive” reaction conditions (5Stark W.M. Sherrat D.J. Boocock M.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Dro¨ge P. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6062-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The β recombinase resembles in many respects the FIS-independent Gin invertase mutants or DNA resolvases assayed under special “permissive” reaction conditions (5Stark W.M. Sherrat D.J. Boocock M.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Klippel A. Kanaar R. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Dro¨ge P. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6062-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An essential difference between the β and Gin systems is that FIS binds to a specific site providing a directionality to the reaction, while Hbsu could in principle bind to any region of the DNA in the recombination complex that has an appropriately bent structure. This characteristic is most likely what allows the β protein to form recombination complexes of different geometries. It is worth mentioning that, like other DNA resolvases of this family (24Benjamin K.R. Abola A.P. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Watson M.A. Boocock M.R. Stark W.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the β protein can form synaptic complexes with a relaxed DNA substrate containing two directly oriented six sites, as judged by electron microscopy (data not shown), although these complexes are not productive (Figs. 3 and 4). Finally, our results may shed some light on how the recombination sites find each other to form the recombination complex. Several models have been proposed to account for this process. Recombination sites could initially juxtapose either by random collision (30Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1986; 45: 795-800Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Boocock M.R. Brown J.L. Sherratt D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or by slithering in a plectonemically interwound molecule (32Benjamin K.R. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. R. A. Welch Found. Conf. Chem. Res. 1986; 29: 107-126Google Scholar). When the substrate DNA is circular, it is proposed that a productive interwrapping of the sites and cognate proteins can only be achieved when the recombination sites exist in the substrate DNA molecule in a particular geometry that would impose a “topological filter” on the reaction (31Boocock M.R. Brown J.L. Sherratt D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When the sites are not in the appropriate orientation, the energetic cost of distorting the DNA to achieve productive synapsis is probably too high and recombination is precluded (25Watson M.A. Boocock M.R. Stark W.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1986; 45: 795-800Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Boocock M.R. Brown J.L. Sherratt D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We suggest that the β recombinase, in the presence of Hbsu, probably forms the recombination complex by random collision because inversion occurs efficiently on linear substrates. In linear DNA, encountering of the recombination sites by slithering would only be successful when the DNA is moving in one direction relative to the first target site for the recombinase since the slithering in the opposite direction would reach the end of the molecule before the second target is found. This would considerably diminish recombination efficiency, and the β protein seems to be equally efficient with linear and supercoiled molecules. In a supercoiled substrate stabilization of a distorted DNA by Hbsu, binding could overcome the energetic cost of reorienting the inappropriate orientation of the inverted six sites to achieve productive synapsis; in the presence of an excess of Hbsu, the constraints on the DNA impose a barrier for such a reorientation and the juxtaposed, properly oriented sites form a synaptic complex. We are very grateful to U. Heinemann for the gift of purified Hbsu protein, to Martin Boocock and Marshall Stark for useful comments on the manuscript, and to T. A. Trautner for continuous interest in the project."

In this study, we have examined the effect of a site-specific cis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct on the helicase activity of the HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase.

The helicase-primase core enzyme consists of the 99-kDa UL5 and 114-kDa UL52 gene products and possesses 5′–3′ DNA helicase, DNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase, and primase activities (8Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A third subunit, the 80-kDaUL8 gene product, is an essential component of the helicase-primase complex. Its precise role is still unclear, but it has been reported to stimulate both the primase and helicase activities of the core enzyme in the presence of the HSV-1 single-strand DNA-binding protein, ICP8 (12Gac N.T.L.

These studies predicted an interaction between ICP8 and the helicase-primase heterotrimer mediated by the UL8 protein, which has subsequently been demonstrated (14Falkenberg M. Bushnell D.A. Elias P.

To study the effect of a cisplatin lesion on the progression of a DNA helicase at the replication fork, we examined the activity of the HSV-1 helicase-primase holoenzyme with a fork-like DNA substrate containing a site-specific cis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct. We also examined the ability of ICP8 to modulate the effect of the cisplatin lesion. The results show that the activity of the helicase-primase was inhibited by the adduct. ICP8 significantly increased the activity of the helicase-primase with cisplatin-damaged DNA. We propose that ICP8 stimulates translesion DNA unwinding by recruiting the helicase-primase to the damaged DNA. ICP8, UL5/52 core enzyme, and UL8 protein were purified to near homogeneity as described (12Gac N.T.L. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli SSB was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. Restriction endonucleases HaeIII and AciI and proteinase K were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), 99.99% pure, was purchased from Aldrich. ATP was from Boehringer Mannheim. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Unmodified or cisplatin-modified substrates B and C (Fig. 1) were constructed as described (15Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Lesca C. Burnouf D. Fuchs R.P.P. Defais M. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13766-13769Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxyribonucleotides employed to construct substrate A were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer and purified by electrophoresis through denaturing polyacrylamide gels. To obtain unmodified substrate A, equimolar concentrations of 90- and 59-mers were annealed to produce the Y-shaped partially duplex molecule. The 59-mer necessary for the construction of platinated substrate A was obtained by ligation of a 22-mer (residues 1–22, starting from the 3′-end of the 59-mer), a platinated 12-mer (residues 23–34), and a 25-mer (residues 35–59). Cisplatin modification of the 12-mer (3′-TCCGGTCCCTTT-5′), which contains only one d(GpG) modification site for cisplatin, was performed as follow: cisplatin was dissolved in 5 mm sodium perchlorate at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and then incubated in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm sodium perchlorate at a 2-fold molar excess with the 12-mer for 48 h at 37 °C. The platinated 12-mer was then precipitated twice in ethanol in order to remove the unreacted drug, and its concentration determined by absorbance at 260 nm. The platinated 12-mer was ligated to the 22- and 25-mers using a 41-mer (complementary to residues 9–49 of the 59-mer) as a scaffold in a reaction containing 10 units of T4 DNA ligase per 5′-end. The resulting platinated 59-mer was purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 5′ 32P-labeled, and hybridized to an equimolar concentration of the complementary 90-mer to yield platinated substrate A. A 28-mer complementary to residues 1–28 of the 90-mer of substrate A and a 27-mer complementary to residues 1–27 of the 90-mer of substrates B and C were also synthesized and purified (see under “Helicase Assay”). To determine the extent of cisplatin modification of substrate A, we took advantage of the fact that the modification site is part of aHaeIII restriction endonuclease site, which upon modification is rendered resistant to cleavage by the enzyme (4Villani G. Cazaux C. Pillaire M.J. Boehmer P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 5 ng of 32P-labeled unmodified or platinated substrate A was digested with 10 units of HaeIII under standard conditions. Fig. 2 shows that the vast majority of the platinated 90/59-mer was resistant to cleavage, whereas the unmodified substrate was digested nearly to completion. PhosphorImager quantitation indicated that 95% of the platinated substrate was resistant to HaeIII cleavage and therefore contained thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct. Similar experiments performed with substrates B and C, and AciI restriction endonuclease indicated that 90% of the substrates were platinated (data not shown). DNA helicase reactions were performed at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Incubation times, DNA helicase-primase (equimolar concentrations of UL5/52 and UL8 proteins), ICP8, E. coli SSB, and DNA substrate concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. Assays included a 10–40-fold molar excess of unlabeled 28-mer or 27-mer to prevent reannealing of the unwound DNA strand. In control helicase assays, performed in the absence of 28-mer, DNA unwinding was only 30% of the reaction with the 28-mer (data not shown). The reactions were terminated by addition of 0.2 volumes of 150 mm EDTA, 1% SDS and then digested for 20 min at 37 °C with 2 mg/ml proteinase K. 3 μl of 0.5% bromphenol blue and 40% glycerol were then added, and the reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis through 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were scanned using a PhosphorImager, and the release of single-stranded DNA was quantitated using the ImageQuant software. DNA unwinding activity is expressed as the percentage of displaced fragments and is corrected for background activity by subtracting the percentage of unwinding obtained in control incubations without protein. Typically such background represented no more than 10% of the total radioactivity for incubations of 60 min. DNA unwinding data represent the average of two or more independent experiments. The HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase is believed to be responsible for unwinding DNA at the replication fork (8Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev.

We define the strand to which the helicase binds and along which it translocates as the template strand. As shown in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, and in agreement with our previously published work (12Gac N.T.L. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol.

In order to obtain efficient unwinding and prevent reannealing of the unwound, labeled primer strand, an excess of unlabeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide, complementary to the double-stranded regions of substrates A, B, or C, was present.

As shown in Fig. 3, increasing DNA unwinding activity was observed with both unmodified and platinated DNA, reaching a plateau at ~250 nm enzyme. However, the presence of the cis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct reduced DNA unwinding by a factor of 3–4, and the extent of inhibition remained unchanged over a range of enzyme concentrations from 50 to 500 nm. It is possible that a significant fraction of the total DNA unwinding observed with the platinated substrate may be due to the presence of a small percentage (~5%) of unmodified substrate (see under “Materials and Methods”). The appearance of a faint band at an intermediate position between substrate and product was occasionally observed with the platinated DNA (data not shown). We believe that this band represents a hairpin structure that is induced by thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct in a fraction of the 59-mer population, thus preventing its hybridization to the 90-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The capacity of cisplatin to induce such hairpin structures in oligodeoxyribonucleotides has been documented (17Iwamoto M. Mukundan S.J. Marzili L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6238-6244Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the lesion inhibited DNA unwinding during the entire course of the reaction, suggesting that the adduct blocks helicase action. However, the lesion did not represent a permanent obstacle to the helicase-primase because addition of fresh enzyme resulted in increased DNA unwinding activity (Fig. 5). The data in Fig. 5 also show that the helicase-primase is unstable during the course of the reaction because addition of fresh enzyme resulted in increased DNA unwinding activity. Preincubation of the helicase-primase in the absence of DNA substrate showed that its half-life was approximately 30 min at 37 °C. In addition, we observed that preincubation of the helicase-primase with DNA substrate significantly increased its stability. In contrast, ICP8, in either the absence or presence of DNA substrate, was not able to increase the stability of the helicase-primase (data not shown). In contrast to the data obtained with substrate A, the helicase-primase unwound unmodified and cisplatin-modified substrates B and C with comparable efficiency (Fig. 6). As can be seen, regardless of whether the lesion was placed 13 or 7 nucleotides from the fork junction (substrates B and C, respectively), its position on the primer strand had no effect on the activity of the helicase-primase. We found that the helicase-primase exhibited greater activity with substrate A than substrates B and C. This may be due to the higher G-C base pair content of substrates B and C, thus making them more difficult to be unwound by the helicase-primase. Nevertheless, it is clear by comparing Figs. 3, 4, and 6 that thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct inhibits the helicase-primase only when it is present on the template strand. The data in the preceding section indicate that the major cisplatin DNA lesion, when located on the template strand of a fork-like substrate, is an obstacle to the progress of the helicase-primase. We have previously shown that the HSV-1 single-strand DNA-binding protein, ICP8, stimulates the DNA unwinding activity of the helicase-primase with unmodified substrate B. Although ICP8 could stimulate the activity of the core enzyme (UL5/52 proteins), optimal stimulation required the presence of the UL8 subunit (12Gac N.T.L. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated the effect of ICP8 on the unwinding ofcis-DDP modified substrate A by the helicase-primase. Because ICP8 has been shown to possess helix-destabilizing activity (18Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we determined its capacity to unwind substrate A under our experimental conditions. As can be seen in Fig.7, a low level of displacement was detected only at 1000 and 1200 nm ICP8 for the unmodified and cisplatin-modified substrates, respectively. Quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis indicated that the amount of displacement was 10 and 15% for 1000 and 1200 nm ICP8, respectively. Estimates of the DNA-binding site size of ICP8 fall in the range of 1 ICP8 to 12–22 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA (8Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By assuming an ICP8 binding site size of 14–15 nucleotides and by considering the total concentration of DNA (substrate plus unlabeled 28-mer) in the reaction, we estimated that the concentration of ICP8 necessary to completely cover the DNA substrate (coating concentration) was ~800 nm. As shown in Fig. 7 (lanes 4 and11), no strand-displacement activity was detected at this concentration of ICP8. Fig. 8 shows that addition of ICP8 stimulated the DNA unwinding activity of the helicase-primase with platinated DNA up to 6-fold. Maximal stimulation was observed at coating concentrations of ICP8 (800 nm). The stimulatory effect of ICP8 on the helicase-primase is likely to be a consequence of specific protein-protein interactions because it was not observed in the presence of the heterologous E. coli SSB (see Fig. 8,columns 11–20). Addition of a 4-fold molar excess of unlabeled substrate A to an ongoing helicase reaction with unmodified substrate A in which the concentration of single-stranded 5′ DNA ends was in excess over helicase-primase resulted in a significant decrease in DNA unwinding activity (Fig. 9 A). This result suggests that the helicase-primase readily dissociates from the DNA substrate and that it is distributive. A higher concentration of unlabeled 28-mer (40-fold molar excess) was used in the competition experiments in order to prevent reannealing of the unwound labeled DNA strand in the presence of the competitor DNA. To investigate the mechanism by which ICP8 stimulates DNA unwinding, we performed competition experiments in the presence of coating concentrations of ICP8. Fig. 9 B shows that addition of ICP8 to a helicase reaction with unmodified substrate A did not significantly alter the level of competition, suggesting that it does not prevent dissociation of the helicase-primase from the substrate and that it does not stimulate the helicase-primase by increasing its processivity. We then examined the effect of coating concentrations of ICP8 in competition experiments performed with cisplatin-modified substrate A. We observed an increased level of competition with the platinated DNA compared with the unmodified substrate (compare Fig. 9, Band C), suggesting that the lesion induces the helicase-primase to dissociate rapidly, even in the presence of ICP8. 2Competition experiments with platinated substrate A in the absence of ICP8 could not be performed due to the inhibition imposed on the helicase-primase by the lesion. Consistent with this conclusion, Fig. 10 shows that even in the presence of ICP8, the helicase-primase was more efficiently competed from the platinated DNA than from the unmodified DNA substrate, thus confirming that the cis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct results in dissociation of the helicase-primase. In addition, the data in Fig. 10 reiterate that increasing concentrations of competitor DNA led to a similar reduction in DNA unwinding activity with unmodified substrate A both in the absence or presence of ICP8. In this work, we have studied the capacity of a replicative DNA helicase, the HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase, to unwind fork-like DNA substrates that contain the major cisplatin-DNA adduct,cis-DDP-d(GpG). The role of the HSV-1 single-strand DNA-binding protein, ICP8, in modulating the activity of the helicase-primase was also examined. Our results show that the DNA unwinding activity of the helicase-primase was significantly reduced when thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct was located on the template strand to which the enzyme binds. In contrast, a lesion located on the opposite strand did not affect DNA unwinding (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Inhibition was observed throughout the time course of DNA unwinding and at high (500 nm) enzyme concentrations. A comparison of these results with previously published data (7Villani G. Pillaire M.J. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269(34): 21676-21681Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) shows that the activity of the helicase-primase was inhibited more strongly by thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct than the helicase activity of the HSV-1 origin-binding protein (UL9 protein), the action of which only appeared to be retarded by the lesion. This difference in behavior may reflect the capacity of UL9 protein to oligomerize into a large complex that is capable of unwinding past the lesion. However, even in the case of the helicase-primase, the cis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct did not represent an impassable obstacle, because addition of fresh enzyme during the course of the reaction resulted in increased DNA unwinding (Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that, consistent with our results, it has recently been shown that the DNA unwinding activity of the helicase-primase is also inhibited by two UV-induced DNA lesions, thecis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer and the (6-4) thymine-thymine lesion, when located on the template strand of the DNA substrate but not on the primer strand. 3X. Veaute, G. Giglia, C. W. Lawrence, and A. Sarasin, submitted for publication. Previous studies have shown the existence of functional and physical interactions between ICP8 and the helicase-primase (12Gac N.T.L. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Hamatake R.K. Bifano M. Hurlburt W.W. Tenney D.J. J. Gen.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of ICP8 on the unwinding of unmodified and platinated substrates by the helicase-primase. Addition of equimolar ICP8 stimulated the helicase-primase on unmodified DNA and significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct on platinated DNA (Fig. 8). However, maximal stimulation of the helicase-primase on damaged DNA was observed only with coating concentrations of ICP8 (Fig. 8). The requirement for coating concentrations of ICP8 may be explained by the fact that the lesion perturbs the structure of the DNA (21Marrot L. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1454-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Tilby M.J. Johnson C. Knox R.J. Cordell J. Roberts J.J. Dean C.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar, 23Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Christin A.F. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) and presumably obstructs the recognition of the substrate by the helicase-primase. Accordingly, high concentrations of ICP8 would be necessary to recruit the helicase-primase to the site of thecis-DDP-d(GpG) adduct and to allow efficient unwinding. The stimulation was specific for ICP8 because no such effect was observed with a heterologous SSB, E. coli SSB, suggesting that it involves specific protein-protein interactions. To obtain insight into the mechanism by which ICP8 stimulates the helicase-primase, we performed the competition experiments depicted in Figs. 9 and 10. Addition of excess challenger DNA to ongoing helicase reactions with unmodified DNA in the absence of ICP8 decreased DNA unwinding, indicating that the helicase-primase was efficiently competed from the DNA substrate and therefore nonprocessive (Fig.9 A). It has recently been suggested that ICP8 stimulates the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein by preventing its dissociation from the DNA substrate, thereby increasing its processivity (24Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may explain the stimulatory effect of ICP8 on the helicase-primase. However, we found that even high concentrations of ICP8 failed to prevent the dissociation of the helicase-primase from its substrate (Fig. 9 B). Moreover, the level of competition was similar in the absence or presence of ICP8 (Fig. 10), indicating that ICP8 does not increase the processivity of the helicase-primase. Interestingly, the level of competition observed with the platinated substrate in the presence of ICP8 was greater than for the unmodified substrate (Figs. 9 C and 10). These results suggest that thecis-DDP-d(GpG) lesion increases the dissociation rate of the helicase-primase from the DNA. Taken together with the relatively short half-life of the helicase-primase in the absence of DNA, these findings may in part explain the inhibitory nature of thecis-DDP-d(GpG) lesion (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). It is possible that ICP8 stimulates DNA unwinding by increasing the stability of the helicase-primase. However, we found no evidence in support of this mechanism. Rather, we favor a model in which ICP8 recruits the helicase-primase by direct protein-protein interactions (14Falkenberg M. Bushnell D.A. Elias P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the association rate of the helicase-primase with DNA and allowing it to unwind the platinated or unmodified DNA. The salient features of our model are depicted in Fig.11. In the absence of ICP8, the distributive nature of the helicase-primase causes the enzyme to cycle on and off unmodified DNA substrate. The presence of acis-DDP-d(GpG) lesion induces the enzyme to dissociate and also prevents the helicase-primase from binding to the substrate. In the presence of ICP8, specific protein-protein interactions between ICP8 and the helicase-primase (14Falkenberg M. Bushnell D.A. Elias P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22766-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) lead to recruitment of the helicase-primase to the ICP8-covered DNA substrate. Recruitment of the helicase-primase to the DNA substrate also occurs with the cisplatin-damaged DNA, thereby permitting the enzyme to unwind past the lesion. Because DNA helicases are among the first components of the DNA replication fork machinery that would encounter a site of DNA damage, it is important to understand how these enzymes interact with specific DNA lesions. Our previous (7Villani G. Pillaire M.J. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269(34): 21676-21681Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and current studies show that specific interactions between the helicase-primase or UL9 protein DNA helicase and ICP8 allow unwinding of cisplatin damaged DNA. In HSV-1 DNA replication, it has been shown that specific protein-protein interactions between ICP8, UL9 protein, and the subunits of the helicase-primase are required for the assembly of these proteins into prereplicative sites and that recruitment of the HSV-1 DNA polymerase into these sites is mediated by the UL42 subunit of the DNA polymerase (25Lukonis C.J.

In addition, the recent finding of an interaction between the UL8 subunit of the helicase-primase and the UL30 subunit of the DNA polymerase (27Marsden H.S. McLean G.W. Barnard E.C. Francis G.J.

In human small intestinal epithelial cells, LPH is synthesized as a single chain precursor (M r = 215,000) that undergoes core N-glycosylation while translocating into the ER. Possibly in the ER or in an intermediate compartment, LPH monomers form homodimers prior to Golgi processing (8Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). Along the pathway through the Golgi apparatus en route to the cell surface, theN-linked sugar chains are truncated, and carbohydrates are added, resulting in a complex-glycosylated protein (M r = 230,000), which is intracellulary cleaved to the mature brush border form of 160 kDa (9Danielsen E.M.

This intracellular processing was also observed in a transfected MDCK cell line, localizing the cleavage of the profragment to intracellular compartments after the trans-Golgi network (12Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of a full-length cDNA encoding LPH in COS-1 cells reveals an uncleaved pro-LPH at the cell surface with an enzymatic activity similar to that of the intestinal mature brush border 160-kDa species (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the intracellular proteolytic processing of pro-LPH in intestinal epithelial cells is not essential for acquisition of transport competence and biological function (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, neither the cleavage process nor the large profragment LPHα that is generated upon proteolytic cleavage of pro-LPH are implicated in the sorting event of LPH to the apical membrane (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent observations have strongly suggested that putative sorting signals of pro-LPH are exclusively located in the domain corresponding to the brush border-associated LPHβ. The gene coding for human LPH is located on chromosome 2 and contains 17 exons (14Boll W. Wagner P. Mantei N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 889-902PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kruse T.A. Bolund L.

The extracellular domain itself consists of a NH2-terminal cleavable signal peptide (19 amino acids) necessary for translocation into the ER (18Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) followed by four homologous regions with 38–55% identity to one another (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H.

The catalytic activity of lactase is localized to glutamine 1273 in the homologous region III, and the activity of phlorizin hydrolase is localized to glutamine 1749 in the homologous region IV (17Wacker H.

Because of the four homologous regions, LPH may have arisen from two gene duplications in evolution (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Bol W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G.

In the work presented here, we analyzed the intracellular transport and polarized sorting of deletion mutants in the extracellular domain IV of LPH contiguous to the transmembrane domain as well as the role of the membrane anchor in a transport-competent mutant, emphasizing the quaternary structure of the proteins. In a variety of membrane proteins such as low density lipoprotein receptor, sucrase-isomaltase and aminopeptidase N (19Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F.

This region, referred to as the “stalk region,” serves as a link between the globular protein and the plasma membrane. Putative factors implicated in a postulated active intracellular protein transport might interact with this region because of the membrane proximity. We demonstrate that a region that reveals features of a stalk region is neither obligatory for intracellular transport of membrane-bound LPH nor for its polarized sorting to the apical membrane. Furthermore, the deletion of 236 amino acids containing more than one-third of phlorizin-hydrolase (homologous region IV) including the catalytic domain has almost no influence on LPH dimerization and transport to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the further deletion of 87 amino acids in the phlorizin-hydrolase domain had significant effects on LPH dimerization and thus on intracellular transport of the protein without significant alterations in the tertiary protein structure. We propose an important role for parts of the phlorizin hydrolase domain in protein-protein interactions and thus in intracellular transport in addition to the physiological role, which is still unknown (5Colombo V.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-protein-disulfide isomerase was provided by Dr. Neil J. Bulleid (University of Manchester, UK). The secondary antibodies, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). The plasmid pLPH, containing the full-length cDNA of LPH inserted into the unique EcoRI site of vector pGEM4Z (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1), was used for cloning. For the construction of the deletion mutants LPH1646MACT and LPH1559MACT, the distal ClaI/EcoRI fragment of LPH was subcloned into the vector pBluescript II KS, and the resulting plasmid was completely digested either with BamHI (to obtain LPH1646MACT) or StuI (to obtain LPH1559MACT). TheBamHI restriction site was blunt ended by deleting the protruding nucleotides with T4-DNA polymerase. Subsequently, the plasmids were digested with EcoRI and were fused in frame to a PCR fragment consisting of the membrane anchor and the cytoplasmic tail (5658–6270 base pairs) (denoted MACT-PCR). The PCR fragment MACT-PCR was synthesized using the oligonucleotides LPH5658 and cLPH6270 as primers and the plasmid pLPH as a template. For molecular cloning, the PCR fragments were depleted of possible protruding nucleotides using T4 DNA-polymerase and were subsequently digested withEcoRI. The expression of the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains in the correct open reading frames was assessed by sequence analysis in each mutant, respectively. The foregoingEcoRI/ClaI fragments were inserted together with the appropriate distal LPH fragments into the single EcoRI site of the expression vector pCMV2. This plasmid exhibits the f1 origin of replication, the human growth hormone polyadenylation site and transcription terminator, the CMV promoter, and the SV40 early region promoter/enhancer and origin of replication (13Naim H.Y.

To construct mutant LPH1646, depleted of the membrane anchor and the cytoplasmic domain, the two extracellular LPH fragments, as described previously for the cloning of LPH1646MACT, were inserted into the vector pCMV2 (Fig. 2). This construction resulted in LPH1646 expression with the additional amino acid leucine located at the COOH terminus.Figure 2Schematic drawing of wild type and mutant LPH molecules.

They were transfected without DNA (mock) or 5 μg of the appropriate recombinant DNA using DEAE-dextran (for COS-1 cells) essentially as described before (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or polybrene (for MDCK cells) (12Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of LPH1646MACT in stable MDCK cells was assessed by immunoprecipitation of total cell extracts with anti-LPH mAb. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were labeled 48–60 h posttransfection with 80 μCi of [35S]methionine in methionine-free minimum essential medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. The labeling was either for 1 h, followed by a chase with an excess of nonlabeled methionine (2.5 mm) for different periods of time, or continuously. MDCK cells stably expressing LPH1646MACT were grown on filters as described before (12Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with [35S]methionine for 18 h. Surface antigens were immunoprecipitated by the addition of mAb anti-LPH to either the apical or basolateral compartments. The labeled cells were rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml/dish of cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the following mixture of protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml soybean-trypsin inhibitor. The cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g and 4 °C to remove nuclei and debris. The supernatants were incubated with anti-LPH antibodies and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed according to Ref. 11Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar. One-dimensional electrophoresis was performed on 6% acrylamide gels according to Ref.24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 80 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 7% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue at 100 °C for 5 min. Gels were fixed and soaked in 16% salicylic acid for signal amplification, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR 5 films at −70 °C. The following molecular mass standards were used: myosin (202 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylaseb (97.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (46 kDa). Endo-N-β-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) was used for the removal of N-linked mannose-rich carbohydrates and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/N-glycopeptidase F (PNGase F) was applied to deplete mannose-rich as well as complex N-linked sugar chains from the glycoproteins. Both endoglycosidases were purchased from Biolabs Corp. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-LPH as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were treated as described by the manufacturer, using 0.5 unit of endo H and 1 unit of PNGase F. For trypsin treatment, cells were solubilized in cold lysis buffer on ice without protease inhibitors. After centrifugation for 20 min at 17,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatants were incubated with 50 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for various periods of time. Trypsin was inactivated by adding 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and protease inhibitors (described above). The treated cell extracts were further processed for immunoprecipitation with mAb anti-LPH. At the 0 min time point, trypsin was added to the cell extracts at 37 °C, extracts were immediately removed from the incubator and placed on ice, and soybean trypsin inhibitor and protease inhibitors were added. Surface expression of mutant proteins in transfected COS-1 cells was studied in cells grown on coverslips. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and immunolabeling was performed using mAb anti-LPH (MLac1) at 1:100 dilution as primary antibody and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a 1:200 dilution as secondary antibody. The intracellular localization of LPH was assessed in transfected cells, which were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 after fixation. ER localization was confirmed by double-immunofluorescence staining with polyclonal anti-protein-disulfide isomerase and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions, respectively. The molecular mass of proteins in cell lysates was determined according to Ref. 25Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. COS-1 cells were transfected and biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were solubilized in 500 μl of 6 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 50 mmTris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (see above) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g and 4 °C to remove nuclei and debris. The supernatants were layered onto a continuous gradient from 10–30% (w/v) sucrose. This gradient was made on top of 600 μl of 50% (w/v) sucrose cushion, containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, pH 7.5. After centrifugation for 22 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C, 16 fractions (approximately 700 μl/fraction) were collected and immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-LPH and analyzed on 6% SDS-PAGE. To investigate the intracellular transport of LPH mutants as compared with wild type LPH, COS-1 cells were transfected with the plasmid pCMV2 containing the recombinant DNA of wild type and mutant LPH (Fig. 2). All cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-LPH MLac1 (23Maiuri L. Raia V. Potter J. Swallow D.M. Ho M.W. Fiocca R. Finzi G. Cornaggia M. Cappella C. Quaroni A. Auricchio S. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were treated in parallel with endo H to identify mannose-rich LPH molecules predominantly in the ER or with PNGase F to detect complex-glycosylated proteins in the Golgi apparatus and at the plasma membrane. Untreated immunoprecipitations were used as a control. Biosynthetic labeling for 18 h revealed that LPH1646MACT showed at steady state level almost the same amounts of mannose-rich (193 kDa) toward complex-glycosylated (200-kDa) molecules as wild type LPH (215 and 230 kDa) (Fig.3). The ratio of Golgi-localized LPH to ER-concentrated molecules is best shown in endo H-treated samples. The slight decrease in molecular weight of the complex-glycosylated proteins in these samples is due to the depletion of mannose-rich sugar chains in predominantly complex-glycosylated proteins. Either protein could be deglycosylated with PNGase F to molecular masses of 200 kDa for wild type LPH and 176 kDa for LPH1646MACT. In contrast, mutant LPH1559MACT exhibited only a slight amount of complex-glycosylated molecules (195 kDa), whereas the majority of the synthesized intracellular protein pool remained mannose-rich (190 kDa) (Fig. 3). The low quantity of Golgi-localized LPH1559MACT is shown in endo H-treated samples where complex-glycosylated molecules remained resistant to processing. Depletion of N-linked sugar chains could be achieved with PNGase F, resulting in a polypeptide with increased mobility to 166 kDa. These results indicate an inefficient intracellular transport of mutant protein LPH1559MACT from the ER to the Golgi and the plasma membrane. The deletion mutant LPH1646 (192 kDa), lacking the membrane anchor and the cytoplasmic domain was endo H-sensitive, resulting in deglycosylated molecules with apparentM r = 175,000 (Fig. 3). The findings suggest that this mutant remains in the ER as mannose-rich precursors at steady state. To determine the kinetics of intracellular transport of LPH mutants in COS-1 cells, pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine were performed. An interval of 7 h proved to be adequate for the transport of wild type LPH to the plasma membrane (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A depicts the results of the electrophoretic analyses of the immunoprecipitates, and Fig.4 B represents the quantification of these fluorograms. 1 h into the chase, 49% of wild type LPH and 31% of mutant LPH1646MACT were converted to the corresponding complex-glycosylated forms. The amount of complex-glycosylated molecules toward the high mannose forms increased during a prolonged chase. 96% of wild type LPH achieved complex-glycosylation after 5 h of chase, whereas LPH1646MACT attained the mature form of the protein after 7 h of chase. Both proteins seem to have different transport kinetics from the ER to the Golgi with a delay of LPH1646MACT of approximately 2 h. Nevertheless, mutant LPH1646MACT with a deletion of 236 amino acids in the ectodomain could be slowly but efficiently transported to the Golgi. By contrast, no more than 10% of mannose-rich LPH1559MACT was converted to the final glycosylated form (Fig. 4). Taken together, these and the data obtained after 18 h of continuous labeling of LPH1559MACT (Fig. 3) demonstrate that this mutant protein is inefficiently transported from the ER to the Golgi. We propose that a deletion of an additional extracellular 87 amino acids in the transport-competent mutant LPH1646MACT results in ER localization of the LPH1559MACT product. The mature LPH molecule is expressed at the cell surface of small intestinal brush border membranes (9Danielsen E.M. Skovbjerg H. Norén O. Sjo¨stro¨m H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as well as of transfected COS-1 cells (13Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular distribution of LPH mutants, transfected COS-1 cells were grown on coverslips and subsequently prepared for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of intact and permeabilized cells with the mAb anti-LPH MLac1. As shown in Fig.5 a, nonpermeabilized cells expressing the construct LPH1646MACT showed bright immunofluorescence staining with the antibody MLac1 at the cell surface. This clearly demonstrated that LPH1646MACT is correctly transported to the plasma membrane in COS-1 cells as predicted by its final complex-glycosylated molecules and consistent with the biochemical data shown in Figs. 3 and4. The permeabilization of the transfected cells with Triton X-100 revealed the intracellular distribution of the transfected protein (Fig. 5 b). The mAb MLac1 strongly labeled the Golgi and the ER of the transfected cells, but further MLac1 staining was observed at the periphery of the permeabilized cells. In contrast, the construct LPH1559MACT displayed relative faint immunofluorescence signals at the cell surface after staining with the mAb MLac1 (Fig. 5 c), while the prominent staining was confined to intracellular compartments (Golgi and ER) after permeabilization with Triton X-100 (Fig.5 d). The low staining of LPH1559MACT at the cell surface shows that a minor proportion of this construct has reached the cell surface. This is consistent with the biochemical data (Figs. 3 and 4) in which a low proportion of LPH1559MACT has been shown to acquire complex type of glycans. In contrast to LPH1646MACT, COS-1 cells transfected with the mutant LPH1646, lacking the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic domain, could not be localized at the cell surface (data not shown). However, the protein showed clear ER localization after permeabilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. 5 f) as assessed in double labeling experiments using protein-disulfide isomerase as a protein marker of the ER (Fig. 5, compare e andf). Further, the subcellular localization of LPH1646 is consistent with the biochemical data of this mutant (Fig. 3), in which we demonstrated that LPH1646 persists as a mannose-rich species. Previous investigations demonstrated that wild type LPH assembles as a homodimer in the ER and is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane (8Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the quate"
https://openalex.org/W2048696899,"The luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor, a seven-transmembrane receptor, is composed of two equal halves, the N-terminal extracellular exodomain and the C-terminal membrane-associated endodomain. Unlike most seven-transmembrane receptors, the exodomain alone is responsible for high affinity hormone binding, whereas signal is generated in the endodomain. These physical separations of hormone-binding and receptor activation sites are attributed to unique mechanisms for hormone binding and receptor activation of this receptor and its subfamily members. However, the precise hormone contact sites in the exodomain are unclear. In the preceding article (Hong, S., Phang, T., Ji, I., and Ji, T. H. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>273, 13835–13840), a region immediately downstream of the N terminus of the exodomain was shown to be crucial for hormone binding. To test if the region interacts with the hormone, human choriogonadotropin (hCG) was photoaffinity-labeled with a peptide mimic corresponding to Gly<sup>18</sup>–Tyr<sup>36</sup> of the receptor. This peptide mimic specifically photoaffinity-labeled both the α- and β-subunits of hCG. Interestingly, hCGα was preferentially labeled. On the other hand, denatured hCG was not labeled, and a mutant analog of the peptide failed to label hCG. Furthermore, the affinity labeling was UV-dependent and saturable, indicating the specificity of the photoaffinity labeling. Our results indicate that the region of the exodomain interacts with hCG and that the contact points are near both subunits of hCG. Particularly, the alternate residues (Leu<sup>20</sup>, Cys<sup>22</sup>, and Gly<sup>24</sup>) are crucial for hCG binding. In addition, the results underscore the fact that there is a crucial hormone contact site outside of the popularly believed primary hormone-binding site that is composed of Leu-rich repeats and is located in the middle of the exodomain. Our observations are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism through which the initial high affinity hormone binding leads to receptor activation in the endodomain."
https://openalex.org/W1979295881,"High level expression of many eukaryotic genes is achieved through the action of distal regulatory sequences or enhancers. We have utilized the interaction between the erythroid-specific enhancer in hypersensitivity site 2 (HS2) of the human beta-globin locus control region and the globin gene promoters as a model to elucidate the mechanisms governing promoter/enhancer interactions. HS2 contains a 400-base pair core element consisting of tandem AP1/NF-E2 motifs flanked by binding sites for multiple ubiquitous and erythroid-specific factors. We have compared the enhancer activity of this core element with a synthetic enhancer lacking the factor binding sites flanking the AP1/NF-E2 motif (HS2(M)). In fetal/erythroid K562 cells, enhancement of a linked gamma-promoter was significantly greater with wild-type HS2 than with HS2(M). In contrast, the increase in beta-promoter activity in these cells was equivalent with either enhancer fragment. Truncation of the binding site for the fetal/erythroid-specific stage selector protein in the gamma-promoter abolished the additional enhancer activity of HS2. Similarly, insertion of the stage selector protein site into the beta-promoter boosted enhancer activity observed with HS2 but not HS2(M). In adult erythroid MEL cells, enhancement of a linked beta-promoter was significantly greater with HS2 than with HS2(M). This effect was dependent on the binding of the adult stage-specific factor, erythroid Kruppel-like factor, to the beta-promoter. Taken together, this data suggests that the stage-specific factors binding the proximal globin promoters and the factors flanking the AP1/NF-E2 motif of HS2 act in synergy."
https://openalex.org/W2136231034,"Abstract Varicella-zoster virus open reading frame 4-encoded protein (IE4) possesses transactivating properties for varicella-zoster virus genes as well as for those of heterologous viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Mechanisms of HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) transactivation were investigated in HeLa cells transiently transfected with an IE4 expression plasmid and a CAT reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR. These results demonstrated that IE4-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in HeLa cells required transcription factor κB (NF-κB). Using the gel retardation assay, it was shown that transfection of the IE4 expression vector in HeLa cells was not associated with induction of NF-κB under the p50·p65 heterodimeric form and that no direct binding of IE4 to the κB sites could be detected. Both Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses suggested that the ability of IE4 to activate transcription through κB motives was not connected with its capacity to override the inhibitory activities of IκB-α or p105. Finally, in vitroprotein-protein interactions involving IE4 and basal transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein and transcription factor IIB were carried out. A direct interaction between IE4 and TATA-binding protein or transcription factor IIB components of the basal complex of transcription was evidenced, as well as binding to the p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits. Mutagenesis analysis of IE4 indicated that the COOH-terminal cysteine-rich and arginine-rich regions (residues 82–182) were critical for transactivation, whereas the first 81 amino acids appeared dispensable. Moreover, the arginine-rich region is required for the in vitro binding activity, whereas the COOH-terminal end did not appear essential."
