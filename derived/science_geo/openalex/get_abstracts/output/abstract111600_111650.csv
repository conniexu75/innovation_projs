https://openalex.org/W1481422886,"Several chemotactic agonists including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and related cytokines have been shown to activate and attract leukocytes via seven-transmembrane domain, GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors. A cDNA clone, LESTR, encoding a protein of 352 amino acids, corresponding to a novel receptor of this type, was isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library. The sequence of the deduced protein, LESTR (leukocyte-derived seven-transmembrane domain receptor), has 92.6% identity with that of a recently reported bovine neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor, boLCR1 (Rimland, J., Xin, W., Sweetnam, P., Saijoh, K., Nestler, E. J., and Duman, R. S. (1991) Mol. Pharmacol. 40, 869-875). LESTR, however, is more similar (> 34%) to the IL-8 receptors, IL-8R1 and IL-8R2, than to several NPY receptors of different origin (< 20%). In the monocyte library, LESTR cDNA fragments were about 20 times as frequent as cDNA coding for IL-8R1 and IL-8R2, and much higher levels of LESTR- than IL-8R-specific mRNA were found in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. LESTR transcripts, by contrast, were low or undetectable in several neuroblastoma cell lines that are widely used to study NPY functions. Transfected cells expressing high levels of LESTR mRNA did not bind radiolabeled NPY, IL-8, NAP-2, GRO alpha, PF4, IP10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, HC14, I309, RANTES, C3a, or LTB4. NPY also failed to bind to neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, to elicit responses in vitro such as Ca2+ changes, shape change, chemotaxis, enzyme release, and the respiratory burst, and to induce leukocyte accumulation upon injection in rats and rabbits. Although the ligand for LESTR could not be identified among a large number of chemotactic cytokines, the high expression in white blood cells and the marked sequence relation to IL-8R1 and IL-8R2 suggest that LESTR may function in the activation of inflammatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541488575,"A proton pump, the vacuolar ATPase, is known to generate the acidic lumenal environment of endosomes and lysosomes. We have investigated the role of the vacuolar ATPase in endocytic membrane traffic by combining electron microscopy in vivo with a cell-free assay that reconstitutes endosome fusion in vitro. Our observations show that inactivation of this proton pump with bafilomycin A1 has no significant effects on internalization or recycling back to the plasma membrane. However, early endosomes become highly tubular and endocytosed markers do not appear in late endosomes. Our data strongly suggest that, upon inactivation of the proton pump, the formation of a vesicular intermediate between early and late endosomes, which we term endosomal carrier vesicle, is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1514298611,"Porphyromonas gingivalis contains many virulence factors that have been implicated as participants in the progression of periodontal disease. It has been shown to produce proteinases of trypsin-like specificity in a number of molecular forms, but previous work in our laboratory resulted in the purification of a major arginine-specific cysteine proteinase, gingipain, which contradicted this supposed specificity. In this study, separate proteinases with arginine and lysine specificity were isolated from a high molecular mass fraction of the P. gingivalis culture fluid. The arginine-specific enzyme was found, by amino acid sequencing studies, to be a high molecular mass form of gingipain, formed by the 50-kDa gingipain noncovalently complexed with 44-kDa binding proteins, subsequently identified as hemagglutinins. The 60-kDa lysine-specific proteinase, referred to as Lys-gingipain, was also found to have one of these hemagglutinins complexed with it in the same manner. Lys-gingipain was found to be a cysteine proteinase with optimal activity and stability at pH 8.0-8.5 and was extensively characterized in terms of its specificity and activation characteristics. The proteinase-hemagglutinin complexes may be important in the uptake of hemin, a vital metabolite for P. gingivalis, via hemagglutination and subsequent hemolysis of erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1529220262,"Mammalian cells accumulate reduced folates and methotrexate, a folate antagonist, through the reduced-folate carrier (RFC) (Goldman, I.D., Lichtenstein, N.S., and Oliverio, V.T. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 5007-5017). This study describes the isolation and expression of a cDNA clone that restores RFC activity to human breast cancer cells defective in this transporter. The cDNA cancer cells defective in this transporter. The cDNA codes for a peptide (mRFC1) of 58 kDa, whose hydropathy plot, resembling those of mammalian sugar transporters, predicts that it may be a member of a superfamily of transporter genes. Transfection of methotrexate-resistant (MTXR) ZR-75-1 cells with an expression vector, pRFC1, that codes for this peptide restores their ability to accumulate methotrexate. Furthermore, transport of methotrexate into pRFC1-transfected cells is blocked by a 10-fold molar excess of the reduced folate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid, but is unaffected by folic acid. The increase in methotrexate uptake that is observed in pRFC1-transfected MTXR ZR-75-1 cells reverses their resistance to this antitumor agent."
https://openalex.org/W1687309826,"The PIM1 nuclear gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease that exhibits over 30% identity with ATP-dependent protease La from Escherichia coli, Lon from Bacillus brevis, and one from Myxococcus xanthus. In addition, Pim1 is 1133 amino acids long and has a putative mitochondrial import signal in the N-terminal region. Enzymatic comparisons of normal PIM1+ and deficient pim1-delta strains revealed that the ATP-dependent protease is located within the mitochondrial matrix. The pim1-delta strains are unable to utilize nonfermentable substrates as the sole carbon source and are unable to maintain functional mitochondrial DNA, indicating that the Pim1 protease is required for mitochondrial function. PIM1 mRNA is constitutively expressed but is increased after thermal stress, suggesting that Pim1 may play a role in the heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W2112120783,"Quercetin is highly mutagenic in vitro, yet is not carcinogenic when administered chronically at large doses to rodents for 12 months. We hypothesized that catechol-O-methyltransferase-catalyzed O-methylation of quercetin and other mutagenic catechol-containing flavonoids may provide an efficient inactivation in vivo and may therefore prevent tumor induction by these flavonoids. After one intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg quercetin to hamsters, a urinary ether extract contained 2% quercetin and 97% 3‘-O-methylquercetin. When the urine was treated first with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase, 13% quercetin and 87% 3‘-O-methylquercetin were recovered. Quercetin was rapidly O-methylated by either porcine liver or hamster kidney catechol-O-methyltransferase, with Km values of 6.1 and 6.9 microM and Vmax values of 14,870 and 200 pmol/mg of protein/min, respectively. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine exhibited a potent feedback inhibition of the catechol-O-methyltransferase-catalyzed O-methylation of quercetin by a competitive mechanism with respect to S-adenosyl-L-methionine and by a competitive plus noncompetitive mechanism with respect to the substrate. A comparison of the O-methylation rates and kinetic characteristics (Km, Vmax, and Vmax/Km) demonstrated that rates of O-methylation of quercetin and fisetin were up to three orders of magnitude higher than those of catechol estrogens and catecholamines. In conclusion, the rapid metabolic inactivation of mutagenic flavonoids catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase may be a major reason for the lack of their carcinogenic activities in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1502625840,"Potent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor agonists, adenophostin A and B, were found from fungal products. In spite of the striking structural difference from IP3, adenophostins were found to inhibit [3H]IP3 binding more potently than IP3: the Ki values for adenophostin A and B were both calculated to be 0.18 nM, while that of IP3 was 15 nM. Adenophostins induced Ca2+ release both from cerebellar microsomes and from intracellular Ca2+ stores in permeabilized NG108-15 cells. Adenophostins at concentration as low as 1 nM produced a significant Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes, and their activities were 100-fold more potent than IP3. In addition, heparin, an IP3 receptor antagonist, completely blocked the Ca2+ releasing activity of adenophostins. Adenophostins were resistant to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by IP3-metabolizing enzymes, thereby providing a possible explanation for their prolonged activities. Adenophostin also bound to plasma membrane IP3 receptor with a high affinity and inhibited [3H]IP3 binding to jurkat human T-cell plasma membranes: the IC50 value for adenophostin A was 0.95 nM. Adenophostin may prove to be a powerful tool for investigating the physiological properties of IP3 and its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1519162499,"Platelet aggregation is mediated by the interaction of fibrinogen with platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, a member of the integrin family (integrin alpha IIb beta 3). Three different binding sites on fibrinogen for IIb-IIIa have been proposed, two RGD-containing sequences in the alpha chain and one dodecapeptide sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain. However, recent evidence shows that mutations in either of the alpha chain sequences have no effect on platelet aggregation, whereas the substitution of a variant gamma chain (gamma') for the gamma chain results in a major reduction in platelet aggregation activity. The present investigation demonstrates that the gamma' chain shows decreased binding to IIb-IIIa as measured by direct binding experiments. In addition, adhesion studies indicate that the binding of both stimulated and unstimulated platelets to immobilized fibrinogens is mediated primarily through the gamma chain carboxyl terminus. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain inhibits fibrinogen binding and platelet adhesion, whereas a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the gamma' chain is significantly less inhibitory. These data show that the defective platelet aggregation activity of the fibrinogen gamma' chain is due to decreased binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1481228136,"We have reported that 3-estradiol-beta-D-xyloside primes heparan sulfate synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary cells and that the proportion of heparan sulfate made rises with increasing concentration of xyloside (Lugemwa, F.N. and Esko, J.D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6674-6677). Using estradiol as a guide, we varied the structure of the aglycone and showed that beta-D-xylosides containing two fused aromatic rings efficiently prime heparan sulfate. Thus, 2-naphthol-beta-D-xyloside primed heparan sulfate at low dose ("
https://openalex.org/W1513600037,"The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is a calmodulin-regulated P-type ATPase that is an essential element in controlling intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Studies on the gene structure of this pump have revealed an alternate splice option that changes the structure of the calmodulin-binding domain. This change in the structure of the enzyme results in a reduced calmodulin affinity. Tests of the enzyme's activity in the presence of a high calmodulin concentration, approximating that found inside living cells, show that this reduced calmodulin affinity causes a reduced apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+. This shift in the Ca2+ activation occurs in a Ca2+ concentration range crucial to cellular function and is probably the physiologically important consequence of the alternate splice."
https://openalex.org/W1559597555,"We have previously shown that phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3'-kinase is activated by the binding of proteins or peptides containing the phosphorylated motif Y(P)XXM. In the present study, we examine interactions between PtdIns 3'-kinase and the human insulin receptor, which contains a C-terminal phosphorylation site in the sequence Y1322THM. Partially purified insulin receptors bound tightly to bacterial fusion proteins containing the N- or C-terminal SH2 domains from PtdIns 3'-kinase regulatory subunit (p85). In contrast, a mutant insulin receptor, truncated by 43 amino acids at the C terminus (IR delta CT), bound poorly to the SH2 domains; these mutant receptors have normal kinase activity but lack the Y1322THM motif. Similarly, incubation with wild-type receptors increased the activity of immunopurified PtdIns 3'-kinase, whereas incubation with IR delta CT receptors did not affect PtdIns 3'-kinase activity. Activation of PtdIns 3'-kinase by the wild-type receptor was mimicked by a tyrosyl phosphopeptide derived from the insulin receptor C terminus and containing the Y1322THM motif; non-phosphorylated peptide did not affect activity. Thus, the insulin receptor C terminus activates PtdIns 3'-kinase in vitro by binding to the SH2 domains of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit. These data support the hypothesis that binding of tyrosyl-phosphorylated receptors to p85 SH2 domains is a general mechanism for PtdIns 3'-kinase activation, and they suggest that direct interactions between the insulin receptor and PtdIns 3'-kinase may provide an alternative pathway for the activation of this enzyme by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1517969155,"This report describes the design, construction, and expression of a bivalent bispecific single-chain antibody (SCA) protein in Escherichia coli. The bispecificity of the bivalent protein was based on two previously constructed monovalent single-chain antibody molecules possessing distinct specificities, SCA 4-4-20 (anti-fluorescein) and SCA 04-01 (anti-single-stranded DNA). A flexible linker, modeled after a secreted fungal cellulase protein, was incorporated as the interdomain linker covalently joining the two active sites. Bivalent bispecific SCA protein that accumulated in bacteria as insoluble inclusion bodies was harvested, denatured, refolded, and affinity-purified in vitro. Affinity-purified bivalent bispecific SCA showed nearly identical ligand binding properties at each site relative to the individual monovalent single-chain antibody prototype molecules. In both solid and solution phase binding assays, the bivalent bispecific single-chain antibody simultaneously bound both ligands (fluorescein and (dT)6). Construction of a model bivalent bispecific molecule provides a foundation for future assembly of similar molecules designed to identify parameters involved in enhanced binding of antibodies due to avidity and dual specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1569638668,"The alpha 2 beta 1 serves as a collagen receptor or a collagen/laminin receptor, depending upon cell type. Expression of the integrin is regulated during normal cellular differentiation and is altered during carcinogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that increased expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin during megakaryocytic differentiation is a consequence of increased alpha 2 mRNA due to transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 integrin gene and that the decreased expression of the integrin in breast adenocarcinoma is due to decreased steady-state levels of alpha 2 mRNA. We now report the identification and characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the alpha 2 integrin gene. The 5'-untranslated region of the alpha 2 mRNA extends 129 base pairs 5' to the site of translation initiation. The promoter region lacks TATA and CAAT boxes but contains an abbreviated initiator sequence and six Sp1 binding sites. Consensus binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2 complexes, a GATA box, a Pu.1 box, and two palindromic motifs with potential to bind the estrogen receptor are also present. A 961-base pair fragment of the 5'-flanking region directs both cell type- and differentiation-specific expression of a reporter gene in T47-D epithelial cells and in pluripotent hematopoietic K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2272491990,"Olfaction is mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. In isolated rat olfactory cilia, odorants such as citralva stimulate a burst of cAMP, which peaks in 50 ms and returns almost to base-line level within 150 ms in the continuing presence of odorant. This desensitization is mediated by the cAMP dependent protein kinase and a specialized G protein-coupled receptor kinase originally termed beta ARK2 (GRK3). In vitro experiments suggest that the prenylated beta gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins target the cytosolic beta ARK1 (GRK2) enzyme to its membrane bound receptor substrate by binding to sites in its carboxyl terminus. Here we demonstrate that odorants stimulate translocation of GRK3 from cytosol to membranes in isolated rat olfactory cilia. We introduced a glutathione S-transferase-GRK3ct fusion protein, containing the carboxyl-terminal 222 amino acid residues of GRK3, which includes the beta gamma binding site, or a 28-amino acid peptide derived therefrom, into permeabilized cilia preparations. These reagents block odorant-mediated enzyme translocation and desensitization while markedly attenuating odorant-stimulated phosphorylation of olfactory proteins. These findings suggest that beta gamma-subunits may physiologically regulate a G protein-coupled receptor kinase and that enzyme translocation may be a general and required feature of the activity of some members of this enzyme family."
https://openalex.org/W1519079218,"Abstract The products of two phosphodiesterase (PDE) genes (ratPDE3/IVd and ratPDE4/IVb) are present in the rat Sertoli cell in culture, and their expression is under the control of the gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (Swinnen, J.V., Tsikalas, K.E., and Conti, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18370-18377). To understand the basis of the sequence heterogeneity found in the 5'-region of the different cDNAs thus far characterized, the structure of the coding region of these two cAMP PDE genes was investigated. Analysis of five ratPDE3/IVd and ratPDE4/IVb genomic clones showed that the coding region of these genes expressed in the Sertoli cell is divided into 11 exons distributed over 35-45 kilobases of genomic DNA. The intron/exon boundaries agreed, with some exceptions, with the established consensus sequences and were located in the same position in the coding region of the two genes. Also present were similarities to the exon composition of the Drosophila melanogaster dunce gene, the ancestor of these mammalian cAMP PDEs. Multiple AUG codons and short open reading frames were present at the 5'-untranslated end of the ratPDE4/IVb mRNA, but not in the ratPDE3 mRNA. By using polymerase chain reaction amplification or Northern analysis, it was determined that at least two forms of ratPDE3/IVd mRNA are present in rat Sertoli and FRTL-5 thyroid cells, but not in the brain. These mRNA variants are generated by inclusion or removal of an intron sequence that produces a frameshift affecting the position of the initiation AUG codon. Both mRNA species were efficiently translated into cAMP PDE proteins with different molecular masses in a transient transfection assay in COS cells. Polymerase chain reaction amplification demonstrated that heterogeneity of ratPDE4/IVb mRNAs was present in the same location as in the ratPDE3/IVd mRNA. Two ratPDE4/IVb mRNAs with different 5'-ends were expressed in Sertoli and FRTL-5 cells and in the brain. This heterogeneity is caused by the presence of an intron promoter that controls the transcription of this mRNA in Sertoli and FRTL-5 cells, but not in the brain. Upstream exons and additional promoters are probably present and necessary to generate the brain-specific mRNAs. These findings demonstrate that the cAMP-specific PDE genes have complex structure and that cAMP PDE proteins with different amino termini are derived from these genes."
https://openalex.org/W1482125983,"The intracellular portion of the epidermal growth factor receptor consists of a tyrosine kinase domain of approximately 290 amino acids and a COOH-terminal regulatory domain of approximately 230 amino acids that contains five sites of autophosphorylation. The effect of autophosphorylation on the conformation of the intracellular domain has been analyzed using gel filtration. Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the intracellular domain exist as monomers and as dimers and appear to have an extended conformation. The Stokes' radii of phosphorylated monomers and dimers were larger than those of the dephosphorylated forms, indicating that the dephosphorylated form is more compact. These results indicate that a significant conformational change occurs in the intracellular portion of the epidermal growth factor receptor upon tyrosine autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1501782029,"When incubated at pH 7.3, 37 degrees C, human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator accumulated 0.77 mol of isoaspartate per mol of plasminogen activator over a 14-day period. Isoaspartate was detected by enzymatic transfer of 3H-labeled methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine in a reaction catalyzed by protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase. Analysis of tryptic peptides derived from aged plasminogen activator revealed that the two major sites of isoaspartate accumulation resulted from deamidation of Asn58 in the sequence -FNGG- and Asn177 in the sequence -GNSD-. Significant levels of isoaspartate also accumulated via deamidation of Asn37 in the sequence -CNSG-. All three sites occur in sequences predicted from studies with synthetic peptide to be unstable. All three sites appear to be on the surface of the protein, and all three occur in regions of the protein predicted to have higher than average chain mobility. These findings add support to the idea that sequence and flexibility play major roles in determining susceptibility to deamidation and peptide bond isomerization at Asn and Asp sites under mild conditions. These studies also illustrate the utility of enzymatic methylation for characterizing sites of deamidation in a large protein that contains numerous disulfide bonds and several sites of glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1530880901,"Chemotactic signaling by the human neutrophil N-formyl peptide receptor requires its association with heterotrimeric G protein. Synthetic peptides and a fusion protein derived from the intracellular regions of the receptor were used to identify sites which interact with G protein. A peptide derived from the second intracellular loop (C12R), and peptides (F15R and S22L) and a fusion protein derived from the receptor's carboxyl terminus inhibited binding of anti-Gi alpha antibody (R16,17) to Gi alpha in a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay, and antagonized pertussis-toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha. C12R also inhibited G protein-dependent, high affinity ligand binding to the receptor and physical coupling of receptor to G protein. In contrast, a peptide consisting of the entire third loop of the N-formyl peptide receptor was totally inactive in these assays. Collectively, these data suggest that the second intracellular loop and the carboxyl-terminal tail are important for effective N-formyl peptide receptor/G protein coupling, but that the third intracellular loop is less important in coupling, unlike previous findings with other G protein-coupled receptor systems. The chemoattractant receptor family may rely on different structural determinants to interact with GTP-binding proteins."

The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA shows significant similarity to those of sulfite oxidase from chicken liver and nitrate reductases from algal, fungal, and plant sources. Two cysteine residues are conserved in all of these proteins, and it is proposed that one or both of these cysteines serve as ligands to molybdenum. The gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli to a level equivalent to that observed in rat liver. The recombinant enzyme has been found to contain the molybdopterin form of the molybdenum cofactor and is active as determined by the sulfite dependent reduction of cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1553559275,"Abstract Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) catalyzes the terminal step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX. Herein we report the expression, purification, and characterization of the mature processed form of human and mouse ferrochelatase in Escherichia coli JM109. Metal analysis of the recombinant normal human ferrochelatase reveals that there are approximately 2 iron atoms/molecule of enzyme. This, along with the presence of spectral absorbance near 320 nm, is strongly suggestive that recombinant mammalian ferrochelatase as expressed in E. coli may contain an iron sulfur cluster. Two human protoporphyric ferrochelatases, F417S and M267I, were also expressed and characterized. The M267I mutant possesses the same Km and Vmax as the normal enzyme but exhibits increased thermolability when compared with normal human ferrochelatase. The F417S mutant has less than 2% of the normal activity. Since the Phe-->Ser substitution in this mutation is both chemically and structurally significant, three single amino acid substitutions (Lys, Tyr, and Trp) were engineered and characterized. None of these resulted in a protein with wild type activity. Additionally the carboxyl-terminal 10-amino acid segment, which contains Phe-417, from the yeast sequence was substituted, but this construct had no activity. Elimination of the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acid residues (which include Phe-417) results in a protein the same length as the bacterial ferrochelatases, but it is an inactive enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1670023673,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the N-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop (i3) of muscarinic and other G protein-coupled receptors is of pivotal importance for G protein recognition and activation. The present study was designed to identify specific amino acids within this domain required for muscarinic receptor-induced activation of G proteins mediating stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis. Among the five mammalian muscarinic receptors (m1-m5), only the m1, m3, and m5 receptors are efficiently coupled to this second messenger pathway. Initially, we created a series of rat m3 receptor mutants in which short segments in the N terminus of the i3 loop were replaced with the corresponding m2 receptor sequences. The effect of these substitutions on m3 receptor-mediated stimulation of PI hydrolysis was studied in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. We found that a stretch of 4 amino acids (Arg252-Ile253-Tyr254-Lys255) located at the beginning of the i3 domain of the m3 muscarinic receptor is critically involved in receptor-mediated stimulation of PI hydrolysis. Further mutational analysis of this 4-amino acid segment by single amino acid substitutions demonstrated that only Tyr254 is essential for efficient activation of the PI pathway. This tyrosine residue is conserved among all PI-coupled muscarinic receptors as well as in many other biogenic amine and glycoprotein hormone receptors, suggesting that it may also play an important functional role in other G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2163150802,"Two residues are known to play important catalytic roles in fatty acyl-thioester hydrolase, thioesterase II: Ser-101, the site of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate, and His-237 which is within hydrogen bonding distance of Ser-101 and facilitates catalysis by increasing the nucleophilicity of this residue. In this study we have examined the effect of mutations at these two residues on the ability of the enzyme to function as a hydrolase and, in the presence of a thiol acceptor, as an acyltransferase. In the hydrolase reaction kcat values for the wild-type, H237R, S101C, and S101C, H237R thioesterase enzymes were 0.11,"
https://openalex.org/W1521785588,"Type VII collagen is the major component of anchoring fibrils in the cutaneous basement membrane zone. In this study, we have examined the effects of various cytokines on the expression of types I and VII collagen genes in dermal fibroblasts in culture. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and leukoregulin (LR) strongly elevated (approximately 5-9-fold) type VII collagen mRNA levels, as measured by Northern blot hybridizations. These effects were also observed at the protein level by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody specific for type VII collagen. By contrast, IL-1 beta had only a slight stimulatory effect (approximately 2-fold) on type I collagen gene expression, while TNF-alpha and LR markedly reduced type I collagen mRNA steady-state levels. Interestingly, IL-1, TNF-alpha and LR had additive effects with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on type VII collagen gene expression, whereas they counteracted the up-regulatory effect of TGF-beta on type I collagen gene expression. Thus, our data indicate that the modulation of type I and type VII collagen gene expression by cytokines involves different regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1596332074,"To better understand the mechanisms regulating myoplasmic Ca2+ during muscle activity, we have examined the effect of inorganic phosphate (P(i)) on the ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We report that P(i) at concentrations reached in exercising skeletal muscle (3-30 mM) produced a dose-dependent stimulation of ryanodine binding to skeletal muscle SR. Ryanodine binding was increased by 84% in the presence of 30 mM P(i) with half-maximal stimulation at 4 mM P(i). In contrast to its effect on skeletal muscle SR, ryanodine binding to cardiac muscle SR was not stimulated by P(i) (3-30 mM). Stimulation of ryanodine binding to skeletal muscle SR was maximal in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ and was associated with an increased affinity of the RyR for ryanodine (Kd = 204 nM in the absence, versus 107 nM in the presence of 10 mM P(i)). P(i) (10 mM) also increased the rate of Ca2+ release from 45Ca(2+)-filled skeletal muscle SR vesicles by 50% in the presence of micromolar Ca2+. Conversely, arsenate and sulfate (10 mM) had no effect on either ryanodine binding or Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, demonstrating the specificity of the P(i) effect. Single-channel recordings of purified skeletal muscle SR RyR incorporated into planar lipid bilayers showed that addition of 10 mM P(i) to the cis chamber increased the open probability of the channel by 91%. These results demonstrate that concentrations of P(i) which occur in vivo during exercise significantly stimulate the in vitro activity of the skeletal muscle RyR Ca2+ release channel."
https://openalex.org/W1558071796,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-regulated transcription factors that bind to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) as monomers and homodimers, and as heterodimers with nuclear proteins such as TR auxiliary proteins and retinoid X receptors. Recently, bacterially expressed human TR beta-1 (hTR beta-1) was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by HeLa cytosolic extract. However, little is known about the consequences of phosphorylation on the nature of TR complexes. Therefore, we studied the effect of phosphorylation on TR binding of TREs. Bacterially expressed hTR beta-1 was phosphorylated in vitro with ATP by HeLa cytosolic extract. The ratio of phosphoserine to phosphothreonine was approximately 5:1. We then analyzed phosphorylated hTR beta-1 binding to several TREs by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Phosphorylated hTR beta-1 bound better as a homodimer to the TREs than hTR beta-1 incubated with preheated cytosolic extract. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of the phosphorylated hTR beta-1 eliminated the enhanced homodimer binding to DNA. In contrast, phosphorylation did not affect TR/TR auxiliary protein or TR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer binding to DNA. Triiodothyronine decreased both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated hTR beta-1 homodimer binding to several TREs, and the addition of okadaic acid did not alter this triiodothyronine effect. These results indicate that phosphorylation, in addition to ligand binding, modulates TR dimer binding to TREs. As such, it is possible that phosphorylation may also participate in TR-mediated regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1560066585,"The bacteriophage T4 tsL141 (A737V) mutant in T4 DNA polymerase is temperature-sensitive for DNA replication and an antimutator for some types of mutations. In the accompanying paper (Spacciapoli, P., and Nossal, N. G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 438-446), we show that the purified A737V T4 DNA polymerase is less processive than the wild type enzyme as a polymerase, but is more processive as an exonuclease. The bacteriophage T4 multienzyme replication complex reconstituted with the A737V mutant polymerase is defective in both lagging and leading strand synthesis. On lagging strand templates, the A737V polymerase is stimulated by the gene 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins and the gene 32 DNA binding protein, but is still arrested at pause sites much more frequently than the wild type. In contrast to wild type T4 DNA polymerase, the A737V polymerase does not catalyze leading strand synthesis on a forked duplex template with the polymerase accessory proteins, 32 protein, and the gene 41 protein helicase. The A737V polymerase requires the T4 gene 59 helicase assembly protein, as well as the other proteins, to carry out this reaction. Each of these defects is suppressed by the intragenic L771F mutation that suppresses the antimutator phenotype of the A737V, polymerase in vivo (Reha-Krantz, L. J., Stocki, S., Nonay, R., and Maughan, C. (1989) J. Cell. Biochem. 13D, 140)."
https://openalex.org/W1607134889,"The gene coding for mouse cardiac troponin I (TnI) has been cloned and sequenced. The cardiac TnI gene contains 8 exons and has an exon-intron organization similar to the quail fast skeletal TnI gene except for the region of exons 1-3, which is highly divergent. Comparative analysis suggests that cardiac TnI exon 1 corresponds to fast TnI exons 1 and 2 and that cardiac exon 3, which codes for most of the cardiac-specific amino-terminal extension and has no counterpart in the fast gene, evolved by exon insertion/deletion. The amino acid sequence of cardiac TnI exon 4 shows limited homology (36% identity) with fast TnI exon 4 but is remarkably similar (79% identity) to the corresponding sequence of slow TnI, possibly reflecting an isoform-specific TnC-binding site. The cardiac TnI gene is one of the very few contractile protein genes expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle. To identify the regulatory sequences responsible for the cardiac-specific expression of this gene we transfected cultured cardiac and skeletal muscle cells with fragments up to 4.0 kilobases of the 5'-flanking region linked to a reporter gene. Deletion analysis reveals four major regions in the 5'-flanking sequence, a minimal promoter region, which directs expression at low level in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, and two upstream cardiac-specific positive regions separated by a negative region."
https://openalex.org/W1531713383,"The bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase mutant A737V (tsL141 and tsCB120) was originally characterized as temperature-sensitive for DNA replication and an antimutator for transition mutations. Its antimutator phenotype is suppressed by the L771F mutation (Reha-Krantz, L. J., Stocki, S., Nonay, R., and Maughan, C. (1989) J. Cell. Biochem. 13D, 140). We find that the A737V polymerase arrests much more frequently than the wild type when polymerizing on primed single-stranded DNA templates. Although the 3‘–>5‘ exonuclease of the mutant is indistinguishable from the wild type on single-stranded DNA, it is more active than the wild type on duplex DNA. In a single encounter with the primer, the wild type polymerase can incorporate more than 50 nucleotides. The processivity of the A737V polymerase is less than the wild type as a polymerase, but is greater than the wild type as an exonuclease. The L771F polymerase resembles the wild type in each of these properties, while the double mutant (A737V, L771F) is intermediate between the two single mutants. Kinetic studies of wild type T4 DNA polymerase (Capson, T. L., Peliska, J. A., Kaboord, B. F., Frey, M. W., Lively, C., Dahlberg, M., and Benkovic, S. J. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 10984-10994) suggest that DNA binds first to the polumerase active site, before adopting a configuration in which it can be hydrolyzed by the exonuclease. Within this framework, our studies suggest that DNA moves more readily from the polymerase- to the exonuclease-competent configuration on the A737V mutant polymerase, and that this movement is decreased by the compensating L771F mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1558802969,"Sea anemone toxins are potentially important tools for understanding the pharmacology of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. We have previously described a bacterial expression system capable of producing large amounts of one such toxin, anthopleurin B (ApB), which delays channel repolarization (Gallagher, M. J., and Blumenthal K. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13958-13963). It has been suggested that cationic residues are a major determinant of anemone toxin binding. In this paper, we describe characterization of three mutants at each of two unique cationic sites of ApB, Arg-12 and Lys-49. The activities of all mutants on cardiac and neuronal sodium channels have been compared with that of wild-type ApB. Mutation of Lys-49 has relatively minor effects on toxicity, whereas the mutant R12A, but not R12S or R12K, is severely impaired. These results indicate that cationic residues per se are not absolutely required at either position, but that polar side chains at position 12 contribute significantly to binding affinity. Furthermore, Arg-12 appears to be involved in the toxin's ability to discriminate between neuronal and cardiac sodium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1587532924,"Prior incubation of the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase depleted of endogenous nucleotides (nd-MF1) with saturating ADP in the presence or absence of Mg2+ induces inhibition of hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP or ITP. After incubation of nd-MF1 with free ADP, inhibition develops hysteretically which is characterized by an uninhibited initial rate which decelerates to an inhibited, steady-state rate. When prior incubation of nd-MF1 is performed with ADP in the presence of Mg2+, the enzyme is partially inhibited when diluted into assay medium and more extensive inhibition develops hysteretically during turnover. Correlation of binding of [14C]ADP, in the presence or absence of Mg2+, with the extent of hysteretic inhibition induced suggests that maximal inhibition occurs when at least two noncatalytic sites are filled with ADP. Hysteretic inhibition is also induced by prior incubation of the enzyme with 2-N3-ADP. Prior incubation of nd-MF1 with increasing concentrations of 2-N3-[beta-32P]ADP, in the presence or absence of Mg2+, increases the extent of induced inhibition which correlates with increasing derivatization of tyrosine beta 368 following irradiation of loaded enzyme. This demonstrates that binding of ADP to noncatalytic sites is, in part, responsible for induction of hysteretic inhibition. After inducing inhibition by prior incubation with ADP, the steady-state kinetic behavior of nd-MF1 differs from that of uninhibited enzyme. Lineweaver-Burk plots of steady-state rates of inhibited enzyme as a function of ATP concentration are linear rather than biphasic which is observed for uninhibited enzyme. The composite results suggest that prior saturation of noncatalytic sites of nd-MF1 with ADP prevents activation of the enzyme by blocking the binding of ATP to these sites which is necessary to promote dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1837344999,"Abstract In RNA from human IgE-producing lymphocytes, we previously discovered two alternatively spliced epsilon-immunoglobulin mRNA isoforms that encode a novel secreted form of IgE and a membrane-bound species. Further analysis using epsilon-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions has elucidated several additional alternatively spliced species of epsilon mRNA. One RNA isoform is generated by splicing the CH4 exon to a novel distal splice acceptor site, forming an epsilon RNA species (designated CH4-M2) that encodes a secreted epsilon protein 6 amino acids larger than the classic secreted epsilon protein. The other three novel epsilon RNAs are generated by splicing from within CH4 to a new exon structure (designated CH5) that is located between CH4 and the membrane exons. Since the three new mRNAs using CH5 share the same stop codon in CH5, they all encode the same novel protein, which is 10 amino acids shorter than the classic secreted epsilon heavy chain. The new alternatively spliced epsilon mRNAs reported here, in addition to the previously reported forms encoding membrane and larger secreted IgE, appear to reflect the normal splicing pattern in humans, as we have detected all these epsilon RNAs in all the human IgE-secreting cells and cell lines tested."
https://openalex.org/W1539151798,"A superfamily of growth factor and cytokine receptors has recently been identified, which is characterized by four spatially conserved cysteine residues, a tryptophan-serine motif (WSXWS) in the extracellular domain, and a proline-rich cytoplasmic domain. The high affinity human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor (hGM-CSFR) consists of two subunits, alpha (hGM-CSFR alpha) and beta (hGM-CSFR beta), both of which are members of the receptor superfamily. In this study, we prepared mutations in conserved amino acids of the receptor subunit necessary for GM-CSF binding (hGM-CSFR alpha) and analyzed mutant receptors for low affinity binding, internalization, and high affinity binding when complexed with the beta subunit. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain did not affect GM-CSF binding or receptor internalization. Mutation of a single conserved serine residue within the WSXWS motif diminishes cell surface receptor expression but not ligand binding. Mutation of either the second or third conserved cysteine residue of hGM-CSFR alpha resulted in complete loss of low affinity binding; however, co-expression of the cysteine 2 mutant with hGM-CSFR beta yielded a high affinity receptor complex. Since neither the cysteine 2 mutant nor the beta subunit can bind ligand alone, this result suggests that hGM-CSFR alpha and hGM-CSFR beta exist in a preformed heterodimeric protein complex on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1600654224,"--CAAX motif peptides, which are substrates for isoprenylation, were synthetically derivatized with the light-sensitive benzophenone (Bz) group in order to determine their potential use as catalytic site-directed covalent photocross-linking ligands for one of the enzymes catalyzing protein isoprenylation, farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase). Bz-peptides could be synthesized with [3H]benzophenone and possessed eiter one or two benzophenone groups located at or near the peptide's NH2 terminus (e.g. the mono-Bz probes Bz-ACVIM and Bz-LPCVVM, and the di-Bz derivatized probe Bz-GY-(Bz)PCVVM, referred to as Bz2-GYPCVVM). Each type of derivatized peptide behaved as a substrate for farnesylation in vitro without irradiation, while under 366-nm irradiation each demonstrated covalent cross-linking ability as a catalytic site-directed photoaffinity ligand with tissue-purified or enriched but impure fractions from rat and bovine brain FPTase, as well as with a recombinant human FPTase variant, FPTase (beta alpha t) expressed in Escherichia coli. Without photoactivation, Bz-ACVIM yielded a Kd of 37 nM for the cloned variant of human FPTase. Pseudo first-order photolytic inhibition of FPTase preparations with Bz-peptides, as well as protection from photoinactivation by unmodified -CAAX motif peptides, supported the capacity of these Bz-peptides to serve as co-substrates and their specificity for seeking the catalytic site of the enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis subsequent to photolysis indicated that the mono-Bz-derivatized peptides (e.g. [3H]Bz-LPCVVM or 3H]Bz-ACVIM) became covalently cross-linked preferentially to the approximately 49-kDa beta subunit of the alpha beta dimeric FPTase. The farnesyl-PP cosubstrate bound equally well to unmodified and Bz-ACVIM-labeled enzyme. The di-Bz derivative, [3H]Bz2-GYPCVVM, in contrast, revealed exclusive photocovalent cross-linking with a species of molecular mass approximately 95-97 kDa, indicating that both FPTase subunits were tethered together covalently by the di-Bz probe. Similar differential SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cross-linking patterns were obtained with homogeneous FPTases as well as with partially purified rat or bovine brain enzyme preparations. The absence of nonspecific photolabeling of any proteins in the partially purified rat or bovine brain enzyme preparations other than FPTase independently attested to the high efficiency of photocross-linking of the FTPase, and the selective catalytic site-seeking ability of these Bz-derivatized peptide substrates, verifying their potential as structural probes for the active site domain on the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1552806469,"Two instances, involving the enzymes carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli and phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively, are described in which increasing temperature alone causes the actions of an allosteric ligand to change from inhibition to activation. In neither case are these effects due to a change in the activation energy of the enzyme catalyzed reaction induced by the allosteric ligand. Rather, they are due to temperature-dependent changes in the extent to which the binding of allosteric ligand modifies the affinity of the enzyme for substrate. The data can be readily explained by an analysis of the apparent delta H and delta S components of the coupling free energy, which quantitatively describe the actions of allosteric ligands that act in this manner. These observations underscore the shortcomings of expecting to explain the actions of an allosteric ligand solely by the structural perturbations that accompany the binding of an allosteric ligand such as those often revealed by x-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W1554862778,"Lipid hydroperoxide-supported metabolic redox cycling between diethylstilbestrol (DES) or catechol-estrogens and their corresponding quinones has been postulated previously to play a role in estrogen-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis. As part of an examination of this postulate, we investigated (a) the effectiveness of various lipid hydroperoxides as oxidants in microsome-mediated quinone formation, and (b) the dependence of DES oxidation to quinone on lipid hydroperoxide levels in liver and kidney of hamsters. Kinetic analyses of the lipid hydroperoxide-mediated conversion of DES to DES quinone revealed that of the peroxides tested (9Z,11E,13(S))-13-hydroperoxyoctadecadien-1-oic acid was the most powerful oxidant (Vmax = 10.5 nmol min-1; Km = 21.3 microM) followed by (5(S),6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-5-hydroperoxyeicosatetra en-1-oic acid (Vmax = 1.0 nmol min-1; Km 10.0 microM). The other pure fatty acid hydroperoxide isomers or mixtures had a lower affinity for the enzyme (Km values ranging from 23.1 to 130 microM) and/or lower maximal velocity (Vmax values ranging from 0.2 to 7.0 nmol min-1). Levels of Z,Z-dienestrol, which arises from spontaneous rearrangement of DES quinone, were not affected in liver of hamsters treated with estradiol implants for 9 days and an injection of 20 mg/kg DES but increased in kidney by 120% over levels observed in animals without implants (5.5 and 12.1 nmol/g of wet tissue, respectively). Z,Z-Dienestrol concentrations correlated directly with lipid hydroperoxide concentrations in liver and kidney of control and estradiol-treated hamsters. The increased conversion of DES to quinone in kidney compared with that in liver was catalyzed by comparable activities of cytochrome P450 IA, the enzyme family catalyzing this oxidation. These results demonstrated that the oxidation of DES to quinone was directly dependent on the lipid hydroperoxide levels in the organ of metabolic conversion in addition to the enzyme activity catalyzing this reaction. The elevated lipid hydroperoxide levels in kidney of estrogen-treated hamsters indicate enhanced estrogen quinone formation and therefore enhanced generation of free radicals by metabolic redox cycling of estrogens in this organ prior to the appearance of malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1479945046,"We report properties of five active site mutants of Escherichia coli citrate synthase, in which histidine 264, aspartate 362, and phenylalanine 383 were replaced by alanines, and arginines 387 and 407 by leucines. All mutants have much lower turnover numbers than wild type enzyme; the strongest effect was with the arginine 387 mutant, perhaps because the substrate, oxaloacetate, binds in a different orientation. The arginine 407 mutant has lost most of its ability to distinguish alpha-ketoglutarate, a competitive inhibitor, from oxaloacetate. The mutations of histidine 264 and aspartate 362 affect steady-state kinetics as would be anticipated from current models for citrate synthase catalysis, and resemble mutations of these residues, in pig heart and E. coli enzyme, reported by others. Mutations of residues 264, 362, and 383 also affect allosteric properties. With the phenylalanine 383 mutant, acetyl-CoA saturation is strongly sigmoid, even in the presence of the activator, KCl, implying a marked shift of the allosteric equilibrium toward the T state. The histidine 264 mutant appears to be shifted toward R state and shows weaker binding of the allosteric inhibitor, NADH; thus this mutation also affects the allosteric site, 25-30 A away."
https://openalex.org/W2105834849,"Single and multiple point mutations were introduced to change the 12 glutamine residues within a 37-amino acid region of sigma 54. Multiple changes are shown to be required in order to interfere significantly with the function of this protein which is associated with enhancer-dependent bacterial transcription. Mutation of the central 4 glutamines leads to the production of less m-RNA, caused by an inability to fully open the promoter start site. DNA binding, however, is normal. Mutation of 4 other adjacent glutamines causes the promoter start site to open more readily than wild type, although this enhanced opening is not accompanied by more mRNA. The enhanced DNA melting is not caused by enhanced promoter binding, as indicated by normal protection of the polymerase-bound promoter against dimethyl sulfate attack. The results suggest that multiple glutamines play a role in transducing the melting signal from the enhancer protein to the polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1590488648,"Membrane vesicles from 13 strains carrying mutations in the C-terminal region of the delta-subunit of Escherichia coli F1F0-ATP synthase were characterized in respect to ATPase activity, ATP-driven proton-pumping, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivity of ATPase, and oxidative phosphorylation. The salient finding was that energy-coupling between F1 and F0 sectors of the enzyme is impaired by several of the mutations. The delta G150N mutant appeared completely uncoupled in vitro. The data emphasize the role of the C-terminal region of delta-subunit in integration of the proton conduction machinery in F0 with the three F1 catalytic sites. It is suggested that the C-terminal region of delta-subunit, speculatively located in the central region of the alpha 3 beta 3 hexagon, acts functionally at the interface between the helical domain of the stalk and the F1 subunits to relay conformational signals which alter the affinities of the catalytic sites for substrates and products."
https://openalex.org/W1594238838,"We have recently cloned and characterized the entire human 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen gene, which is expressed at a relatively high level in the basal keratinocytes. A putative AP2 binding sequence (KRE2), identified in the position -1786 to -1778, was cloned in front of a heterologous thymidine kinase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct, and transient transfections of normal human keratinocytes indicated a marked enhancement of the promoter activity. Normal human keratinocyte nuclear extracts contained a protein, designated as keratinocyte transcriptional protein-1 (KTP-1), which complexed with the KRE2 oligomer when examined by gel mobility shift assays. This protein was not detected in human skin fibroblast or HeLa cell nuclear extracts that did, however, contain AP2. UV cross-linking studies and Southwestern analyses suggested that KTP-1 binds to DNA as a single polypeptide of approximately 110 kDa. These data suggest that KTP-1 is a DNA-binding protein clearly distinct from AP2, and this protein may be responsible for the basal keratinocyte-specific expression of the bullous pemphigoid antigen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1593242723,"Abstract The nature of the Uvr protein-DNA complexes formed on psoralen-DNA interstrand cross-links was analyzed by DNase I footprinting and correlated with the incision efficiency of the UvrABC endonuclease on the cross-links of different DNA sequences. Our results indicate that the repair specificity is dependent on the DNA sequence and the psoralen orientation in the cross-link. On the strand that will be cut, a 30-nucleotide long UvrAB footprint with a DNase I hypersensitive site at the 11th nucleotide 5' to the lesion was observed and subsequently rearranged to a 22-nucleotide long UvrB-lesion footprint. On the strand that will not be cut, the UvrAB-lesion footprint had no 5' DNase I hypersensitive site and did not form the UvrB-lesion footprint. Although UvrABC incision requires the formation of UvrB-lesion complex on the strand which will be cut, the affinities of these complexes do not correlate with the incision efficiencies, suggesting that the overall reaction can be driven forward by a favorable next step such as UvrC incision. A study of the time-dependent interconversion of UvrAB-lesion complex to UvrB-lesion complex on a cross-link revealed a secondary recognition of the UvrB-lesion complex by UvrA2(B) proteins in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1632995000,"The muscle-specific intermediate filament protein desmin is up-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation. When myoblasts leave the cell cycle and fusion into multinucleated myotubes starts, genes associated with myogenesis become activated. The activation is believed to be mediated by the muscle-specific determination factors. We present evidence that both MyoD and myogenin are able to activate the transcription of the hamster desmin gene. A proximal promoter fragment of 89 base pairs is sufficient for this transactivation process. The single E-box in this region is essential for desmin promoter activity in mouse C2 skeletal muscle cells and upon co-transfection of a myogenin expression vector also in human primary fibroblasts. Mutation of this MyoD binding site abrogates desmin transcription, and transactivation of the promoter no longer occurs. By using gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we were able to demonstrate that nuclear proteins from C2 muscle cells and myogenin/E12 glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins are able to bind to the functional E-box consensus sequence. A second E-box, situated in a more upstream regulatory region, which also binds to purified Helix-Loop-Helix proteins in vitro is only moderately affected by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1514890101,"Xenopus laevis provides an established developmental system to study the regulation of cell lineage establishment and the generation of tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. We have isolated from Xenopus erythroid cell RNA two distinct cDNA clones encoding the xGATA-1 transcription factor. We have identified, in erythroid nuclear extracts, the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein they encode. By characterizing the expression patterns for RNA derived from two distinct homologues, we find that the two xGATA-1 genes are differentially regulated. The xGATA-1a mRNA predominates in embryos prior to terminal differentiation of erythroid cells, while the differentiated cells contain RNA derived predominantly from the xGATA-1b gene. Both proteins activate a target globin promoter in transient transfection assays. During early development, GATA-1 transcripts are localized to ventral regions of the embryo. GATA-1 should therefore provide a useful early marker for studying signalling pathways which result in the generation of ventral mesoderm. The differentially regulated genes may be distinct markers for targets of ventral mesoderm induction."
https://openalex.org/W1537215209,"To understand the transcriptional regulation of the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene, we examined the effects of okadaic acid, a potent in vitro inhibitor of protein phosphatases, on the activation of human IGF-II gene expression. Treatment of A-549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells with okadaic acid increased expression of the IGF-II mRNAs. Since the 4.8-kb mRNA is transcribed under the control of human IGF-II P4 promoter, we examined the P4 promoter element responsible for the okadaic acid-mediated transcriptional activation. Transfection of IGF-II P4 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs demonstrated that the effects of okadaic acid on the induction of IGF-II gene expression are mediated through multiple promoter elements, including an Egr-1 consensus element. We have also shown that okadaic acid induced the expression of the transcription factor Egr-1. Moreover, by using a GAL4-Egr-1 fusion protein, we have directly demonstrated that okadaic acid positively regulates Egr-1 transcriptional activity in vivo. These results indicate that protein phosphatases play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IGF-II."
https://openalex.org/W1497901324,"Although G protein alpha subunits are known to regulate such cellular functions as growth and enzymatic activity, the ability of these proteins to regulate target gene expression has not yet been directly investigated. Transient expression in GH3 pituitary cells of a target rat prolactin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct, (-1957)PRL-CAT, was increased by coexpressed constitutively active alpha s mutant Q227L-alpha s but not by wild-type alpha s. Thus activated alpha s but not basal state alpha s can stimulate prolactin promoter activity. Q227L-alpha s also stimulated expression of construct (-187)PRL-CAT, showing that only the proximal prolactin promoter region is required for a response to activated alpha s. The promoter specificity of the transcriptional influence of activated alpha s was demonstrated by the inability of either Q227L-alpha s or wild-type alpha s to stimulate expression of control target constructs containing either the rat growth hormone promoter or the thymidine kinase promoter. Previous studies have shown that the most proximal prolactin promoter binding site for the pituitary-specific transcription factor pit-1, site 1P, can act as an independent response element for either thyrotropin-releasing hormone or Ca2+. Two copies of site 1P conferred upon a heterologous metallothionein promoter a response to Q227L-alpha s. This implies that site 1P can also serve as an independent response element for alpha s and suggests that pit-1 may be a mediator of the cellular regulation by alpha s of the prolactin promoter."

K., Marshak, D. R., and Landreth, G. E. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 368-372). This serine/threonine kinase, termed Fos kinase, has been purified > 24,000-fold through five column steps to near homogeneity and is shown to be a 37-kDa protein as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with a pI = 6.0. Fos kinase is distinguishable from previously characterized NGF-regulated kinases by its chromatographic behavior, its response to specific kinase inhibitors, and its substrate specificity. The concentration of NGF required to activate Fos kinase is consistent with signaling from the high affinity NGF receptor. Fos kinase phosphorylates c-Fos at its C terminus as indicated by competitive inhibition with a peptide corresponding to C-terminal phosphorylation sites and lack of phosphorylation of a C-terminal deletion mutant of c-Fos. Hyperphosphorylation of c-Fos in vivo, as detected by reduced electrophoretic mobility of c-Fos, is induced by the same ligands which activate Fos kinase. Moreover, Fos kinase phosphorylation of c-Fos in vitro results in a similar electrophoretic mobility shift, demonstrating that Fos kinase may be responsible for growth factor-stimulated alterations in mobility on SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation of this transcription factor. The ability of this unique growth factor-responsive kinase to phosphorylate c-Fos at its C terminus, a region essential for the transrepressive properties of c-Fos, suggests that Fos kinase may play a role in the regulation of the transcriptional repressive activity of c-Fos."
https://openalex.org/W1520514488,"In Escherichia coli, the F1 sector of the F1F0-ATP synthase is connected to the membrane-embedded F0 sector by a narrow stalk, thought to be formed by subunits delta and b. Mutagenic analysis was used here to study the structure and function of subunit delta. First, random mutations in the protein were generated by bisulfite mutagenesis. Two single missense mutations causing impaired growth by oxidative phosphorylation were found, namely delta A149T and delta G150D. Both occur at the conserved C-terminal region, which has been suggested previously to be functionally important. Two techniques were applied to study the C-terminal region in greater detail. Cassette mutagenesis was used to randomly mutate the sequence from delta 145 to delta 167, and residues delta A149 and delta G150 were specifically mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to obtain multiple substitutions at each position. Fifteen of the residues between delta 145 and delta 167 were mutated. None was found to be absolutely essential for function. However, the properties of the mutants obtained, which included partial impairment of growth by oxidative phosphorylation, temperature sensitivity, and specific structural requirements at residues delta A149 and delta G150, confirmed that this region is important for enzyme function. Based on these studies, and on secondary and tertiary structure predictions, a model for subunit delta and its orientation in F1F0-ATP synthase is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1611431942,"To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms of collagen VI synthesis we have characterized the cis-acting elements of the chicken alpha 1(VI) collagen promoter. Footprinting experiments with nuclear extracts from chicken embryos revealed three distinct elements, designated A, B, and C, that were protected from DNase I digestion. The nuclear proteins that interact with the three sites were identified by gel retardation assays in combination with the use of various oligonucleotide competitors as well as specific antibodies raised against well characterized transcription factors. Site A was found to be a target for transcriptional activator AP1, whereas sites B and C were shown to be recognized each by two distinct nuclear proteins which belong to the Sp1 multigene family. To address the question whether the three sites alone are able to direct transcription, a minipromoter construct was created in which the sequences of sites A, B, and C were placed in front of a reporter gene. After transfection into chicken fibroblasts, this construct exhibited a high relative promoter activity when compared to a large genomic fragment containing the basic alpha 1(VI) collagen promoter. Thus, the three sites are sufficient to induce transcription of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1569896570,"Fluorescence techniques have been used to investigate the interaction of bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc 70) with small molecular weight peptides and myo-inositol monophosphatase. The emission properties of Hsc 70 remain invariant upon addition of ATP. The results of steady-state fluorescence indicate that the tryptophan residues of Hsc 70 are exposed to the rapidly relaxing aqueous solvent. Binding of residues 1-20 of ribonuclease A (RNase S-peptide) to Hsc 70 causes protein fluorescence quenching which was used to determine a dissociation constant Kd = 2.7 microM for the binary Hsc 70.RNase S-peptide complex. The octapeptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal portion of sickle cell hemoglobin recognizes Hsc 70 and binds with a Kd = 9.3 microM. Binding of RNase S-peptide to Hsc 70 produces a small enhancement of ATPase activity. Unfolded myo-inositol monophosphatase, tagged with the fluorescent probe 5-[2-(2-iodoacetamido)ethylamino]-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, recognizes Hsc 70; the formation of a stable complex was detected by steady-state emission anisotropy measurements. The rate and extent of recovery of catalytic activity of unfolded myo-inositol monophosphatase is not influenced by Hsc 70.

[3H]SR 46349B bound to one class of specific binding sites with high affinity (KD = 1.3 +/- 0.3 nM; Bmax = 176 +/- 42 fmol/10(5) cells). Exposure of cells to a 1 microM concentration of the 5-HT2 agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ((+/-)-DOI) or the antagonist ketanserin led to a significant decrease in 5-HT2 receptor density as measured by [3H]SR 46349B binding. In contrast, exposure of cells to 1 microM SR 46349B caused a marked increase in the maximal binding capacity of [3H]SR 46349B, with a maximal effect at 24 h (73% increase). The affinity constant was not affected by prior exposure to (+/-)-DOI, ketanserin, or SR 46349B. Furthermore, exposure of cells to 1 microM (+/-)-DOI or ketanserin produced, 48 h later, a decrease in the ability of (+/-)-DOI to stimulate phosphoinositide turnover in the cells, whereas treatment with SR 46349B induced a significant stimulation of the 5-HT2 receptor-linked signal transduction. This effect occurred with no changes in the amount of 5-HT2 receptor mRNAs as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These results indicate that SR 46349B increases 5-HT2 receptor binding and functions without altering steady-state 5-HT2 mRNA levels in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526005115,"We previously reported the generation of monoclonal antibodies which immunoprecipitate a fraction of the total chick kidney 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-24R-hydroxylase activity. These antibodies were used to screen a chick kidney lambda gt11 cDNA library resulting in the isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding a protein that is not the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-24R-hydroxylase but another protein we term the vitamin D3 hydroxylase-associated protein (VDHAP). The deduced amino acid sequence agreed with an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence from the isolated VDHAP. Gene and protein bank search did not identify homology to known sequences or functional domains in the VDHAP cDNA. VDHAP mRNA levels are not altered by conditions which either induce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-24R-hydroxylase activity (78-fold) or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (30-fold). Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from chick tissues revealed VDHAP only in kidney. Cellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that VDHAP and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase are colocalized in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The VDHAP antibody immunoprecipitates 14% of the total 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-24R-hydroxylase activity (7-fold over background) and immunoprecipitates 21% of the total 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (2-fold over background). VDHAP is a novel chick kidney-specific inner membrane protein of mitochondria, which associates with a fraction of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-24R-hydroxylase and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase."
