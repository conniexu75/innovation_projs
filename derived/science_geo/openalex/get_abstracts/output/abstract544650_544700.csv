https://openalex.org/W2178895998,"The bacterial composition of the human fecal microbiome is influenced by many lifestyle factors, notably diet. It is less clear, however, what role host genetics plays in dictating the composition of bacteria living in the gut. In this study, we examined the association of ~200K host genotypes with the relative abundance of fecal bacterial taxa in a founder population, the Hutterites, during two seasons (n = 91 summer, n = 93 winter, n = 57 individuals collected in both). These individuals live and eat communally, minimizing variation due to environmental exposures, including diet, which could potentially mask small genetic effects. Using a GWAS approach that takes into account the relatedness between subjects, we identified at least 8 bacterial taxa whose abundances were associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the host genome in each season (at genome-wide FDR of 20%). For example, we identified an association between a taxon known to affect obesity (genus Akkermansia) and a variant near PLD1, a gene previously associated with body mass index. Moreover, we replicate a previously reported association from a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study of fecal microbiome abundance in mice (genus Lactococcus, rs3747113, P = 3.13 x 10−7). Finally, based on the significance distribution of the associated microbiome QTLs in our study with respect to chromatin accessibility profiles, we identified tissues in which host genetic variation may be acting to influence bacterial abundance in the gut."

Recently, we demonstrated that alcohol-treated hepatocytes cross-talk with immune cells via exosomes containing microRNA (miRNAs). Here, we hypothesized that alcohol-exposed monocytes can communicate with naive monocytes via EVs. We observed increased numbers of EVs, mostly exosomes, secreted by primary human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells in the presence of alcohol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. EVs derived from alcohol-treated monocytes stimulated naive monocytes to polarize into M2 macrophages as indicated by increased surface expression of CD68 (macrophage marker), M2 markers (CD206 (mannose receptor) and CD163 (scavenger receptor)), secretion of IL-10, and TGFβ and increased phagocytic activity. miRNA profiling of the EVs derived from alcohol-treated THP-1 monocytes revealed high expression of the M2-polarizing miRNA, miR-27a. Treatment of naive monocytes with control EVs overexpressing miR-27a reproduced the effect of EVs from alcohol-treated monocytes on naive monocytes and induced M2 polarization, suggesting that the effect of alcohol EVs was mediated by miR-27a. We found that miR-27a modulated the process of phagocytosis by targeting CD206 expression on monocytes. Importantly, analysis of circulating EVs from plasma of alcoholic hepatitis patients revealed increased numbers of EVs that contained high levels of miR-27a as compared with healthy controls. Our results demonstrate the following: first, alcohol increases EV production in monocytes; second, alcohol-exposed monocytes communicate with naive monocytes via EVs; and third, miR-27a cargo in monocyte-derived EVs can program naive monocytes to polarize into M2 macrophages.

EVs act as signaling conveyors in cell-to-cell communication and contain bioactive molecules, including proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Based on the mode of biogenesis, EVs can be categorized into two main classes as follows: shedding MVs (originating from plasma membrane) and exosomes (derived from multivesicular bodies) (2Kalra H.

Exosomal markers are CD63, CD81, and CD9, whereas microvesicles are annexin V-positive (3Momen-Heravi F. Balaj L. Alian S. Mantel P.Y. Halleck A.E. Trachtenberg A.J. Soria C.E. Oquin S.

Based on size distribution and CD63 expression, exosomes are defined as 40–150 nm and MVs as 150–1000 nm (4Momen-Heravi F. Bala S. Bukong T. Szabo G.

The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver disease is complex and is associated with liver abnormalities ranging from steatosis and inflammation to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (10.Mandrekar, P., and Ambade, A., (2012) in Cellular Signaling Pathways in Alcoholic Liver Disease, Trends in Alcoholic Liver Disease Research–Clinical and Scientific Aspects (Shimizu, I., ed) 10.5772/27412,Google Scholar, 11Gao B.

Gut-liver axis in alcoholic liver disease.Gastroenterology. 2015; 148: 30-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The intercellular signaling during alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is key to its progression and pathogenesis (13Beier J.I. McClain C.J. Mechanisms and cell signaling in alcoholic liver disease.Biol.

Hepatol. 2015; 12: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Our previous studies explored the role of exosomes in various liver diseases and showed that circulating miRNAs in exosomes may serve as biomarkers to differentiate between different types of hepatocyte injury and inflammation (15Bala S. Petrasek J. Mundkur S. Catalano D. Levin I. Ward J. Alao H. Kodys K. Szabo G. Circulating microRNAs in exosomes indicate hepatocyte injury and inflammation in alcoholic, drug-induced, and inflammatory liver diseases.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 1946-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Recent data showed a role for exosomes in communication between hepatocytes and monocytes/macrophages via horizontal transfer of hepatocyte-derived miR-122 to monocytes in the presence of alcohol (16Momen-Heravi F. Bala S. Kodys K. Szabo G. Exosomes derived from alcohol-treated hepatocytes horizontally transfer liver specific miRNA-122 and sensitize monocytes to LPS.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Innate immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages, play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALD. However, the role of immune cell-derived EVs in intercellular signaling and communication has yet to be explored in alcohol-induced immunoregulation. Monocytes are the precursors of macrophages. In response to various signals, monocytes differentiate into macrophages with a polarized phenotype in the spectrum of M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes (17Mosser D.M. Edwards J.P. Exploring the full spectrum of macrophage activation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 958-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar, 18Martinez F.O. Gordon S.

The possible contribution of circulating miRNAs transported via EVs to signal between monocytes and activate the process of monocyte differentiation and/or polarization has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of alcohol on EV secretion by human monocytes and studied the role of alcohol-induced EVs as an alternative mode of cell-to-cell communication between monocytes. Our data demonstrate that the total number of EVs secreted from alcohol-treated monocytes is significantly increased as compared with untreated monocytes. EVs originating from alcohol-exposed monocytes induced differentiation and polarization of naive monocytes into M2 macrophages. We demonstrated the role for miR-27a in EVs from alcohol-treated monocytes in inducing activation, polarization, and increased phagocytic activity of naive monocytes. These in vitro observations were validated in vivo where we found an increased number of EVs in the circulation of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, which had increased levels of miR-27a in the EV cargo. Our results suggest that in the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis, EVs play an important role in cell-cell communication between monocytes/macrophages. Confirmed cases of alcoholic hepatitis (n = 8) and healthy individuals (n = 8) were enrolled. The diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis was performed by expert clinicians based on the patients' medical history, physical examination, and laboratory data and according to the guidelines of the American College of Gastroenterology (29O'Shea R.S. Dasarathy S. McCullough A.J. Practice Guideline Committee of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and Practice Parameters Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology Alcoholic liver disease.Hepatology. 2010; 51: 307-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Healthy controls were defined as being free of any systemic and non-systemic diseases based on patients' history and routine laboratory findings performed by primary care physicians and a history of “only social” alcohol consumption. To avoid selection bias, healthy controls and patients were enrolled consecutively. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Worcester, MA), and written informed consents were obtained from all subjects. We obtained plasma samples from controls and patients for the study. RPMI 1640 cell culture media, antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids were purchased from Gibco. Exosome-depleted FBS (Exo-FBSTM) was purchased from System Biosciences (Mountain View, CA). CD14+ monocytes were isolated by MACS CD14 microbeads from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA). Human antibodies CD16 APC, CD14 FITC, and CD86 FITC were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego). Antibodies CD163 PE, CD68 PE, CD206 APC, and isotype control antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen. CD63 antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). miR-27a mimic and scrambled control were purchased from Ambion Life Technologies, Inc. Dextran-FITC beads were purchased from Sigma. Primary human monocytes and THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 cell culture media containing antibiotics, nonessential amino acids, and FBS. For EV isolation and quantification experiments, the cells were cultured in the presence of RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% exosome-depleted FBS (Exo-FBSTM) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For ethanol treatments, 25, 50, and 100 mm ethanol were added to the cells for various time points (24 and 48 h). At desired time points, culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated or quantified using a NanoSight NS300 system (NanoSight, Amesbury, UK). For EV isolation from ethanol-treated and normal THP-1 cells, supernatants were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to remove cells followed by 10,000 × g for 20 min to deplete residual cellular debris, and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0.8-μm filter. The filtered supernatant was used to precipitate EVs with ExoQuick-TCTM, according to the manufacturer's guidelines (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). After isolation, EVs were resuspended in PBS. The concentration of EVs was determined by Bradford assay (30Momen-Heravi F. Saha B. Kodys K. Catalano D. Satishchandran A. Szabo G. Increased number of circulating exosomes and their microRNA cargos are potential novel biomarkers in alcoholic hepatitis.J. Transl. Med. 2015; 13: 261Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For co-culture experiments, EVs isolated from THP-1 cells or primary monocytes (ethanol-treated or non-treated) or from plasma of patients with alcoholic hepatitis or from healthy controls were added to normal primary human monocytes in the concentration of 25–50 μg/ml (50 μl). This concentration was comparable with EVs secreted by primary monocytes in the presence of ethanol. The monocytes were stimulated with EVs (25 μl) on day 1 and day 3 and cultured for 5 days. The concentration and diameter of EVs derived from culture supernatant from primary monocytes, THP-1 cells, and patient plasma samples were identified by a NanoSight equipped with a fast video capture and NTA software. Before using the samples, the instrument was calibrated with 100 nm polystyrene beads (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA). The samples were captured for 90 s at room temperature. NTA software was used to measure particle concentration (particles/ml) and size distribution (in nanometers). For each sample, three measurements were taken, and the average value was determined. THP-1 human monocytes were plated into 12-well plates and were left untreated or treated with 50 mm ethanol for 24 h. After 24 h, ethanol-treated THP-1 cells and untreated cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Sorenson Phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) for 2 h. The cells were then given three 5-min washes with PBS and fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h. Next, the samples were rinsed and put through an alcohol dehydration series. The samples were mounted on aluminum, and the mounted specimens were coated with gold/palladium using a gold sputter coater. Then the samples were analyzed and examined with a MKII FEI Quanta 200 FEG MKII scanning electron microscope (FEI, Netherlands). EVs were isolated from THP-1 cells, and Western blot analysis for the exosomal marker CD63 was performed. EVs were resuspended in RIPA buffer, and the proteins were extracted. The proteins were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked for 1 h in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature (TBST). The blot was then incubated overnight with primary CD63 antibody at 4 °C on a rocker. The following day, the blot was washed three times with TBST and then incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for 1 h at a dilution of 1:10,000. ClarityTM Western ECL substrate kit (Bio-Rad) was used to develop the blot, and the CD63 protein band was visualized with a Fujifilm LAS-4000 luminescent image analyzer. Cell surface marker analysis on monocytes/macrophages was performed by flow cytometry as described previously (31Zhang S. Kodys K. Li K. Szabo G. Human type 2 myeloid dendritic cells produce interferon-λ and amplify interferon-α in response to hepatitis C virus infection.Gastroenterology. 2013; 144: 414-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FcR blocking reagent (BD Biosciences) was used to inhibit nonspecific binding of antibodies. The cells were incubated with appropriate antibody or isotype control for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS) and acquired on a BD-LSR II (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed on FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). For CD14+ monocytes, we gated on the various markers and plotted the percentage of positive cells. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is shown by histogram plots. Protein levels of TNFα, IL-10, IL-12, and TGFβ were measured in cell-free culture supernatant by ELISA. Whole blood cells isolated from human subjects were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the levels of IL-10 and TGF-β secretion were determined by ELISA. Levels of TNFα, IL-12 (BD Biosciences), IL-10, and TGFβ (eBioscience, San Diego) were measured based on the manufacturers' recommendations and quantified using an ELISA reader. Mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis was measured as the cellular uptake of FITC-dextran and quantified by flow cytometry (32Op den Brouw M.L. Binda R.S. Geijtenbeek T.B. Janssen H.L. Woltman A.M.

Phagocytosis: elegant complexity.Immunity. 2005; 22: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). For the phagocytosis assay, ∼2 × 105 cells per sample were incubated in medium containing 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran beads for 120 min at 4 or 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS containing 2% FBS. Phagocytic assays performed at 4 °C were used as negative controls (i.e. a reduced phagocytosis condition) and accounted for the particles bound to the cells' extracellular surface. The cells were acquired in the LSR II (BD Biosciences) instrument to analyze the uptake of FITC-dextran beads by the cells. The phagocytosis was calculated by normalizing with the phagocytosis at 4 °C. The phagocytosis index was calculated as described previously (36Wang Z. Fayngerts S. Wang P. Sun H. Johnson D.S. Ruan Q. Guo W. Chen Y.H. TIPE2 protein serves as a negative regulator of phagocytosis and oxidative burst during infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We loaded THP-1-derived EVs with miR-27a mimic and scrambled mimic according to our previously optimized protocol (4Momen-Heravi F. Bala S. Bukong T. Szabo G. Exosome-mediated delivery of functionally active miRNA-155 inhibitor to macrophages.Nanomedicine. 2014; 10: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, EVs were diluted in Gene Pulser® electroporation buffer (Bio-Rad) at a ratio of 1:1. miR-27a mimic or scrambled mimic at a final amount of 400 pmol was added to EV samples containing 1 μg/μl EV protein. For the dose-dependent experiments, 300, 100, and 40 pmol were loaded into the EVs. The mixtures (200 μl) were transferred into cold 0.2-cm electroporation cuvettes and electroporated at 150 kV and 100 microfarads with a Gene Pulser II System (Bio-Rad). The EVs were treated with 1 unit of RNase H to eliminate free-floating miR-27a mimic or scrambled mimic outside the EVs and were re-isolated using ExoQuick-TCTM. Based on the loading efficiency that we established earlier (4Momen-Heravi F. Bala S. Bukong T. Szabo G. Exosome-mediated delivery of functionally active miRNA-155 inhibitor to macrophages.Nanomedicine. 2014; 10: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and dilution of EVs, a final concentration of 10, 25, and 75 pmol of miR-27a mimic was used in the co-culture experiments with primary human monocytes. EVs were lysed in QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen), and total RNA was isolated using Direct-zolTM RNA MiniPrep isolation kit (Zymo Research Corp, Irvine, CA). Optical density (260/280 and 260/230 ratios) was measured to check RNA quality and quantity. 50 μl of EV suspension from the supernatant of ethanol-treated cells or normal cells was mixed with 500 μl of QIAzol lysis buffer, and the mixture was processed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted RNA was eluted with 25 μl of RNase-free water. For miRNA analysis of exosomes, synthetic Caenorhabditis elegans (cel)-miR-39 was added during the total RNA isolation process and was used to normalize the qPCR data. TaqMan® miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used for detection of miR-27a, miR-146a, and miR-9 expression according to the manufacturer's protocol, as described previously (4Momen-Heravi F. Bala S. Bukong T. Szabo G. Exosome-mediated delivery of functionally active miRNA-155 inhibitor to macrophages.Nanomedicine. 2014; 10: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The miRNA levels were normalized, and the relative expression of the specific miRNAs was presented by 2−ΔΔCt. All the data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.), which was obtained from three or more independent experiments. For pairwise comparisons, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test or parametric Student's t test was used based on underlying distribution. Comparison between groups was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test or the analysis of variance parametric test. p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. GraphPad Prism version 6.05 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis. Monocytes become activated in the presence of alcohol and are characterized by changes in the expression of cell surface molecules and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines (24Saha B.

Szabo G. Exosomes derived from alcohol-treated hepatocytes horizontally transfer liver specific miRNA-122 and sensitize monocytes to LPS.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that ethanol treatment can induce EV secretion by monocytes. To evaluate the EV secretion pattern of monocytes, we treated human blood monocytes with different concentrations of ethanol and measured the EVs using a Nanosight instrument coupled with NTA software. We observed that ethanol treatment (25–100 mm) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the total number of EVs produced by monocytes (Fig. 1A). We found a significant increase in the number of secreted exosomes with the increasing concentrations of ethanol from 25 to 100 mm (Fig. 1A). These ethanol concentrations are relevant to human alcoholics because the 25 mm in vitro dose mimics binge drinking (∼0.1 g/dl) blood alcohol content and 100 mm approximates 0.4 g/dl blood alcohol content seen in chronic alcoholics (39Bala S.

Mass media reports on an epidemic or pandemic can provide important information to the public, and in turn, can induce positive healthy behaviour practices (i.e., handwashing, social distancing) in the individuals, that will reduce the probability of contracting the disease. Mass media fatigue, however, can dampen these effects. Mathematical models can be used to study the effects of mass media reports on epidemic/pandemic outcomes. In this study we employ a stochastic agent based model to provide a quantification of mass media reports on the variability in important public health measurements. We also include mass media report data compiled by the Global Public Health Intelligence Network, to study the effects of mass media reports in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We find that the report rate and the rate at which individuals relax their healthy behaviours (media fatigue) greatly affect the variability in important public health measurements. When the mass media reporting data is included in the model, two peaks of infection result."
https://openalex.org/W2186340798,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive tumor subtype with an enriched CD44+/CD24- stem-like population. Salinomycin is an antibiotic that has been shown to target cancer stem cells (CSC); however, the mechanisms of action involved have not been well characterized. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of salinomycin on cell death, migration, and invasion, as well as CSC-like properties in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Salinomycin significantly induced anoikis-sensitivity, accompanied by caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and PARP cleavage, during anchorage-independent growth. Salinomycin treatment also caused a marked suppression of cell migration and invasion with concomitant downregulation of MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA levels. Notably, salinomycin inhibited the formation of mammospheres and effectively reduced the CD44+/CD24- stem-like population during anchorage-independent growth. These observations were associated with the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705). Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced STAT3 activation was strongly suppressed by salinomycin challenge. These findings support the notion that salinomycin may be potentially efficacious for targeting breast cancer stem-like cells through the inhibition of STAT3 activation."

An alternative approach is to extrapolate reference volumes from low b-value data. We aim to compare the performance of conventional and extrapolation-based correction of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) data, and to demonstrate the impact of the correction approach on group comparison studies.DKI was performed in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and healthy age-matched controls, using b-values of up to 2750 s/mm2. The accuracy of conventional and extrapolation-based correction methods was investigated. Parameters from DTI and DKI were compared between patients and controls in the cingulum and the anterior thalamic projection tract.Conventional correction resulted in systematic registration errors for high b-value data. The extrapolation-based methods did not exhibit such errors, yielding more accurate tractography and up to 50% lower standard deviation in DKI metrics. Statistically significant differences were found between patients and controls when using the extrapolation-based motion correction that were not detected when using the conventional method.We recommend that conventional motion and eddy-current correction should be abandoned for high b-value data in favour of more accurate methods using extrapolation-based references."
https://openalex.org/W2120719841,"Personality and anxiety disorders across species are affected by genetic and environmental factors. Shyness-boldness personality continuum exists across species, including the domestic dog, with a large within- and across-breed variation. Domestic dogs are also diagnosed for several anxiety-related behavioral conditions, such as generalized anxiety disorders, phobias, and separation anxiety. Genetic and environmental factors contributing to personality and anxiety are largely unknown. We collected questionnaire data from a Finnish family dog population (N = 3264) in order to study the associating environmental factors for canine fearfulness, noise sensitivity, and separation anxiety. Early life experiences and exercise were found to associate with anxiety prevalence. We found that fearful dogs had less socialization experiences (p = 0.002) and lower quality of maternal care (p < 0.0001) during puppyhood. Surprisingly, the largest environmental factor associating with noise sensitivity (p < 0.0001) and separation anxiety (p = 0.007) was the amount of daily exercise; dogs with noise sensitivity and separation anxiety had less daily exercise. Our findings suggest that dogs share many of the same environmental factors that contribute to anxiety in other species as well, such as humans and rodents. Our study highlights the importance of early life experiences, especially the quality of maternal care and daily exercise for the welfare and management of the dogs, and reveals important confounding factors to be considered in the genetic characterization of canine anxiety."

This study aimed to detect spatiotemporal change patterns of PM2.5 from August 2013 to July 2014 in Beijing, and to assess the relationship between PM2.5 and meteorological factors. Methods Daily and hourly PM2.5 data from the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB) were analyzed separately. Ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation, time-series graphs, Spearman correlation coefficient and coefficient of divergence (COD) were used to describe the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5. The Kruskal-Wallis H test, Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess differences in PM2.5 levels associated with spatial and temporal factors including season, region, daytime and day of week. Relationships between daily PM2.5 and meteorological variables were analyzed using the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). Results Annual mean and median of PM2.5 concentrations were 88.07 μg/m3 and 71.00 μg/m3, respectively, from August 2013 to July 2014. PM2.5 concentration was significantly higher in winter (P < 0.0083) and in the southern part of the city (P < 0.0167). Day to day variation of PM2.5 showed a long-term trend of fluctuations, with 2–6 peaks each month. PM2.5 concentration was significantly higher in the night than day (P < 0.0167). Meteorological factors were associated with daily PM2.5 concentration using the GAMM model (R2 = 0.59, AIC = 7373.84). Conclusion PM2.5 pollution in Beijing shows strong spatiotemporal variations. Meteorological factors influence the PM2.5 concentration with certain patterns. Generally, prior day wind speed, sunlight hours and precipitation are negatively correlated with PM2.5, whereas relative humidity and air pressure three days earlier are positively correlated with PM2.5."

We determined the performance of transient elastography (TE), acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score for fibrosis detection in bariatric patients.41 patients (median BMI 47 kg/m2) underwent 14-day low-energy diets to improve conditions prior to bariatric surgery (day 0). TE (M and XL probe), ARFI, and ELF score were performed on days -15 and -1 and compared with intraoperative liver biopsies (NAS staging).Valid TE and ARFI results at day -15 and -1 were obtained in 49%/88% and 51%/90% of cases, respectively. High skin-to-liver-capsule distances correlated with invalid TE measurements. Fibrosis of liver biopsies was staged as F1 and F3 in n = 40 and n = 1 individuals. However, variations (median/range at d-15/-1) of TE (4.6/2.6-75 and 6.7/2.9-21.3 kPa) and ARFI (2.1/0.7-3.7 and 2.0/0.7-3.8 m/s) were high and associated with overestimation of fibrosis. The ELF score correctly classified 87.5% of patients.In bariatric patients, performance of TE and ARFI was poor and did not improve after weight loss. The ELF score correctly classified the majority of cases and should be further evaluated."

Separate psycholinguistic work emphasizes the importance of left lateral prefrontal cortex executive-control resources during sentence processing, especially when readers must override early, incorrect interpretations when faced with temporary ambiguity. Using transcranial direct current stimulation, we tested whether stimulation of left lateral prefrontal cortex had discriminate effects on language and memory conditions that rely on executive-control (versus cases with minimal executive-control demands, even in the face of task difficulty). Participants were randomly assigned to receive Anodal, Cathodal, or Sham stimulation of left lateral prefrontal cortex while they (1) processed ambiguous and unambiguous sentences in a word-by-word self-paced reading task and (2) performed an n-back memory task that, on some trials, contained interference lure items reputed to require executive-control. Across both tasks, we parametrically manipulated executive-control demands and task difficulty. Our results revealed that the Anodal group outperformed the remaining groups on (1) the sentence processing conditions requiring executive-control, and (2) only the most complex n-back conditions, regardless of executive-control demands. Together, these findings add to the mounting evidence for the selective causal role of left lateral prefrontal cortex for executive-control tasks in the language domain. Moreover, we provide the first evidence suggesting that brain stimulation is a promising method to mitigate processing demands encountered during online sentence processing."

https://openalex.org/W2136451369,"Injury is a leading cause of the global disease burden, accounting for 10 percent of all deaths worldwide. Despite 90 percent of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), the majority of trauma research and infrastructure development has taken place in high-income settings. Furthermore, although accessible services are of central importance to a mature trauma system, there remains a paucity of literature describing the spatial accessibility of emergency services in LMICs. Using data from the Service Provision Assessment component of the Demographic and Health Surveys of Namibia and Haiti we defined the capabilities of healthcare facilities in each country in terms of their preparedness to provide emergency services. A Geographic Information System-based network analysis method was used to define 5- 10- and 50-kilometer catchment areas for all facilities capable of providing 24-hour care, higher-level resuscitative services or tertiary care. The proportion of a country's population with access to each level of service was obtained by amalgamating the catchment areas with a population layer. A significant proportion of the population of both countries had poor spatial access to lower level services with 25% of the population of Haiti and 51% of the population of Namibia living further than 50 kilometers from a facility capable of providing 24-hour care. Spatial access to tertiary care was considerably lower with 51% of Haitians and 72% of Namibians having no access to these higher-level services within 50 kilometers. These results demonstrate a significant disparity in potential spatial access to emergency services in two LMICs compared to analogous estimates from high-income settings, and suggest that strengthening the capabilities of existing facilities may improve the equity of emergency services in these countries. Routine collection of georeferenced patient and facility data in LMICs will be important to understanding how spatial access to services influences outcomes."

In the present study, we have used transient transfection of cultured cell lines to examine the impact of different disease-causing mutations on the localization of Matrin 3 within cells.Using CHO and human H4 neuroglioma cell models, we find that ALS/myopathy mutations do not produce profound changes in the localization of the protein. Although we did observe variable levels of Matrin 3 in the cytoplasm either by immunostaining or visualization of fluorescently-tagged protein, the majority of cells expressing either wild-type (WT) or mutant Matrin 3 showed nuclear localization of the protein. When cytoplasmic immunostaining, or fusion protein fluorescence, was seen in the cytoplasm, the stronger intensity of staining or fluorescence was usually evident in the nucleus. In ~80% of cells treated with sodium arsenite (Ars) to induce cytoplasmic stress granules, the nuclear localization of WT and F115C mutant Matrin 3 was not disturbed. Notably, over-expression of mutant Matrin 3 did not induce the formation of obvious large inclusion-like structures in either the cytoplasm or nucleus.Our findings indicate that mutations in Matrin 3 that are associated with ALS and myopathy do not dramatically alter the normal localization of the protein or readily induce inclusion formation."

A comparative study of infectious diarrhea between two regions was needed. Three groups of diarrheal patients were collected: children ≤5 year-olds from Beijing (developed region) and Henan Province (developing region), and adults over 18 year-olds from Beijing. A questionnaire was used to survey and feces samples were examined for 16 enteropathogens. We enrolled 1422 children and 1047 adults from developed region and 755 children from developing region. Virus positive rates were 32.98% for children and 23.67% for adults in developed region. The most prevalent pathogen for children was rotavirus whereas for adults was norovirus. Bacterial isolation rates were 13.92% for children from developed region, while 29.14% for children from the developing regions. For the greatest difference, Shigella accounted for 50.79% and was the dominant pathogen in the developing region, whereas in the developed region it was only 1.45%. There was no significant relationship between the local levels of development with diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DEC) categories. But it was seen the notable differences between the population with different age: enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC) and enteroaggregative E.coli (EAggEC) were the primary classes of DEC in children from both regions, whereas it was enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) in adults. The symptoms of Shigella and Salmonella infection, such as bloody stools, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) positivity and fever were similar in children, which may lead to the misidentification.

The aim of the present study was to develop a system that allows application of stretch stimuli to human skin equivalents (HSEs), prepared by coculturing of these two types of cells. In addition, this study aimed to analyze the effect of a stretch on keratinization of the epidermis and on the basement membrane. HSEs were prepared in a gutter-like structure created with a porous silicone sheet in a silicone chamber. After 5-day stimulation with stretching, HSEs were analyzed histologically and immunohistologically. Stretch-stimulated HSEs had a thicker epidermal layer and expressed significantly greater levels of laminin 5 and collagen IV/VII in the basal layer compared with HSEs not subjected to stretch stimulation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the structure of the basement membrane was more developed in HSEs subjected to stretching. Our model may be relevant for extrapolating the effect of a stretch on the skin in a state similar to an in vivo system. This experimental system may be useful for analysis of the effects of stretch stimuli on skin properties and wound healing and is also expected to be applicable to an in vitro model of a hypertrophic scar in the future."

Like other biomolecules, membrane lipids are dynamically maintained, but current methods are extremely limited for monitoring lipid dynamics in living animals. We developed novel strategies in C. elegans combining 13C and 15N stable isotopes with mass spectrometry to directly quantify the replenishment rates of the individual fatty acids and intact phospholipids of the membrane. Using multiple measurements of phospholipid dynamics, we found that the phospholipid pools are replaced rapidly and at rates nearly double the turnover measured for neutral lipid populations. In fact, our analysis shows that the majority of membrane lipids are replaced each day. Furthermore, we found that stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs), critical enzymes in polyunsaturated fatty acid production, play an unexpected role in influencing the overall rates of membrane maintenance as SCD depletion affected the turnover of nearly all membrane lipids. Additionally, the compromised membrane maintenance as defined by LC-MS/MS with SCD RNAi resulted in active phospholipid remodeling that we predict is critical to alleviate the impact of reduced membrane maintenance in these animals. Not only have these combined methodologies identified new facets of the impact of SCDs on the membrane, but they also have great potential to reveal many undiscovered regulators of phospholipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2265774226,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. The signaling molecule adenosine is produced in response to injury and serves a protective role in early stages of injury and is detrimental during chronic stages of disease such as seen in lung conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the association of extracellular adenosine levels and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis is critical for designing adenosine based approaches to treat pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of this study was to use various models of experimental lung fibrosis to understand when adenosine levels are elevated during pulmonary fibrosis and whether these elevations were associated with disease progression and severity. To accomplish this, extracellular adenosine levels, defined as adenosine levels found in bronchio-alveolar lavage fluid, were determined in mouse models of resolvable and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. We found that relative bronchioalveolar lavage fluid adenosine levels are progressively elevated in association with pulmonary fibrosis and that adenosine levels diminish in association with the resolution of lung fibrosis. In addition, treatment of these models with dipyridamole, an inhibitor of nucleoside transporters that potentiates extracellular adenosine levels, demonstrated that the resolution of lung fibrosis is blocked by the failure of adenosine levels to subside. Furthermore, exacerbating adenosine levels led to worse fibrosis in a progressive fibrosis model. Increased adenosine levels were associated with elevation of IL-6 and IL-17, which are important inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary fibrosis. These results demonstrate that extracellular adenosine levels are closely associated with the progression of experimental pulmonary fibrosis and that this signaling pathway may mediate fibrosis by regulating IL-6 and IL-17 production.—Luo, F., Le, N.-B., Mills, T., Chen, N.-Y., Karmouty-Quintana, H., Molina, J.

However, remote sensing of sugarcane has been limited because useable remote sensing data are limited due to the cloudy climate of this region during the growing season and severe spectral mixing with other crops. In this study, we developed a methodology for automatically mapping sugarcane over large areas using time-series middle-resolution remote sensing data. For this purpose, two major techniques were used, the object-oriented method (OOM) and data mining (DM). In addition, time-series Chinese HJ-1 CCD images were obtained during the sugarcane growing period. Image objects were generated using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and DM was implemented using the AdaBoost algorithm, which generated the prediction model. The prediction model was applied to the HJ-1 CCD time-series image objects, and then a map of the sugarcane planting area was produced. The classification accuracy was evaluated using independent field survey sampling points. The confusion matrix analysis showed that the overall classification accuracy reached 93.6% and that the Kappa coefficient was 0.85. Thus, the results showed that this method is feasible, efficient, and applicable for extrapolating the classification of other crops in large areas where the application of high-resolution remote sensing data is impractical due to financial considerations or because qualified images are limited."
https://openalex.org/W1912148278,"Background The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) is an exotic insect pest that was first recognized in the United States in 2001. As of today, it has been found in more than 42 states. BMSB has a very broad host plant range and damage to crops in mid-Atlantic States has reached a critical level. A reliable and accurate tool for infestation detection and population monitoring is urgently needed to provide better and more timely interventions. Pheromones produced by male BMSB have been previously identified and are currently used in BMSB infestation detection. However, the conditions affecting BMSB production of these pheromones were unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we collected headspace volatiles from male BMSB under laboratory conditions, measured the temporal patterns of release of these pheromones, and assayed the attractiveness to conspecifics. In addition to the pheromone components, tridecane (C13) and E-2-decenal (an alarm compound) were observed in headspace collections of males, as well as in females and nymphs. Exposure of pheromone-emitting adult males to synthetic C13 greatly reduced pheromone emission. Conclusions/Significance This information should lead to a better understanding of the biology, physiology, and chemical ecology of BMSB, which will help scientists and growers develop more efficient strategies based on natural products to manage BMSB population, therefore, reducing pesticide usage and protecting the crops from BMSB damage."
https://openalex.org/W1906003146,"This study presents data on the detailed evaluation (tier 2) of a site-specific ecological risk assessment (ssERA) in a former smelter area contaminated with metals (Santo Amaro, Bahia, Brazil). Combining information from three lines of evidence (LoE), chemical (ChemLoE), ecotoxicological (EcotoxLoE) and ecological (EcoLoE), in the Triad approach, integrated risk values were calculated to rank sites and confirm the potential risk disclosed with tier 1. Risk values were calculated for the habitat and for the retention functions in each sampling point. Habitat function included the ChemLoE calculated from total metal concentrations. The EcotoxLoE was based on reproduction tests with terrestrial invertebrates (Folsomia candida, Enchytraeus crypticus, Eisenia andrei), shoot length and plant biomass (Avena sativa, Brassica rapa). For the EcoLoE, ecological parameters (microbial parameters, soil invertebrate community, litter breakdown) were used to derive risk values. Retention function included the ChemLoE, calculated from extractable metal concentrations, and the EcotoxLoE based on eluate tests with aquatic organisms (Daphnia magna reproduction and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth). Results related to the habitat function indicated that the metal residues are sufficient to cause risk to biota, while the low metal levels in extracts and the general lack of toxicity in aquatic tests indicated a high soil retention capacity in most sampling points. Integrated risk of tier 2 showed the same trend of tier 1, suggesting the need to proceed with remediation actions. The high risk levels were related to direct toxicity to organisms and indirect effects, such as failure in the establishment of vegetation and the consequent loss of habitat quality for microorganisms and soil fauna. This study shed some light on the selection of tools for the tier 2 of an ssERA in tropical metal-contaminated sites, focusing on ecological receptors at risk and using available chemical methods, ecological surveys and ecotoxicity tests."

However, the precise signaling networks that regulate the production of each in Toxoplasma gondii-infected THP-1 monocytic cells, particularly the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, remain unknown. In the present study, T. gondii infection upregulated the expression of IL-23 and IL-12 in THP-1 cells, and both cytokines increased with parasite dose. IL-23 secretion was strongly inhibited by TLR2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment in a dose-dependent manner and by TLR2 siRNA transfection, whereas IL-12 secretion was strongly inhibited by TLR4 mAb treatment dose-dependently and by TLR4 siRNA transfection. IL-23 production was dose-dependently inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, whereas IL-12 production increased dose-dependently. THP-1 cells exposed to live T. gondii tachyzoites underwent rapid p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK activation. IL-23 production was significantly upregulated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 dose-dependently, whereas pretreatment with 10 μM SB203580 significantly downregulated IL-12 production. ERK1/2 inhibition by PD98059 was significantly downregulated IL-23 production but upregulated IL-12 production. JNK inhibition by SP600125 upregulated IL-23 production, but IL-12 production was significantly downregulated dose-dependently. T. gondii infection resulted in AKT activation, and AKT phosphorylation was inhibited dose-dependently after pretreatment with PI3K inhibitors. In T. gondii-infected THP-1 cells, ERK1/2 activation was regulated by PI3K; however, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK was negatively modulated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Collectively, these results indicate that IL-23 production in T. gondii-infected THP-1 cells was regulated mainly by TLR2 and then by PI3K and ERK1/2; however, IL-12 production was mainly regulated by TLR4 and then by p38 MAPK and JNK. Our findings provide new insight concerning the intracellular networks of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling cascades for regulating T. gondii-induced IL-23 and IL-12 secretion in human monocytic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1894171397,"This paper describes the trends in prevalence of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) and ESBL genes, measured in five consecutive yearly Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS). All patients present in the hospital and in a day-care clinic (including patients on dialysis) on the day of the survey, were screened for perianal ESBL-E carriage. Perianal swabs were taken and cultured using an enrichment broth and a selective agar plate. Both phenotypic and genotypic methods were used to detect the production of ESBL, presence of ESBL-genes and clonal relatedness. Out of 2,695 patients, 135 (5.0%) were tested ESBL-E positive. The overall ESBL-E prevalence was stable over the years. Overall 5.2% of all ESBL-E were acquired by nosocomial transmission. A relative decrease of CTX-M-1-1-like ESBL genes (from 44 to 25%, p = 0.026) was observed, possibly related to the strong (>60%) decrease in antibiotic use in livestock in our country during the same period."

Therefore, a study to determine the global gene expression profile of tenogenic differentiation in human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) using growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) was conducted. Microarray analyses were conducted on hMSCs cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml of GDF5 and compared to undifferentiated hMSCs and adult tenocytes. Results of QuantiGene® Plex assay support the use and interpretation of the inferred gene expression profiles and pathways information. From the 27,216 genes assessed, 873 genes (3.21% of the overall human transcriptome) were significantly altered during the tenogenic differentiation process (corrected p<0.05). The genes identified as potentially associated with tenogenic differentiation were ARHGAP29, CCL2, integrin alpha 8 and neurofilament medium polypeptides. These genes, were mainly associated with cytoskeleton reorganization (stress fibers formation) signaling. Pathway analysis demonstrated the potential molecular pathways involved in tenogenic differentiation were: cytoskeleton reorganization related i.e. keratin filament signaling and activin A signaling; cell adhesion related i.e. chemokine and adhesion signaling; and extracellular matrix related i.e. arachidonic acid production signaling. Further investigation using atomic force microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated apparent cytoskeleton reorganization in GDF5-induced hMSCs suggesting that cytoskeleton reorganization signaling is an important event involved in tenogenic differentiation. Besides, a reduced nucleostemin expression observed suggested a lower cell proliferation rate in hMSCs undergoing tenogenic differentiation. Understanding and elucidating the tenogenic differentiation signalling pathways are important for future optimization of tenogenic hMSCs for functional tendon cell-based therapy and tissue engineering."

The tumor suppressor gene Scribble encodes a polarity protein that is conserved between Drosophila and mammals; loss of the locus disrupts cell polarity, inhibits apoptosis, and mediates cancer process. However, the role of Scribble in drug resistance remains unknown. We show here that knockdown of Scribble enhances drug resistance by permitting accumulation of Snail, which functions as a transcription factor during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Then, loss of Scribble activates the mRNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) by facilitating translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrate HuR can recognize AU-rich elements of the Snail-encoding mRNA, thereby regulating Snail translation. Moreover, loss of Scribble-induced HuR translocation mediates the accumulation of Snail via activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Thus, this work clarifies the role of polarity protein Scribble, which is directly implicated in the regulation of developmental transcription factor Snail, and suggesting a mechanism for Scribble mediating cancer drug resistance.

We noted multiple E2F binding site consensus sequences in both promoters. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in both human and mouse cells and found that E2F1 bound to candidate E2F binding sites in both promoters. In HEK293 cells, we overexpressed E2F1, which significantly reduced OGT and MGEA5 expression. Conversely, E2F1-deficient mouse fibroblasts had increased Ogt and Mgea5 expression. Of the known binding partners for E2F1, we queried whether retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1) might be involved.

https://openalex.org/W2184719027,"Aging is commonly described as being a continuous process affecting progressively organisms as time passes. This process results in a progressive decrease in individuals fitness through a wide range of both organismal-decreased motor activity, fertility, resistance to stress-and molecular phenotypes-decreased protein and energy homeostasis, impairment of insulin signaling. In the past 20 years, numerous genes have been identified as playing a major role in the aging process, yet little is known about the events leading to that loss of fitness. We recently described an event characterized by a dramatic increase of intestinal permeability to a blue food dye in aging flies committed to die within a few days. Importantly, flies showing this so called 'Smurf' phenotype are the only ones, among a population, to show various age-related changes and exhibit a high-risk of impending death whatever their chronological age. Thus, these observations suggest that instead of being one continuous phenomenon, aging may be a discontinuous process well described by at least two distinguishable phases. In this paper we addressed this hypothesis by implementing a new 2 Phases of Aging mathematiCal model (2PAC model) to simulate longevity curves based on the simple hypothesis of two consecutive phases of lifetime presenting different properties. We first present a unique equation for each phase and discuss the biological significance of the 3 associated parameters. Then we evaluate the influence of each parameter on the shape of survival curves. Overall, this new mathematical model, based on simple biological observations, is able to reproduce many experimental longevity curves, supporting the existence of 2 phases of aging exhibiting specific properties and separated by a dramatic transition that remains to be characterized. Moreover, it indicates that Smurf survival can be approximated by one single constant parameter for a broad range of genotypes that we have tested under our environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2412814116,"Cell migration is a fundamental cellular process requiring integrated activities of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and cell/extracellular matrix adhesions. Many cytoskeletal activities rely on microtubule filaments. It has been speculated that microtubules can serve as tracks to deliver proteins essential for focal adhesion turnover. Three microtubule end-binding proteins (EB1, EB2, and EB3) in mammalian cells can track the plus ends of growing microtubules. EB1 and EB3 together can regulate microtubule dynamics by promoting microtubule growth and suppressing catastrophe, whereas, in contrast, EB2 does not play a direct role in microtubule dynamic instability, and little is known about the cellular function of EB2. By quantitative proteomics, we identified mammalian HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) as an EB2-specific interacting protein. Knockdown of HAX1 and EB2 in skin epidermal cells stabilizes focal adhesions and impairs epidermal migration in vitro and in vivo. Our results further demonstrate that cell motility and focal adhesion turnover require interaction between Hax1 and EB2. Together, our findings provide new insights for this critical cellular process, suggesting that EB2 association with Hax1 plays a significant role in focal adhesion turnover and epidermal migration."

This enzyme also contributes to many important biological functions during plant growth and development, such as seed development, root development and plant nitrogen using. The unique rice arginase gene OsARG is known to affect nitrogen use efficiency and is also associated with higher yields in rice. In this study, we transformed OsARG into upland cotton R18 by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation and analyzed the function of OsARG in transgenic cotton. Two independent OsARG expression transgenic cotton lines, ARG-26 and ARG-38, were obtained via transformation. Southern blot analysis indicated that two copies and one copy of the OsARG gene were integrated into the ARG-26 and ARG-38 genomes, respectively. Enzyme activity and RNA transcription analysis revealed that the OsARG gene is highly expressed in cotton. The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the OsARG gene. Field experiments indicated that the polyamine and nitrogen content increased by more than two-fold in the T3 generation plants of the transgenic cotton lines ARG-26-2, ARG-26-7, ARG-38-8, and ARG-38-11, as compared with the control plants. After harvesting cotton fibers grown in field conditions, we analyzed the quality of fiber and found that the fiber length was increased in the transgenic lines. The average cotton fiber length for all of the transgenic cotton lines was two millimeters longer than the fibers of the control plants; the average cotton fiber lengths were 31.94 mm, 32.00 mm, 32.68 mm and 32.84 mm in the ARG-26ARG-26-2, ARG-26-7, ARG-38-8 and ARG-38-11 lines, respectively, but the average fiber length of the control plants was 29.36mm. Our results indicate that the OsARG gene could potentially be used to improve cotton fiber length traits."
https://openalex.org/W1922213143,"Very young cucumber (Cucumis sativus) fruit are highly susceptible to infection by the oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora capsici. As the fruit complete exponential growth, at approximately 10-12 days post pollination (dpp), they transition to resistance. The development of age-related resistance (ARR) is increasingly recognized as an important defense against pathogens, however, underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Peel sections from cucumber fruit harvested at 8 dpp (susceptible) and 16 dpp (resistant) showed equivalent responses to inoculation as did whole fruit, indicating that the fruit surface plays an important role in defense against P. capsici. Exocarp from 16 dpp fruit had thicker cuticles, and methanolic extracts of peel tissue inhibited growth of P. capsici in vitro, suggesting physical or chemical components to the ARR. Transcripts specifically expressed in the peel vs. pericarp showed functional differentiation. Transcripts predominantly expressed in the peel were consistent with fruit surface associated functions including photosynthesis, cuticle production, response to the environment, and defense. Peel-specific transcripts that exhibited increased expression in 16 dpp fruit relative to 8 dpp fruit, were highly enriched (P<0.0001) for response to stress, signal transduction, and extracellular and transport functions. Specific transcripts included genes associated with potential physical barriers (i.e., cuticle), chemical defenses (flavonoid biosynthesis), oxidative stress, penetration defense, and molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered or effector-triggered (R-gene mediated) pathways. The developmentally regulated changes in gene expression between peels from susceptible- and resistant- age fruits suggest programming for increased defense as the organ reaches full size."

Cluster analysis revealed different hot spots over time. Lifestyle habits, such as walking barefoot in irrigated taro fields or pig pens probably contributed to contamination from the swine and rodent reservoirs to humans.

We sought to identify the mechanism of differential regulation by MARCKS of VSMC and EC proliferation in vitro and in vivo.siRNA-mediated MARCKS knockdown in VSMCs inhibited proliferation and prevented progression from phase G0/G1 to S. Protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, but not p21cip1 was increased by MARCKS knockdown. MARCKS knockdown did not affect proliferation in VSMCs derived from p27kip1-/- mice indicating that the effect of MARCKS is p27kip1-dependent. MARCKS knockdown resulted in decreased phosphorylation of p27kip1 at threonine 187 and serine 10 as well as, kinase interacting with stathmin (KIS), cyclin D1, and Skp2 expression. Phosphorylation of p27kip1 at serine 10 by KIS is required for nuclear export and degradation of p27kip1. MARCKS knockdown caused nuclear trapping of p27kip1. Both p27kip1 nuclear trapping and cell cycle arrest were released by overexpression of KIS, but not catalytically inactive KIS. In ECs, MARCKS knockdown paradoxically increased KIS expression and cell proliferation. MARCKS knockdown in a murine aortic injury model resulted in decreased VSMC proliferation determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) integration assay, and inhibition of vascular wall thickening. MARCKS knockdown increased the rate of re-endothelialization.MARCKS knockdown arrested VSMC cell cycle by decreasing KIS expression. Decreased KIS expression resulted in nuclear trapping of p27kip1 in VSMCs. MARCKS knockdown paradoxically increased KIS expression in ECs resulting in increased EC proliferation. MARCKS knockdown significantly attenuated the VSMC proliferative response to vascular injury, but accelerated reestablishment of an intact endothelium. MARCKS is a novel translational target with beneficial cell type-specific effects on both ECs and VSMCs."

Vesicular debris within lens cells exposed to UV light has been observed raising speculation that lens cells themselves could act as phagocytes to remove toxic apoptotic debris. However, phagocytosis has not been confirmed as a function of the intact eye lens, and no mechanism for lens phagocytosis has been established. Here, we demonstrate that the eye lens is capable of phagocytizing extracellular lens cell debris. Using high throughput RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we establish that lens epithelial cells express members of the integrin αVβ5-mediated phagocytosis pathway and that internalized cell debris co-localizes with αVβ5 and with RAB7 and Rab-interacting lysosomal protein that are required for phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes. We demonstrate that the αVβ5 receptor is required for lens epithelial cell phagocytosis and that UV light treatment of lens epithelial cells results in damage to the αVβ5 receptor with concomitant loss of phagocytosis.

Using high throughput RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we establish that lens epithelial cells express members of the integrin αVβ5-mediated phagocytosis pathway and that internalized cell debris co-localizes with αVβ5 and with RAB7 and Rab-interacting lysosomal protein that are required for phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes. We demonstrate that the αVβ5 receptor is required for lens epithelial cell phagocytosis and that UV light treatment of lens epithelial cells results in damage to the αVβ5 receptor with concomitant loss of phagocytosis. These data suggest that loss of αVβ5-mediated phagocytosis by the eye lens could result in accumulation of toxic cell debris that could contribute to UV light-induced cataract formation."
https://openalex.org/W2177956265,"In severe burn injury the unique setting of a depleted, dysfunctional immune system along with a loss of barrier function commonly results in opportunistic infections that eventually proof fatal. Unfortunately, the dynamic sequence of bacterial contamination, colonization and eventually septic invasion with bacteria such as Pseudomonas species is still poorly understood although a limiting factor in clinical decision making. Increasing evidence supports the notion that inhibition of bacterial translocation into the wound site may be an effective alternative to prevent infection. In this context we investigated the role of the mammalian Chitinase-3-Like-1 (CHI3L1) non-enyzmatic protein predominately expressed on epithelial as well as innate immune cells as a potential bacterial-translocation-mediating factor. We show a strong trend that a modulation of chitinase expression is likely to be effective in reducing mortality rates in a mouse model of burn injury with superinfection with the opportunistic PA14 Pseudomonas strain, thus demonstrating possible clinical leverage."
https://openalex.org/W2226993512,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent a highly differentiated cell type that lines hepatic sinusoids. LSECs form a discontinuous endothelium due to fenestrations under physiological conditions, which are reduced upon chronic liver injury. Cultivation of rodent LSECs associates with a rapid onset of stress-induced senescence a few days post isolation, which limits genetic and biochemical studies ex vivo. Here we show the establishment of LSECs isolated from p19ARF-/- mice which undergo more than 50 cell doublings in the absence of senescence. Isolated p19ARF-/- LSECs display a cobblestone-like morphology and show the ability of tube formation. Analysis of DNA content revealed a stable diploid phenotype after long-term passaging without a gain of aneuploidy. Notably, p19ARF-/- LSECs express the endothelial markers CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor, stabilin-2 and CD146 suggesting that these cells harbor and maintain an endothelial phenotype. In line, treatment with small molecule inhibitors against VEGFR-2 caused cell death, demonstrating the sustained ability of p19ARF-/- LSECs to respond to anti-angiogenic therapeutics. From these data we conclude that loss of p19ARF overcomes senescence of LSECs, allowing immortalization of cells without losing endothelial characteristics. Thus, p19ARF-/- LSECs provide a novel cellular model to study endothelial cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2132168249,"At present, the radius of wind turbine rotors ranges from several meters to one hundred meters, or even more, which extends Reynolds number of the airfoil profile from the order of 105 to 107. Taking the blade for 3MW wind turbines as an example, the influence of Reynolds number on the aerodynamic design of a wind turbine blade is studied. To make the study more general, two kinds of multi-objective optimization are involved: one is based on the maximum power coefficient (CPopt) and the ultimate load, and the other is based on the ultimate load and the annual energy production (AEP). It is found that under the same configuration, the optimal design has a larger CPopt or AEP (CPopt//AEP) for the same ultimate load, or a smaller load for the same CPopt//AEP at higher Reynolds number. At a certain tip-speed ratio or ultimate load, the blade operating at higher Reynolds number should have a larger chord length and twist angle for the maximum Cpopt//AEP. If a wind turbine blade is designed by using an airfoil database with a mismatched Reynolds number from the actual one, both the load and Cpopt//AEP will be incorrectly estimated to some extent. In some cases, the assessment error attributed to Reynolds number is quite significant, which may bring unexpected risks to the earnings and safety of a wind power project."

The two enzymes differ by only four amino acid residues, which determine whether the enzymes transfer GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc or Gal from UDP-Gal to the H-antigen acceptor. The enzymes belong to the class of GT-A folded enzymes, grouped as GT6 in the CAZy database, and are characterized by a single domain with a metal dependent retaining reaction mechanism. However, the exact role of the four amino acid residues in the specificity of the enzymes is still unresolved. In this study, we report the first structural information of a dual specificity cis-AB blood group glycosyltransferase in complex with a synthetic UDP-GalNAc derivative. Interestingly, the GalNAc moiety adopts an unusual yet catalytically productive conformation in the binding pocket, which is different from the “tucked under” conformation previously observed for the UDP-Gal donor. In addition, we show that this UDP-GalNAc derivative in complex with the H-antigen acceptor provokes the same unusual binding pocket closure as seen for the corresponding UDP-Gal derivative. Despite this, the two derivatives show vastly different kinetic properties.

One important example is the generation of human ABO(H) blood group A and B antigens. These antigens differ in only a single sugar (A: N-acetyl d-galactosamine; B: d-galactose), which is installed at the common H-antigen core by one of two closely related GTs, an α-(1→3)-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA) and an α-(1→3)-galactosyltransferase (GTB) (Fig. 1A). Despite the different donor substrate specificities GTA and GTB are identical except for only four amino acids. GTA has residues Arg176, Gly235, Leu266, and Gly268, whereas GTB has residues Gly176, Ser235, Met266, and Ala268 at the corresponding positions (3Yamamoto F. Cid E. Yamamoto M. Blancher A.

The structural basis for this difference in specificity between GTA and GTB is currently unresolved. To address this question, important insights can be gleaned from structural and mechanistic studies with mutant blood group enzymes. One naturally occurring blood group GT mutant is the cis-AB enzyme, AAGlyB, which can bind and utilize either UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc with almost equal efficiency (3Yamamoto F. Cid E. Yamamoto M.

These donor analogues carry an additional substituent in position 5 of the uracil base (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, this modification in position 5 of UDP-Gal turned the donor analogues 1 (5-(5-formylthien-2-yl)-UDP-α-d-galactose) and 2 (5-(phenyl)-UDP-α-d-galactose) into potent inhibitors with very low turnover rates with the AAGlyB mutant (7Pesnot T.

However, the 5-formylthienyl and phenyl substituents in these compounds are obstructing the stacking of the side chain of Trp181 positioned in a flexible active site loop with the side chain of Arg352 in the equally flexible C terminus. Upon binding of native donor substrates to blood group GTs, this stacking interaction stabilizes the “closed” conformation and contributes to the H-antigen acceptor (HAA) binding site, which is required for full catalytic activity. Hence, obstruction of this crucial conformational transition provides an explanation for the inhibitory activity of 1 and 2 toward AAGlyB (7Pesnot T. Jørgensen R. Palcic M.M. Wagner G.K.

The structures of AAGlyB in complex with compounds 1 or 2 and the HAA substrate acceptor, α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp, in conjunction with detailed enzymological data, also provided an explanation for the different binding affinities and turnover rates of the two different UDP-Gal derivatives (12Jørgensen R.

Intriguingly, the ternary structure of the AAGlyB-1-HAA complex revealed an alternatively closed conformation of the C terminus forming hydrogen bonds with the 5-formylthienyl substituent. This alternatively closed conformation was not present in the AAGlyB-2-HAA structure presumably because of the lack of hydrogen bonding opportunities between the C terminus and the 5-phenyl substituent in 2. Therefore, the ability of AAGlyB to adopt this alternative conformation in 1 but not in 2 provided an explanation for the difference in residual rate of product formation between the two derivatives. It also suggested a reason for the elevated Km for acceptor substrate with compound 1 because a histidine residue in this alternative conformation of the C terminus is no longer hydrogen bonding to the acceptor.

Therefore, we have expanded our ligand design to the UDP-GalNAc congener of inhibitor 1 (compound 3, Fig. 1B) assuming that this UDP-GalNAc derivative would also behave as an inhibitor with a low turnover rate. Herein, we present the synthesis of compound 3 as well as structures of AAGlyB in complex with 3 alone, and in complex with 3 together with the HAA-acceptor. Importantly, the structure of the AAGlyB-3 complex contains the donor analogue with a partially intact GalNAc portion, which, for the first time, gives an indication of the binding mode of UDP-GalNAc to a human blood group GT. In this new structure, the GalNAc moiety is placed in the active site in a conformation, which is different from the canonical tucked under conformation previously observed in other UDP-sugar-GT complex structures (7Pesnot T.

Triphenylphosphine-3,3′,3″-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (0.0625 eq), Na2Cl4Pd (0.025 eq), and degassed H2O (4 ml) were added and the reaction was stirred under N2 for 1 h at 50 °C. Upon completion, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the pH was adjusted to 7 with 1% HCl. The black suspension was filtered through a membrane filter (0.45 μm). The filter was washed with H2O and the combined filtrates were evaporated under reduced pressure.

The AAGlyB-3 complex crystals were flash cooled in liquid N2 after adding a cryosolution consisting of reservoir solution including 20% glycerol and 25 mm compound 3 to a crystal drop and letting it soak for 30 min at 4 °C. The AAGlyB-3-HAA crystals were flash cooled in liquid N2 as for AAGlyB-3 crystals but with an additional 25 mm α-Fucp-(1→2)-β-Galp-O-(CH2)7-CH3 (HAA) acceptor added to the cryosolution.

For donor kinetics, 3 (25–0.29 μm), AAGlyB protein (0.004 μg/ml), TMR-labeled acceptor (25 μm), MnCl2 (20 mm), BSA (1 mg/ml), and MOPS buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) were incubated at 37 °C. All concentrations are final concentrations in a volume of 12 μl. To avoid substrate depletion, the assay was only incubated for 8 min. For acceptor kinetics with 3, the following concentrations were used: 3 (33.3 μm) and TMR-labeled acceptor (250–1.9 μm), incubated for 20 min. The Km and Vmax values were obtained by fitting the data points to a Michaelis-Menten curve using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). The Ki value for 3 with AAGlyB competing with UDP-[6-3H]Gal transfer was determined by a standard SepPak reverse-phase radiochemical assay as previously described (15Alfaro J.A. Zheng R.B. Persson M. Letts J.A. Polakowski R. Bai Y. Borisova S.N. Seto N.O. Lowary T.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. ABO(H) blood group A and B glycosyltransferases recognize substrate via specific conformational changes.J.

Ki values were determined by linear regression of Dixon plots using 100 μm HAA, 2 μm UDP-Gal, 300,000 dpm of UDP-[6-3H]Gal, and 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm 3. Because the GalNAc moiety in compound 3 is not radiolabeled this assay set-up does not differentiate between inhibitor and substrate behavior of 3. Reduced incorporation of labeled [6-3H]Gal from UDP-[6-3H]Gal can be the result either of inhibition, or incorporation of unlabeled GalNAc. Therefore, the determination of Ki values in this assay is compatible with the observed donor substrate behavior of 3. Hydrolysis of UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc by AAGlyB was followed with a radiochemical assay, as previously described (28Sindhuwinata N. Munoz E. Munoz F.J. Palcic M.M. Peters H. Peters T.

https://openalex.org/W2167200526,"How does the brain discriminate essential information aimed to be stored permanently from information required only temporarily, and that needs to be cleared away for not saturating our precious memory space? Reference Memory (RM) refers to the long-term storage of invariable information whereas Working Memory (WM) depends on the short-term storage of trial-unique information. Previous work has revealed that WM tasks are very sensitive to proactive interference. In order to prevent such interference, irrelevant old memories must be forgotten to give new ones the opportunity to be stabilized. However, unlike memory, physiological processes underlying this adaptive form of forgetting are still poorly understood. Here, we precisely ask what specific brain structure(s) could be responsible for such process to occur. To answer this question, we trained rats in a radial maze using three paradigms, a RM task and two WM tasks involving or not the processing of interference but strictly identical in terms of locomotion or motivation. We showed that an inhibition of the expression of Zif268 and c-Fos, two indirect markers of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, was observed in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus when processing such interfering previously stored information. Conversely, we showed that inactivating the dentate gyrus impairs both RM and WM, but improves the processing of interference. Altogether, these results strongly suggest for the first time that the dentate gyrus could be a key structure involved in adaptive forgetting."
https://openalex.org/W2236002390,"Coupling between cyclically varying external light and an endogenous biochemical oscillator known as the circadian clock, modulates a rhythmic pattern with two prominent peaks in the locomotion of Drosophila melanogaster. A morning peak appears around the time lights turn on and an evening peak appears just before lights turn off. The close association between the peaks and the external 12:12 hour light/dark photoperiod means that respective morning and evening peaks of individual flies are well-synchronized in time and, consequently, feature prominently in population-averaged data. Here, we report on a brief but strong stochastic burst in fly activity that, in contrast to morning and evening peaks, is detectable only in single fly recordings. This burst was observed across 3 wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster. In a single fly recording, the burst is likely to appear once randomly within 0.5-5 hours after lights turn on, last for only 2-3 minutes and yet show 5 times greater activity compared to the maximum of morning peak with data binned in 3 minutes. Owing to its variable timing and short duration, the burst is virtually undetectable in population-averaged data. We use a locally-built illumination system to study the burst and find that its incidence in a population correlates with light intensity, with ~85% of control flies showing the behavior at 8000 lux (1942 μW/cm2). Consistent with that finding, several mutant flies with impaired vision show substantially reduced frequency of the burst. Additionally, we find that genetic ablation of the clock has insignificant effect on burst frequency. Together, these data suggest that the pronounced burst is likely generated by a light-activated circuit that is independent of the circadian clock."

We used error-prone PCR and activity screening to identify mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) PDOR with improved activity. The activity of one of the identified mutants, PDOR'-24, which includes a single mutation, A199S, was 48 U/mg, 4.9 times that of the wild-type enzyme. Molecular docking was performed to analyze the identified mutants; and amino acids S103, H271, N366, D106, N262 and D364 were predicted to bond with NADH. The origins of the improved activity of PDOR'-24, as well as three other mutants were analyzed by simulating the interaction mechanism of the mutants with the substrate and coenzyme, respectively. This research provides useful information about the use of safranine O plate screening for the directed evolution of oxidoreductases, identifies interesting sites for improving PDOR activity, and demonstrates the utility of using molecular docking to analyze the interaction mechanism of the mutants with the substrate and coenzyme, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1952021098,"Very little is known about the extent of physical health issues among young women in early adulthood and whether this is changing over time.We used data from two national samples of young women aged 18-23 years, surveyed 17 years apart, who participated in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. We used multinomial logistic regression to compare the women's physical health (i.e., self-rated health, common symptoms and conditions) and identify whether sociodemographic factors, health behaviours and stress explained any physical health differences between the samples.Women aged 18-23 years in 2013 (N = 17,069) were more likely to report poor self-rated health and physical symptoms (particularly urogenital and bowel symptoms) than women aged 18-23 years in 1996 (N = 14,247). Stress accounted for a large proportion of the physical health differences between the cohorts, particularly for allergies, headaches, self-rated health, severe tiredness, skin problems, severe period pain and hypertension.Women's health appears to be changing, with young women born in more recent decades reporting greater physical symptom levels. Changing socio-cultural and economic conditions may place pressure on young adults, negatively affecting their health and wellbeing. Assessing the extent to which social structures and health care policies are offering adequate support to young women may offer avenues for promoting positive health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2225016033,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the elderly and negatively impacts survival and health status. Thus, nephrological competence is mandatory for a skilled geriatrician. The present study aimed to assess nephrological competence in a sample of geriatricians recruited through a web survey. To this aim, a 12-items questionnaire was produced by an expert panel of nephrologists and geriatricians and was available online for members of the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics (SIGG). Two-hundred-eighty-seven geriatricians volunteered to fill in the questionnaire. The majority of them indirectly estimated the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using mainly the Cockroft-Gault (C-G) formula. Selected nephrological exams, such as urinary Na and serum D-vitamin measurements, did not qualify as routine exams although the majority of geriatricians supplemented their patients with fat-soluble secosteroids. Ten percent of geriatricians asked for nephrological consultation only for stage 5 CKD patients and 30,9% only for stage 4 or 5. Erythropoietin supplementation was common practice for the majority of geriatricians, while only one third of them systematically used a procedure intended to prevent the contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Finally, an alleged 50% adherence to the international guidelines for the management of CKD patients emerged from the questionnaire. Overall, results from this survey strongly recommend promoting nephrological education among geriatricians. Didactic standards for in training geriatricians need to be updated and the cooperation between geriatrics and nephrological societies promoted."
https://openalex.org/W2263070645,"Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (cPEPCK) is a critical enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, glyceroneogenesis and cataplerosis. cPEPCK converts oxaloacetic acid (OAA) into phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) in the presence of GTP. cPEPCK is known to be associated with type 2 diabetes. Genistein is an isoflavone compound that shows anti-diabetic and anti-obesitic properties. Experimental studies have shown a decrease in the blood glucose level in the presence of genistein by lowering the functional activity of cPEPCK, an enzyme of gluconeogenesis. Using computational techniques such as molecular modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculations, we identified cPEPCK as a direct target of genistein. We studied the molecular interactions of genistein with three possible conformations of cPEPCK-unbound cPEPCK (u_cPEPCK), GTP bound cPEPCK (GTP_cPEPCK) and GDP bound cPEPCK (GDP_cPEPCK). Binding of genistein was also compared with an already known cPEPCK inhibitor. We analyzed the interactions of genistein with cPEPCK enzyme and compared them with its natural substrate (OAA), product (PEP) and known inhibitor (3-MPA). Our results demonstrate that genistein uses the mechanism of mixed inhibition to block the functional activity of cPEPCK and thus can serve as a potential anti-diabetic and anti-obesity drug candidate. We also identified an extended binding site in the catalytic cleft of cPEPCK which is used by 3-MPA to inhibit cPEPCK non-competitively. We demonstrate that extended binding site of cPEPCK can further be exploited for designing new drugs against cPEPCK."

https://openalex.org/W2180882244,"The food consumption to biomass ratio (C) is one of the most important population parameters in ecosystem modelling because its quantifies the interactions between predator and prey. Existing models for estimating C in fish populations are per-recruit cohort models or empirical models, valid only for stationary populations. Moreover, empirical models lack theoretical support. Here we develop a theory and derive a general modelling framework to estimate C in fish populations, based on length frequency data and the generalised von Bertalanffy growth function, in which models for stationary populations with a stable-age distributions are special cases. Estimates using our method are compared with estimates from per-recruit cohort models for C using simulated harvested fish populations of different lifespans. The models proposed here are also applied to three fish populations that are targets of commercial fisheries in southern Chile. Uncertainty in the estimation of C was evaluated using a resampling approach. Simulations showed that stationary and non-stationary population models produce different estimates for C and those differences depend on the lifespan, fishing mortality and recruitment variations. Estimates of C using the new model exhibited smoother inter-annual variation in comparison with a per-recruit model estimates and they were also smaller than C predicted by the empirical equations in all population assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2177026387,"Object localization plays a key role in many popular applications of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) and as a result, it has acquired a significant status for the research community. A significant body of research performs this task without considering node orientation, object geometry and environmental variations. As a result, the localized object does not reflect the real world scenarios. In this paper, a novel object localization scheme for WMSN has been proposed that utilizes range free localization, computer vision, and principle component analysis based algorithms. The proposed approach provides the best possible approximation of distance between a wmsn sink and an object, and the orientation of the object using image based information. Simulation results report 99% efficiency and an error ratio of 0.01 (around 1 ft) when compared to other popular techniques."
