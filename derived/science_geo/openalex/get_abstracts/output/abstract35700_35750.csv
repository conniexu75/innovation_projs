https://openalex.org/W1499811594,"In mammalian cells, low density lipoprotein (LDL) is bound, internalized, and delivered to lysosomes where LDL-cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed to unesterified cholesterol. The mechanisms of intracellular transport of LDL-cholesterol from lysosomes to other cellular sites and LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism are unknown. We have identified a pharmacological agent, U18666A (3-beta-[2-diethyl-amino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one), which impairs the intracellular transport of LDL-derived cholesterol in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. U18666A blocks the ability of LDL-derived cholesterol to stimulate cholesterol esterification, and to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and LDL receptor activities. However, U18666A does not impair 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated regulation of these processes. In addition, U18666A impedes the ability of LDL-derived cholesterol to support the growth of CHO cells. However, U18666A has only moderate effects on growth supported by non-lipoprotein cholesterol. LDL binding, internalization, and lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesteryl esters are not affected by the presence of U18666A. Analysis of intracellular cholesterol transport reveals that LDL-derived cholesterol accumulates in the lysosomes of U18666A-treated CHO cells which results in impaired movement of LDL-derived cholesterol to other cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1494127461,"Abstract Secretogranin II (previously also called chromogranin C) is a tyrosine-sulfated secretory protein found in secretory granules in a wide variety of endocrine cells and neurons. Here, we have determined the primary structure of human secretogranin II from a full length cDNA clone and have investigated its properties, predicted from the sequence, by studying the behavior of purified secretogranin II under conditions characteristic of the milieu of secretory granules. Analysis of a 2.35-kilobase cDNA clone isolated from a human pituitary library and identified as secretogranin II by various criteria showed that human presecretogranin II is a 617-residue polypeptide containing an NH2-terminal located signal peptide. Secretogranin II lacks the disulfide-bonded loop structure near the NH2 terminus which is conserved in chromogranin A and chromogranin B (secretogranin I), two other widespread constituents of neuroendocrine secretory granules, but like the latter two proteins contains (i) an -E-N/S-L-X-A/D-X-D/E-X-E-L- motif and (ii) multiple potential dibasic cleavage sites for the generation of smaller, perhaps biologically active peptides. Another structural feature that secretogranin II shares with chromogranin A and chromogranin B (secretogranin I) is the abundance of acidic residues all along the polypeptide chain whose negative charge must somehow be neutralized to allow condensation and packaging of the protein into secretory granules. Experiments with purified secretogranin II showed that in the presence of 10 mM calcium at pH 5.2, conditions characteristic of the milieu of neuroendocrine secretory granules, this protein formed aggregates. Immunoglobulin G, a secretory protein that in vivo is not packaged into secretory granules, did not form aggregates under these in vitro conditions and was excluded from the secretogranin II aggregates. Very little aggregation of secretogranin II was observed in the absence of calcium at pH 5.2 or in the presence of calcium at neutral pH. In vivo, ammonium chloride, which is known to neutralize the pH of acidic intracellular compartments, inhibited the packaging of newly synthesized secretogranin II into secretory granules. Our results suggest that the low pH- and calcium-induced aggregation of secretogranin II may be important for the organization of the secretory granule matrix and raise the possibility that aggregation of secretogranin II may be involved in its sorting to secretory granules."
https://openalex.org/W1525015059,"The compound 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) is a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus replication in vitro and is currently in clinical trials for treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The compound was found to exert delayed cytotoxicity against Molt-4F cells, a human T lymphoblastic cell line. At a concentration as low as 0.1 microM, the doubling time of the cells was increased after 8 days of ddC treatment. This concentration is 5-fold lower than plasma levels reached in clinical trials. The cells finally died after a 2-week exposure to 0.1 or 0.2 microM ddC. The delayed cytotoxicity was not due to a greater accumulation of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine triphosphate in cells with longer exposure to the compound. The cellular content of mitochondrial DNA was found to decrease and the rate of glycolysis was found to increase with continuous exposure of cells to ddC. The mitochondrial toxicity and cell growth inhibition were reversed when ddC was removed. The reduction in cellular content of mitochondrial DNA caused by ddC may partially explain the delayed toxicity observed in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients treated with the drug."
https://openalex.org/W1514758940,"Graphic methods, when applied to enzyme kinetics, can provide a visually intuitive relation between calculations and reaction graphs. This will not only greatly raise the efficiency of calculations but also significantly help the analysis of enzyme kinetic mechanisms. In this paper, four graphic rules are presented. Rules 1–3 are established for steady state enzyme-catalyzed reaction systems and Rule 4 is for non-steady state ones. In comparison with conventional graphic methods which can only be applied to steady state systems, the present rules have the following merits. 1) Complicated and tedious calculations can be greatly simplified; for example, in calculating the concentrations of enzyme species for the bi-bi random mechanism, the calculation work can be reduced 8-fold compared with the King-Altman's method. 2) A great deal of wasted labor can be avoided; for example, in calculating the rate of product formation for the same mechanism, the operation of finding and removing the 96 reciprocally canceled terms is no longer needed because they automatically disappear during the derivation. 3) Final results can be easily and safely checked by a formula provided in each of the graphic rules. 4) Non-steady state systems can also be treated by the present graphic method; for example, applying Rule 4, one can directly write out the solution for a non-steady state enzyme-catalyzed system, without the need to follow more difficult and complicated operations to solve differential equations. The mathematical proofs of Rules 1–4 are given in Appendices A–D (in the Miniprint), respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1538340522,"Abstract A metabolite with intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing activity can be produced by incubating NAD+ with extracts from sea urchin eggs. Structural determination indicates it is a cyclized ADP-ribose, and we have proposed cyclic ADP-ribose as a common name for it. In this study, we addressed the question of how widespread is the occurrence of the synthesizing enzyme for this NAD+ metabolite. Incubation of NAD+ with extracts prepared from rabbit liver resulted in a progressive increase in Ca2+ release activity which was monitored by a biological assay using sea urchin egg homogenates. The half-maximal concentration of NAD+ required was about 1 mM. The reaction was stereospecific, and the extracts were sensitive to protease treatment and heat, as well as alkaline pH of about 9.0, indicating the reaction was catalyzed by a protein. The active metabolite was purified by an identical high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure used for cyclic ADP-ribose. Functionally, the liver metabolite behaved similarly to cyclic ADP-ribose. Both discharged the same Ca2+ stores in sea urchin egg homogenates with the same half-maximal effective concentrations. Both were active in inducing the cortical exocytosis reaction when microinjected into sea urchin eggs. That they are indeed identical compounds was demonstrated by structural analyses showing that they coeluted on a Partisil 5 SAX HPLC column and had identical 1H NMR spectra. Mass spectrometry indicated a mass of 540.0529 for the molecular ion (M - H)- of the liver metabolite, which was identical to within 0.74 ppm of cyclic ADP-ribose. Furthermore, their collisional activated decomposition mass spectra were virtually superimposable. Extracts from rabbit brain, heart, spleen, and kidney were all active in producing similar Ca2+-releasing metabolites which could be isolated by the same HPLC procedure and had similar elution times on both the mixed mode and the Partisil 5 SAX column. It is therefore apparent that the synthesizing enzyme for cyclic ADP-ribose is a very common enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1555694689,"The trigger Ca2+-binding sites in troponin C, those which initiate muscle contraction, are thought to be the first two of four potential sites (sites I-IV). In cardiac troponin C, the first Ca2+-binding site is inactive, and initiation of contraction in cardiac muscle appears to involve only the second site. To study this phenomenon and associated Ca2+-dependent protein conformational changes in cardiac troponin C, the cDNA for the chicken protein was incorporated into a bacterial expression plasmid to allow site-specific mutagenesis. Ca2+-binding site I was activated by deletion of Val-28 and conversion of amino acids 29-32 to those found at the first four positions in the active site I of fast skeletal troponin C. In a series of proteins, Ca2+-binding site II was inactivated by mutation of amino acids Asp-65, Asp-67, and Gly-70. All mutated proteins exhibited the predicted calcium-binding characteristics. The single mutation of converting Asp-65 to Ala was sufficient to inactivate site II. Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in the normal and mutated proteins were monitored by labeling with a sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent dye. Activation of Ca2+-binding site I or inactivation of site II, eliminated the large Ca2+-dependent increase in fluorescence seen in the wild type protein and there was, instead, a Ca2+-dependent decrease in fluorescence. All mutant proteins could associate with troponin I and troponin T to form a troponin complex. Activation of Ca2+-binding site I changed the characteristics of contraction in skinned slow skeletal muscle fibers such that the response to Ca2+ was more cooperative. Inactivation of Ca2+-binding site II abolished Ca2+-dependent contraction in skinned muscle fibers. The data provide a direct demonstration that Ca2+-binding site II in cardiac troponin C is essential for triggering muscle contraction and support the hypothesis that site I functions to modify the characteristics of contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1489733307,"Abstract We examined the effects of cellular aging on the regulation of heat shock gene expression in IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts. Heat shock (42-43 degrees C) and canavanine (200-400 micrograms/ml) were used to evoke the heat shock response in these cells. We showed that heat shock induced the synthesis of proteins with apparent molecular weights of 98,000, 89,000, 78,000, 72,000, 64,000, 50,000 and 25,000, with heat shock protein (HSP) 89 and 72 being most prominent. Canavanine induced the synthesis of the four high molecular weight HSPs, particularly HSP 89 and HSP 78, without noticeably enhancing synthesis of the low molecular weight HSPs. We found that, while a similar series of HSPs were induced in the young and old cells, there was a marked decrease in the magnitude of this induction in the old cells. Using cells with defined population doubling levels, we observed a direct correlation of the inducibility of HSP synthesis and the replicative potential of the cells used. Analysis of the amount of translatable and hybridizable mRNA, by the methods of in vitro translation and Northern blot hybridization, demonstrated that the induction of HSPs synthesis can be accounted for by increases in their mRNA. Nuclear runoff transcription provided evidence that the decrease in inducible expression of the HSPs in aging IMR-90 cells was attributable to a transcriptional mechanism. This conclusion was substantiated by analysis of the hsp 70 promoter activity in transient expression assay of the hsp 70 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. We propose that there is an age-associated dysfunction in the signaling mechanism of the heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W1555648778,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies to the CD9 antigen are powerful platelet agonists. We report here the novel finding that the anti-CD9 monoclonal antibodies 50H.19 and ALB6 promote physical association between CD9 antigen and the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GPIIb-IIIa) component of the platelet fibrinogen receptor. The monoclonal antibodies do not consistently immunoprecipitate proteins other than CD9 from 125I-labeled human platelets even if the platelets are first treated with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), indicating that CD9 antigen is not physically associated with other membrane proteins in the resting state. However, the addition of agonistic concentrations of either monoclonal antibody before cross-linking results in the coprecipitation of proteins corresponding in mobility and peptide composition to GPIIb, and GPIIIa. The association of CD9 with the GPIIb-IIIa complex is unaffected by a combination of aspirin and ADP scavengers sufficient to abrogate anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody-induced platelet aggregation, and is therefore not dependent upon thromboxane- and ADP-mediated pathways of intracellular signalling. The specificity of the association is demonstrated by the lack of other coprecipitating major proteins, by the requirement for induction by anti-CD9 monoclonal antibodies, and by the failure to promote reciprocal association with either of the anti-GPIIb-IIIa complex monoclonal antibodies P2 or HuP1-m1a."
https://openalex.org/W1538333669,"The hemorrhagic toxin Ht-d from venom of the Western diamondback rattlesnake is a metalloproteinase with a molecular weight of 23,234. Peptides were obtained from enzymatic and chemical digestions, separated by reverse-phase chromatography, and sequenced in a gas-phase sequenator. The sequence showed a putative zinc binding site similar to that of thermolysin and other metalloproteinases but no overall significant similarity to the sequences of other metalloproteinases and may represent a new subfamily of metalloproteinases. Ht-d was shown to degrade type IV collagen and gelatin types I, III, and V but not interstitial collagens. The digestion of type IV collagen and other basement membrane proteins may allow this proteinase to disrupt capillary membranes causing hemorrhage in surrounding tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1498359524,"Abstract The multicatalytic proteinase is a high molecular weight nonlysosomal proteinase which has been isolated from a variety of mammalian tissues and has been suggested to contain several distinct catalytic sites. The enzyme degrades protein and peptide substrates and can cleave bonds on the carboxyl side of basic, hydrophobic, and acidic amino acid residues. The three types of activity have been referred to as trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide bond hydrolyzing activities, respectively. All of these proteolytic activities are associated with a single band on native polyacrylamide gels. The pH optimum of the proteinase (pH 7.5-9.5) depends on the substrate. Using synthetic peptide substrates it was possible to demonstrate two distinct activities. Trypsin-like activity is inhibited at concentrations of the peptide aldehyde inhibitors leupeptin and antipain or of N-ethylmaleimide which have little or no effect on chymotrypsin-like activity. Results of mixed-substrate experiments also suggest that there are at least two distinct types of catalytic sites. All proteolytic activity is lost following dissociation by urea or by acid treatment. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the intact multicatalytic proteinase precipitate the complex but have little effect on its proteolytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1582393082,"Three cDNA clones containing the entire coding sequence for JH esterase from the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens have been isolated from an expression library using specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes. The complete sequence of one of the clones shows a 2989-base pair insert that is approximately the length of the single 3.0-kilobase pair mRNA transcript detected by Northern blotting. The clone has an open reading frame of 1714 base pairs that predicts a mature protein (minus signal peptide 19 residues long) of 61,012 Da. The 3'-nontranslated region has three signals for polyadenylation although only one apparently is used. Edman degradation of purified juvenile hormone lesterase indicates two slightly different proteins (one being 75% of the total) while the three cDNA clones differ at three bases in their 5' region causing their predicted sequence to differ at one or two residues of the 35 amino acids sequenced from the major form. Comparison of the predicted protein sequence to other carboxylesterase sequences indicates extensive similarity in the NH2-terminal half of the protein and the active site serine to be at position 201. The lack of conserved histidine and aspartate residues and the presence of conserved arginine and glutamate residues in appropriate positions in the NH2-terminal half of the homologous serine carboxylesterases suggests a catalytic mechanism for the serine carboxylesterases that is different from that of the serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1525178364,"King et al. (King, K., Benkovic, S. J., and Modrich, P. (1989) 264, 11807-11815) have shown that Glu-111 is required for DNA cleavage by EcoRI endonuclease and have suggested that this residue is required for activation of the cleavage center upon specific recognition. We have substituted Gln or Asp for Glu-111 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. First and second strand cleavage rate constants are reduced by a factor of more than 10(4) by the Gln-111 substitution. However, these rate constants are enhanced 9-fold when pH is increased from 7.6 to 8.5, which enhances strand cleavage at EcoRI sites by wild type endonuclease to a similar degree. The specific affinity of Gln-111 endonuclease for EcoRI sites is 1000 times greater than that of wild type enzyme reflecting a decrease in the rate constant governing specific complex dissociation. In contrast to Gln-111 endonuclease, the equilibrium specific affinity of Asp-111 endonuclease for the EcoRI sequence is similar to that of wild type enzyme, and first and second strand cleavage rate constants are reduced only 100-fold relative to wild type enzyme. These results suggest that a negative charge on residue 111 is required for strand cleavage and are consistent with participation of Glu-111 in activation of the DNA cleavage center, with energy associated with specific sequence recognition driving this process."
https://openalex.org/W1839821620,"Large and small interstitial proteoglycans were purified from different bovine tissues, i.e. cartilage, sclera, tendon, aorta, cornea, and bone. The structure of the molecules was compared using the glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing technique for electron microscopy. Large proteoglycans from sclera and tendon have a core protein with a domain structure similar to that previously reported for cartilage proteoglycans (Paulsson, M., Morgelin, M., Wiedemann, H., Beardmore-Gray, M., Dunham, D., Hardingham, T., Heinegard, D., Timpl, R., and Engel, J. (1987) Biochem. J. 245, 763-772). It is comprised of a pair of globules at one end of the molecule, connected by a short extended segment, followed by a long extended domain which is terminated by a third globular domain. Large aorta proteoglycans show a somewhat different structure, with only one globular domain at each end of a long extended segment. Large sclera and aorta proteoglycans form aggregates with hyaluronate and cartilage link protein in a manner similar to that of large cartilage proteoglycans. The large proteoglycans show considerable tissue variability with regard to number, length, and spacing of glycosaminoglycan side chains. The small proteoglycans reveal a small globular core protein to which one or two glycosaminoglycans are attached. Although the main structural features do not differ, proteoglycans of the S1 class have an average glycosylation close to two glycosaminoglycans/molecule, while that of the S2 class is close to one. Differences in glycosaminoglycan length were observed between tissues and between the S1 and S2 class of proteoglycan derived from a single tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2169498441,"The gene atp6, encoding subunit 6 of the mitochondrial F0-ATPase complex, has been characterized from both the normal (fertile) and Ogura (male-sterile) radish cytoplasms in order to determine if previously identified atp6 transcriptional differences could play a role in cytoplasmic male sterility. Normal radish atp6 encodes a 262-amino acid polypeptide that exhibits approximately 80% sequence identity with other plant atp6 polypeptides. A tRNA(fMet) gene is located 150 base pairs 5' to atp6, and the two genes may be co-transcribed. As a result of extensive rearrangement, sequences that comprise the normal atp6 locus are present in three widely separated regions of the Ogura mitochondrial genome. Both 5' and 3' rearrangement breakpoints have been identified and found to be associated with short repeated sequences. The normal and Ogura atp6 loci share a common 987-base pair region containing most of the atp6 coding region and 106 base pairs of the 3'-flanking region. A 105-codon open reading frame is transcribed as the first gene of an Ogura atp6 bicistronic mRNA. This sequence is not present in normal radish mitochondrial DNA. There are many nucleotide differences in the Ogura atp6 5'-flanking and coding regions that can be expected to eliminate normal translation of atp6. At least two possibilities exist for translation of Ogura atp6, both of which would result in an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence different from that of normal radish."
https://openalex.org/W1490806866,"Abstract We have devised a simple method for achieving 890-fold purification of ceramide glycanase with 17% recovery from a North American leech, Macrobdella decora. The method includes water extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on octyl-Sepharose, Matrex gel blue A, and Bio-Gel A-0.5m columns. The final preparation showed one major protein band at 54 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By using Bio-Gel A-0.5m filtration, the native enzyme was found to have a molecular mass of 330 kDa. With GM1 as substrate, the optimum pH of this enzyme was determined to be 5.0; the enzyme was stable between pH 4.5 and 8.5. Zn2+ at 5 mM and Cu2+, Ag+, and Hg2+ at 1 mM strongly inhibited the hydrolysis of GM1 by ceramide glycanase. The ceramide glycanase released the intact glycan chain from various glycosphingolipids in which the glycan chain is linked to the ceramide through a beta-glucosyl linkage. This enzyme also cleaved lyso-glycosphingolipids such as lyso-GM1 and lyso-LacCer and synthetic alkyl beta-lactosides. Among seven alkyl beta-lactosides tested, the enzyme only hydrolyzed the ones with an alkyl chain length of four or more carbons. The enzyme also hydrolyzed 2-(octadecylthio)ethyl O-beta-lactoside and 2-(2-carbomethoxyethylthio)ethyl O-beta-lactoside. p-Nitrophenyl, benzyl, and phytyl beta-lactosides, on the other hand, were not hydrolyzed. These results suggest that the enzyme can recognize the hydrophobic portion of glycolipid substrates. The fact that 2-(2-carbomethoxyethylthio)ethyl O-beta-N-acetyllactosaminide and DiGalCer were refractory to the enzyme indicated that in the substrate the first sugar attached to the hydrophobic chain cannot be N-acetylglucosamine and galactose. Furthermore, dodecyl maltoside, Gal alpha 1----6Glc beta Cer, and the LacCer in which the --CH2OH of the galactose was converted into --CHO were also resistant to the enzyme, and Man beta 1----4 Glc beta Cer was hydrolyzed at a much slower rate than LacCer. These results indicate that the nature and the linkage of the sugar attached to the glucose have a profound effect on the action of this enzyme. The hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids by ceramide glycanase is stimulated by bile salts. Among various bile salts tested, sodium cholate at a concentration of 1 microgram/microliter was found to be most effective in stimulating the hydrolysis of various glycosphingolipids with the exception of LacCer. For LacCer, sodium taurodeoxycholate at a concentration of 2-3 micrograms/microliters was most effective. Tween 20, Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100 did not stimulate the hydrolysis of GM1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1525484036,"Gap repair in the presence of 2′-deoxycytosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) has been utilized to mutagenize the amino-terminal one-half of the structural gene for EcoRI endonuclease. This approach has led to identification of over 200 mutants defective in endonuclease function. One mutant protein, which binds to the EcoRI sequence but displays greatly reduced cleavage activity, is the consequence of a Glu to Gly change at position 111. This protein has been purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail. Subunit interactions governing the tetramer to dimer transition of the mutant endonuclease are near normal as are parameters governing its interaction with specific and nonspecific DNA sequences. However, the rate constants for first and second strand cleavage steps are reduced by 60,000- and 30,000-fold, respectively, as a consequence of the Glu → Gly change. The defect in chemical cleavage steps can be partially overcome by elevating the pH of the reaction buffer from 7.6 to 8.5, conditions which enhance the rate of EcoRI* strand cleavage by wild type enzyme to a similar degree. We suggest that the Glu-111 mutation affects an interface between recognition and cleavage functions of the enzyme, an idea consistent with the suggestion that the cleavage center of the endonuclease is subject to activation upon specific recognition of the EcoRI sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1557108786,"The thyroid hormone receptor exerts transcriptional control over a variety of genes. This report describes four sites that bind this receptor with high affinity within the 5′-flanking DNA of the rat growth hormone gene, approximately centered at −180, −160, −60 and −20 nucleotides from the transcription start site. These sites were defined by gel retardation of short synthetic oligonucleotides using native receptor purified several hundred-fold from rat liver. Binding sites were also defined by methylation interference and methidium-propyl-EDTA footprinting. Alignment of the four binding sites suggests that each contains two purine-rich regions, the more downstream of which, GGGTACCG, is highly conserved. Mutations made within each of the two upstream sites reduce receptor binding affinity. For one mutation, a partial loss of receptor binding strength correlated with a change in electrophoretic mobility, indicating that receptor binding may alter DNA conformation. Mutations at each of the four sites also reduce thyroid hormone responsiveness of the −237/+11 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene coding sequences and transfected into cultured pituitary (GC) cells. These results suggest that several different receptor-binding elements interact to control thyroid hormone responsiveness of the rat growth hormone gene and reveal common sequences that may be important for receptor-DNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1493038050,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor possesses an agonist binding site on each of the two α-subunits and an allosterically coupled noncompetitive inhibitor (NCI) site. The spatial relationships between these sites have been determined by fluorescence energy transfer employing lifetime and steady-state techniques with two donor-acceptor pairs. 6-(5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)hexanoic acid-β-(N-trimethylammonium)ethyl ester (dansyl-C6-choline, an agonist) and bis(choline)-N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-7-yl)-iminodiproprionate (BCNI, a competitive antagonist) were employed as energy donors bound to the agonist sites. Ethidium was employed as a specific probe of the NCI site and served as the energy acceptor for both donors. Under steady-state conditions, energy transfer was measured by monitoring BCNI fluorescence as a function of occupancy of ethidium. Changes in acceptor occupancy were achieved by titrating acetylcholine receptor-donor-acceptor complexes with phencyclidine, a nonfluorescent NCI ligand. Extrapolation of the data to 100% acceptor occupancy yielded a transfer efficiency of 38% for the BCNI-ethidium pair. In the second method, the transfer efficiency of the dansyl-C6-choline-ethidium pair was determined by analysis of the reduction of the donor-excited state fluorescence lifetime. The nanosecond decay rates for dansyl-C6-choline measured in the presence of phencyclidine are characterized by two lifetimes (τ = 6.7; τ2 = 17.1 ns) with an amplitude ratio, a1/a2 = 2.3. In the presence of ethidium, the two lifetimes were proportionally diminished while retaining a comparable ratio of amplitudes. Displacement of ethidium from the NCI site by phencyclidine restored the two lifetimes to their original values. These data indicate that the donors bound to the two agonist sites transferred energy with similar efficiencies to the acceptor. Thus, the lifetime data suggest that the NCI site is approximately equidistant from each of the agonist sites. The corrected efficiency of donor quenching by this method was 34%, a value in close accord with the steady-state measurements. The distance between the agonist sites and the NCI site was calculated to be between 21–35 A for the BCNI/ethidium pair and 22–40 A for the dansyl-C6-choline/ethidium pair. Consideration of these distances with respect to the molecular dimensions of the receptor and location of the agonist sites suggests a location for the NCI site near the ion channel at the extracellular surface of the membrane bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1499386671,"Abstract As reported previously, homologous plasma lipoproteins specifically bind to the plasma membrane of human blood platelets. The two major lipoprotein-binding membrane glycoproteins were purified to apparent homogeneity and identified by their mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, both in the nonreduced and reduced state, by specific antibodies against glycoproteins IIb (GPIIb) and IIIa (GPIIIa), respectively, including the alloantibody anti-PlA1 and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, lipoprotein binding to intact platelets is also inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by preincubation of the platelets with antibodies against these glycoproteins. From these experiments it can be concluded that lipoproteins bind to both components of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex in isolated membranes and intact platelets. High density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein bind to GPIIIa blotted to nitrocellulose in a way that binding of one species interferes with the binding of the other. Addition of fibrinogen significantly inhibits this binding. The specific binding of fibrinogen to GPIIIa is strongly inhibited in the presence of either of the two lipoproteins. LDL and HDL are specifically bound by isolated GPIIb, too. In our blotting experiments fibrinogen shows no binding to this membrane glycoprotein. On the other hand, fibrinogen significantly interferes with the interaction between GPIIb and the lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2054703591,"The linker histones (H1, H5, H1 degrees) are involved in the condensation of chromatin into the 30-nanometer fiber. This supranucleosome organization correlates with the resting state of chromatin, and it is therefore possible that the linker histones play an active role in the control of chromatin activity. The effect of H5 has been directly determined by expression of an inducible transfected H5 gene in rat sarcoma cells, which do not produce H5. Transfection resulted in the reversible inhibition of DNA replication and arrest of cells in G1, at which time H5 concentrations approached that of terminally differentiated avian erythrocytes. The arrest of proliferation was accompanied by specific changes in gene expression probably related to the cell cycle block. The selectivity of these effects suggest that H5 plays an active role in the control of DNA replication and cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1560465954,"Abstract Exposure of human colon tumor (HT 29 cells) to N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine and analogs produced a rapid loss of intracellular polyamines. This loss was brought about predominantly by an increased excretion of spermidine. N1,N11-Bis(ethyl)norspermine and N1,N12-Bis(ethyl)spermine were potent inducers of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, and this induction facilitated the efflux of polyamines by enhancing the conversion of spermine into spermidine. N1,N14-Bis(ethyl)homospermine, which did not induce spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, also caused the loss of spermidine from the cell but was less effective in bringing about the decline in intracellular spermine. These results indicate that cellular polyamine levels can be regulated by excretion of spermidine and that the bis(ethyl)spermine derivatives deplete intracellular polyamine content by interference with this process."
https://openalex.org/W1563344197,"Abstract Urea and thermal unfolding curves for ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) were determined by measuring several different physical properties. In all cases, steep, single-step unfolding curves were observed. When these results were analyzed by assuming a two-state folding mechanism, the plots of fraction unfolded protein versus denaturant were coincident. The dependence of the free energy of unfolding, delta G (in kcal/mol), on urea concentration is given by delta G = 5.6 - 1.21 (urea). The parameters characterizing the thermodynamics of unfolding are: midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve, Tm = 48.1 degrees C, enthalpy change at Tm, delta Hm = 97 kcal/mol, and heat capacity change, delta Cp = 1650 cal/mol deg. A single kinetic phase was observed for both the folding and unfolding of RNase T1 in the transition and post-transition regions. However, two slow kinetic phases were observed during folding in the pre-transition region. These two slow phases account for about 90% of the observed amplitude, indicating that a faster kinetic phase is also present. The slow phases probably result from cis-trans isomerization at the 2 proline residues that have a cis configuration in folded RNase T1. These results suggest that RNase T1 folds by a highly cooperative mechanism with no structural intermediates once the proline residues have assumed their correct isomeric configuration. At 25 degrees C, the folded conformation is more stable than the unfolded conformations by 5.6 kcal/mol at pH 7 and by 8.9 kcal/mol at pH 5, which is the pH of maximum stability. At pH 7, the thermodynamic data indicate that the maximum conformational stability of 8.3 kcal/mol will occur at -6 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1527325255,"Abnormalities of ganglioside structure characterize the neoplastic state, and aberrant glycosylation has been implicated as underlying many new tumor ganglioside structures. However, variations in ceramide structure can also result in novel tumor gangliosides. To address systematically this aspect of ganglioside metabolism, we have initiated a study of the structures of the ceramide species of an oligosaccharide-homogeneous human tumor-derived ganglioside, GM2. The ganglioside was isolated from neuroblastoma tissue and purified by normal-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Marked ceramide heterogeneity was observed; 18 individual ceramide species of neuroblastoma GM2 were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and collected. Their structures were determined by a combination of negative- and positive-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry of the underivatized gangliosides. The striking finding was the detection of alpha-hydroxylation of a significant fraction of each of the major fatty acid species (16:0, 18:0, 20:0, 22:0, and 24:1); alpha-hydroxylated species quantitatively represented almost one-fifth of the total tumor GM2 species. Fatty acyl hydroxylation was also detected in the ceramide of several other human tumor gangliosides. In contrast, as previously known, fatty acyl hydroxylation was not detected in the normal human brain gangliosides GM3, GM2, and GM1. We propose that aberrant fatty acid alpha-hydroxylation is a novel and sometimes quantitatively significant characteristic of human tumor ganglioside metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1586833407,"Abstract The substrate dependence of the time courses of hydrolysis of both small and large unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) by Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus monomeric phospholipase A2 is consistent with an activation process involving enzyme aggregation on the vesicle surface. The time course of hydrolysis of large unilamellar vesicles is particularly complex; a slow initial rate of hydrolysis is followed by an extremely abrupt increase in enzyme activity. The length of this slow phase is a minimum at the phase transition temperature of the vesicles. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the phospholipase A2 also abruptly increases (50-60%) after a latency period revealing a strong temporal correlation between enzyme activity and the increase in fluorescence intensity. The length of the latency period before the sudden increase in fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to substrate concentration at DPPC concentrations above 20-100 microM. At lower concentrations, the length of the latency period is inversely proportional to the DPPC concentration. Such biphasic substrate dependence is predicted by a previously proposed enzyme activation model involving dimerization on the surface vesicle. Simultaneous monitoring of the protein fluorescence and hydrolysis demonstrates that the magnitude of the fluorescence change and the rate of hydrolysis are in exact temporal correlation. Furthermore, simultaneous monitoring of the fluorescence of the protein and that of a lipid probe, trimethylammonium diphenylhexatriene, indicates a change in lipid vesicle structure prior to, or coincident with, the abrupt change in protein activation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the monomeric phospholipase A2 from A. piscivorus piscivorus initially possesses a low level of intrinsic activity toward large unilamellar DPPC vesicles and that the enzyme slowly becomes further activated on the vesicle surface via dimerization. Eventually, the vesicles undergo an abrupt transition in internal structure leading to sudden rapid activation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1565546071,"Abstract Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) stimulated the production of total protein, collagen, and fibronectin by normal human lung fibroblasts. The stimulatory response was maximal at 100 pM TGF beta and reversed toward control at higher concentrations. Inhibition of fibroblast prostaglandin (PG) synthesis enhanced TGF beta-induced stimulation of total protein, collagen, and fibronectin production and reversed the negative slope of the dose-response curve at high concentrations of TGF beta. Determination of the steady-state levels of Types I and III procollagens and fibronectin mRNAs employing specific cDNA probes demonstrated that inhibition of fibroblast PG production increased the stimulatory effect of TGF beta on the levels of these transcripts. Exogenous PGE2 abrogated the stimulatory effects of TGF beta. These findings suggest that fibroblast stimulation by TGF beta may be down-regulated by endogenous PG synthesized in response to TGF beta. This notion was supported by the demonstration that TGF beta markedly stimulated fibroblast PGE2 production. These results indicate that TGF beta-induced stimulation of fibroblast PGE2 production may be an autoregulatory control mechanism to limit the effects of TGF beta on connective tissue protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1673816403,"Abstract The structural organization of the X-linked gene for the E1 alpha subunit of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has been determined by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequence analysis of overlapping genomic clones. The gene is approximately 17 kilobase pairs long. It contains 11 exons ranging from 61 to 174 base pairs and introns ranging from 600 base pairs to 5.7 kilobase pairs. All the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the GT/AG rule. The transcription initiation site was determined by S1 nuclease mapping. The DNA sequence around this site is very GC-rich. A TATA box-like sequence and a CAAT box-like sequence are present 24 and 113 bases upstream from the cap site, respectively. Also upstream from the cap site are several sets of inverted repeats, direct repeats, several sequences resembling the transcription factor Sp1 binding site, a glucocorticoid-responsive element, and two cAMP receptor binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W54026990,"Abstract A luciferin-binding protein (LBP), which binds and protects from autoxidation the substrate of the circadian bioluminescent reaction of Gonyaulax polyedra, has been purified to near homogeneity. The purified protein is a dimer with two identical 72-kDa subunits, and an isoelectric point of 6.7. LBP is a major component of the cells, comprising about 1% of the total protein during the night phase, but drops to only about 0.1% during the day. The luciferin is protected from autoxidation by binding to LBP, and one luciferin is bound per dimer at alkaline pH (Ka approximately 5 x 10(7) M-1). The protein undergoes a conformational change with release of luciferin at pH values below 7, concurrent with an activation of Gonyaulax luciferase. LBP thus has a dual role in the circadian bioluminescent system."
https://openalex.org/W1498973204,"We have identified a point mutation in one α1(I) collagen allele (COL1A1) of a child with the type IV osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype. When compared to parental and control samples, skin fibroblasts of the proband synthesized two populations of type I collagen molecules. One population was normal; the other was delayed in secretion and electrophoretic migration due to post-translational overmodification. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the CNBr peptides demonstrated a gradient of overmodification beginning near the carboxyl-terminal CB peptides. This predicts that the mutation delaying helix formation is near the carboxyl-terminal end of one of the component chains of type I collagen. The mRNA of the patient was probed with overlapping antisense riboprobes to type I collagen cDNA. Cleavage of a mismatch in RNA/RNA hybrids of RNase A allowed the location of the mutation to a 225-base pair region of α1(I) cDNA. The mismatch was not present in RNA/RNA hybrids from either parent. This region of both α1(I) alleles of the patient was isolated by screening a λZAP cDNA library. Sequence determination of both alleles demonstrated a single nucleotide change, G→A, resulting in the substitution of a serine for a glycine at amino acid residue 832. This point mutation occurs in the coding region for α1(I) CB6 and is concordant with the protein data. The finding of a glycine substitution in an α1(I) chain of a patient with the milder type IV osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype requires modification of current molecular models for types II and IV osteogenesis imperfecta."
https://openalex.org/W1569527052,"Abstract We have found previously (Fahien, L.A., Kmiotek, E.H., MacDonald, M. J., Fibich, B., and Mandic, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 10687-10697) that glutamate-malate oxidation can be enhanced by cooperative binding of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase to the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The present results demonstrate that glutamate dehydrogenase, which forms binary complexes with these enzymes, adds to this ternary complex and thereby increases binding of the other enzymes. Kinetic evidence for direct transfer of alpha-ketoglutarate and NADH, within these complexes, has been obtained by measuring steady-state rates of E2 when most of the substrate or coenzyme is bound to the aminotransferase or glutamate dehydrogenase (E1). Rates significantly greater than those which can be accounted for by the concentration of free ligand, calculated from the measured values of the E1-ligand dissociation constants, require that the E1-ligand complex serve as a substrate for E2 (Srivastava, D. K., and Bernhard, S. A. (1986) Curr. Tops. Cell Regul. 28, 1-68). By this criterion, NADH is transferred directly from glutamate dehydrogenase to malate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate is channeled from the aminotransferase to both glutamate dehydrogenase and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Similar evidence indicates that GTP bound to an allosteric site on glutamate dehydrogenase functions as a substrate for succinic thiokinase. The potential physiological advantages to channeling of activators and inhibitors as well as substrates within multienzyme complexes organized around the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1494518134,"Abstract In the normal and post-ischemic, isovolumic Langendorff perfused rat hearts, 31P NMR spectra and mechanical performance were evaluated over a wide range of myocardial oxygen consumption rates (MVO2). Hearts were perfused with either glucose and insulin, palmitate and glucose, or pyruvate and glucose as exogenous carbon sources. After ischemia at 38 degrees C until the onset of ischemic contracture and subsequent reperfusion, the free ADP levels were significantly reduced as compared to controls. In the control palmitate + glucose and glucose + insulin groups, the ADP levels were virtually independent of approximately 2.5-fold variation in MVO2; in contrast, they changed 4-fold with a approximately 30% variation in MVO2 in the post-ischemic myocardium following ischemia to contracture. In the pyruvate + glucose group, ADP levels varied with MVO2 in controls and post-ischemia; however, MVO2-ADP relationship was significantly altered following ischemia. Analysis of these observations within the concept of kinetic regulation of oxidative phosphorylation yielded the following significant conclusions: 1) the mode of respiratory regulation changed from a non-ADP to an domain with non-pyruvate carbon sources; 2) respiratory regulation was in the ADP:Pi limited domain before and after ischemia in the pyruvate + glucose group; however, the Km for the relationship between MVO2 and ADP was reduced following the ischemia/reperfusion insult; 3) the post-ischemic oxidative capacity (Vmax for MVO2) was significantly reduced in all groups and this reduction would limit maximal post-ischemic mechanical performance."
https://openalex.org/W1582176993,"Abstract A new active site directed photoaffinity probe, which is a model compound for studying nucleotide diphosphate sugar binding proteins, has been synthesized by coupling 5-azido-UTP and [32P]Glc-1-P using yeast UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase to produce [beta-32P]5-azidouridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (5N3UDP-Glc). This probe has photochemical properties similar to that of 5-azidoUTP (Evans, R. K., and Haley, B. E. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 269-276). The efficacy of 5N3UDP-Glc as an active site directed probe was demonstrated using yeast UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase. Saturation effects of photoinsertion were observed with an apparent Kd of 51 microM and the natural substrate, UDP-Glc, prevented photoinsertion of [beta-32P]5N3UDP-Glc with an apparent Kd of 87 microM. Prevention of photoinsertion was also seen with UTP and pyrophosphate with apparent Kd values less than 200 microM. UMP, UDP, ATP, and GTP were much less effective competitors. Selective photoinsertion was observed with several partially purified enzymes including UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, UDP-Gal-4-epimerase, Gal-1-P uridyltransferase, and phosphorylase a. The absence of nonselective photoinsertion into bulk proteins was demonstrated with crude homogenates of rabbit liver as well as with several UDP-Glc binding proteins. Of the six purified enzymes tested, only phosphoglucomutase has been shown to incorporate radiolabel from the photoprobe in the absence of UV irradiation. These results and a discussion of the utility of 5N3UDP-Glc for detecting UDP-Glc binding proteins and isolating active site peptides are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1558122004,"Abstract Protein B23 (38 kDa, pI = 5.1) is an abundant RNA-associated nucleolar phosphoprotein and putative ribosome assembly factor. A full length cDNA clone (lambda JH1) encoding a major expressed form of rat protein B23, now designated B23.1, was reported recently (Chang, J. H., Dumbar, T. S., and Olson, M. O. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12824-12837). In this paper the isolation from a rat brain library and sequence of a cDNA clone (lambda JH2) coding for a second form (B23.2) of protein B23 is reported. Isoforms B23.1 and B23.2 are polypeptides of 292 and 257 amino acids, respectively. The 5'-untranslated regions of the two cDNAs and the amino-terminal 255 amino acids of the proteins are identical in the two isoforms. However, the 3'-untranslated regions of the mRNAs are completely different, and the dipeptide Gly-Gly in B23.1 (residues 256 and 257) is replaced by Ala-His in B23.2 indicating that the former is not a precursor of the latter. The finding of AGGT sequences in the 3' regions of lambda JH1 suggest the presence of intron-exon boundaries at the point where the two cDNAs begin to differ. To investigate the origin of the two isoforms, two rat genomic libraries were screened with oligonucleotide probes based on sequences from the unique regions of the two cDNAs. One of the genomic clones isolated (lambda JH125) contained a 6.5-kilobase fragment encoding the 3' end of both cDNAs. lambda JH125 contains four exons designated W, X, Y, and Z in the order indicated. Exons W and X encode 36 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of B23.2, whereas exons W, Y, and Z encode the carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acid residues of B23.1. Exons X and Z each contain distinct 3'-untranslated sequences in which are found polyadenylation signals. These data suggest that two different mRNAs are formed by alternative splicing of separate 3' segments onto a common 5' region."
https://openalex.org/W1484508453,"Abstract We have examined the effects of ketoconazole, a drug which inhibits enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism, on the suppressive effects of serum lipoproteins and 25-hydroxycholesterol on low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene promoter activity. A LDL receptor promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene construct (pLDLR-CAT 6500) was transfected into JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, and the transfected cells were cultured in the absence or presence of serum, LDL, or serum and 25-hydroxycholesterol. Serum, LDL, and serum + 25-hydroxycholesterol reduced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cells transfected with pLDLR-CAT 6500, whereas these treatments had no effect upon enzyme activity in cells transfected with a control construct (pSV2CAT). Ketoconazole (50 microM) overcame the effects of serum and LDL on suppression of pLDLR-CAT 6500 expression, but could not override the combination of serum + 25-hydroxycholesterol. Ketoconazole had no significant effect on expression of pSV2CAT. The drug inhibited cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme in the cells, but appeared to have no impact on the ability of cells to take up LDL-carried lipids. Our observations are consistent with the idea that serum lipoprotein cholesterol is metabolized to an effector substance which acts to suppress LDL receptor gene transcription. The generation of this effector seems to be sensitive to ketoconazole."
https://openalex.org/W1542633821,"Abstract The respiratory burst oxidase of neutrophils can be activated in a cell-free system in which solubilized membranes, cytosol, and Mg2+ are required and in which sodium dodecyl sulfate is used to convert the dormant oxidase to an active form. The 2',3'-dialdehyde analog of NADPH was used as an affinity label for the cytosolic NADPH binding component of the respiratory burst oxidase from human neutrophils. When treated with this affinity label in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to reduce Schiff bases, neutrophil cytosol was shown to lose at least 90% of its activity in the cell-free system. In contrast to normal cytosol, treated cytosol had lost its ability to abolish the lag time required for activation of the oxidase, suggesting that the treated cytosol was no longer able to participate in the rate-limiting activation step. Furthermore, the treated cytosol had lost its ability to convert the oxidase from a form with a high Km to a form with a low Km for NADPH. The ability of dialdehyde-treated cytosol to activate the oxidase could be restored by untreated cytosol with a concentration dependence suggesting that only one kinetically active component of the oxidase was inhibited by treatment with the NADPH analog. Like the dialdehyde-treated cytosol, cytosols from patients with chronic granulomatous disease caused by a deficiency in a cytosolic Mr = 47,000 protein (pp47) fail to participate in the rate-limiting activation step (Curnutte, J. T., Scott, P. J., and Babior, B. M. (1989) J. Clin. Invest. 83, 1236-1240). These chronic granulomatous disease cytosols were nevertheless able to restore limited activity to the dialdehyde-inactivated cytosol in a cell-free activation system. These results are consistent with a model in which (a) the NADPH binding subunit of the oxidase exists in a very slowly dissociating complex with one or more additional cytosolic components, including pp47, and (b) the NADPH binding component of the oxidase controls the affinity of the enzyme for NADPH, either directly or through the binding of additional cytosolic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1597832222,"Abstract The gene encoding the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD) of Halobacterium cutirubrum was isolated and characterized. The gene and 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions were located on a genomic DNA fragment of 1127 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence is 200 residues long and has 39-42% identity with manganese-containing SODs of eubacteria and mitochondria. This homology may be due to either lateral transfer of the gene between eubacteria and archaebacteria or to high amino acid sequence conservation in the enzyme during the separate evolution of eubacteria and archaebacteria. Transcription of the gene initiates only about three nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. The 5' end of the transcript does not contain a purine-rich Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and the promoter region does not contain consensus sequences found in other archaebacterial promoters. Termination of transcription occurs at 5 consecutive thymine residues that are preceded by a GC-rich region. The gene is basally expressed in anaerobically grown cells but is also inducible by paraquat, a generator of oxygen radicals. The same transcription initiation site is used in both types of expression, suggesting that one promoter is responsible for both basal and regulated expression. In addition to the single copy of the authentic SOD gene, the genome of H. cutirubrum contains a sequence that is very closely related to but does not code for the previously purified SOD of this organism."
https://openalex.org/W1480634185,"Variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy has been used to characterize the magnetic and electronic properties of the Ni(II) tetrapyrrole, F430, which is the cofactor of the S-methyl coenzyme M methylreductase enzyme from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (strain delta H). 4-Coordinate forms are found to be diamagnetic (S = 0 ground state), whereas 6-coordinate forms are paramagnetic (S = 1 ground state). MCD studies, together with parallel low temperature UV-visible absorption and resonance Raman investigations, show that the equilibrium distribution of 4-coordinate square-planar and 6-coordinate bis-aquo forms of the native isomer of F430 in aqueous solution is affected by both temperature and the presence of glycerol. In the presence of 50% glycerol, the 12,13-diepimer of F430 is shown to be partially 6-coordinate in frozen solution at low temperature. Low temperature MCD magnetization data allow the determination of the axial zero-field splitting (D) of the S = 1 ground state of bis-ligand complexes of F430. The value of D is sensitive to the nature of the Ni(II) axial ligands: bis-aquo F430, D = +9 +/- 1 cm-1; bis-imidazole F430, D = -8 +/- 2 cm-1. Measurement of D = +10 +/- 1 cm-1 for F430 in the methylreductase holoenzyme argues strongly against histidine imidazole coordination to Ni(II) in the enzyme. The possible existence of alcoholic or phenolic oxygen-containing ligands (serine, threonine, tyrosine, water) to Ni(II) in the enzyme-bound cofactor is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1545657590,"Abstract An allosteric modulator of oxygen release in human erythrocytes is 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, but bovine erythrocytes apparently utilize chloride for this purpose since they contain little, if any, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. In order to identify the sites to which these anions bind, the site-specific acetylating agent, methyl acetyl phosphate, has been employed to compete with these allosteric modulators and to mimic their effects on hemoglobin function. With human hemoglobin A, methyl acetyl phosphate competes with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and acetylates only Val-1(beta), Lys-82(beta), and Lys-144(beta) within or near the cleft that binds this organic phosphate (Ueno, H., Pospischil, M. A., Manning, J. M., and Kluger, R. (1986) Arch Biochem. Biophys. 244, 795). With bovine hemoglobin, the acetylation is competitive with chloride ion. The sites of acetylation in oxy bovine hemoglobin are Met-1(beta) and Lys-81(beta) and for deoxy bovine hemoglobin, they are Val-1(alpha) and Lys-81(beta). Thus, these sites are expected to be involved in the binding of chloride to bovine hemoglobin. Treatment of either human or bovine hemoglobins with methyl acetyl phosphate under anaerobic conditions leads to a lowering of their oxygen affinity and hence the covalent modifier has the same effect on hemoglobin function as the non-covalent regulators, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and chloride. The Hill's coefficient of hemoglobin is unaffected by treatment with methyl acetyl phosphate. Under aerobic conditions, specifically acetylated bovine hemoglobin also has a lowered oxygen affinity, and human hemoglobin A shows a slight change in its oxygen affinity. In general, bovine hemoglobin is more responsive than human hemoglobin to both chloride and methyl acetyl phosphate; the latter agent results in a permanent covalent labeling of the protein. Therefore, the results support the idea that methyl acetyl phosphate may be a useful probe for deciphering the sites of binding of anions to proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1573828630,"We examined the effect of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine-specific reagent, on the H+/organic cation antiport system in brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from the rat renal cortex. Pretreatment of membrane vesicles with DEPC resulted in the inhibition of tetraethylammonium transport. This inhibition was reversed by subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine, but not with dithiotreitol. In contrast, the uptake of p-aminohippurate, a typical organic anion, was not inhibited by DEPC pretreatment. In the absence of an H+ gradient, pretreatment with DEPC inhibited the uptake of tetraethylammonium at pH 6.0-7.0, but not at pH 7.5. The Vmax value of tetraethylammonium uptake at pH 7.0 was decreased without any change in the Km value, but the kinetic parameters at pH 7.5 were unchanged. Unlabeled tetraethylamonium did not protect against the inhibition by DEPC. These results suggest that histidine residues in the organic cation carrier are essential for transport at acidic and neutral pH values, but not at alkaline pH values, and that histidine residues play an important role as regulatory sites in the H+/organic cation antiport system rather than as binding sites for organic cations."

The extent of aggregation was shown to depend substantially on pH as well as on salt. In the absence of salt and in all of the salt conditions tested as the pH was increased, less and less chromatin was aggregated. The aggregation of half the chromatin in the presence of 0 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2 was observed at pH 5.4, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.3, respectively. In 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, chromatin aggregation decreased from 86 to 63% as the pH was changed from 5.9 to 6.8, which is the same pH change reported to occur between interphase and mitosis. H1 dissociation from chromatin was also found to be pH dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1547629349,"Abstract The presence of covalently bound palmitic acid in fibrinogen receptors, glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa, has been explored in human blood platelets. Membrane fractions were isolated from fresh blood platelets labeled with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid and then analyzed for radioactive proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, excised, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The results indicate that membrane proteins with electrophoretic mobility corresponding to glycoproteins IIb and IIIa incorporate [9,10-3H]palmitic acid. The palmitylated glycoproteins IIb and IIIa were immunoprecipitated by specific anti-GP IIb and GP IIIa antisera. It is interesting to note that the palmitylation of these glycoproteins occurred rapidly in platelets activated with 0.5 unit of thrombin or 30 microM ADP. At the concentration used (100 micrograms/ml), cycloheximide did not inhibit incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the glycoproteins showing that this process is not dependent upon protein synthesis. The acyl moiety was resistant to denaturating detergents, delipidation with organic solvents, and hydrolyzable with hydroxylamine. In the case of membrane protein with the electrophoretic mobility of GP IIb, the radioactive label was significantly decreased after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. Final identification of GP IIIa as an acylated product in human platelets incubated with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid was provided by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast to GP IIb alpha, GP IIIa isolated by this method showed the presence of attached radioactive palmitic acid residues. Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography after methanolysis of the [3H]palmitate-labeled glycoproteins confirmed the fatty acid nature of the label. Palmitylation is a newly identified post-translational modification of the fibrinogen receptor which may play an important role in its interaction with the membrane and/or its biological function."

https://openalex.org/W1536751808,"Abstract The nucleotide affinity label 2-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)adenosine 5'-diphosphate (2-BDB-TADP) reacts covalently with pig heart NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase with a limiting value of 75% inactivation and loss of ADP activation concomitant with incorporation of about 1 mol of reagent/mol of average enzyme subunit (Huang, Y.-C., Bailey, J. M., and Colman, R. F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 14100-14107). Complete protection against the functional changes is provided by ADP + Mn2+, and reagent incorporation is decreased to about 0.5 mol/mol of average enzyme subunit. We have now identified the critical modified peptide by comparison of the peptides labeled by 2-BDB-TADP at pH 6.8 in the absence and presence of ADP + Mn2+. After removal of excess reagent, modified enzyme was treated with [3H]NaBH4 to reduce the keto groups of the reagent and introduce a radioactive tracer into the reagent which is covalently linked to the protein. Following carboxymethylation and digestion with trypsin, the specific modified peptide was isolated using two successive high performance liquid chromatography steps: 1) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with an acetonitrile gradient; and 2) 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.8, with an acetonitrile gradient. Gas phase sequencing gave the modified peptide Leu-Gly-Asp-Gly-Leu-Phe-Leu-Gln in which aspartic acid is the target of 2-BDB-TADP. Isolation of the corresponding tryptic peptide from unmodified enzyme yielded the sequence Leu-Gly-Asp-Gly-Leu-Phe-Leu-Gln-CmCys-CmCys-Lys. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is composed of three distinct subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), separable by chromatofocusing in urea and identified by analytical gel isoelectric focusing. The evidence indicates that the specific peptide labeled by 2-BDB-TADP, which is at or near the ADP site, can be derived from the gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2151677704,"The renal adaptive response to a varied intake of sulfur amino acids is demonstrated by an increase in the initial rate of Na+-taurine symport (cotransport) by rat renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) after 8-14 days of a low methionine diet. A high (3%) taurine diet reduces Na+-taurine symport. Fasting for 3 days, which depletes renal tubule cell taurine content, also enhances Na+-taurine symport both initially (15 s) and throughout the overshoot. In this study we examine the possibility that a rapid-onset adaptive response is expressed in BBMV, with the increased Na+-taurine symport reflecting the incorporation of preformed symporter into membranes rather than new synthesis. Rats fed the low methionine diet for 14 days were placed on the high taurine diet for 12-18 h; Na+-taurine symport activity fell by 40%. Fasting for 4 h restored low methionine diet levels of Na+-taurine symport activity (92 pmol.mg protein-1.15 s-1), defining a rapidly induced rise in uptake. Colchicine (0.6 mg) was injected prior to fasting in a group of rats because it blocks the incorporation (import) of preformed symporter into the membrane. Animals injected with colchicine had a pattern of BBMV uptake similar to that found in animals switched to the high taurine diet for 18 h. This agent blocked the rapidly induced rise in uptake. Feeding with the high taurine diet for 4 h caused a fall in uptake of 16.5%; colchicine blocked this reduction in uptake. These results indicate that the nephron can respond rapidly to changes in the intake of amino acids, conserving taurine in periods of nutrient lack and excreting excess taurine within 4 h in periods of surfeit. This rapid response is expressed at the brush border surface. The use of cholchicine indicates that the increase or reduction in Na+-taurine symport activity is due to incorporation (import) of transporter into the BBMV rather than to de novo synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1493621289,"In a previous paper, we reported a ligand-induced modulation of the asialoglycoprotein receptors on HepG2 cells whereby these receptors were rendered functionally inert while remaining immunologically intact on the plasma membrane. At that time, it was speculated that the loss in receptor-binding ability was a direct result of a concomitant decrease in cell surface sialic acid residues. Experiments designed to test that hypothesis are presented. The results revealed: 1) an identical response in binding activity and sialic acid content in cells subjected to minimal exposure to neuraminidase; 2) a parallel and synchronous recovery of both parameters following modulation; 3) an invariant binding of high affinity ligands, and 4) the ability of galactose oxidase to restore, at least partially, the cell's ability to bind asialoglycoprotein. These results indicate that ligand-induced surface hyposialylation directly diminishes expression of the asialoglycoprotein receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1511824811,"Abstract An enzyme hydrolyzing proline-beta-naphthylamide was purified to apparent homogeneity from porcine intestinal mucosa. The purified enzyme appears to consist of three identical subunit polypeptides with a molecular weight of about 58,000 each, associated noncovalently. The enzyme is a glycoprotein, and the subunit polypeptide contains 3 residues each of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. A wide variety of peptidase substrates were tested for the enzyme, and the results showed that it hydrolyzes only aminopeptidase substrates, such as proline-beta-naphthylamide, glycine-beta-naphthylamide, leucine-beta-naphthylamide, and alanine-beta-naphthylamide. Among these substrates, proline-beta-naphthylamide is most efficiently hydrolyzed as judged by the kcat/Km value. The optimum pH for this substrate is around 9. The enzyme also hydrolyzes efficiently the ester substrates of these amino acids. No hydrolytic activity was observed for the peptide and protein substrates tested. The proline-beta-naphthylamidase activity was drastically inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, indicating that the enzyme is a serine hydrolase, whereas it was slightly inhibited by aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as amastatin, bestatin, and puromycin. No significant homology was found for the NH2-terminal sequence of 27 amino acid residues with any known protein sequences. From these results we conclude that the enzyme is a protein which has not been described before."
https://openalex.org/W1525446968,"Abstract We have previously reported the isolation of variants of the C2 mouse muscle cell line that express reduced amounts of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on their surface (Black, R. A., and Hall, Z. W. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 124-128). One of the variants, T-, makes an approximately normal amount of the AChR but accumulates most of it in an intracellular pool. This pool is stable and does not serve as precursor for surface AChR. Surface levels of insulin receptor and transferrin receptor are normal in T- cells, and a normal proportion of total hemagglutinin is expressed on the surface after infection of the T- variant with influenza virus. Pulse-chase experiments and kinetic analysis show: 1) that T- cells synthesize a normal amount of the alpha subunit but degrade it much more slowly than do wild-type cells; and 2) that newly synthesized alpha subunit is assembled into the AChR at a normal rate. A small fraction of the assembled AChR in T- cells is transported to the surface with normal kinetics, but most of it remains in an internal pool. This variant may provide an important tool for investigation of the factors that regulate AChR assembly and transport to the surface membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1583246716,"Abstract The metabolism of N-substituted aromatic compounds, i.e. aniline, acetanilide, N-hydroxyacetanilide, nitrosobenzene, and nitrobenzene in mammalian spermatozoa was investigated. In boar spermatozoa fortified with glucose, no acetylation, deacetylation, and monooxygenation of these compounds were found. Nitrobenzene was reduced slowly, but nitrosobenzene was a good substrate for this reductive activity. In the latter reaction, the products were N-hydroxyacetanilide, azoxybenzene, and an organic phase-nonextractable metabolite(s). Pyruvate was found to be involved in the formation of N-hydroxyacetanilide from nitrosobenzene, and the reaction occurred through a ping-pong mechanism. This enzymatic activity, located in the mid-piece fraction of spermatozoa, was enhanced by thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ and inhibited by thiamine thiazolone pyrophosphate. N-Hydroxyacetanilide formed from [3(-13)C]pyruvate showed complete retention of the isotope at the methyl carbon of the molecule. 2-Nitrosofluorene and 4-nitrosobiphenyl were also transformed into the corresponding N-hydroxy-N-arylacetamides. N-Hydroxyacetanilide was also formed in rat and human spermatozoa. These facts suggest that the formation of N-hydroxy-N-arylacetamides from the nitroso aromatic compounds and pyruvate is mediated by a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex located in the mitochondria of spermatozoa. The formation of both azoxybenzene and the organic phase-nonextractable metabolite(s) was found to be a pyruvate-independent nonenzymatic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1569226566,"Abstract The effects of monovalent ions on endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase activity in purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were investigated. Activity of PDH kinase was stimulated 1.9-, 1.95-, 1.65-, and 1.4-fold by 10 mM K+, Rb+, NH+4, and Cs+, respectively, whereas Na+ and Li+ had no effect on PDH kinase activity. The crystal radii of stimulatory ions were in the range of 1.33 to 1.69 A while the crystal radii of nonstimulatory ions were in the range of 0.6 to 0.94 A. Stimulation of PDH kinase by monovalent ions was not pH dependent. Protein dilution studies showed that monovalent ion stimulation was measurable within 10 s after protein addition to PDH kinase assays. Furthermore, stimulation occurred at all protein concentrations tested. At ATP concentrations from 12.5 to 25 microM, K+ and NH+4 stimulation was constant from 0 to 110 and 0 to 30 mM, respectively. At higher ATP concentrations, from 50 to 500 microM, K+ and NH+4 stimulation peaked at approximately 30 and 3 mM, respectively, and thereafter declined as the ion concentration increased. Maximal PDH kinase stimulation by K+ or NH+4 also declined as Na+ was increased from 0 to 120 mM, but at a fixed salt concentration of 120 mM, both K+ and NH+4 stimulated PDH kinase activity. Phosphopeptide analysis demonstrated that K+ and NH+4 stimulated phosphorylation at sites 1 and 2, but that site 3 phosphorylation was relatively constant under all conditions. Thiamin pyrophosphate and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) blocked monovalent ion stimulation half-maximally at 4 and 6 microM, respectively. However, neither thiamin pyrophosphate nor 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) significantly inhibited PDH kinase activity in the absence of monovalent ions. The results indicate that heart PDH kinase stimulation by monovalent ions does not occur by changing the binding equilibrium between PDH and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core. Instead, monovalent ions bind and exert their regulatory effects at or near the active site of PDH kinase."
