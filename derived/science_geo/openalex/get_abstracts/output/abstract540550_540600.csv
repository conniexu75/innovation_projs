These are not completely normalized with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Moreover, increate morbidity and mortality of cART-treated HIV-infected individuals is associated with inflammation. Methods In order to enhance GI tract immunity, we recruited and treated 20 HIV-infected humans with cART supplemented with probiotics and followed inflammation and immunological parameters (clinical trial number NCT02164344). 11 HIV seronegative subjects were included as control group. The enumeration of CD4+, CD8+, CD38+ and HLA-DR+ lymphocytes were evaluated on peripheral blood; HIV-RNA levels, sCD14, d-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL-6 and Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP) were assayed on plasma. Results We observe that cART does not normalize the levels of immune activation in HIV positive patients anyway inflammation and markers of microbial translocation were significantly reduced with probiotic supplementation. Patients show a clear and statistically significant reduction in the levels of immune activation on CD4 T-lymphocytes, for both markers CD38 and HLA-DR and their simultaneous expression, LBP and hsCRP plasma levels after probiotic diet supplementation settling to values comparable to controls. Conclusions Supplementing cART with probiotics in HIV-infected individuals may improve GI tract immunity and there by mitigate inflammatory sequelae, ultimately improving prognosis.

https://openalex.org/W2252527437,"The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-dependent proton pump composed of a peripheral ATPase domain (V1) and a membrane-integral proton-translocating domain (V0) and is involved in many normal and disease processes. An important mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity is reversible assembly of the V1 and V0 domains. Increased assembly in mammalian cells occurs under various conditions and has been shown to involve PI3K. The V-ATPase is necessary for amino acid-induced activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is important in controlling cell growth in response to nutrient availability and growth signals. The V-ATPase undergoes amino acid-dependent interactions with the Ragulator complex, which is involved in recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane during amino acid sensing. We hypothesized that changes in the V-ATPase/Ragulator interaction might involve amino acid-dependent changes in V-ATPase assembly. To test this, we measured V-ATPase assembly by cell fractionation in HEK293T cells treated with and without amino acids. V-ATPase assembly increases upon amino acid starvation, and this effect is reversed upon readdition of amino acids. Lysosomes from amino acid-starved cells possess greater V-ATPase-dependent proton transport, indicating that assembled pumps are catalytically active. Amino acid-dependent changes in both V-ATPase assembly and activity are independent of PI3K and mTORC1 activity, indicating the involvement of signaling pathways distinct from those implicated previously in controlling assembly. By contrast, lysosomal neutralization blocks the amino acid-dependent change in assembly and reactivation of mTORC1 after amino acid starvation. These results identify an important new stimulus for controlling V-ATPase assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2223093350,"Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) causes significant economic loss in salmonid aquaculture. Using microsatellite markers in a genome scan, we previously detected significant and suggestive QTL affecting phenotypic variation in survival following challenge with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of BCWD in rainbow trout. In this study, we performed selective genotyping of SNPs from restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequence data from two pedigreed families (2009070 and 2009196) to validate the major QTL from the previous work and to detect new QTL. The use of RAD SNPs in the genome scans increased the number of mapped markers from ~300 to ~5,000 per family. The significant QTL detected in the microsatellites scan on chromosome Omy8 in family 2009070 was validated explaining up to 58% of the phenotypic variance in that family, and in addition, a second QTL was also detected on Omy8. Two novel QTL on Omy11 and 14 were also detected, and the previously suggestive QTL on Omy1, 7 and 25 were also validated in family 2009070. In family 2009196, the microsatellite significant QTL on Omy6 and 12 were validated and a new QTL on Omy8 was detected, but none of the previously detected suggestive QTL were validated. The two Omy8 QTL from family 2009070 and the Omy12 QTL from family 2009196 were found to be co-localized with handling and confinement stress response QTL that our group has previously identified in a separate pedigreed family. With the currently available data we cannot determine if the co-localized QTL are the result of genes with pleiotropic effects or a mere physical proximity on the same chromosome segment. The genetic markers linked to BCWD resistance QTL were used to query the scaffolds of the rainbow trout reference genome assembly and the QTL-positive scaffold sequences were found to include 100 positional candidate genes. Several of the candidate genes located on or near the two Omy8 QTL detected in family 2009070 suggest potential linkages between stress response and the regulation of immune response in rainbow trout."
https://openalex.org/W2254061197,"As revealed in a previous microarray study to identify genes regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, E93 expression in the fat body was markedly low prior to the wandering stage but abundant during larval-pupal metamorphosis. Induced by 20E and suppressed by JH, E93 expression follows this developmental profile in multiple silkworm alleles. The reduction of E93 expression by RNAi disrupted 20E signaling and the 20E-induced autophagy, caspase activity, and cell dissociation in the fat body. Reducing E93 expression also decreased the expression of the 20E-induced pupal-specific cuticle protein genes and prevented growth and differentiation of the wing discs. Importantly, the two HTH domains in E93 are critical for inducing the expression of a subset of 20E response genes, including EcR, USP, E74, Br-C, and Atg1. By contrast, the LLQHLL and PLDLSAK motifs in E93 inhibit its transcriptional activity. E93 binds to the EcR-USP complex via a physical association with USP through its LLQHLL motif; and this association is enhanced by 20E-induced EcR-USP interaction, which attenuates the transcriptional activity of E93. E93 acts through the two HTH domains to bind to GAGA-containing motifs present in the Atg1 promoter region for inducing gene expression. In conclusion, E93 transcriptionally modulates 20E signaling to promote Bombyx larval-pupal metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2108549689,"Family dogs and dog owners offer a potentially powerful way to conduct citizen science to answer questions about animal behavior that are difficult to answer with more conventional approaches. Here we evaluate the quality of the first data on dog cognition collected by citizen scientists using the Dognition.com website. We conducted analyses to understand if data generated by over 500 citizen scientists replicates internally and in comparison to previously published findings. Half of participants participated for free while the other half paid for access. The website provided each participant a temperament questionnaire and instructions on how to conduct a series of ten cognitive tests. Participation required internet access, a dog and some common household items. Participants could record their responses on any PC, tablet or smartphone from anywhere in the world and data were retained on servers. Results from citizen scientists and their dogs replicated a number of previously described phenomena from conventional lab-based research. There was little evidence that citizen scientists manipulated their results. To illustrate the potential uses of relatively large samples of citizen science data, we then used factor analysis to examine individual differences across the cognitive tasks. The data were best explained by multiple factors in support of the hypothesis that nonhumans, including dogs, can evolve multiple cognitive domains that vary independently. This analysis suggests that in the future, citizen scientists will generate useful datasets that test hypotheses and answer questions as a complement to conventional laboratory techniques used to study dog psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2342200792,"Analysis of pollen grains reveals valuable information on biology, ecology, forensics, climate change, insect migration, food sources and aeroallergens. Vibrational (infrared and Raman) spectroscopies offer chemical characterization of pollen via identifiable spectral features without any sample pretreatment. We have compared the level of chemical information that can be obtained by different multiscale vibrational spectroscopic techniques.Pollen from 15 different species of Pinales (conifers) were measured by seven infrared and Raman methodologies. In order to obtain infrared spectra, both reflectance and transmission measurements were performed on ground and intact pollen grains (bulk measurements), in addition, infrared spectra were obtained by microspectroscopy of multigrain and single pollen grain measurements. For Raman microspectroscopy measurements, spectra were obtained from the same pollen grains by focusing two different substructures of pollen grain. The spectral data from the seven methodologies were integrated into one data model by the Consensus Principal Component Analysis, in order to obtain the relations between the molecular signatures traced by different techniques.The vibrational spectroscopy enabled biochemical characterization of pollen and detection of phylogenetic variation. The spectral differences were clearly connected to specific chemical constituents, such as lipids, carbohydrates, carotenoids and sporopollenins. The extensive differences between pollen of Cedrus and the rest of Pinaceae family were unambiguously connected with molecular composition of sporopollenins in pollen grain wall, while pollen of Picea has apparently higher concentration of carotenoids than the rest of the family. It is shown that vibrational methodologies have great potential for systematic collection of data on ecosystems and that the obtained phylogenetic variation can be well explained by the biochemical composition of pollen. Out of the seven tested methodologies, the best taxonomical differentiation of pollen was obtained by infrared measurements on bulk samples, as well as by Raman microspectroscopy measurements of the corpus region of the pollen grain. Raman microspectroscopy measurements indicate that measurement area, as well as the depth of focus, can have crucial influence on the obtained data."
https://openalex.org/W2209065521,"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most frequent cause of cardioembolic stroke, is increasing in prevalence as the population ages, and presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms and severity. The early identification of AF is an essential part for preventing the possibility of blood clotting and stroke. In this work, a real-time algorithm is proposed for accurately screening AF episodes in electrocardiograms. This method adopts heart rate sequence, and it involves the application of symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy. Using novel recursive algorithms, a low-computational complexity can be obtained. Four publicly-accessible sets of clinical data (Long-Term AF, MIT-BIH AF, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Databases) were used for assessment. The first database was selected as a training set; the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed, and the best performance was achieved at the threshold of 0.639: the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and overall accuracy (ACC) were 96.14%, 95.73%, 97.03% and 95.97%, respectively. The other three databases were used for independent testing. Using the obtained decision-making threshold (i.e., 0.639), for the second set, the obtained parameters were 97.37%, 98.44%, 97.89% and 97.99%, respectively; for the third database, these parameters were 97.83%, 87.41%, 47.67% and 88.51%, respectively; the Sp was 99.68% for the fourth set. The latest methods were also employed for comparison. Collectively, results presented in this study indicate that the combination of symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy yields a potent AF detector, and suggest this method could be of practical use in both clinical and out-of-clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2244323017,"Many migrating birds undertake extraordinary long flights. How birds are able to perform such endurance flights of over 100-hour durations is still poorly understood. We examined energy expenditure and physiological changes in Northern Bald Ibis Geronticus eremite during natural flights using birds trained to follow an ultra-light aircraft. Because these birds were tame, with foster parents, we were able to bleed them immediately prior to and after each flight. Flight duration was experimentally designed ranging between one and almost four hours continuous flights. Energy expenditure during flight was estimated using doubly-labelled-water while physiological properties were assessed through blood chemistry including plasma metabolites, enzymes, electrolytes, blood gases, and reactive oxygen compounds. Instantaneous energy expenditure decreased with flight duration, and the birds appeared to balance aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, using fat, carbohydrate and protein as fuel. This made flight both economic and tolerable. The observed effects resemble classical exercise adaptations that can limit duration of exercise while reducing energetic output. There were also in-flight benefits that enable power output variation from cruising to manoeuvring. These adaptations share characteristics with physiological processes that have facilitated other athletic feats in nature and might enable the extraordinary long flights of migratory birds as well."
https://openalex.org/W2168539009,"Our functional genomic RNAi screens have identified the protein components of the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, SUPT16H and SSRP1, as top host factors that negatively regulate HIV-1 replication. FACT interacts specifically with histones H2A/H2B to affect assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes, as well as transcription elongation. We further investigated the suppressive role of FACT proteins in HIV-1 transcription. First, depletion of SUPT16H or SSRP1 protein enhances Tat-mediated HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) promoter activity. Second, HIV-1 Tat interacts with SUPT16H but not SSRP1 protein. However, both SUPT16H and SSRP1 are recruited to LTR promoter. Third, the presence of SUPT16H interferes with the association of Cyclin T1 (CCNT1), a subunit of P-TEFb, with the Tat-LTR axis. Removing inhibitory mechanisms to permit HIV-1 transcription is an initial and key regulatory step to reverse post-integrated latent HIV-1 proviruses for purging of reservoir cells. We therefore evaluated the role of FACT proteins in HIV-1 latency and reactivation. Depletion of SUPT16H or SSRP1 protein affects both HIV-1 transcriptional initiation and elongation and spontaneously reverses latent HIV-1 in U1/HIV and J-LAT cells. Similar effects were observed with a primary CD4+ T cell model of HIV-1 latency. FACT proteins also interfere with HTLV-1 Tax-LTR-mediated transcription and viral latency, indicating that they may act as general transcriptional suppressors for retroviruses. We conclude that FACT proteins SUPT16H and SSRP1 play a key role in suppressing HIV-1 transcription and promoting viral latency, which may serve as promising gene targets for developing novel HIV-1 latency-reversing agents.

https://openalex.org/W1881036256,"Low nitrogen availability in the high Arctic represents a major constraint for plant growth, which limits the tundra capacity for carbon retention and determines tundra vegetation types. The limited terrestrial nitrogen (N) pool in the tundra is augmented significantly by nesting seabirds, such as the planktivorous Little Auk (Alle alle). Therefore, N delivered by these birds may significantly influence the N cycling in the tundra locally and the carbon budget more globally. Moreover, should these birds experience substantial negative environmental pressure associated with climate change, this will adversely influence the tundra N-budget. Hence, assessment of bird-originated N-input to the tundra is important for understanding biological cycles in polar regions. This study analyzed the stable nitrogen composition of the three main N-sources in the High Arctic and in numerous plants that access different N-pools in ten tundra vegetation types in an experimental catchment in Hornsund (Svalbard). The percentage of the total tundra N-pool provided by birds, ranged from 0–21% in Patterned-ground tundra to 100% in Ornithocoprophilous tundra. The total N-pool utilized by tundra plants in the studied catchment was built in 36% by birds, 38% by atmospheric deposition, and 26% by atmospheric N2-fixation. The stable nitrogen isotope mixing mass balance, in contrast to direct methods that measure actual deposition, indicates the ratio between the actual N-loads acquired by plants from different N-sources. Our results enhance our understanding of the importance of different N-sources in the Arctic tundra and the used methodological approach can be applied elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2204137670,"The pink or red ketocarotenoids, canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, are used as feed additives in the poultry and aquaculture industries as a source of egg yolk and flesh pigmentation, as farmed animals do not have access to the carotenoid sources of their wild counterparts. Because soybean is already an important component in animal feed, production of these carotenoids in soybean could be a cost-effective means of delivery. In order to characterize the ability of soybean seed to produce carotenoids, soybean cv. Jack was transformed with the crtB gene from Pantoea ananatis, which codes for phytoene synthase, an enzyme which catalyzes the first committed step in the carotenoid pathway. The crtB gene was engineered together in combinations with ketolase genes (crtW from Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 and bkt1 from Haematococcus pluvialis) to produce ketocarotenoids; all genes were placed under the control of seed-specific promoters. HPLC results showed that canthaxanthin is present in the transgenic seeds at levels up to 52 μg/g dry weight. Transgenic seeds also accumulated other compounds in the carotenoid pathway, such as astaxanthin, lutein, β-carotene, phytoene, α-carotene, lycopene, and β-cryptoxanthin, whereas lutein was the only one of these detected in non-transgenic seeds. The accumulation of astaxanthin, which requires a β-carotene hydroxylase in addition to a β-carotene ketolase, in the transgenic seeds suggests that an endogenous soybean enzyme is able to work in combination with the ketolase transgene. Soybean seeds that accumulate ketocarotenoids could potentially be used in animal feed to reduce or eliminate the need for the costly addition of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2200269720,"Certain missense mutations in optineurin/OPTN and amplification of TBK1 are associated with normal tension glaucoma. A glaucoma-associated variant of OPTN, M98K, induces autophagic degradation of transferrin receptor (TFRC) and death in retinal cells. Here, we have explored the role of Tbk1 in M98K-OPTN-induced autophagy and cell death, and the effect of Tbk1 overexpression in retinal cells. Cell death induced by M98K-OPTN was dependent on Tbk1 as seen by the effect of Tbk1 knockdown and blocking of Tbk1 activity by a chemical inhibitor. Inhibition of Tbk1 also restores M98K-OPTN-induced transferrin receptor degradation. M98K-OPTN-induced autophagosome formation, autophagy and cell death were dependent on its phosphorylation at S177 by Tbk1. Knockdown of OPTN reduced starvation-induced autophagosome formation. M98K-OPTN expressing cells showed higher levels of Tbk1 activation and enhanced phosphorylation at Ser177 compared to WT-OPTN expressing cells. M98K-OPTN-induced activation of Tbk1 and its ability to be phosphorylated better by Tbk1 was dependent on ubiquitin binding. Phosphorylated M98K-OPTN localized specifically to autophagosomes and endogenous Tbk1 showed increased localization to autophagosomes in M98K-OPTN expressing cells. Overexpression of Tbk1 induced cell death and caspase-3 activation that were dependent on its catalytic activity. Tbk1-induced cell death possibly involves autophagy, as shown by the effect of Atg5 knockdown, and requirement of autophagic function of OPTN. Our results show that phosphorylation of Ser177 plays a crucial role in M98K-OPTN-induced autophagosome formation, autophagy flux and retinal cell death. In addition, we provide evidence for cross talk between two glaucoma associated proteins and their inter-dependence to mediate autophagy-dependent cell death."

Molecular mechanisms of these activities and cellular targets have not been clarified to-date. We demonstrate that the embelin inhibits mortalin-p53 interactions, and activates p53 protein in tumor cells. We provide bioinformatics, molecular docking and experimental evidence to the binding affinity of embelin with mortalin and p53. Binding of embelin with mortalin/p53 abrogates their complex resulted in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation function of p53 causing growth arrest in cancer cells. Furthermore, analyses of growth factors and metastatic signaling using antibody membrane array revealed their downregulation in embelin-treated cells. We also found that the embelin causes transcriptional attenuation of mortalin and several other proteins involved in metastatic signaling in cancer cells. Based on these molecular dynamics and experimental data, it is concluded that the anticancer activity of embelin involves targeting of mortalin, activation of p53 and inactivation of metastatic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2213046359,"The optic radiation (OR) is one of the major components of the visual system and a key structure at risk in white matter diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is challenging to perform track reconstruction of the OR using diffusion MRI due to a sharp change of direction in the Meyer’s loop and the presence of kissing and crossing fibers along the pathway. As such, we aimed to provide a highly precise and reproducible framework for tracking the OR from thalamic and visual cortex masks. The framework combined the generation of probabilistic streamlines by high order fiber orientation distributions estimated with constrained spherical deconvolution and an automatic post-processing based on anatomical exclusion criteria (AEC) to compensate for the presence of anatomically implausible streamlines. Specifically, those ending in the contralateral hemisphere, cerebrospinal fluid or grey matter outside the visual cortex were automatically excluded. We applied the framework to two distinct high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) acquisition protocols on one cohort, comprised of ten healthy volunteers and five MS patients. The OR was successfully delineated in both HARDI acquisitions in the healthy volunteers and MS patients. Quantitative evaluation of the OR position was done by comparing the results with histological reference data. Compared with histological mask, the OR reconstruction into a template (OR-TCT) was highly precise (percentage of voxels within the OR-TCT correctly defined as OR), ranging from 0.71 to 0.83. The sensitivity (percentage of voxels in histological reference mask correctly defined as OR in OR-TCT) ranged from 0.65 to 0.81 and the accuracy (measured by F1 score) was 0.73 to 0.77 in healthy volunteers. When AEC was not applied the precision and accuracy decreased. The absolute agreement between both HARDI datasets measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.73. This improved framework allowed us to reconstruct the OR with high reliability and accuracy independently of the acquisition parameters. Moreover, the reconstruction was possible even in the presence of tissue damage due to MS. This framework could also be applied to other tracts with complex configuration."

https://openalex.org/W2200053018,"Background and Aim Harmful alcohol consumption has long been recognized as being the major determinant of male premature mortality in the European countries of the former USSR. Our focus here is on Belarus and Russia, two Slavic countries which continue to suffer enormously from the burden of the harmful consumption of alcohol. However, after a long period of deterioration, mortality trends in these countries have been improving over the past decade. We aim to investigate to what extent the recent declines in adult mortality in Belarus and Russia are attributable to the anti-alcohol measures introduced in these two countries in the 2000s. Data and Methods We rely on the detailed cause-specific mortality series for the period 1980–2013. Our analysis focuses on the male population, and considers only a limited number of causes of death which we label as being alcohol-related: accidental poisoning by alcohol, liver cirrhosis, ischemic heart diseases, stroke, transportation accidents, and other external causes. For each of these causes we computed age-standardized death rates. The life table decomposition method was used to determine the age groups and the causes of death responsible for changes in life expectancy over time. Conclusion Our results do not lead us to conclude that the schedule of anti-alcohol measures corresponds to the schedule of mortality changes. The continuous reduction in adult male mortality seen in Belarus and Russia cannot be fully explained by the anti-alcohol policies implemented in these countries, although these policies likely contributed to the large mortality reductions observed in Belarus and Russia in 2005–2006 and in Belarus in 2012. Thus, the effects of these policies appear to have been modest. We argue that the anti-alcohol measures implemented in Belarus and Russia simply coincided with fluctuations in alcohol-related mortality which originated in the past. If these trends had not been underway already, these huge mortality effects would not have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W2172480288,"Few studies have investigated the control of grip force when manipulating an object with an extremely small mass using a precision grip, although some related information has been provided by studies conducted in an unusual microgravity environment. Grip-load force coordination was examined while healthy adults (N = 17) held a moveable instrumented apparatus with its mass changed between 6 g and 200 g in 14 steps, with its grip surface set as either sandpaper or rayon. Additional measurements of grip-force-dependent finger-surface contact area and finger skin indentation, as well as a test of weight discrimination, were also performed. For each surface condition, the static grip force was modulated in parallel with load force while holding the object of a mass above 30 g. For objects with mass smaller than 30 g, on the other hand, the parallel relationship was changed, resulting in a progressive increase in grip-to-load force (GF/LF) ratio. The rayon had a higher GF/LF force ratio across all mass levels. The proportion of safety margin in the static grip force and normalized moment-to-moment variability of the static grip force were also elevated towards the lower end of the object mass for both surfaces. These findings indicate that the strategy of grip force control for holding objects with an extremely small mass differs from that with a mass above 30 g. The data for the contact area, skin indentation, and weight discrimination suggest that a decreased level of cutaneous feedback signals from the finger pads could have played some role in a cost function in efficient grip force control with low-mass objects. The elevated grip force variability associated with signal-dependent and internal noises, and anticipated inertial force on the held object due to acceleration of the arm and hand, could also have contributed to the cost function."
https://openalex.org/W2239488731,"We previously identified two distinct molecular subtypes of osteosarcoma through gene expression profiling. These subtypes are associated with distinct tumor behavior and clinical outcomes. Here, we describe mechanisms that give rise to these molecular subtypes. Using bioinformatic analyses, we identified a significant association between deregulation of the retinoblastoma (RB)-E2F pathway and the molecular subtype with worse clinical outcomes. Xenotransplantation models recapitulated the corresponding behavior for each osteosarcoma subtype; thus, we used cell lines to validate the role of the RB-E2F pathway in regulating the prognostic gene signature. Ectopic RB resets the patterns of E2F regulated gene expression in cells derived from tumors with worse clinical outcomes (molecular phenotype 2) to those comparable with those observed in cells derived from tumors with less aggressive outcomes (molecular phenotype 1), providing a functional association between RB-E2F dysfunction and altered gene expression in osteosarcoma. DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors similarly reset the transcriptional state of the molecular phenotype 2 cells from a state associated with RB deficiency to one seen with RB sufficiency. Our data indicate that deregulation of RB-E2F pathway alters the epigenetic landscape and biological behavior of osteosarcoma. We previously identified two distinct molecular subtypes of osteosarcoma through gene expression profiling. These subtypes are associated with distinct tumor behavior and clinical outcomes. Here, we describe mechanisms that give rise to these molecular subtypes.

https://openalex.org/W2221070192,"Rhythms, or patterns in time, play a vital role in both speech and music. Proficiency in a number of rhythm skills has been linked to language ability, suggesting that certain rhythmic processes in music and language rely on overlapping resources. However, a lack of understanding about how rhythm skills relate to each other has impeded progress in understanding how language relies on rhythm processing. In particular, it is unknown whether all rhythm skills are linked together, forming a single broad rhythmic competence, or whether there are multiple dissociable rhythm skills. We hypothesized that beat tapping and rhythm memory/sequencing form two separate clusters of rhythm skills. This hypothesis was tested with a battery of two beat tapping and two rhythm memory tests. Here we show that tapping to a metronome and the ability to adjust to a changing tempo while tapping to a metronome are related skills. The ability to remember rhythms and to drum along to repeating rhythmic sequences are also related. However, we found no relationship between beat tapping skills and rhythm memory skills. Thus, beat tapping and rhythm memory are dissociable rhythmic aptitudes. This discovery may inform future research disambiguating how distinct rhythm competencies track with specific language functions."
https://openalex.org/W2135971884,"Objectives Debate for a greater role of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measures in nutritional programming continues, but a shift from therapeutic feeding programs admitting children using MUAC and/or weight-for-height Z (WHZ) to a new model admitting children using MUAC only remains complicated by limited information regarding the clinical profile and response to treatment of children selected by MUAC vs. WHZ. To broaden our understanding of how children identified for therapeutic feeding by MUAC and/or WHZ may differ, we aimed to investigate differences between children identified for therapeutic feeding by MUAC and/or WHZ in terms of demographic, anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory and treatment response characteristics. Methods Using secondary data from a randomized trial in rural Niger among children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition, we compared children that would be admitted to a therapeutic feeding program that used a single anthropometric criterion of MUAC< 115 mm vs. children that are admitted under current admission criteria (WHZ< -3 and/or MUAC< 115 mm) but would be excluded from a program that used a single MUAC< 115 mm admission criterion. We assessed differences between groups using multivariate regression, employing linear regression for continuous outcomes and log-binomial regression for dichotomous outcomes. Results We found no difference in terms of clinical and laboratory characteristics and discharge outcomes evaluated between children that would be included in a MUAC< 115 mm therapeutic feeding program vs. children that are currently eligible for therapeutic feeding but would be excluded from a MUAC-only program. Conclusions A single anthropometric admission criterion of MUAC < 115 mm did not differentiate well between children in terms of clinical or laboratory measures or program outcomes in this context. If nutritional programming is to use a single MUAC-based criterion for admission to treatment, further research and program experience can help to identify the most appropriate criterion in a broad range of contexts to target children in most urgent need of treatment."

In this study, a cDNA encoding geranylgeranyl phyrophosphate synthase (GGPS), named IbGGPS, was isolated from sweetpotato storage roots. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the C-terminus of IbGGPS to obtain an IbGGPS-GFP fusion protein that was transiently expressed in both epidermal cells of onion and leaves of tobacco. Confocal microscopic analysis determined that the IbGGPS-GFP protein was localized to specific areas of the plasma membrane of onion and chloroplasts in tobacco leaves. The coding region of IbGGPS was cloned into a binary vector under the control of 35S promoter and then transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana to obtain transgenic plants. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed a significant increase of total carotenoids in transgenic plants. The seeds of transgenic and wild-type plants were germinated on an agar medium supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Transgenic seedlings grew significantly longer roots than wild-type ones did. Further enzymatic analysis showed an increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in transgenic seedlings. In addition, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced in transgenics. qRT-PCR analysis showed altered expressions of several genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis in transgenic plants. These data results indicate that IbGGPS is involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids in sweetpotato storage roots and likely associated with tolerance to osmotic stress."

However, epidemiologic studies that examined associations between B vitamin intake and BC risk have provided inconsistent results. We prospectively examined, in the Italian ORDET cohort, whether B vitamin consumption was associated with risk of BC and BC subtypes.After a mean follow-up of 16.5 years, 391 BCs were diagnosed among 10,786 cohort women. B vitamin intakes were estimated from food frequency questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for energy intake and confounders, estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for BC according to intake.RRs were 0.61 (95% CI 0.38-0.97 highest vs. lowest quartile; P trend 0.025) for thiamine; 0.48 (95% CI 0.32-0.71; P trend <0.001) for riboflavin; 0.59 (95% CI 0.39-0.90; P trend 0.008) for vitamin B6, and 0.65 (95% CI 0.44-0.95; P trend 0.021) for folate. As regards risk of BC subtypes, high riboflavin and folate were significantly associated with lower risk of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and progesterone receptor positive (PR+) cancers, and high thiamine was associated with lower risk of ER-PR- cancers. High riboflavin was associated with lower risk of both HER2+ and HER2- cancers, high folate with lower risk of HER2- disease, and high thiamine with HER2+ disease.These findings support protective effects of thiamine and one-carbon metabolism vitamins (folate, riboflavin, and vitamin B6) against BC in general; while folate may also protect against ER+PR+ and HER2- disease; and thiamine against ER-PR-, and HER2+ disease."

Infants were randomized to a tapering 7-day course of stress dose hydrocortisone or saline placebo. The primary outcome at follow-up was a composite of death, cognitive or language delay, cerebral palsy, severe hearing loss, or bilateral blindness at a corrected age of 18-22 months. Secondary outcomes included continued use of respiratory therapies and somatic growth.Fifty-seven infants had adequate data for the primary outcome. Of the 28 infants randomized to hydrocortisone, 19 (68%) died or survived with impairment compared with 22 of the 29 infants (76%) assigned to placebo (relative risk: 0.83; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.14). The rates of death for those in the hydrocortisone and placebo groups were 31% and 41%, respectively (P = 0.42). Randomization to hydrocortisone also did not significantly affect the frequency of supplemental oxygen use, positive airway pressure support, or need for respiratory medications.In high-risk extremely low birth weight infants, stress dose hydrocortisone therapy after 10 days of age had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18-22 months. These results may inform the design and conduct of future clinical trials.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00167544."

In this study, we investigated whether these new strain types exhibit an increased ability to cause TB lymphadenitis (TBLN) and raised the question, if particular MTBC strains derived from TBLN patients in northern Ethiopia are genetically adapted to their local hosts and/or to the TBLN.Genotyping of 196 MTBC strains isolated from TBLN patients was performed by spoligotyping and 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing. A statistical analysis was carried out to see possible associations between patient characteristics and phylogenetic MTBC strain classification.Among 196 isolates, the majority of strains belonged to the Delhi/CAS (38.8%) lineage, followed by Ethiopia 1 (9.7%), Ethiopia 3 (8.7%), Ethiopia H37RV-like (8.2%), Ethiopia 2 and Haarlem (7.7% each), URAL (3.6%), Uganda l and LAM (2% each), S-type (1.5%), X-type (1%), and 0.5% isolates of TUR, EAI, and Beijing genotype, respectively. Overall, 15 strains (7.7%) could not be allocated to a previously described phylogenetic lineage. The distribution of MTBC lineages is similar to that found in studies of PTB samples. The cluster rate (35%) in this study is significantly lower (P = 0.035) compared to 45% in the study of PTB in northwestern Ethiopia.In the studied area, lymph node samples are dominated by Dehli/CAS genotype strains and strains of largely not yet defined clades based on MIRU-VNTR 24-loci nomenclature. We found no indication that strains of particular genotypes are specifically associated with TBLN. However, a detailed analysis of specific genetic variants of the locally contained Ethiopian clades by whole genome sequencing may reveal new insights into the host-pathogen co-evolution and specific features that are related to the local host immune system."

Recent studies show that some patients with ADHD can also suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness but there are no data assessing the role of sleepiness in road safety in patients with ADHD. We conducted an epidemiological study to explore sleep complaints, inattention and driving risks among automobile drivers.From August to September 2014, 491186 regular highway users were invited to participate in an Internet survey on driving habits. 36140 drivers answered a questionnaire exploring driving risks, sleep complaints, sleepiness at the wheel, ADHD symptoms (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale) and distraction at the wheel. 1.7% of all drivers reported inattention-related driving accidents and 0.3% sleep-related driving accidents in the previous year. 1543 drivers (4.3%) reported ADHD symptoms and were more likely to report accidents than drivers without ADHD symptoms (adjusted OR = 1.24, [1.03-1.51], p < .021). 14.2% of drivers with ADHD symptoms reported severe excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale >15) versus 3.2% of drivers without ADHD symptoms and 20.5% reported severe sleepiness at the wheel versus 7.3%. Drivers with ADHD symptoms reported significantly more sleep-related (adjusted OR = 1.4, [1.21-1.60], p < .0001) and inattention-related (adjusted OR = 1.9, [1.71-2.14], p<0001) near misses than drivers without ADHD symptoms. The fraction of near-misses attributable to severe sleepiness at the wheel was 4.24% for drivers without ADHD symptoms versus 10,35% for drivers with ADHD symptoms.Our study shows that drivers with ADHD symptoms have more accidents and a higher level of sleepiness at the wheel than drivers without ADHD symptoms. Drivers with ADHD symptoms report more sleep-related and inattention-related near misses, thus confirming the clinical importance of exploring both attentional deficits and sleepiness at the wheel in these drivers. Road safety campaigns should be improved to better inform drivers of these accidental risks."

We mainly focused on the uncharacterized adenylate-forming enzyme (RevS). revS gene disruption resulted in the reduction of all RM derivatives, whereas reintroduction of the gene restored the yield of RMs. Although RevS was classified in the fatty acyl-AMP ligase clade based on phylogenetic analysis, biochemical characterization revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the middle chain fatty acyl-CoA ligase (FACL) but not the fatty acyl-AMP ligase activity, suggesting the molecular evolution for acyl-CoA biosynthesis. Moreover, we examined the in vitro conversion of fatty acid into 2-alkylmalonyl-CoA using purified RevS and RevT. The coupling reaction showed efficient conversion of hexenoic acid into butylmalonyl-CoA.

Interestingly, the human SepSecS was reported to interact in vivo with the SPS1 isoform (14Small-Howard A. Morozova N. Stoytcheva Z. Forry E.P. Mansell J.B. Harney J.W. Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

Biol. 2006; 26: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but little is known about the mechanism of this interaction. The elucidation of SPS-catalyzed selenium metabolism is important because SPS, rather than the less specific SelA, is responsible for the discrimination between selenium and sulfur in the process of Sec-tRNASec biosynthesis. The structural basis for this specificity is not yet understood. In this study, we show that SPS functionally interacts with the SelA-tRNASec binary complex, forming the SelA-tRNASec-SPS complex. The macromolecular assembly of the ternary complex follows a stoichiometric ratio of 1SelAdecamer:10tRNASec:5SPSdimer, resulting in a macromolecular structure of ∼1.3 MDa, and we provide structural insights into the organization of the ternary complex. SelA was expressed and purified according to Manzine et al. (15Manzine L.R. Cassago A. da Silva M.T. Thiemann O.H.

The DNA sequence of E. coli SPS was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA using 5′-ACTGTATCATATGAGCGAGAACTCGATTCGTTTGACCCAATAC-3′ forward and 5′-TGCACTCGAGTCATTAACGAATCTCAACCATGGCACGACCGAC-3′ reverse primers and ligated into pET28a(+) vector (GE Healthcare). Recombinant SPS was overexpressed at 37 °C overnight in the E. coli BL21 (λDE3) (Stratagene) in LB medium and then harvested at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl) and lysed by six cycles of 30 s of sonication and 1 min of rest using the 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific). The soluble fraction was applied to a metal-chelate affinity matrix (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen) and eluted with 250 mm imidazole, followed by cleavage of the affinity tag using 1 unit of thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) for 100 μg of E. coli SPS. The product was purified to homogeneity using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. Limited proteolysis of E. coli SPS was performed using chymotrypsin protease (Sigma). SPS (5 mg/ml) was incubated at a protease:protein ratio of 1:50 w/w for 20 min at 18 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A stable proteolytic fraction was subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). The result from the proteolytic digestion was used to confirm the truncation of the N-terminal sequence of E. coli SPS after the 11th amino acid residue. The Δ11-SPS construct lacking the first 11 amino acid residues was obtained by DNA sequence amplification from E. coli genomic DNA using 5′-AGCATATGAGCCACGGAGCTGGTTGCGGCTG-3′ forward and 5′-AGCTCGAGTTAACGGATCTCAACCATGGCACG-3′ reverse primers and ligated into pET28a(+) vector (GE Healthcare).

These cells were tested for the presence of an active selenoprotein formate dehydrogenase H (FDH H) using the benzyl viologen assay under anaerobic conditions (16Sculaccio S.A. Rodrigues E.M.

The uncharged tRNASec was fluorescein-labeled, and its interaction with SelA was conducted using 500 nm SelA with 490 nm unlabeled tRNASec and 10 nm fluorescein-labeled tRNASec incubated in binding buffer for 30 min at 25 °C to form the covalently bound binary complex SelA-tRNASec in a final equimolar stoichiometry, according to previous publications (5Forchhammer K.

The isothermal fluorescence anisotropy assay was performed with fluorescence anisotropy measurements in “L” geometry at 25 °C. A concentrated SPS sample was titrated to a SelA-tRNASec sample, homogenized, and equilibrated for 5 min at 25 °C prior to steady-state anisotropy measurements. The same experimental conditions were applied to fluorescence anisotropy assays using mutant tRNASec constructs. Excitation was set to 480 nm, and emission was recorded through an orange cut-off filter at 515 nm (6Manzine L.R. Serrão V.H. da Rocha e Lima L.M. de Souza M.M. Bettini J. Portugal R.V. van Heel M.

Anisotropy fluorescence values, r, and total intensity of fluorescence were calculated with the ISS program. In all cases, maximal dilution was less than 20%. The resulting fluorescence anisotropy values were fitted, using the program Origin 8.0, to the Hill equation r = r 0 + ( r f − r 0 ) × ( [ SPS monomer ] ) n ( K d ) n + ( [ SPS monomer ] ) n (Eq. 1) with r0 and rf representing the initial and final fluorescence anisotropy measures. [SPSmonomer] is the titrated SPS concentration in units of monomers. Thus, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and the Hill constant (n) were determined. Experiments for determination of the stoichiometry of SelA-tRNASec-SPS binding were performed using 5000 nm SelA bound to 4990 nm unlabeled tRNASec and 10 nm fluorescein-labeled tRNASec. The same procedures as described above were used during the SPS titration. Mutant tRNASec molecules were also tested for interaction with SelA by fluorescence anisotropy assays, as described previously (6Manzine L.R. Serrão V.H. da Rocha e Lima L.M. de Souza M.M. Bettini J.

We used hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry to map the surfaces of SelA and SPS following the formation of the SelA-tRNASec binary complex and the SelA-tRNASec-SPS ternary complex. The various samples (SelA, SelA-tRNASec, SPS, tRNASec, and SelA-tRNASec-SPS) were prepared using a published protocol (17Figueira A.C.M. Saidemberg D.M. Souza P.C.T. Martínez L. Scanlan T.S. Baxter J.D. Skaf M.S. Palma M.S. Webb P. Polikarpov I. Analysis of agonist and antagonist effects on thyroid hormone receptor conformation by hydrogen/deuterium exchange.Mol. Endocrinol. 2011; 25: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were labeled by diluting the sample to a final concentration of D2O of ∼90%. At each time point analyzed, aliquots (20 μl) were taken out of the exchange tube and quenched by mixing the solution with a 1:1 ratio of the quenching buffer (D2O, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.5) and cooled to 0 °C to slow down the H/D exchange. These sample aliquots were digested for 5 min at 0 °C after the addition of 1 μl of a precooled pepsin solution (1 mg/ml in 5% (v/v) formic acid) and were injected directly to the mass spectrometer using a flow of 80 μl/min. The MS experiments were performed with an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole instrument, model Quatro II (Micromass UK), using the same procedures described by Figueira et al. (17Figueira A.C.M. Saidemberg D.M. Souza P.C.T. Martínez L. Scanlan T.S. Baxter J.D. Skaf M.S. Palma M.S. Webb P. Polikarpov I.

The spectral data were acquired and monitored using the MassLynx software (Micromass); the spectra deconvolution of the intact protein samples was performed with the program Transform (Waters). The theoretical digest was performed using the MS-Digest web server, and the error at each data point was determined to be 0.3 Da (based on multiple measurements). The structural model of E. coli SelA decamer was obtained using the I-TASSER server (18Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4691) Google Scholar) that joins multiple threading alignments to rounds of iterative structural assembly simulations for protein structure modeling. Infrared spectra of protein solutions were collected in a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS KBr detector, corresponding to 512 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1 over the wavenumber range 4000–400 cm−1 at 25 °C. During data acquisition, the spectrometer was continuously purged with nitrogen. The buffer spectrum was subtracted digitally from the sample spectrum. The second derivative was used to identify the peak positions of the major components of the amide I band on the original (non-smoothed) protein vibrational spectra. To estimate the secondary structure content, Gaussian curve fitting was performed in the region of 1500–1700 cm−1 using GRAMS/386 software package (Galactic Industries). For FTIR analyses, SelA and SPS were prepared isolated in solution but also in the combinations 1SPS:1SelA, 1SelA:1tRNASec, and 1SelA:1tRNASec:1SPS (molar ratios in monomer units). Difference infrared spectra were used to monitor the initial and the final state of SelA after SelA-tRNASec complex formation obtained by spectrum subtraction of the complex with the isolated samples. The final state of SPS after SelA-tRNASec-SPS complex formation was assessed by subtracting the experimental FTIR signal for the ternary complex, previously subtracted by the FTIR signal of the binary complex, to the SPS spectrum. The combination 1SelA:1SPS was also analyzed. To analyze the external dimensions, 1 μl of each sample, at 0.5 mg/ml, was incubated in binding buffer without PLP for 40 min at 25 °C, deposited on a mica square (10 × 10 mm), and dried at room temperature for 3 h. This mica square was fixed in a metal base and analyzed in a Bruker Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIA atomic force microscope (LNNano, CNPEM) using the non-contact mode and silicon tip of 1-nm diameter with 256 lines of scanning (19Müller D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2264890678,"Angiotensin II, a peptide hormone that regulates blood pressure, has been proposed as a protective factor against cerebral malaria based on a genetic analysis. In vitro studies have documented an inhibitory effect of angiotensin II on Plasmodium growth, while studies using chemical inhibitors of angiotensin II in mice showed protection against experimental cerebral malaria but not major effects on parasite growth. To determine whether the level of angiotensin II affects Plasmodium growth and/or disease outcome in malaria, elevated levels of angiotensin II were induced in mice by intradermal implantation of osmotic mini-pumps providing constant release of this hormone. Mice were then infected with P. berghei and monitored for parasitemia and incidence of cerebral malaria. Mice infused with angiotensin II showed decreased parasitemia seven days after infection. The development of experimental cerebral malaria was delayed and a moderate increase in survival was observed in mice with elevated angiotensin II, as confirmed by decreased number of cerebral hemorrhages compared to controls. The results presented here show for the first time the effect of elevated levels of angiotensin II in an in vivo model of malaria. The decreased pathogenesis observed in mice complements a previous human genetic study, reinforcing the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of angiotensin II in malaria."

It is also known to have an important function in wound healing. This study investigated the effect of GM-CSF in wound healing of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). We used human GM-CSF derived from rice cells (rice cell-derived recombinant human GM-CSF; rhGM-CSF). An in vitro migration assay was performed to investigate the migration rate of HCECs treated with various concentrations of rhGM-CSF (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μg/ml). MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to evaluate the proliferative effect of rhGM-CSF. The protein level of p38MAPK was analyzed by western blotting. For in vivo analysis, 100 golden Syrian hamsters were divided into four groups, and their corneas were de-epithelialized with alcohol and a blade. The experimental groups were treated with 10, 20, or 50 μg/ml rhGM-CSF four times daily, and the control group was treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The corneal wound-healing rate was evaluated by fluorescein staining at the initial wounding and 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after epithelial debridement. rhGM-CSF accelerated corneal epithelial wound healing both in vitro and in vivo. MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis revealed that rhGM-CSF treatment had no effects on HCEC proliferation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression level of phosphorylated p38MAPK increased with rhGM-CSF treatment. These findings indicate that rhGM-CSF enhances corneal wound healing by accelerating cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2340950307,"Cytokinins, a class of phytohormones, are adenine derivatives common to many different organisms. In plants, these play a crucial role as regulators of plant development and the reaction to abiotic and biotic stress. Key enzymes in the cytokinin synthesis and degradation in modern land plants are the isopentyl transferases and the cytokinin dehydrogenases, respectively. Their encoding genes have been probably introduced into the plant lineage during the primary endosymbiosis. To shed light on the evolution of these proteins, the genes homologous to plant adenylate isopentenyl transferase and cytokinin dehydrogenase were amplified from the genomic DNA of cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The putative isopentenyl transferase was shown to be functional in a biochemical assay. In contrast, no enzymatic activity was detected for the putative cytokinin dehydrogenase, even though the principal domains necessary for its function are present. Several mutant variants, in which conserved amino acids in land plant cytokinin dehydrogenases had been restored, were inactive. A combination of experimental data with phylogenetic analysis indicates that adenylate-type isopentenyl transferases might have evolved several times independently. While the Nostoc genome contains a gene coding for protein with characteristics of cytokinin dehydrogenase, the organism is not able to break down cytokinins in the way shown for land plants."
https://openalex.org/W2246681791,"The KCNH2 and KCNE2 genes encode the cardiac voltage-gated K+ channel KV11.1 and its auxiliary β subunit KCNE2. KV11.1 is critical for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. In humans, mutations or drug therapy affecting the KV11.1 channel are associated with prolongation of the QT intervals on the ECG and increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death--conditions known as congenital or acquired Long QT syndrome (LQTS), respectively. In horses, sudden, unexplained deaths are a well-known problem. We sequenced the cDNA of the KCNH2 and KCNE2 genes using RACE and conventional PCR on mRNA purified from equine myocardial tissue. Equine KV11.1 and KCNE2 cDNA had a high homology to human genes (93 and 88%, respectively). Equine and human KV11.1 and KV11.1/KCNE2 were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and investigated by two-electrode voltage-clamp. Equine KV11.1 currents were larger compared to human KV11.1, and the voltage dependence of activation was shifted to more negative values with V1/2 = -14.2±1.1 mV and -17.3±0.7, respectively. The onset of inactivation was slower for equine KV11.1 compared to the human homolog. These differences in kinetics may account for the larger amplitude of the equine current. Furthermore, the equine KV11.1 channel was susceptible to pharmacological block with terfenadine. The physiological importance of KV11.1 was investigated in equine right ventricular wedge preparations. Terfenadine prolonged action potential duration and the effect was most pronounced at slow pacing. In conclusion, these findings indicate that horses could be disposed to both congenital and acquired LQTS."

Despite external quality assessment is established in Ethiopia, there is lower TB detection rate (48%) in Amhara region compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate (70%). This highlights the quality of smear microscopy needs to be evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the quality of sputum smear microscopy performance among health center laboratories in West Amhara region, Ethiopia.A cross sectional study was conducted from July 08, 2013 to July 07, 2014. Data were collected from 201 public health center laboratories using a structured questionnaire. Slides were collected based on Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) method and rechecked blindly by trained laboratory technologists. The data were entered into EPI info V.7 and smear quality indicators and AFB results were analyzed by SPSS version 20.Among 201 laboratories enrolled in this study, 47 (23.4%) laboratories had major errors. Forty one (20.4%) laboratories had a total of 67 false negative and 29 (14.4%) laboratories had a total of 68 false positive results. Specimen quality, smear thickness and evenness were found poor in 134 (66.7%), 133 (66.2%) and 126 (62.7%) laboratories, respectively.

We analysed data from a large cohort of residents in Rome followed-up between 2001 and 2012 to assess the relationship between individual education and mortality. We distinguished five causes of death and investigated the role of age, gender, and birthplace.From the Municipal Register we enrolled residents of Rome on October 21st 2001 and collected information on educational level attained from the 2001 Census. We selected Italian citizens aged 30-74 years and followed-up their vital status until 2012 (n = 1,283,767), identifying the cause of death from the Regional Mortality Registry. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and cause-specific mortality in relation to education. We used age, gender, and birthplace for adjusted or stratified analyses. We used the inverse probability weighting approach to account for right censoring due to emigration.We observed an inverse association between education (none vs. post-secondary+ level) and overall mortality (HRs(95%CIs): 2.1(1.98-2.17), males; 1.5(1.46-1.59), females) varying according to demographic characteristics. Cause-specific analysis also indicated an inverse association with education, in particular for respiratory, digestive or circulatory system related-mortality, and the youngest people seemed to be more vulnerable to low education.Our results confirm the inverse association between education and overall or cause-specific mortality and show differentials particularly marked among young people compared to the elderly. The findings provide further evidence from the Mediterranean area, and may contribute to national and cross-country comparisons in Europe to understand the mechanisms generating socioeconomic differentials especially during the current recession period."

Pre and post-intervention questionnaires were administered to collect information on TB notification practices and feasibility of MITUN after an implementation period of 6 months.A total of 266 private medical practitioners were approached for the study. Of them, 184 (69%) participated in the study; of whom 11 (6%) practitioners used MITUN for TB notification. Reasons for not using MITUN include lack of time, referral of patients to government facility, issues related to patient confidentiality and technical problems. Suggestions for making mobile phone based TB notification process user-friendly included reducing call duration, including only crucial questions and using missed call or SMS options.The performance (feasibility and usefulness) of MITUN voice based system for TB notification in the present format was sub-optimal. Perceived problems, logistical and practical issues preclude scale-up of notification of TB by private practitioners."

This paper focuses on level 8 (dated around ∼ 100 ka BP) of El Harhoura 2 Cave, located along the coastline in the Rabat-Témara region (Morocco). The large quantity of Patella sp. shells found in this level highlights questions regarding their origin and preservation. This study presents an estimation of the preservation status of these shells. We focus here on the diagenetic evolution of both the microstructural patterns and organic components of crossed-foliated shell layers, in order to assess the viability of further investigations based on shell layer minor elements, isotopic or biochemical compositions. The results show that the shells seem to be well conserved, with microstructural patterns preserved down to sub-micrometric scales, and that some organic components are still present in situ. But faint taphonomic degradations affecting both mineral and organic components are nonetheless evidenced, such as the disappearance of organic envelopes surrounding crossed-foliated lamellae, combined with a partial recrystallization of the lamellae. Our results provide a solid case-study of the early stages of the diagenetic evolution of crossed-foliated shell layers. Moreover, they highlight the fact that extreme caution must be taken before using fossil shells for palaeoenvironmental or geochronological reconstructions. Without thorough investigation, the alteration patterns illustrated here would easily have gone unnoticed. However, these degradations are liable to bias any proxy based on the elemental, isotopic or biochemical composition of the shells. This study also provides significant data concerning human subsistence behavior: the presence of notches and the good preservation state of limpet shells (no dissolution/recrystallization, no bioerosion and no abrasion/fragmentation aspects) would attest that limpets were gathered alive with tools by Middle Palaeolithic (Aterian) populations in North Africa for consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2197353625,"Studies have shown that internal representations of manipulations of objects with asymmetric mass distributions that are generated within a specific orientation are not generalizable to novel orientations, i.e., subjects fail to prevent object roll on their first grasp-lift attempt of the object following 180° object rotation. This suggests that representations of these manipulations are specific to the reference frame in which they are formed. However, it is unknown whether that reference frame is specific to the hand, the body, or both, because rotating the object 180° modifies the relation between object and body as well as object and hand. An alternative, untested explanation for the above failure to generalize learned manipulations is that any rotation will disrupt grasp performance, regardless if the reference frame in which the manipulation was learned is maintained or modified. We examined the effect of rotations that (1) maintain and (2) modify relations between object and body, and object and hand, on the generalizability of learned two-digit manipulation of an object with an asymmetric mass distribution. Following rotations that maintained the relation between object and body and object and hand (e.g., rotating the object and subject 180°), subjects continued to use appropriate digit placement and load force distributions, thus generating sufficient compensatory moments to minimize object roll. In contrast, following rotations that modified the relation between (1) object and hand (e.g. rotating the hand around to the opposite object side), (2) object and body (e.g. rotating subject and hand 180°), or (3) both (e.g. rotating the subject 180°), subjects used the same, yet inappropriate digit placement and load force distribution, as those used prior to the rotation. Consequently, the compensatory moments were insufficient to prevent large object rolls. These findings suggest that representations of learned manipulation of objects with asymmetric mass distributions are specific to the body- and hand-reference frames in which they were learned."
https://openalex.org/W2146007425,"Increasing fishing pressure and uncertainty surrounding recreational fishing catch and effort data promoted the development of alternative methods for conducting fisheries research. A pilot investigation was undertaken to engage the Australian game fishing community and promote the non-lethal collection of tissue samples from the black marlin Istiompax indica, a valuable recreational-only species in Australian waters, for the purpose of future genetic research. Recruitment of recreational anglers was achieved by publicizing the project in magazines, local newspapers, social media, blogs, websites and direct communication workshops at game fishing tournaments. The Game Fishing Association of Australia and the Queensland Game Fishing Association were also engaged to advertise the project and recruit participants with a focus on those anglers already involved in the tag-and-release of marlin. Participants of the program took small tissue samples using non-lethal methods which were stored for future genetic analysis. The program resulted in 165 samples from 49 participants across the known distribution of I. indica within Australian waters which was a sufficient number to facilitate a downstream population genetic analysis. The project demonstrated the potential for the development of citizen science sampling programs to collect tissue samples using non-lethal methods in order to achieve targeted research objects in recreationally caught species."
https://openalex.org/W2339814748,"One of the central questions of the transition from mobile hunter-gatherers to sedentary farming communities concerns the establishment of new social structures and group identities. Along with other important factors, such as territory, ideology or economy, biological relationships might have played a decisive role in defining social groups. We therefore systematically analyzed teeth and jaw remains from nine sites in the Near East dating from the Natufian to the Late PPNB as primary proxy data for the reconstruction of familial relationships. This paper presents the results of morphological analyses on the teeth of the individuals from Kfar HaHoresh, one of the investigated Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites. Kfar HaHoresh is located in the Nazareth hills of Galilee (32°42'20'' N 35°16'28'' E), Israel. Different statistical methods were applied to our data of epigenetic traits with the aim of determining biological relationships within the community, whereby the data of the eight other sites were used as cross-references. Our comparison of the traits of all individuals from Kfar HaHoresh indicates a rather heterogeneous community, but clearly shows one cluster belonging to a quite homogenous group, suggesting close biological relations between females and sub-adults. Interestingly, none of the male individuals belongs to this cluster, although their number outweighs that of the female individuals. This might suggest matrilocal residence patterns. However, due to the incomplete preservation of the teeth along with several other uncertainties, our conclusion must be seen as preliminary. A cross-examination of the results on skeletons excavated after our investigation should also be taken into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2208908464,"In the 200 years since the Sumatran rhinoceros was first scientifically described (Fisher 1814), the range of the species has contracted from a broad region in Southeast Asia to three areas on the island of Sumatra and one in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Assessing population and spatial distribution of this very rare species is challenging because of their elusiveness and very low population number. Using an occupancy model with spatial dependency, we assessed the fraction of the total landscape occupied by Sumatran rhinos over a 30,345-km2 survey area and the effects of covariates in the areas where they are known to occur. In the Leuser Landscape (surveyed in 2007), the model averaging result of conditional occupancy estimate was or 2,371.47 km2, and the model averaging result of replicated level detection probability ; in Way Kambas National Park—2008: or 634.18 km2, and ; and in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park—2010: or 819.67 km2, and . In the Leuser Landscape, rhino occurrence was positively associated with primary dry land forest and rivers, and negatively associated with the presence of a road. In Way Kambas, occurrence was negatively associated with the presence of a road. In Bukit Barisan Selatan, occurrence was negatively associated with presence of primary dryland forest and rivers. Using the probabilities of site occupancy, we developed spatially explicit maps that can be used to outline intensive protection zones for in-situ conservation efforts, and provide a detailed assessment of conserving Sumatran rhinos in the wild. We summarize our core recommendation in four points: consolidate small population, strong protection, determine the percentage of breeding females, and recognize the cost of doing nothing. To reduce the probability of poaching, here we present only the randomized location of site level occupancy in our result while retaining the overall estimation of occupancy for a given area."
https://openalex.org/W2247380377,"The Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) requires cAMP binding to undergo a conformational change for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Two CRP residues, Thr(127) and Ser(128), are known to play important roles in cAMP binding through hydrogen bonding and in the cAMP-induced conformational change, but the connection between the two is not completely clear. Here, we simultaneously randomized the codons for these two residues and selected CRP mutants displaying high CRP activity in a cAMP-producing E. coli. Many different CRP mutants satisfied the screening condition for high CRP activity, including those that cannot form any hydrogen bonds with the incoming cAMP at the two positions. In vitro DNA-binding analysis confirmed that these selected CRP mutants indeed display high CRP activity in response to cAMP. These results indicate that the hydrogen bonding ability of the Thr(127) and Ser(128) residues is not critical for the cAMP-induced CRP activation. However, the hydrogen bonding ability of Thr(127) and Ser(128) was found to be important in attaining high cAMP affinity. Computational analysis revealed that most natural cAMP-sensing CRP homologs have Thr/Ser, Thr/Thr, or Thr/Asn at positions 127 and 128. All of these pairs are excellent hydrogen bonding partners and they do not elevate CRP activity in the absence of cAMP. Taken together, our analyses suggest that CRP evolved to have hydrogen bonding residues at the cAMP pocket residues 127 and 128 for performing dual functions: preserving high cAMP affinity and keeping CRP inactive in the absence of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2206857212,"Brucella are facultative intracellular Gram-negative coccobacilli that chronically infect humans as well as domestic and wild-type mammals, and cause brucellosis. Alternatively activated macrophages (M2a) induced by IL-4/IL-13 via STAT6 signaling pathways have been frequently described as a favorable niche for long-term persistence of intracellular pathogens. Based on the observation that M2a-like macrophages are induced in the spleen during the chronic phase of B. abortus infection in mice and are strongly infected in vitro, it has been suggested that M2a macrophages could be a potential in vivo niche for Brucella. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a model in which infected cells can be observed directly in situ and where the differentiation of M2a macrophages is favored by the absence of an IL-12-dependent Th1 response. We performed an in situ analysis by fluorescent microscopy of the phenotype of B. melitensis infected spleen cells from intranasally infected IL-12p40-/- BALB/c mice and the impact of STAT6 deficiency on this phenotype. Most of the infected spleen cells contained high levels of lipids and expressed CD11c and CD205 dendritic cell markers and Arginase1, but were negative for the M2a markers Fizz1 or CD301. Furthermore, STAT6 deficiency had no effect on bacterial growth or the reservoir cell phenotype in vivo, leading us to conclude that, in our model, the infected cells were not Th2-induced M2a macrophages. This characterization of B. melitensis reservoir cells could provide a better understanding of Brucella persistence in the host and lead to the design of more efficient therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2207416616,"The characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human turbinates (hTMSCs) have not been investigated in allergic rhinitis. We evaluated the influence of allergic state of the donor on the characteristics, proliferation, and differentiation potential of hTMSCs, compared with hTMSCs derived from non-allergic patients. hTMSCs were isolated from five non-allergic and five allergic patients. The expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in hTMSCs was measured by FACS, and cell proliferation was measured using a cell counting kit. Cytokine secretion was analyzed using multiplex immunoassays. The osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation potentials of hTMSCs were evaluated by histology and gene expression analysis. In allergic patients, FACS analysis showed that TLR3 and TLR4 were more highly expressed on the surface of hTMSCs than TLR2 and TLR5. The proliferation of hTMSCs was not influenced by the presence of TLR priming. The expression of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IP-10, and RANTES was upregulated after the TLR4 priming. The differentiation potential of hTMSCs was not influenced by TLR priming. These characteristics of hTMSCs were similar to those of hTMSCs from non-allergic patients. We conclude that the allergic condition of the donor does not influence TLR expression, proliferation, or immunomodulatory potential of hTMSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2208000532,"Analyzing and optimizing biological models is often identified as a research priority in biomedical engineering. An important feature of a model should be the ability to find the best condition in which an organism has to be grown in order to reach specific optimal output values chosen by the researcher. In this work, we take into account a mitochondrial model analyzed with flux-balance analysis. The optimal design and assessment of these models is achieved through single- and/or multi-objective optimization techniques driven by epsilon-dominance and identifiability analysis. Our optimization algorithm searches for the values of the flux rates that optimize multiple cellular functions simultaneously. The optimization of the fluxes of the metabolic network includes not only input fluxes, but also internal fluxes. A faster convergence process with robust candidate solutions is permitted by a relaxed Pareto dominance, regulating the granularity of the approximation of the desired Pareto front. We find that the maximum ATP production is linked to a total consumption of NADH, and reaching the maximum amount of NADH leads to an increasing request of NADH from the external environment. Furthermore, the identifiability analysis characterizes the type and the stage of three monogenic diseases. Finally, we propose a new methodology to extend any constraint-based model using protein abundances."
https://openalex.org/W1932680975,"Frequently, population ecology of marine organisms uses a descriptive approach in which their sizes and densities are plotted over time. This approach has limited usefulness for design strategies in management or modelling different scenarios. Population projection matrix models are among the most widely used tools in ecology. Unfortunately, for the majority of pelagic marine organisms, it is difficult to mark individuals and follow them over time to determine their vital rates and built a population projection matrix model. Nevertheless, it is possible to get time-series data to calculate size structure and densities of each size, in order to determine the matrix parameters. This approach is known as a ""demographic inverse problem"" and it is based on quadratic programming methods, but it has rarely been used on aquatic organisms. We used unpublished field data of a population of cubomedusae Carybdea marsupialis to construct a population projection matrix model and compare two different management strategies to lower population to values before year 2008 when there was no significant interaction with bathers. Those strategies were by direct removal of medusae and by reducing prey. Our results showed that removal of jellyfish from all size classes was more effective than removing only juveniles or adults. When reducing prey, the highest efficiency to lower the C. marsupialis population occurred when prey depletion affected prey of all medusae sizes. Our model fit well with the field data and may serve to design an efficient management strategy or build hypothetical scenarios such as removal of individuals or reducing prey. TThis This sdfsdshis method is applicable to other marine or terrestrial species, for which density and population structure over time are available."

At the end of the incubation, the samples were each mixed with glycerol to 20%, and 5-μl aliquots were then subjected to electrophoresis on Glyko Mono Composition gels with Mono Running buffer from ProZyme Inc. (San Leandro, CA). Running conditions were 500 V at 4 °C in a cold room for 1 h. Gels were imaged on an Ultra-Lum transilluminator (365 nm). Images were captured with a Quantix cooled charge-coupled device camera from Roper Scientific/Photometrics and analyzed with the Gel-Pro Analyzer program version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics). The hyaluronan contents were quantified according to the integrated intensities of signal bands and then normalized with chondroitin sulfate contents. Heparin was digested with the bacterial heparin lyase 1 (Seikagaku) overnight, and its endoeliminase activity was inactivated by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min (16.Lauer M.E. Hascall V.C. Wang A.

The samples were subsequently cooled on ice for 10 min. To purify heparin trisaccharides, the digests were precipitated in 82.5% ethanol and lyophilized as described previously (16.Lauer M.E.

Each sample was labeled in an 8-μl reaction volume using PCR tubes and low retention pipette tips. Briefly, 4 μl of 12.5 mm 2-aminoacridine in 85% dimethyl sulfoxide and 15% glacial acetic acid was added to each lyophilized sample, and the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Then 4 μl of 1.25 m sodium cyanoborohydride in distilled water was added, followed by an overnight (16–18-h) incubation at 37 °C. The disaccharides and oligosaccharides were analyzed using OLIGO profiling gels and companion buffers (ProZyme) at 15 mA/gel (constant) as described previously (16.Lauer M.E. Hascall V.C. Wang A.

To determine whether or not heparin and Hep-Tri are internalized by RMCs, growth-arrested G0/G1 cultures were stimulated to divide with 10% FBS in high glucose medium in the presence of 1 μg/ml FITC-heparin or Hep-Tri labeled by AMAC for 2 h. Cells were then lightly fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. DiI (0.5 μg/ml) was added at 30 min before the end of incubation following the manufacturer's instructions. Heparin is synthesized in mast cells as a proteoglycan, serglycin, which contains 15–20 heparin chains with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa. During or after entry into the secretory granules, the chains are hydrolyzed by heparanase to 10–15 kDa (18.Wight T.N. Heinegård D.K. Hascall V.C. Proteoglycans: structure and function.in: Hay E.

There is only one heparanase in the human genome, and it hydrolyzes bonds between hexuronate residues and GlcNS(6S) (20.Okada Y. Yamada S. Toyoshima M. Dong J. Nakajima M. Sugahara K.

Bacterial heparin lyase is an endoeliminase that converts heparin primarily to disaccharides containing unsaturated (Δ-hexuronate) residues at their non-reducing ends (Fig. 1A). When heparin lyase acts, it also forms a saturated trisaccharide (Hep Digest/Tri) from the non-reducing end of the heparin chain formed through the action of heparanase on serglycin (21.Linhardt R.J.

Specificity studies on the heparin lyases from Flavobacterium heparinum.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The FACE analysis of the heparin digestion mixture showed that more than 90% of labeled saccharides are the highly sulfated ΔUA(2S)GlcNS(6S) disaccharide, consistent with the highly sulfated structure of heparin, and revealed the presence of two trisaccharide bands (Fig. 1B). Ethanol precipitation removed the Δ-disaccharides from the mixture, and the purified heparin digest (Hep Digest/Tri) contains a minor amount of a fully sulfated, faster migrating trisaccharide (Tri), GlcNS(6S)-UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S), and a major slower migrating trisaccharide (Hep Digest/Tri**) likely with one less sulfate residue. The Δ-Di band intensity was >10 times the sum of the trisaccharide bands. The purified Hep Digest/Tri sample contains only a small amount of the Δ-Di. Thus, the mass of the Hep Digest/Tri used in the following experiment was <1/10 that of the heparin, i.e. at equivalent molar concentrations. Fig. 2 compares the effects of different concentrations of the heparin and Hep Digest/Tri on hyaluronan synthesis and U937 monocyte binding. The RMC cultures were growth-arrested to G0/G1 and stimulated to divide in hyperglycemic medium without (Control) and with heparin and with Hep Digest/Tri as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hyaluronan contents and U937 monocyte binding were determined at 72 h, ∼48 h after completing cell division. As shown in Fig. 2A, increased synthesis of hyaluronan was nearly identical for the concentrations of intact heparin (white bars) and Hep Digest/Tri (black bars). Both treatments reached a plateau level ∼2 times the hyperglycemic medium alone at a concentration of 0.3 μg/ml heparin and ∼0.03 μg/ml Hep Digest/Tri. A concentration of 0.15 μg/ml heparin (∼0.015 μg/ml Hep Digest/Tri) increased synthesis nearly midway to the plateau level. If all the Hep Digest/Tri lacked one sulfate residue and were recognized by the receptor, this would be conservatively ∼20 nmol/ml. Binding of U937 monocytes also increased to a plateau level ∼2.5 times the hyperglycemia medium alone with no significant differences between heparin and Hep Digest/Tri (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the numbers bound at 0.15 μg/ml heparin (∼0.015 μg/ml Hep Digest/Tri) were already near the plateau level, although the increase in hyaluronan at this concentration was significantly less than the plateau level. This suggests the possibility that coalescence of hyaluronan cable structures among the cells that occurs in the monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrices at plateau may limit the number of monocytes that can bind, whereas the sparsity of the monocyte-adhesive structures in the pre-plateau cultures can accommodate relatively more. Fig. 3A shows an example of the U937 monocyte adhesion results on cultures 72 h after initiating cell division from G0/G1 cells, and Fig. 3B shows the bar graphs from assays of three replicate analyses for each. Plateau concentrations of 0.3 μg/ml heparin and ∼0.03 μg/ml Hep Digest/Tri were used. The ratios of hyaluronan to the value in hyperglycemic cultures alone (Control) are also indicated in Fig. 3A. Both the heparin and the Hep Digest/Tri treatments significantly increased hyaluronan and U937 monocyte binding as compared with the high glucose control cultures. Therefore, the results in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 provide compelling evidence that the structure determinant on heparin required for the induction to form the extensive monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix resides on its non-reducing termini. To determine whether exposing the non-reducing GlcNS(6S) is required to initiate the hyaluronan and monocyte-adhesive responses, a fully sulfated Δ-tetrasaccharide (Δ-Tetra) purified from heparin lyase-digested heparin was tested (23.Merchant Z.M. Kim Y.S. Rice K.G. Linhardt R.J. Structure of heparin-derived tetrasaccharides.Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FACE analysis of the Δ-Tetra showed a single band that was converted to fully sulfated Δ-UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) disaccharides after heparin lyase digestion (Fig. 4). Mercuric ion treatment of the Δ-Tetra removed the Δ-UA(2S), as indicated by the unidentified X1 band present when the Δ-hexuronate is 2-sulfated, and as shown when the Δ-disaccharide is converted to the GlcNS(6S) monosaccharide after mercuric ion treatment. The purity of the resulting GlcNS(6S)-UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) trisaccharide (Hep-Tri) is shown by the single band (tri-). The effects of the Δ-Tetra (0.022 μg/ml) and Hep-Tri (∼0.018 μg/ml) on hyaluronan synthesis and U937 monocyte adhesion in hyperglycemic dividing mesangial cells were analyzed. Fig. 5A shows an example of the U937 monocyte adhesion results on cultures 72 h after initiating cell division from G0/G1 cells, and Fig. 5B shows the bar graphs from assays of three replicate analyses for each. The ratios of hyaluronan to the value in hyperglycemic cultures alone are also indicated in Fig. 5A. The Δ-Tetra showed minimal (not statistically significant) increases in U937 monocyte adhesion and hyaluronan synthesis as compared with the hyperglycemic cultures alone. In contrast, the Hep-Tri showed similar values to those for the heparin and Hep Digest/Tri analyses in Fig. 3. These results indicate that the exposure of the non-reducing GlcNS(6S) on the trisaccharide, which would also be on the non-reducing end of heparin, is necessary to initiate the responses in hyperglycemic dividing mesangial cells that prevent the intracellular hyaluronan synthesis and autophagy and reprogram the cells to synthesize an extensive extracellular monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix after completing division. To determine whether heparin and Hep-Tri interact with RMCs and then can be internalized by the cells, FITC-labeled heparin and AMAC-labeled Hep Digest/Tri were used when the G0/G1-arrested RMCs were stimulated by serum to reenter the cell cycle in the high glucose medium. Fig. 6 shows the internalization of FITC-labeled heparin and AMAC-labeled Hep-Tri in RMCs. At 2 h after the treatments, FITC-labeled heparin and AMAC-labeled Hep Digest/Tri were internalized and found in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi regions of RMCs with some evidence for nuclear localization as well. These data indicate that heparin and Hep Digest/Tri act on RMCs via a similar molecular and cellular mechanism and provide compelling evidence for a putative cell surface receptor mediating their responses. Previous studies showed that mesangial cells in normal glucose catabolize cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans by an endosomal pathway that contains heparanase, which hydrolyzes the heparan sulfate chains (∼50 kDa) into fragments (5–10 kDa), and that a large proportion is recycled into the medium (5.Wang A.

Heparan sulfate chains with antimitogenic properties arise from mesangial cell-surface proteoglycans.Metabolism. 1999; 48: 1220-1229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These fragments bound to the surface of G0/G1 growth-arrested cells in normal glucose, but not to confluent cells, and inhibited serum-stimulated mitogenesis of mesangial cells. Further, the intact heparan sulfate chains isolated from the cell surface proteoglycans showed much less activity. Neither trypsin treatment, heating to 90 °C for 20 min, nor chondroitinase digestion had an effect on the ability of the heparan sulfate fragments to suppress thymidine incorporation in the stimulated cells, whereas nitrous acid degradation did. This supports the interpretation that the activity is a property of the heparan sulfate fragments themselves. The degradation of intact heparan sulfate chains by heparanase occurs by hydrolyzing bonds between hexuronate residues and GlcNS(6S) in the interspaced highly sulfated regions typical of heparan sulfate. Therefore, the heparan sulfate fragments contain the newly formed non-reducing ends with GlcNS(6S), which suggests that the highly sulfated non-reducing end with this motif is also critical for their binding activity to dividing mesangial cells. This is in keeping with the observation in this study that the highly sulfated trisaccharide with GlcNS(6S) at non-reducing ends of heparin is sufficient to induce the formation of the monocyte adhesive hyaluronan matrix. Heparin is the most highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan and has the most complex structure (see reviews in Refs. 25.Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Heparin or heparan sulfate–what is the difference?.Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 26.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Heparan sulfate: a piece of information.FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). After assembly of the backbone polymer, (glucuronic acid-β1,4-N-acetylglucosamine-α1,4-)n, on the serglycin core protein in mast cells, almost all of the N-acetyl residues are replaced to form N-sulfated glucosamines. A large majority of the glucuronic acid residues are then epimerized at the 5-carbon to form iduronic acid. Subsequent, or concurrent addition of sulfate occurs at the 2-carbon of the hexuronic acids, predominantly on the iduronic acid residues, and on the 6-carbon of the N-sulfated glucosamines. Antithrombin III and growth factors bind to selective sites within the heparin and heparan sulfate chains that are independent from the exposed non-reducing end motif identified in this study and that have substantially lower affinities for binding. In this study, we have found that the highly sulfated trisaccharide with GlcNS(6S) at non-reducing ends of heparin is sufficient to induce the formation of the extensive monocyte adhesive hyaluronan matrix after completing cell division, indicating that the receptor on the mesangial cells recognizes a motif different from ones for growth factors and antithrombin III binding.

The activity of these regulators is discussed in the context of the gene regulatory network proposed for the specification of the forebrain. The progressive specification of the forebrain (or of any other developing structure) depends on the synchronized activity of intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic signals, which form well integrated and hierarchically organized gene regulatory networks (GRNs). 3The abbreviations used are: GRNgene regulatory networkTFtranscription factorTFBSTF binding siteTRStrans-regulation screeningLucluciferaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationBSbinding siteEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinCREConserved Regulatory ElementDNdominant negativeBMPbone morphogenetic proteinCDScoding sequence. Perturbation of the GRN status causes abnormal development of the involved structure, which is also considered a mechanism that enables the acquisition of morphological innovations during evolution (1Davidson E.H.

Components of a GRN with a high hierarchical and central position are known as hubs. In general, hubs are transcription factors (TFs), which regulate the many other components of the network and which are, in turn, regulated by a relatively low number of genes (1Davidson E.H.

Six3 appears to regulate its own transcription with a context-dependent positive or negative feedback loop (25Suh C.S. Ellingsen S. Austbø L. Zhao X.F. Seo H.C. Fjose A.

Biol. 2007; 309: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that Six3 expression is restrained anteriorly by BMP-mediated Lmo4 activity (26McCollum C.W. Amin S.R. Pauerstein P. Lane M.E. A zebrafish LMO4 ortholog limits the size of the forebrain and eyes through negative regulation of six3b and rx3.Dev. Biol. 2007; 309: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and posteriorly by Wnt signaling (13Lagutin O.V. Zhu C.C. Kobayashi D. Topczewski J. Shimamura K. Puelles L. Russell H.R. McKinnon P.J. Solnica-Krezel L. Oliver G. Six3 repression of Wnt signaling in the anterior neuroectoderm is essential for vertebrate forebrain development.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In both cases, it is still unclear whether the mechanism is direct. Taking advantage of the identified cis-regulatory code and of available TF binding site (TFBS) prediction tools, we have recently demonstrated that the neural inducing factor Sox2 directly controls the expression of the medaka Six3.2 (21Beccari L. Conte I. Cisneros E. Bovolenta P. Sox2-mediated differential activation of Six3.2 contributes to forebrain patterning.Development. 2012; 139: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, in silico prediction of putative candidates has limitations because it depends on available TFBSs and does not account for transcriptional modifications imposed by the interaction with a given cofactor. Thus, to extend our search and generate a more comprehensive scenario of the relevant Six3 regulators, we have reinforced our in silico prediction approach with a trans-regulation screening (TRS). This screening is a systematic survey of potential regulators, which has already been successfully used to identify trans-acting factors of the medaka Ath5 (27Souren M. Martinez-Morales J.R. Makri P. Wittbrodt B. Wittbrodt J. A global survey identifies novel upstream components of the Ath5 neurogenic network.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R92Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and of the zebrafish eng2a genes (28Maurya A.K. Tan H. Souren M. Wang X. Wittbrodt J. Ingham P.W. Integration of Hedgehog and BMP signalling by the engrailed2a gene in the zebrafish myotome.Development. 2011; 138: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The latter study used a preselected version of the library enriched in characterized developmental regulators, thus improving the time/cost efficiency of the screening. By combining this mid-scale TRS with our in silico prediction-based approach over a well characterized cis-regulatory code (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we have identified a number of potential upstream regulators of the medaka Six3.2 gene, further improving the time/cost efficacy of the approach over previous studies (21Beccari L. Conte I. Cisneros E. Bovolenta P. Sox2-mediated differential activation of Six3.2 contributes to forebrain patterning.Development. 2012; 139: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Souren M. Martinez-Morales J.R.

These regulators were further validated with different combinations of expression pattern analysis, dose-response luciferase (Luc) assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and functional studies. Our results indicate that Msx2, Pbx1, and Pax6 are bona fide direct regulators of Six3.2 expression at early stages of medaka fish forebrain development and point to Tcf3, Etv4/5, Nkx2.2, Prdm1/Blimp1, and Vsx1 as additional TFs responsible for Six3.2 expression at different developmental stages. Wild type (WT) medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) of the Cab strain and the transgenic line Six3.2cI::EGFP, expressing the EGFP reporter under the control of the full-length Six3.2 regulatory region (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), were maintained in an in-house facility (28 °C on a 14/10-h light/dark cycle). Embryos were staged as described previously (29Iwamatsu T. Stages of normal development in the medaka Oryzias latipes.Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Sequences of the medaka, zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis) genomes were obtained from the USCS genome browser. Multiple alignments of the 4-kb regulatory region of the medaka Six3.2 gene (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were performed using the Mulan and mVista tools (Fig. 1A). Evolutionarily conserved TFBSs were identified combining rVista (multi-TF), Jaspar, and Matinspector. In some cases, we found BSs with partially overlapping sequences. When overlap was more than 80% and the BS belonged to closely related TFs, we considered the presence of only one BS. Candidates were further screened according to gene expression data available in the literature and in the following databases: GeneCards, OMIM, Emage, and zFIN. Candidate TFs were considered “related” if their expression was overlapping with or complementary to that of Six3.2. The distribution of these regulators was plotted along the Six3.2 regulatory region using GraphPad software (Fig. 1B and supplemental material), and these candidates were considered for subsequent experimental validation. Thus, relevant members of each one of the identified TF families were assayed in Luc assays (Table 1).TABLE 1In silico predicted candidates further tested in Luciferase assaysView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab For the TRS, the 4-kb regulatory region of the medaka Six3.2 gene, including the minimal promoter region and the 5′-UTR, was cloned into the pGL3b vector (Promega), carrying the firefly Luc gene to generate the pSix3.2-full reporter vector. Reporter constructs carrying different combinations of the Six3.2 cis-regulatory modules upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter in the pGL3b-TK vector (Fig. 2A) were used to validate in silico predicted candidates (21Beccari L. Conte I. Cisneros E. Bovolenta P. Sox2-mediated differential activation of Six3.2 contributes to forebrain patterning.Development. 2012; 139: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Information about the plasmids coding for the in silico-predicted candidate TFs used in the Luc assays is available upon request. The Tcf3-HA-VP16 and Tcf3-HA-En were kindly provided by Dr. E. Marti. Modified versions of the pCS2 plasmid, carrying either the HA-Eng or the HA-VP16 proteins, were generated to obtain constitutive repressive or activating forms of the TFs and then used for mRNA transcription and injection experiments. To this end, the HA-VP16 or the HA-Eng cassettes were amplified with PCR-specific primers and cloned into the pCS2+ vector using specific restriction enzymes. The CDS of the different TFs was subsequently amplified with specific primers and subcloned either in the pCS2-HA-En (Pbx1, Pax6) or pCS2-HA-VP16 (Msx2). Deletions of the Pax BS present in the D elements were produced by PCR amplification using the Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and PCR-specific primers. The obtained PCR product was subsequently purified, treated with the polynucleotide kinase, self-ligated using the T4 DNA ligase, and transformed in DH5a-competent cells. The TRS was performed as previously described (27Souren M. Martinez-Morales J.R. Makri P. Wittbrodt B. Wittbrodt J. A global survey identifies novel upstream components of the Ath5 neurogenic network.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R92Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, we individually tested 1064 clones (supplemental material) belonging to a Unigene library enriched in genes considered as “developmental regulators.” BHK21 cells seeded in 96-well plates were co-transfected with 2 μl (10–300 ng) of each cDNA, 40 ng of the pSix3.2-full reporter vector, and 5 ng of pRL-CMV using the Fugene 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured and transfected with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The quality threshold was set above 1,000 relative units for Renilla luminescence and above 10 times the background signal (10 raw units) for firefly luminescence. Clones that activate the reporters with lower values were discarded. Raw luminescence readings were stored in a FileMaker database. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the median values were normalized and analyzed using MS Excel. To account for plate-to-plate variations, each firefly/Renilla ratio was normalized against the average of all ratios in the plate as described (27Souren M. Martinez-Morales J.R. Makri P. Wittbrodt B. Wittbrodt J. A global survey identifies novel upstream components of the Ath5 neurogenic network.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R92Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the average values of this ratio among plates (supplemental material), supporting the reproducibility and robustness of this approach. Selected candidate clones were further tested in a dose-response Luc assay performed in triplicate by co-transfecting 20, 40, 80, or 160 ng of pCMV-Sport6.1::cDNA with the reporter and constructs. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding the necessary amount of pCS2+ vector. Dose-response experiments were performed with both CMV- and SV40-driven Renilla vectors to discard clones with a possible off-target effect on the Renilla promoter and to avoid the influence of possible difference in the expression efficiency of the different plasmids. Each clone and dose was assayed in triplicate, and the firefly/Renilla ratio was statistically compared using an appropriate t test. Clones were considered positives when at least one of the tested doses induced a response at least 75% higher (activation) or 50% lower (repression) than that observed with the dose of 20 ng (supplemental material). Clones were also considered positive if the firefly/Renilla ratio at 20 ng was significantly different from the average value of the other clones at the same dose, independently of their dose response. Luc assays were performed using the undifferentiated and pluripotent P19 teratocarcinoma line cultured in minimum Eagle's medium α with Glutamax (Gibco). Cells were transfected with 310 ng of DNA/well composed of the reporter plasmid (pSix3.2-cI-cVI, 50 ng), a CMV-driven Renilla Luc control vector (pRL-CMV; 10 ng), increasing amounts (25–250 ng) of the effector plasmid, and, when needed, variable amounts of the empty vector to kept the total amount of the transfected DNA constant. Transfections were performed with Fugene HD, following the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize possible bias imposed by differences in the expression level of the various plasmids, we normalized the reporter luciferase activity to a control Renilla reporter and then to the basal activity of the reporter construct when co-transfected with GFP. After normalization, the raw values of basal activity of the cI-cVI constructs were statistically indistinguishable and quite reproducible among experiments (data not shown). Cells were maintained in the same medium containing 5% FCS for an additional 48 h, when the Luc activity was measured using the Dual Luc reporter assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated at least three times. Data are presented as -fold induction of the Luc activity observed in the control vector normalized to 1. ChIPs were performed as described (21Beccari L. Conte I. Cisneros E. Bovolenta P. Sox2-mediated differential activation of Six3.2 contributes to forebrain patterning.Development. 2012; 139: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using a Myc- or HA-tagged version of the selected candidate genes. Briefly, P19 cells were transfected with reporter/effector plasmids (3:1 ratio, 10 μg total). ChIP was performed using the anti-Myc 9E10 (Sigma) or the anti-HA 3B9 (Active Motif) monoclonal antibody. The relative enrichment of each one of the Six3.2 regulatory elements was determined by quantitative PCR (Roche Applied Science) using specific primers (information available upon request). Primers designed in the Luc coding sequence and in the genomic locus of the 18S RNA were used as negative controls. -Fold enrichment was expressed as the ratio of Myc to IgG signal and calculated with the expression, 2−(ΔΔCt), where ΔΔCt = Ctc-Myc − CtIgG. The mRNA used in overexpression experiments were synthesized with mMESSAGE mMACHINE kits (Ambion) and co-injected with the RFP reporter (10 ng/μl) into one-cell stage Six3.2-cI::EGFP transgenic embryos at concentrations ranging from 30 to 100 ng/μl for each one of the tested mRNA. Within this range, we selected the best working concentration as that which gave the most evident phenotype without affecting embryo survival. Changes in Six3.2 expression were determined by in situ hybridization (see below) and EGFP reporter expression using a Leica fluorescent stereomicroscope. We injected and analyzed a minimum of 30 to a maximum of 250 embryos for each one of the tested mRNAs. Antisense riboprobes for the identified candidates were synthesized from the pCMV-Sport6 clone containing the full-length mRNAs according to standard protocols. Probes for the medaka Tcf3, Etv4, Etv5, and Msx2a genes were amplified by PCR using specific primers (information available upon request) and cloned into the pSCA-Strataclone vector (Stratagene). The Six3.2 probe used in this study is as described (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In situ hybridizations were performed as described (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The regulatory region sufficient to recapitulate the entire spatio-temporal expression of the medaka Six3.2 gene is composed of 10 conserved regulatory elements (CREs) distributed in a 4-kb region located upstream of the coding region (Fig. 1, A and B) (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two of these CREs, known as D and IL elements, act like enhancers during early and late forebrain development, respectively (23Conte I. Bovolenta P. Comprehensive characterization of the cis-regulatory code responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the developing medaka forebrain.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The A element instead silences Six3.2 expression in the hindbrain and neural tube, whereas the E, F, G, and H elements modulate D or IL function (23Conte I. Bovolenta P.
