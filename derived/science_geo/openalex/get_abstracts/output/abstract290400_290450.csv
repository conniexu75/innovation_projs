https://openalex.org/W2065686858,"Majorite is a new garnet in a veinlet of the Coorara meteorite. Its chemical composition is compatible with derivation mostly from original pyroxene, not from olivine as originally reported. Silicon is partly in sixfold coordination. Ringwoodite, a spinel of olivine composition, occurs as purple grains set in a matrix of fine-grained garnet. The similar mineralogy and texture of the Coorara and Tenham meteorites suggest a common parent body."
https://openalex.org/W4237877885,"Phosphorus, the element itself, becomes superconducting near 4.7 degrees K and at pressures exceeding 100 kilobars. This constitutes one of the four last missing links in the proof that superconductivity is normal behavior for every truly metallic sp element. The three remaining ones are arsenic, sulfur, and iodine."

https://openalex.org/W1967754046,"A layered, basic igneous intrusion, analogous in mineralogy and texture to certain large, continental layered complexes, is exposed in the Romanche Fracture, equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Crustal intrusion of large masses of basic magmas with their subsequent gravity differentiation is probably one of a number of major processes involved in the formation of new oceanic crust during sea-floor spreading."
https://openalex.org/W4247160711,"The generalized isotopic paleotemperature curve reproduces absolute temperatures to within 1 degrees C; it closely reflects faunal changes; and its time scale is correct to within a very few percent back to at least 175,000 years. The average oxygen isotopic composition of the North American and European ice caps was about -9 per mil."
https://openalex.org/W2058672075,"A rocket-borne photometer has detected far ultraviolet night glow radiations that are identified as Lyman-beta (HI 1026 angstroms), and the helium lines at 304 or 584 angstroms, or at both. At an altitude of 227 kilometers the measured intensity for Lyman-beta was about 10 rayleighs. The discrimination characteristics of the broad-band helium radiation filter give helium line intensities, at 227 kilometers, of 4.8 and 12 rayleighs, respectively, pending identification of the wavelength of the radiation as 304 or 584 angstroms. These ultraviolet radiations appear sufficient to maintain the night E and F(1) regions of the ionosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2042770073,"More precise and comprehensive analytical results for lunar surface material in a terra region have been derived from the data of the alpha-scattering experiment on Surveyor 7. The silicon content and the low sodium abundance are close to that of mare material. The abundances of titanium and iron are at least a factor of 2 lower, whereas the abundances of aluminum and calcium are significantly higher. The analytical results provide direct evidence for chemical differentiation in the moon and indicate a lunar crust of appreciably lower density than the whole moon and with lower density and higher albedo than lunar mare material."
https://openalex.org/W1998929175,Lower Paleozoic data now available for all the southern continents enable a unique reconstruction of Gondwanaland to be determined from paleomagnetic measurements alone. This reconstruction is corroborated by the computerized fit of the continental shelves and the matching of geological age provinces.
https://openalex.org/W1985468036,"The Venus radius of 6085 +/- 10 kilometers, deduced from combining observations made with the Venera 4 and Mariner V space probes is incompatible with the value of 6050 +/- kilometers determined from Earth-based radar mesurements."
https://openalex.org/W1969571399,"Membrane-limited inclusions were found in the cytoplasm of cells of the rectal mucosa, leukocytes, and cultured fibroblasts from two humans with cystinosis. Most of the inclusions contained amorphous material, presumably cystine. In cells of the rectal mucosa the material appeared frequently crystallized. This was rarely seen in leukocytes, and never in cultured fibroblasts. The fact that acid phosphatase could be demonstrated consistently in the organelles responsible for sequestration of cystine indicates that they are lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2018905405,The radius of Venus has been determined from radar-range data taken at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Goldstone facility. A simultaneous intergration of the equations of motion of the solar-system fit to this time-delay data gave a value of 6053.7 +/- 2.2 kilometers. A discussion of other Venusian radius determinations is made.

https://openalex.org/W2121598841,"Analysis of an image of Phobos on Mariner 7 frame 7F91 indicates that the martian satellite is larger and has a darker surface than had previously been thought. The limb profile measures 18 by 22 kilometers and is elongated along the orbital plane. Phobos has an average visual geometric albedo of 0.065 lower than that known for any other body in the solar system. It seems probable that Phobos did not form by accretion around primordial Mars, but was captured at some later time."
https://openalex.org/W2010967634,"During the growth of embryonic droplets in an imperfect vapor the surface polar molecules pass from a disordered orientation state to an ordered orientation state, the transition size being on the order of 100 molecules. This transition poses an interesting model problem in the study of order-disorder transitions in the thermodynamics of small systems."

https://openalex.org/W2011044015,Concentration-gradient-driven convection was studied by measurement of the rate of dissolution of the lower face of a KCl single crystal in contact with various solvents. The rate of mass transfer due to convective stirring appeared to follow the Rayleigh number to the one-third power law. A regular pattern of etch pits due to the convective stirring action was observed in the crystal face after exposure to water for 5 minutes. Schlieren photographs of the early stages of dissolution showed a regular pattern of spikes having approximately the same dimensions as the etch pits in the crystals.
https://openalex.org/W2018991831,"Both pentaploid and haploid cells were observed in a short-term culture of bone marrow of a diploid-triploid frog chimera. Apparently, diploid and triploid marrow cells fused to form ""hybrid"" pentaploid cells, which subsequently gave rise by somatic reduction to haploid daughter cells. The hybrid marrow cells and their haploid segregants are presumably at a selective disadvantage, as neither type of cell has been detected in the circulating blood of chimeric frogs."
https://openalex.org/W1971772991,"THE IMPORTANCE OF LUBRICATED FRICTION OF RUBBER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY OBVIOUS IN THE PAST DECADE AS DRIVING SPEEDS HAVE INCREASED. FRICTION OF RUBBER ON WET SURFACES IS DETERMINED ENTIRELY BY ENERGY LOSSES IN THE RUBBER THAT ARE PRODUCED BY ITS DEFORMATION BY THE HARD SURFACE OVER WHICH IT SLIDES. IT APPEARS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN ABSOLUTE VALUES FOR FRICTION COEFFICIENTS OF RUBBER ON HARD SURFACES, BY MEANS OF APPROPRIATE LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS ON THE RUBBER AND THE SURFACE. ABRASIVE AND DEFORMATION CONTRIBUTIONS TO FRICTION ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE MAGNITUDE AND CHARACTERISTIC FREQUENCY OF THE DISTORTION OF THE RUBBER. ON THE BASIS OF THE SIMPLE HYPOTHESIS THAT ABRASIVE AND DEFORMATION COMPONENTS EXIST IN THE ROAD SURFACE AND THAT PROPERTIES OF THE RUBBER RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO THESE TWO TYPES OF COMPONENTS, IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO DEVISE A SIMPLE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING THE PROPERTIES OF ROADS. SLIPPERINESS IS ACCOMPANIED, FOR THE MOST PART, BY A LACK OF ABRASIVE COMPONENT IN THE ROAD SURFACE. HYSTERESIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LUBRICATED FRICTION, BUT TESTS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF RUBBER SPECIMENS OF DIFFERENT COMPOSITION SHOW THAT NOT ONLY HYSTERESIS BUT ALSO MODULUS OF ELASTICITY DETERMINES THE FRICTION COEFFICIENT OF A RUBBER SPECIMEN ON A HARD SURFACE. THE WAY IN WHICH MODULUS ENTERS INTO FRICTION IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR. /AUTHOR/"
