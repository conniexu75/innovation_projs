Nagasawa et al. show that such gaze-mediated bonding also exists between us and our closest animal companions, dogs (see the Perspective by MacLean and Hare). They found that mutual gazing increased oxytocin levels, and sniffing oxytocin increased gazing in dogs, an effect that transferred to their owners. Wolves, who rarely engage in eye contact with their human handlers, seem resistant to this effect. Science , this issue p. 333 ; see also p. 280"

Fibroblasts are known to be involved, but their role is poorly characterized. Rinkevich et al. identify two lineages of dermal fibroblasts in the dorsal skin of mice (see the Perspective by Sennett and Rendl). A fibrogenic lineage, defined by embryonic expression of Engrailed-1 , plays a central role in dermal development, wound healing, radiation-induced fibrosis, and cancer stroma formation. Targeted inhibition of this lineage results in reduced melanoma growth and scar formation, with no effect on the structural integrity of the healed skin, thus indicating therapeutic approaches for treating fibrotic disease.

The polarization is usually not uniform throughout the material, and for nanosized ferroelectrics, polarization can be quite complex. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, Tang et al. found that in thin films of the ferroelectric PbTiO 3 , the polarization vector rotated in space, forming a closed loop, the so-called flux closure. The flux closure structures formed an array, with the period dependent on the width of the thin film, and caused the buildup of considerable strain within the crystal lattice of the material Science, this issue p. 547"

Key manifestations of D&A include: physical abuse, non-consented care, non-confidential care, non-dignified care, discrimination, abandonment, and detention in facilities. This paper describes manifestations of D&A experienced in Kenya and measures their prevalence. Methods This paper is based on baseline data collected during a before-and-after study designed to measure the effect of a package of interventions to reduce the prevalence of D&A experienced by women during labor and delivery in thirteen Kenyan health facilities. Data were collected through an exit survey of 641 women discharged from postnatal wards. We present percentages of D&A manifestations and odds ratios of its relationship with demographic characteristics using a multivariate fixed effects logistic regression model. Results Twenty percent of women reported any form of D&A. Manifestations of D&A includes: non-confidential care (8.5%), non-dignified care (18%), neglect or abandonment (14.3%), Non-consensual care (4.3%) physical abuse (4.2%) and, detainment for non-payment of fees (8.1). Women aged 20-29 years were less likely to experience non-confidential care compared to those under 19; OR: [0.6 95% CI (0.36, 0.90); p=0.017]. Clients with no companion during delivery were less likely to experience inappropriate demands for payment; OR: [0.49 (0.26, 0.95); p=0.037]; while women with higher parities were three times more likely to be detained for lack of payment and five times more likely to be bribed compared to those experiencing there first birth. Conclusion One out of five women experienced feeling humiliated during labor and delivery. Six categories of D&A during childbirth in Kenya were reported. Understanding the prevalence of D&A is critical in developing interventions at national, health facility and community levels to address the factors and drivers that influence D&A in facilities and to encourage clients’ future facility utilization."

https://openalex.org/W2093438876,"Background There is evidence that physical activity (PA) is of cognitive benefit to the ageing brain, but little is known on the effect in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The present pilot study assessed the effect of a home-based PA training on clinical symptoms, functional abilities, and caregiver burden after 12 and 24 weeks. Methods In an RCT thirty patients (aged 72.4±4.3 years) with AD (MMSE: 20.6±6.5 points) and their family caregivers were allocated to a home-based 12-week PA intervention program or the usual care group. The program changed between passive, motor-assisted or active resistive leg training and changes in direction on a movement trainer in order to combine physical and cognitive stimuli. Results Analysis of activities of daily living in the patients (ADCS ADL total score) revealed a significant group × time interaction effect (95% CI of the difference between both groups at T2: 5.01–10.51). The control group experienced decreases in ADL performance at week 12 and 24 whereas patients in the intervention group remained stable. Analyses of executive function and language ability revealed considerable effects for semantic word fluency with a group × time interaction (95% CI of the difference between both groups at T2: 0.18–4.02). Patients in the intervention group improved during the intervention and returned to initial performance at week 12 whereas the controls revealed continuous worsening. Analyses of reaction time, hand-eye quickness and attention revealed improvement only in the intervention group. Caregiver burden remained stable in the intervention group but worsened in the control group. Conclusions This study suggests that PA in a home-based setting might be an effective and intrinsically attractive way to promote PA training in AD and modulate caregiver burden. The results demonstrate transfer benefits to ADL, cognitive and physical skill in patients with AD. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02196545"

https://openalex.org/W2031475382,"Target of rapamycin is a Ser/Thr kinase that operates in two conserved multiprotein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. Unlike TORC1, TORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin, and its functional characterization is less advanced. Previous genetic studies demonstrated that TORC2 depletion leads to loss of actin polarization and loss of endocytosis. To determine how TORC2 regulates these readouts, we engineered a yeast strain in which TORC2 can be specifically and acutely inhibited by the imidazoquinoline NVP-BHS345. Kinetic analyses following inhibition of TORC2, supported with quantitative phosphoproteomics, revealed that TORC2 regulates these readouts via distinct pathways as follows: rapidly through direct protein phosphorylation cascades and slowly through indirect changes in the tensile properties of the plasma membrane. The rapid signaling events are mediated in large part through the phospholipid flippase kinases Fpk1 and Fpk2, whereas the slow signaling pathway involves increased plasma membrane tension resulting from a gradual depletion of sphingolipids. Additional hits in our phosphoproteomic screens highlight the intricate control TORC2 exerts over diverse aspects of eukaryote cell physiology.

Lacking a specific small molecule inhibitor, it has been more challenging to characterize the effectors downstream of TORC2.

Although these studies represent a significant increase in our understanding of the mTOR-dependent phosphoproteome, coverage is an issue, and it remains a challenge to partition these phosphorylation events downstream of mTORC1 versus mTORC2. Dissection of the TORC2 function in S. cerevisiae has relied heavily on the use of temperature-sensitive alleles of TOR2 or genes encoding other essential components of TORC2. These tools led to the discovery that Ypk1 and Ypk2, a pair of AGC family Ser/Thr kinases, are the essential substrates of TORC2 (17.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S.

However, temperature-sensitive and other conditional alleles (e.g. gene expression driven by glucose-repressible promoters) are not optimal tools to probe TORC2 functions as environmental stresses, including temperature shifts and changes in carbon source per se, affect TORC2 activity and thus complicate interpretation of observations made from these experimental paradigms (27.Sun Y.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5851-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). TORC2 regulates SPT activity via phosphorylation of threonine 662 embedded in a hydrophobic motif at the C terminus of Ypk1 (18.Niles B.J. Mogri H. Hill A. Vlahakis A. Powers T. Plasma membrane recruitment and activation of the AGC kinase Ypk1 is mediated by target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) and its effector proteins Slm1 and Slm2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which promotes Ypk1 kinase activity and additionally serves as a convenient proxy to monitor TORC2 activity (28.Berchtold D. Piccolis M. Chiaruttini N. Riezman I. Riezman H. Roux A. Walther T.C. Loewith R. Plasma membrane stress induces relocalization of Slm proteins and activation of TORC2 to promote sphingolipid synthesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ypk1 in turn regulates SPT by phosphorylating Orm1 (on serines 51–53) and Orm2 (on serines 46–48) that antagonize their ability to inhibit SPT (24.Roelants F.M. Breslow D.K. Muir A. Weissman J.S. Thorner J. Protein kinase Ypk1 phosphorylates regulatory proteins Orm1 and Orm2 to control sphingolipid homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Orm family proteins mediate sphingolipid homeostasis.Nature. 2010; 463: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition to being structural components of membranes, sphingolipids are thought to function as signal transducers (35.Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Principles of bioactive lipid signalling: lessons from sphingolipids.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is considerable literature describing roles for these lipids in the regulation of various cellular functions in yeast, including actin organization and endocytosis (36.Friant S. Zanolari B. Riezman H. Increased protein kinase or decreased PP2A activity bypasses sphingoid base requirement in endocytosis.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2834-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37.Zanolari B. Friant S.

Sphingoid base synthesis requirement for endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), particularly in response to acute heat stress. Given the role of TORC2 upstream of sphingolipid biosynthesis, and the proposed functions of sphingolipids in actin organization and endocytosis, one might hypothesize that TORC2 regulates at least some of its distal effectors via its influence on sphingolipid levels. Like sphingolipids, phospholipids also affect many functions in a cell (38.Sebastian T.T. Baldridge R.D. Xu P. Graham T.R. Phospholipid flippases: building asymmetric membranes and transport vesicles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and are downstream targets of TORC2/Ypk1. Specifically, Ypk1 was recently shown to phosphorylate and inhibit the flippase protein kinase Fpk1 and its paralog Fpk2 (39.Roelants F.M. Baltz A.G. Trott A.E. Fereres S. Thorner J. A protein kinase network regulates the function of aminophospholipid flippases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fpks are activators of aminophospholipid flippases Dnf1 and Dnf2 (Drs2 Neo1 family) that regulate phospholipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane. Additional targets of Fpks are suspected but have not yet been reported (40.Nakano K. Yamamoto T. Kishimoto T. Noji T. Tanaka K. Protein kinases Fpk1p and Fpk2p are novel regulators of phospholipid asymmetry.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1783-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we wished to understand better how TORC2/Ypk1 regulates actin polarization and endocytosis. Specifically, we wished to determine whether these processes are directly targeted through phosphorylation events or are indirectly regulated through lipid messengers. To address this problem, we employed a reverse chemical genetic approach where we engineered TORC1 to be resistant to the ATP-competitive small molecule TOR inhibitor NVP-BHS345. Addition of NVP-BHS345 to these cells triggered a specific and acute inhibition of TORC2. Our subsequent observations indicate that TORC2 regulates actin polarization and endocytosis via distinct pathways involving the following: (i) the Fpks; (ii) Fpk-independent phosphorylation of proteins involved in endocytosis; and (iii) slower effects due to changes in membrane tension.

https://openalex.org/W2089506194,"Glucose-induced augmented vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production is a key event in diabetic retinopathy. We have previously demonstrated that downregulation of miR-200b increases VEGF, mediating structural and functional changes in the retina in diabetes. However, mechanisms regulating miR-200b in diabetes are not known. Histone methyltransferase complex, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), has been shown to repress miRNAs in neoplastic process. We hypothesized that, in diabetes, PRC2 represses miR-200b through its histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation mark. We show that human retinal microvascular endothelial cells exposed to high levels of glucose regulate miR-200b repression through histone methylation and that inhibition of PRC2 increases miR-200b while reducing VEGF. Furthermore, retinal tissue from animal models of diabetes showed increased expression of major PRC2 components, demonstrating in vivo relevance. This research established a repressive relationship between PRC2 and miR-200b, providing evidence of a novel mechanism of miRNA regulation through histone methylation."

SERCA activity in muscle can be regulated by phospholamban (PLB), an affinity modulator, and sarcolipin (SLN), an uncoupler. Although PLB gets dislodged from Ca2+-bound SERCA, SLN continues to bind SERCA throughout its kinetic cycle and promotes uncoupling of Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis. To determine the structural regions of SLN that mediate uncoupling of SERCA, we employed mutagenesis and generated chimeras of PLB and SLN. In this study we demonstrate that deletion of SLN N-terminal residues 2ERSTQ leads to loss of the uncoupling function even though the truncated peptide can target and constitutively bind SERCA. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of SLN and SERCA interaction showed a rearrangement of SERCA residues that is altered when the SLN N terminus is deleted.

Further introduction of the PLB TM region into this chimera resulted in conversion to full PLB-like function.

Our studies revealed that mice lacking SLN were unable to maintain body temperature when exposed to cold but could be rescued by re-expression of SLN. Additionally the SLN−/− mice developed obesity when fed a high fat diet suggesting SLN regulation of SERCA activity contributes to whole body energy metabolism (4.Bal N.C. Maurya S.K. Sopariwala D.H.

However, the mechanistic details of how SLN binding promotes uncoupling of SERCA resulting in heat production are unclear. Thus a major interest of our current research is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the SLN-SERCA interaction. Toward this goal we have developed a SLN and SERCA expression system in HEK cells and employed chemical cross-linking, SERCA ATP hydrolysis, and Ca2+ uptake assays to investigate how SLN interacts with SERCA during Ca2+ transport. Using this approach we recently showed that monomeric SLN binds to SERCA directly and the nature of SLN interaction with SERCA differs significantly from PLB (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H.

A novel finding of this study was that although increasing the Ca2+ concentration reduced the interaction between SERCA and SLN, it did not abolish the interaction. Interestingly, SLN was also able to bind to SERCA in the Ca2+-bound, phosphoenzyme conformation of the pump, E1P. In contrast, PLB binds to SERCA only in the Ca2+-free E2 state of the pump (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C. Periasamy M.

These studies highlighted a key difference between SLN and PLB: that only SLN can bind to SERCA during Ca2+ transport and this unique property of SLN leads to uncoupling of SERCA. Despite these findings, the detailed mechanism of how SLN binding to SERCA promotes uncoupling of the pump and causes release of Ca2+ back to the cytosol is yet to be understood. To date, attention has been focused on the C-terminal tail of SLN as the regulator of SERCA activity (19.Hughes E. Clayton J.C. Kitmitto A. Esmann M. Middleton D.A.

Furthermore, recent x-ray crystallographic studies on co-crystals of SERCA-SLN and SERCA-PLB have added valuable information about the interaction of monomeric PLB or SLN with SERCA (22.Winther A.M.

However, these crystal structures were unable to identify where the N terminus of SLN or PLB interact with SERCA, due to the dynamic nature of the N terminus. Previous studies have found that the N-terminal domain of PLB is critical for the modulation of SERCA pump function (25.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H.

The most conspicuous structural differences between SLN and PLB lie in their N- and C-terminal regions, which may dictate their functional differences in SERCA regulation. Therefore, a major objective of this study was to investigate the structural regions of SLN necessary for interaction and uncoupling of SERCA. We especially investigated whether the N terminus regulates the uncoupling function of SLN. In the present study we generated chimeras by swapping SLN and PLB domains to test the specific function of each. Our studies for the first time demonstrate that the N terminus of SLN plays an important role in its uncoupling action on SERCA. Lipofectamine, DMEM, and other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The cross-linking reagent 1,6-bismaleimidohexane was purchased from Pierce (Thermo Scientific). Thapsigargin, sodium orthovanadate, AlCl3, and KOH were purchased from Sigma. 45CaCl2 was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The SLN, PLB, and SERCA constructs were generated by PCR amplification and cloning into pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector as reported previously (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C.

The rat SERCA1 cDNA sequence that has 99% homology with mouse SERCA1 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Mouse SLN and PLB cDNAs were PCR amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The desired mutagenesis of rat SERCA1, mouse SLN, and mouse PLB were done using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). All cDNA clones and mutated constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. We have previously shown that E7C SLN and N30C PLB are similar in function to WT SLN and WT PLB (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C. Periasamy M.

The mutants E7C SLN and N30C PLB were used in this study as native SLN and PLB, and also to generate all chimeras to enable cross-linking with SERCA at Cys318 (hence, E7C SLN and N30C PLB will be denoted as SLN and PLB throughout this text for simplicity, as shown in Fig. 1, A and B). Residues 2–6 of SLN were deleted to make the SLNNTdel mutant. The SLN N terminus (SLN residues 1–7) was replaced with the PLB N-terminal domain (PLB residues 1–30) to make Chimera-1. The last three residues (MLL) in the C-terminal of PLB were replaced with SLN C-terminal tail residues, RSYQY to obtain Chimera-2. The length of PLB TM was kept intact to prevent possible mis-localization of PLB (28.Butler J. Lee A.G. Wilson D.I. Spalluto C. Hanley N.A. East J.M. Phospholamban and sarcolipin are maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum by retrieval from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment.Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as well as to ensure ideal interaction of RSYQY with SERCA. The N-terminal residues 1–30 of Chimera-2 were replaced with residues 1–7 of SLN to get Chimera-3 (Fig. 1, A and B). We further mutagenized residues 3RS to AA, 5TQ to AA, as well as 3RSTQ to AAAA to obtain N-terminal alanine mutants of SLN. Protein expression of the chimeras was determined using the SLN antibody, which detects the C-terminal RSYQY sequence of SLN. PLB expression was determined by PLB antibody, which recognizes residues 2–13 of PLB N-terminal domain. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with SERCA and SLN or PLB cDNAs at a 1:2 ratio, using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were harvested in PBS 48 h post-transfection and the pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Microsomes from transfected cells were prepared as described previously (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C. Periasamy M.

Oxalate-supported Ca2+ uptake assay was performed to determine the effect of SLN, PLB, or their mutants on SERCA-mediated Ca2+ transport. The proteins were expressed in HEK cells by transfection of DNA using Lipofectamine (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C. Periasamy M.

HEK homogenates were incubated in Ca2+ uptake buffer with the desired free Ca2+ level as determined by Maxchelator webware. Aliquots of the reaction were collected and filtered at 30, 60, and 90 s.

The reaction was initiated by addition of 5 μg of microsomes in the Ca2+ uptake buffer and samples were collected at the end of 30 min. The amount of Pi release was calculated as nanomole of Pi/mg/min. Values of reactions carried out in the presence of thapsigargin (TG), a SERCA inhibitor, were subtracted from all samples to obtain SERCA specific activity (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H.

The SERCA protein level in the samples was normalized to that in the control to obtain the final absolute activity values. The final values were expressed as a percentage of the maximum control SERCA activity. Activity curves with n = at least 3 measurements were generated using sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting in the GraphPad Prism 6 software to get the best-fit values ± S.E. Analysis of data were done using ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. Chemical cross-linking of proteins was performed using the 10-Å homo-bifunctional sulfhydryl cross-linker, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane, as previously described (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H.

Briefly, 15 μg of microsomes were mixed with 3 mm ATP in cross-linking buffer followed by addition of 0.1 mm cross-linker. The reaction was stopped after incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Specific cross-linking of SLN, SLNNTdel, Chimera-1, and Chimera-3 to SERCA showed a band above 110 kDa probed with anti-SLN antibody, whereas PLB or the Chimera-2 interaction with SERCA showed a 116-kDa band probed with anti-PLB antibody. The effect of TG was studied by adding 0–10 μm TG to the reaction mixture without Ca2+, in the presence of ATP, before the addition of cross-linker (3.Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C.

Stable analogs of the major intermediates of SERCA kinetic steps (E2, E1, E1PCa2·ADP, and E2P) were obtained by incubating microsomes in a cross-linking reaction buffer for 45 min at 25 °C with different chemicals, before addition of 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (3.Sahoo S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2026231131,"Galectin-2 is a monocyte-expressed carbohydrate-binding lectin, for which increased expression is genetically determined and associated with decreased collateral arteriogenesis in obstructive coronary artery disease patients. The inhibiting effect of galectin-2 on arteriogenesis was confirmed in vivo, but the mechanism is largely unknown. In this study we aimed to explore the effects of galectin-2 on monocyte/macrophage phenotype in vitro and vivo, and to identify the receptor by which galectin-2 exerts these effects. We now show that the binding of galectin-2 to different circulating human monocyte subsets is dependent on monocyte surface expression levels of CD14. The high affinity binding is blocked by an anti-CD14 antibody but not by carbohydrates, indicating a specific protein-protein interaction. Galectin-2 binding to human monocytes modulated their transcriptome by inducing proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting pro-arteriogenic factors, while attenuating monocyte migration. Using specific knock-out mice, we show that galectin-2 acts through the CD14/toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 pathway. Furthermore, galectin-2 skews human macrophages to a M1-like proinflammatory phenotype, characterized by a reduced motility and expression of an anti-arteriogenic cytokine/growth factor repertoire. This is accompanied by a switch in surface protein expression to CD40-high and CD206-low (M1). In a murine model we show that galectin-2 administration, known to attenuate arteriogenesis, leads to increased numbers of CD40-positive (M1) and reduced numbers of CD206-positive (M2) macrophages surrounding actively remodeling collateral arteries. In conclusion galectin-2 is the first endogenous CD14/TLR4 ligand that induces a proinflammatory, non-arteriogenic phenotype in monocytes/macrophages. Interference with CD14-Galectin-2 interaction may provide a new intervention strategy to stimulate growth of collateral arteries in genetically compromised cardiovascular patients."
https://openalex.org/W2040366195,"Background Parkinson’s disease patients are more likely to be hospitalized, have higher rates of hospital complications, and have an increased risk of deterioration during hospitalization. Length of stay is an important underlying factor for these increased risks. We aimed to investigate potential medication errors that may occur during hospitalization and its impact on length of hospital stay. Methods A cross-sectional chart review of 339 consecutive hospital encounters from 212 PD subjects was performed. Medication errors were defined as wrong timing or omission of administration for dopaminergic drugs and administration of contraindicated dopamine blockers. An analysis of covariance was applied to examine whether these medication errors were related to increased length of hospital stays. Results A significant effect for dopaminergic administration (p<0.01) on length of hospital stay was observed. Subjects who had delayed administration or missed at least one dose stayed longer (M=8.2 days, SD=8.9 vs. M=3.6 days SD=3.4). Contraindicated dopamine blocking agents were administered in 23% (71/339) of cases, and this was also significantly related to an increased length of stay (M=8.2 days, SD=8.9 vs. M=3.6 days SD=3.4), p<0.05. Participants who received a contraindicated dopamine blocker stayed in the hospital longer (M=7.5 days, SD=9.1) compared to those who did not (M=5.9 days, SD=6.8). Neurologists were consulted in 24.5% of encounters. Specialty consultation had no effect on the medication related errors. Conclusions Missing dopaminergic dosages and administration of dopamine blockers occur frequently in hospitalized Parkinson’s disease patients and this may impact length of stay. These potentially modifiable factors may reduce the risk of a longer stay related to hospitalization."

https://openalex.org/W2095407765,"Cre-recombinase mediated conditional deletion of Lox-P site flanked (""floxed"") genes is widely used for functional gene annotation in mice. Many different Cre-transgenic mouse lines have been developed for cell-type specific gene disruption. But often, the precise tissue-patterns of Cre activity remain incompletely characterized. Two widely used transgenes for conditional gene recombination in hematopoietic cells are Vav-iCre driven from the murine Vav1 promotor, and hCD2-iCre driven from the human CD2 promotor. Vav-iCre expresses active Cre in fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells and all descendants, hCD2-iCre in immature and mature B and T lymphocytes. To better characterize which hematopoietic cells contain hCD2-iCre activity, we compared EYFP fluorescence in hCD2-iCre+/- R26-stop-EYFP+/- and Vav-iCre+/- R26-stop-EYFP+/- mice. R26-stop-EYFP ubiquitously encodes EYFP preceded by a floxed stop cassette. By removing it, Cre activity induces measurable EYFP expression. Our results confirm the known activity patterns for both Cre transgenes and unveil additional hCD2-iCre mediated reporter gene recombination in common lymphoid progenitors, in natural killer cells and their progenitors, and in plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells. This supports previously proposed common lymphoid origins for natural killer cells and subsets of dendritic cells, and indicates the need to consider pleiotropic effects when studying hCD2-iCre mediated conditional knockout mice. Vav-iCre+/- R26-stop-EYFP+/- mice did not show the non-hematopoietic recombination in vascular endothelial cells seen in other Vav-Cre mouse lines, but displayed an unexpected Vav-iCre mediated recombination in a bone cell subset lacking hematopoietic markers. This pinpoints the need to consider stromal cell contributions to phenotypes of Vav-iCre mediated conditional knockout mice. Altogether, our data provide the first detailed assessment of hCD2-iCre and Vav-iCre mediated deletion of floxed genes during lymphocyte development from hematopoietic stem cells and open up novel applications for either Cre-transgenic mouse line."

CDT leads to the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton and, eventually, to cell death. Low doses of CDT result in the formation of microtubule-based protrusions on the cell surface that increase the adherence and colonization of C. difficile. The lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) is the host cell receptor for CDT, and our aim was to gain a deeper insight into the interplay between both proteins. We show that CDT interacts with the extracellular, Ig-like domain of LSR with an affinity in the nanomolar range. We identified LSR splice variants in the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 and disrupted the LSR gene in these cells by applying the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. LSR truncations ectopically expressed in LSR knock-out cells indicated that intracellular parts of LSR are not essential for plasma membrane targeting of the receptor and cellular uptake of CDT. By generating a series of N- and C-terminal truncations of the binding component of CDT (CDTb), we found that amino acids 757–866 of CDTb are sufficient for binding to LSR. With a transposon-based, random mutagenesis approach, we identified potential LSR-interacting epitopes in CDTb.

By generating a series of N- and C-terminal truncations of the binding component of CDT (CDTb), we found that amino acids 757–866 of CDTb are sufficient for binding to LSR. With a transposon-based, random mutagenesis approach, we identified potential LSR-interacting epitopes in CDTb. This study increases our understanding about the interaction between CDT and its receptor LSR, which is key to the development of anti-toxin strategies for preventing cell entry of the toxin. Background: Clostridium difficile binary toxin CDT enters host cells via its receptor LSR. Results: Regions responsible for the CDT-LSR interaction were identified. Conclusion: An immunoglobulin-like domain of LSR and amino acids 757–866 of the binding component of CDT determine the toxin-receptor interaction. Significance: Knowledge of the toxin-receptor interaction is key to the development of anti-toxin strategies."

A literature overview was performed to compare the frequency of EMAST in our study with existing data. Immunohistochemistry for MSH3 was compared with EMAST status. Outcome was studied in terms of overall survival (OS) of mCRC patients with MSI and MSS tumors.EMAST was evaluated in 89 patients with MSI tumors (including 39 patients with Lynch syndrome) and 94 patients with MSS tumors. EMAST was observed in 45.9% (84 out of 183) of patients, with an increased frequency in MSI tumors (79.8% versus 13.8%, p < 0.001). We found no correlation between EMAST and MSH3 protein expression. There was no effect of EMAST on prognosis in patients with MSS tumors, but patients with MSI / non-EMAST tumors had a significantly better prognosis than patients with MSI / EMAST tumors (OS: HR 3.22, 95% CI 1.25-8.30).Frequency of EMAST was increased in mCRC patients with MSI tumors, compared to MSS tumors. Our data suggest that the presence of EMAST correlates with worse OS in these patients. There was no effect of EMAST on the prognosis of patients with MSS tumors. A limitation of our study is the small number of patients in our subgroup analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2109638807,"Here, we have developed an extremely efficient in vivo Tn5-based mutagenesis procedure to construct a Deinococcus radiodurans insertion mutant library subsequently screened for sensitivity to genotoxic agents such as γ and UV radiations or mitomycin C. The genes inactivated in radiosensitive mutants belong to various functional categories, including DNA repair functions, stress responses, signal transduction, membrane transport, several metabolic pathways, and genes of unknown function. Interestingly, preliminary characterization of previously undescribed radiosensitive mutants suggests the contribution of cyclic di-AMP signaling in the recovery of D. radiodurans cells from genotoxic stresses, probably by modulating several pathways involved in the overall cell response. Our analyses also point out a new transcriptional regulator belonging to the GntR family, encoded by DR0265, and a predicted RNase belonging to the newly described Y family, both contributing to the extreme radioresistance of D. radiodurans. Altogether, this work has revealed new cell responses involved either directly or indirectly in repair of various cell damage and confirmed that D. radiodurans extreme radiation resistance is determined by a multiplicity of pathways acting as a complex network."
https://openalex.org/W1971100822,"Nowadays, the study of environmental samples has been developing rapidly. Characterization of the environment composition broadens the knowledge about the relationship between species composition and environmental conditions. An important element of extracting the knowledge of the sample composition is to compare the extracted fragments of DNA with sequences derived from known organisms. In the presented paper, we introduce an algorithm called CoMeta (Classification of metagenomes), which assigns a query read (a DNA fragment) into one of the groups previously prepared by the user. Typically, this is one of the taxonomic rank (e.g., phylum, genus), however prepared groups may contain sequences having various functions. In CoMeta, we used the exact method for read classification using short subsequences (k-mers) and fast program for indexing large set of k-mers. In contrast to the most popular methods based on BLAST, where the query is compared with each reference sequence, we begin the classification from the top of the taxonomy tree to reduce the number of comparisons. The presented experimental study confirms that CoMeta outperforms other programs used in this context. CoMeta is available at https://github.com/jkawulok/cometa under a free GNU GPL 2 license."
https://openalex.org/W2048820826,"Upon TCR stimulation by peptide-MHC complexes, CD4+ T cells undergo activation and proliferation. This process will ultimately culminate in T-cell differentiation and the acquisition of effector functions. The production of specific cytokines by differentiated CD4+ T cells is crucial for the generation of the appropriate immune response. Altered CD4+ T-cell activation and cytokine production result in chronic inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders. miRNAs have been shown to be important regulators of T-cell biology. In this study, we have focused our investigation on miR-20a, a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, whose expression is decreased in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. We have found that miR-20a is rapidly induced upon TCR-triggering in primary human naïve CD4+ T cells and that its transcription is regulated in a Erk-, NF-κB-, and Ca++-dependent manner. We have further shown that overexpression of miR-20a inhibits TCR-mediated signaling but not the proliferation of primary human naïve CD4+ T cells. However, miR-20a overexpression strongly suppresses IL-10 secretion and moderately decreases IL-2, IL-6 and IL8 production, which are crucial regulators of inflammatory responses. Our study suggests that miR-20a is a new player in the regulation of TCR signaling strength and cytokine production."

Regenerative potential of hCPCs is severely limited with age, requiring genetic modification to enhance therapeutic potential. A legacy of work from our laboratory with Pim1 kinase reveals effects on proliferation, survival, metabolism, and rejuvenation of hCPCs in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that subcellular targeting of Pim1 bolsters the distinct cardioprotective effects of this kinase in hCPCs to increase proliferation and survival, and antagonize cellular senescence. Adult hCPCs isolated from patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation were engineered to overexpress Pim1 throughout the cell (PimWT) or targeted to either mitochondrial (Mito-Pim1) or nuclear (Nuc-Pim1) compartments. Nuc-Pim1 enhances stem cell youthfulness associated with decreased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, preserved telomere length, reduced expression of p16 and p53, and up-regulation of nucleostemin relative to PimWT hCPCs. Alternately, Mito-Pim1 enhances survival by increasing expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and decreasing cell death after H2O2 treatment, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity superior to PimWT.

A total of 503 (262 Croatian and 241Norwegian) non small cell lung cancer patients and 897 controls (568 Croatian and 329 Norwegian) were analyzed. We found that the frequency of allele b (three VNTR repeats) of FAM46A gene was significantly increased in the patients compared to the healthy controls in the Croatian and the combined Croatian and Norwegian subjects. Genotype frequencies of cd (four and five VNTR repeats) and cc (four VNTR repeats homozygote) of the FAM46A gene were significantly decreased in the patients compared to the healthy controls in the Croatian and Norwegian subjects, respectively. Logistic regression analyses revealed FAM46A genotype cc to be an independent predictive factor for non small cell lung cancer risk in the Norwegian subjects after adjustment for age, gender and smoking status. This is the first study to suggest an association between the FAM46A gene VNTR polymorphisms and non small cell lung cancer. We found also that BAG6 rs3117582 SNP was associated with non small cell lung cancer in the Norwegian subjects and the combined Croatian-Norwegian subjects corroborating the earlier finding that BAG6 rs3117582 SNP was associated with lung cancer in Europeans.

https://openalex.org/W2035076545,"Background A novel, swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was detected worldwide in April 2009, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic that June. DNA vaccine priming improves responses to inactivated influenza vaccines. We describe the rapid production and clinical evaluation of a DNA vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin protein of the 2009 pandemic A/California/04/2009(H1N1) influenza virus, accomplished nearly two months faster than production of A/California/07/2009(H1N1) licensed monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV). Methods 20 subjects received three H1 DNA vaccinations (4 mg intramuscularly with Biojector) at 4-week intervals. Eighteen subjects received an optional boost when the licensed H1N1 MIV became available. The interval between the third H1 DNA injection and MIV boost was 3–17 weeks. Vaccine safety was assessed by clinical observation, laboratory parameters, and 7-day solicited reactogenicity. Antibody responses were assessed by ELISA, HAI and neutralization assays, and T cell responses by ELISpot and flow cytometry. Results Vaccinations were safe and well-tolerated. As evaluated by HAI, 6/20 developed positive responses at 4 weeks after third DNA injection and 13/18 at 4 weeks after MIV boost. Similar results were detected in neutralization assays. T cell responses were detected after DNA and MIV. The antibody responses were significantly amplified by the MIV boost, however, the boost did not increased T cell responses induced by DNA vaccine. Conclusions H1 DNA vaccine was produced quickly, was well-tolerated, and had modest immunogenicity as a single agent. Other HA DNA prime-MIV boost regimens utilizing one DNA prime vaccination and longer boost intervals have shown significant immunogenicity. Rapid and large-scale production of HA DNA vaccines has the potential to contribute to an efficient response against future influenza pandemics. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00973895"
https://openalex.org/W2047083614,"Bystanders in a real world's social setting have the ability to influence people’s beliefs and behavior. This study examines whether this effect can be recreated in a virtual environment, by exposing people to virtual bystanders in a classroom setting. Participants (n = 26) first witnessed virtual students answering questions from an English teacher, after which they were also asked to answer questions from the teacher as part of a simulated training for spoken English. During the experiment the attitudes of the other virtual students in the classroom was manipulated; they could whisper either positive or negative remarks to each other when a virtual student was talking or when a participant was talking. The results show that the expressed attitude of virtual bystanders towards the participants affected their self-efficacy, and their avoidance behavior. Furthermore, the experience of witnessing bystanders commenting negatively on the performance of other students raised the participants’ heart rate when it was their turn to speak. Two-way interaction effects were also found on self-reported anxiety and self-efficacy. After witnessing bystanders’ positive attitude towards peer students, participants’ self-efficacy when answering questions received a boost when bystanders were also positive towards them, and a blow when bystanders reversed their attitude by being negative towards them. Still, inconsistency, instead of consistency, between the bystanders’ attitudes towards virtual peers and the participants was not found to result in a larger change in the participants’ beliefs. Finally the results also reveal that virtual flattering or destructive criticizing affected the participants’ beliefs not only about the virtual bystanders, but also about the neutral teacher. Together these findings show that virtual bystanders in a classroom can affect people’s beliefs, anxiety and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2047521148,"Lignin plays important structural and functional roles in plants by forming a hydrophobic matrix in secondary cell walls that enhances mechanical strength and resists microbial decay. While the importance of the lignin matrix is well documented and the biosynthetic pathways for monolignols are known, the process by which lignin precursors or monolignols are transported and polymerized to form this matrix remains a subject of considerable debate. In this study, we have synthesized and tested an analog of coniferyl alcohol that has been modified to contain an ethynyl group at the C-3 position. This modification enables fluorescent tagging and imaging of this molecule after its incorporation into plant tissue by click chemistry-assisted covalent labeling with a fluorescent azide dye, and confers a distinct Raman signature that could be used for Raman imaging. We found that this monolignol analog is incorporated into in vitro-polymerized dehydrogenation polymer (DHP) lignin and into root epidermal cell walls of 4-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Incorporation of the analog in stem sections of 6-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants and labeling with an Alexa-594 azide dye revealed the precise locations of new lignin polymerization. Results from this study indicate that this molecule can provide high-resolution localization of lignification during plant cell wall maturation and lignin matrix assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2062387508,"The human inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase isoform α (IBtkα) is a BTB protein encoded by the IBTK gene, which maps to chromosomal locus 6q14.1, a mutational hot spot in lymphoproliferative disorders. Here, we demonstrate that IBtkα forms a CRL3IBTK complex promoting its self-ubiquitylation. We identified the tumor suppressor Pdcd4 as IBtkα interactor and ubiquitylation substrate of CRL3IBTK for proteasomal degradation. Serum-induced degradation of Pdcd4 required both IBtkα and Cul3, indicating that CRL3IBTK regulated the Pdcd4 stability in serum signaling. By promoting Pdcd4 degradation, IBtkα counteracted the suppressive effect of Pdcd4 on translation of reporter luciferase mRNAs with stem-loop structured or unstructured 5′-UTR. IBtkα depletion by RNAi caused Pdcd4 accumulation and decreased the translation of Bcl-xL mRNA, a well known target of Pdcd4 repression. By characterizing CRL3IBTK as a novel ubiquitin ligase, this study provides new insights into regulatory mechanisms of cellular pathways, such as the Pdcd4-dependent translation of mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2072355330,"Deamidation, the loss of the ammonium group of asparagine and glutamine to form aspartic and glutamic acid, is one of the most commonly occurring post-translational modifications in proteins. Since deamidation rates are encoded in the protein structure, it has been proposed that they can serve as molecular clocks for the timing of biological processes such as protein turnover, development and aging. Despite the importance of this process, there is a lack of detailed structural information explaining the effects of deamidation on the structure of proteins. Here, we studied the effects of deamidation on human triosephosphate isomerase (HsTIM), an enzyme for which deamidation of N15 and N71 has been long recognized as the signal for terminal marking of the protein. Deamidation was mimicked by site directed mutagenesis; thus, three mutants of HsTIM (N15D, N71D and N15D/N71D) were characterized. The results show that the N71D mutant resembles, structurally and functionally, the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the N15D mutant displays all the detrimental effects related to deamidation. The N15D/N71D mutant shows only minor additional effects when compared with the N15D mutation, supporting that deamidation of N71 induces negligible effects. The crystal structures show that, in contrast to the N71D mutant, where minimal alterations are observed, the N15D mutation forms new interactions that perturb the structure of loop 1 and loop 3, both critical components of the catalytic site and the interface of HsTIM. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of TIM sequences, we propose the conservation of this mechanism for mammalian TIMs."

https://openalex.org/W2012418732,"When V. cholerae encounters nutritional stress, it activates (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response. The genes relA and relV are involved in the production of (p)ppGpp, whereas the spoT gene encodes an enzyme that hydrolyzes it. Herein, we show that the bacterial capability to produce (p)ppGpp plays an essential role in glucose metabolism. The V. cholerae mutants defective in (p)ppGpp production (i.e. ΔrelAΔrelV and ΔrelAΔrelVΔspoT mutants) lost their viability because of uncontrolled production of organic acids, when grown with extra glucose. In contrast, the ΔrelAΔspoT mutant, a (p)ppGpp overproducer strain, exhibited better growth in the presence of the same glucose concentration. An RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that transcriptions of genes consisting of an operon for acetoin biosynthesis were markedly elevated in N16961, a seventh pandemic O1 strain, but not in its (p)ppGpp(0) mutant during glucose-stimulated growth. Transposon insertion in acetoin biosynthesis gene cluster resulted in glucose-induced loss of viability of the ΔrelAΔspoT mutant, further suggesting the crucial role of acetoin production in balanced growth under glucose-rich environments. Additional deletion of the aphA gene, encoding a negative regulator for acetoin production, failed to rescue the (p)ppGpp(0) mutant from the defective glucose-mediated growth, suggesting that (p)ppGpp-mediated acetoin production occurs independent of the presence of AphA. Overall, our results reveal that (p)ppGpp, in addition to its well known role as a stringent response mediator, positively regulates acetoin production that contributes to the successful glucose metabolism and consequently the proliferation of V. cholerae cells under a glucose-rich environment, a condition that may mimic the human intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2063029860,"Single-molecule super-resolution microscopy allows imaging of fluorescently-tagged proteins in live cells with a precision well below that of the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate 3D sectioning with single-molecule super-resolution microscopy by making use of the fitting information that is usually discarded to reject fluorophores that emit from above or below a virtual-'light-sheet', a thin volume centred on the focal plane of the microscope. We describe an easy-to-use routine (implemented as an open-source ImageJ plug-in) to quickly analyse a calibration sample to define and use such a virtual light-sheet. In addition, the plug-in is easily usable on almost any existing 2D super-resolution instrumentation. This optical sectioning of super-resolution images is achieved by applying well-characterised width and amplitude thresholds to diffraction-limited spots that can be used to tune the thickness of the virtual light-sheet. This allows qualitative and quantitative imaging improvements: by rejecting out-of-focus fluorophores, the super-resolution image gains contrast and local features may be revealed; by retaining only fluorophores close to the focal plane, virtual-'light-sheet' single-molecule localisation microscopy improves the probability that all emitting fluorophores will be detected, fitted and quantitatively evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2086290120,"Background High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a kind of pro-inflammatory mediator, is associated with inflammatory conditions and tissue damage. Our previous study demonstrated that the circulating levels of HMGB1 correlated with disease activity of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). In the current study, we aimed to measure urinary levels of HMGB1 in AAV patients, correlated them to clinical activity index and analysed the immunohistochemical HMGB1 staining in kidney specimens. Methods 50 patients with AAV in active stage and 56 patients with AAV in remission were recruited. The urinary levels of HMGB1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, renal biopsy specimens from 27 patients with active AAV were randomly collected to evaluate the deposition of HMGB1. Results Urinary HMGB1 levels in AAV patients in active stage were significantly higher than those in AAV patients in remission and healthy controls (1.46 [0.56-3.43] versus 0.38 [0.10-1.35] mg/μmolCr, P=0.001; 1.46 [0.56-3.43] versus 0.48 [0.40-0.60] mg/μmolCr, P=0.000, respectively). Further analysis found that urinary levels of HMGB1 correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.354, p=0.012), C-reactive protein (r=0.289, p=0.042), and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (r=0.350, p=0.013). Renal tissue of active AAV patients showed HMGB1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and the extracellular space. The percentage of HMGB1-negative nuclei in renal tissue of patients with active AAV was significantly higher than that in normal controls (60.6±20.2 % versus 2.7±0.6 %, p<0.01). Conclusion Urinary levels of HMGB1 may be associated with the disease activity in AAV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2125709933,"The most consistent cognitive sex differences have been found in the visuo-spatial domain, using Mental Rotation (MR) tasks. Such sex differences have been suggested to bear implications on our understanding of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, it is still debated how the sex difference in MR performance relates to differences between individuals with ASD compared to typically developed control persons (TD). To provide a detailed exploration of sex differences in MR performance, we studied rotational (indicated by slopes) and non-rotational aspects (indicated by intercepts) of the MR task in TD individuals (total N = 50). Second-to-fourth digit length ratios (2D:4D) were measured to investigate the associations between prenatal testosterone and performance on MR tasks. Handedness was assessed by the use of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory in order to examine the relation between handedness and MR performance. In addition, we investigated the relation of spatial to systemising abilities, both of which have been associated with sex differences and with ASD, employing the Intuitive Physics Test (IPT). Results showed a male advantage in rotational aspects of the MR task, which correlated with IPT results. These findings are in contrast to the MR performance of individuals with ASD who have been shown to outperform TD persons in the non-rotational aspects of the MR task. These results suggest that the differences in MR performance due to ASD are different from sex-related differences in TD persons, in other words, ASD is not a simple and continuous extension of the male cognitive profile into the psychopathological range as the extreme male brain hypothesis (EMB) of ASD would suggest."

Here we use a new virtual screening procedure which uses a combination of similarity searching and docking to identify chemically tractable scaffolds that bind to the p53-interaction site of MDM2. The binding has been verified using capillary electrophoresis which has proven to be an excellent screening method for such small, weakly binding ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2006485504,"Enhanced expression and activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) has been implicated in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in various experimental models. The upregulation of NHE1 was correlated with an increase in osteopontin (OPN) expression in models of cardiac hypertrophy (CH), and the mechanism for this remains to be delineated. To determine whether the expression of active NHE1-induces OPN and contributes to the hypertrophic response in vitro, cardiomyocytes were infected with the active form of the NHE1 adenovirus or transfected with OPN silencing RNA (siRNA-OPN) and characterized for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Expression of NHE1 in cardiomyocytes resulted in a significant increase in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy markers: cell surface area, protein content, ANP mRNA and expression of phosphorylated-GATA4. NHE1 activity was also significantly increased in cardiomyocytes expressing active NHE1. Interestingly, transfection of cardiomyocytes with siRNA-OPN significantly abolished the NHE1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. siRNA-OPN also significantly reduced the activity of NHE1 in cardiomyocytes expressing NHE1 (68.5±0.24%; P<0.05), confirming the role of OPN in the NHE1-induced hypertrophic response. The hypertrophic response facilitated by NHE1-induced OPN occurred independent of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases and Akt, but required p90-ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). The ability of OPN to facilitate the NHE1-induced hypertrophic response identifies OPN as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the hypertrophic effect induced by the expression of active NHE1."
https://openalex.org/W2139625894,"The spatial structure of species richness is often characterized by the species-area relationship (SAR). However, the SAR approach rarely considers the spatial variability of individual plants that arises from species interactions and species' habitat associations. Here, we explored how the interactions of individual plants of target species influence SAR patterns at a range of neighborhood distances. We analyzed the data of 113,988 woody plants of 110 species from the Fushan Forest Dynamics Plot (25 ha), northern Taiwan, which is a subtropical rainforest heavily influenced by typhoons. We classified 34 dominant species into 3 species types (i.e., accumulator, repeller, or no effect) by testing how the individual species-area relationship (i.e., statistics describing how neighborhood species richness changes around individuals) of target species departs (i.e., positively, negatively, or with no obvious trend) from a null model that accounts for habitat association. Deviation from the null model suggests that the net effect of species' interactions increases (accumulate) or decreases (repel) neighborhood species richness. We found that (i) accumulators were dominant at small interaction distances (<10-30 m); (ii) the detection of accumulator species was lower at large interaction distances (>30 m); (iii) repellers were rarely detected; and (iv) large-sized and abundant species tended to be accumulators. The findings suggest that positive species interactions have the potential to accumulate neighborhood species richness, particularly through size- and density-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that the frequently disturbed environment of this subtropical rainforest (e.g., typhoon-driven natural disturbances such as landslides, soil erosion, flooding, and windthrow) might create the spatial heterogeneity of species richness and promote positive species interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2050161793,"Objectives Ultrasound studies of carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and plaques are limited in South Asians, a group at elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We determined whether South Asians have a difference in these ultrasound markers compared to Europeans living in the United Kingdom and whether measured risk factor(s) could account for any such differences. Methods One hundred South Asian men, aged 40 to 70 years and 100 European men of similar age and BMI, without diagnosed CVD or diabetes, underwent carotid ultrasound for measurement of cIMT and carotid plaque presence. Physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, anthropometry and blood pressure were assessed, fasted blood taken for measurement of cardiometabolic risk factors and demographic and lifestyle factors recorded. Results Age-adjusted mean (SD) cIMT was similar in South Asians and Europeans (0.64 (0.16) mm v 0.65 (0.12) mm, p = 0.64). Plaque was present in 48 South Asians and 37 Europeans and overall, there was no age-adjusted difference between South Asian and Europeans for plaque score(odds ratio 1.49, 95% CI, 0.86-2.80, p = 0.16), however, South Asians appeared to have more plaques at a younger age than Europeans; at age 40-50 years the odds of South Asians having plaques was 2.63 (95% CI, 1.16-5.93) times that for Europeans. Conclusions cIMT is similar between healthy South Asian and European men. Whilst there was no overall difference in plaque presence in South Asians, there is an indication of greater plaque prevalence at younger ages - an observation requiring further investigation. Prospective studies linking plaques to CVD outcomes in South Asians are needed to investigate whether these measures help improve CVD risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2326810932,"Anchoring proteins direct protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases toward selected substrates to control the efficacy, context, and duration of neuronal phosphorylation events. The A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP79/150 interacts with protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) to modulate second messenger signaling events. In a mass spectrometry-based screen for additional AKAP79/150 binding partners, we have identified the Roundabout axonal guidance receptor Robo2 and its ligands Slit2 and Slit3. Biochemical and cellular approaches confirm that a linear sequence located in the cytoplasmic tail of Robo2 (residues 991–1070) interfaces directly with sites on the anchoring protein. Parallel studies show that AKAP79/150 interacts with the Robo3 receptor in a similar manner. Immunofluorescent staining detects overlapping expression patterns for murine AKAP150, Robo2, and Robo3 in a variety of brain regions, including hippocampal region CA1 and the islands of Calleja. In vitro kinase assays, peptide spot array mapping, and proximity ligation assay staining approaches establish that human AKAP79-anchored PKC selectively phosphorylates the Robo3.1 receptor subtype on serine 1330. These findings imply that anchored PKC locally modulates the phosphorylation status of Robo3.1 in brain regions governing learning and memory and reward. Background: A-kinase anchoring proteins position signaling enzymes to control neuronal phosphorylation events. Results: Biochemical and cellular approaches confirm that the AKAP79/150 signaling complex interfaces with the cytoplasmic tail of Roundabout (Robo) receptors. Conclusion: AKAP79/150-associated protein kinase C facilitates the phosphorylation of Ser-1330 on the Robo3.1 isoform. Significance: Kinase anchoring is a mechanism to control the phosphorylation of Robo3.1 within macromolecular assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W1981550131,"Purpose To estimate the rate of hospitalized eye trauma in Taiwan and investigate the role between principal and secondary diagnoses of such trauma. Methods Nationwide fixed cohort study of 1,000,000 beneficiaries from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Database was used and 4819 patients who were hospitalized for eye trauma during 1996-2010 were analyzed. Results During 1996-2010, the incidence rates of hospitalized eye trauma (per 100 000 person-years) were 35.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 34.0 to 36.0) for total diagnosis, 9.8 (95% CI, 9.3 to 10.3) for a principal diagnosis, and 25.3 (95% CI, 24.4 to 26.1) for a secondary diagnosis. The sex risk ratio was 3.1 for a principal diagnosis and 2.1 for a secondary diagnosis. The main causes of eye trauma were traffic accident, work accident, assault (among males <60 years of age), and falls (among elderly men and women). The proportion admitted to an ophthalmic department among those with a principal diagnosis of eye trauma (64.8%) was significantly higher than among those with a secondary diagnosis (2.3%) (p<.0001). Patients with a principal diagnosis of eye trauma had shorter hospital stays (7.1±10.2 days) and lower fatality (0.07%) than those with a secondary diagnosis of eye trauma (10.0±31.6 days and 0.3%, respectively). Conclusion Data only from ophthalmic admissions tends to underestimate the true incidence rate of hospitalized eye trauma. Patients with a principal diagnosis of eye trauma had less severe injuries than did those with a secondary diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1986332675,"Inflammation is one of the major hallmarks of cancer. This study was designed to profile a panel of inflammatory mediators in gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) and to identify their potential differences separately in metastatic and non-metastatic patient subgroups.Serum samples from 216 GA patients and 333 healthy controls from China were analyzed for six proteins using the Luminex multiplex assay.The serum levels for all the six proteins were significantly elevated in metastatic GA compared to non-metastatic GA. Two acute phase proteins (SAA and CRP) and a CXC chemokine (GRO) were significantly elevated in metastatic GA (p <0.01) but smaller changes were observed in non-metastatic GA compared to healthy controls. OPN is moderately increased in non-metastatic GA (2.05-fold) and more severely elevated in metastatic GA (3.34-fold). Surprisingly, soluble VCAM1 and AGP were significantly lower in both non-metastatic and metastatic GA patients compared to controls. Several individual proteins were shown to possess moderate diagnostic value for non-metastatic GA (AUC = 0.786, 0.833, 0.823 for OPN, sVCAM1 and AGP, respectively) and metastatic GA (AUC = 0.931, 0.720, 0.834 and 0.737 for OPN, sVCAM1, SAA and CRP, respectively). However, protein combinations further improve the diagnostic potential for both non-metastatic GA (best AUC = 0.946) and metastatic GA (best AUC = 0.963). The protein combination with best AUC value for both comparisons is OPN+sVCAM1+AGP+SAA.These results suggest that several serum proteins are directly related to the severity of gastric cancer. Overall, stronger associations are observed with metastatic than non-metastatic GA as the protein changes are greater with the metastatic status. A combination of these serum proteins may serve as non-invasive markers to assess the severity status and stage of gastric cancer."
