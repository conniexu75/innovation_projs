https://openalex.org/W4213211303,"Pediatric Coronavirus Disease 2019 (pCOVID-19) is rarely severe; however, a minority of children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), with substantial morbidity. In this longitudinal multi-institutional study, we applied multi-omics (analysis of soluble biomarkers, proteomics, single-cell gene expression and immune repertoire analysis) to profile children with COVID-19 (n = 110) and MIS-C (n = 76), along with pediatric healthy controls (pHCs; n = 76). pCOVID-19 was characterized by robust type I interferon (IFN) responses, whereas prominent type II IFN-dependent and NF-κB-dependent signatures, matrisome activation and increased levels of circulating spike protein were detected in MIS-C, with no correlation with SARS-CoV-2 PCR status around the time of admission. Transient expansion of TRBV11-2 T cell clonotypes in MIS-C was associated with signatures of inflammation and T cell activation. The association of MIS-C with the combination of HLA A*02, B*35 and C*04 alleles suggests genetic susceptibility. MIS-C B cells showed higher mutation load than pCOVID-19 and pHC. These results identify distinct immunopathological signatures in pCOVID-19 and MIS-C that might help better define the pathophysiology of these disorders and guide therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4213163295,"Abstract Previous microbiome and metabolome analyses exploring non-communicable diseases have paid scant attention to major confounders of study outcomes, such as common, pre-morbid and co-morbid conditions, or polypharmacy. Here, in the context of ischemic heart disease (IHD), we used a study design that recapitulates disease initiation, escalation and response to treatment over time, mirroring a longitudinal study that would otherwise be difficult to perform given the protracted nature of IHD pathogenesis. We recruited 1,241 middle-aged Europeans, including healthy individuals, individuals with dysmetabolic morbidities (obesity and type 2 diabetes) but lacking overt IHD diagnosis and individuals with IHD at three distinct clinical stages—acute coronary syndrome, chronic IHD and IHD with heart failure—and characterized their phenome, gut metagenome and serum and urine metabolome. We found that about 75% of microbiome and metabolome features that distinguish individuals with IHD from healthy individuals after adjustment for effects of medication and lifestyle are present in individuals exhibiting dysmetabolism, suggesting that major alterations of the gut microbiome and metabolome might begin long before clinical onset of IHD. We further categorized microbiome and metabolome signatures related to prodromal dysmetabolism, specific to IHD in general or to each of its three subtypes or related to escalation or de-escalation of IHD. Discriminant analysis based on specific IHD microbiome and metabolome features could better differentiate individuals with IHD from healthy individuals or metabolically matched individuals as compared to the conventional risk markers, pointing to a pathophysiological relevance of these features."
https://openalex.org/W4212853165,"Cardiometabolic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite a known genetic component, our understanding of these diseases remains incomplete. Here, we analyzed the contribution of rare variants to 57 diseases and 26 cardiometabolic traits, using data from 200,337 UK Biobank participants with whole-exome sequencing. We identified 57 gene-based associations, with broad replication of novel signals in Geisinger MyCode. There was a striking risk associated with mutations in known Mendelian disease genes, including MYBPC3, LDLR, GCK, PKD1 and TTN. Many genes showed independent convergence of rare and common variant evidence, including an association between GIGYF1 and type 2 diabetes. We identified several large effect associations for height and 18 unique genes associated with blood lipid or glucose levels. Finally, we found that between 1.0% and 2.4% of participants carried rare potentially pathogenic variants for cardiometabolic disorders. These findings may facilitate studies aimed at therapeutics and screening of these common disorders."

https://openalex.org/W4226169124,"Cell-free biosensors are powerful platforms for monitoring human and environmental health. Here, we expand their capabilities by interfacing them with toehold-mediated strand displacement circuits, a dynamic DNA nanotechnology that enables molecular computation through programmable interactions between nucleic acid strands. We develop design rules for interfacing a small molecule sensing platform called ROSALIND with toehold-mediated strand displacement to construct hybrid RNA-DNA circuits that allow fine-tuning of reaction kinetics. We use these design rules to build 12 different circuits that implement a range of logic functions (NOT, OR, AND, IMPLY, NOR, NIMPLY, NAND). Finally, we demonstrate a circuit that acts like an analog-to-digital converter to create a series of binary outputs that encode the concentration range of the molecule being detected. We believe this work establishes a pathway to create 'smart' diagnostics that use molecular computations to enhance the speed and utility of biosensors."
https://openalex.org/W4212925316,"Despite the well-established role of nuclear organization in the regulation of gene expression, little is known about the reverse: how transcription shapes the spatial organization of the genome. Owing to the small sizes of most previously studied genes and the limited resolution of microscopy, the structure and spatial arrangement of a single transcribed gene are still poorly understood. Here we study several long highly expressed genes and demonstrate that they form open-ended transcription loops with polymerases moving along the loops and carrying nascent RNAs. Transcription loops can span across micrometres, resembling lampbrush loops and polytene puffs. The extension and shape of transcription loops suggest their intrinsic stiffness, which we attribute to decoration with multiple voluminous nascent ribonucleoproteins. Our data contradict the model of transcription factories and suggest that although microscopically resolvable transcription loops are specific for long highly expressed genes, the mechanisms underlying their formation could represent a general aspect of eukaryotic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4213162030,"Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) are commonly used to replace severely diseased heart valves but their susceptibility to structural valve degeneration (SVD) limits their use in young patients. We hypothesized that antibodies against immunogenic glycans present on BHVs, particularly antibodies against the xenoantigens galactose-α1,3-galactose (αGal) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), could mediate their deterioration through calcification. We established a large longitudinal prospective international cohort of patients (n = 1668, 34 ± 43 months of follow-up (0.1-182); 4,998 blood samples) to investigate the hemodynamics and immune responses associated with BHVs up to 15 years after aortic valve replacement. Early signs of SVD appeared in <5% of BHV recipients within 2 years. The levels of both anti-αGal and anti-Neu5Gc IgGs significantly increased one month after BHV implantation. The levels of these IgGs declined thereafter but anti-αGal IgG levels declined significantly faster in control patients compared to BHV recipients. Neu5Gc, anti-Neu5Gc IgG and complement deposition were found in calcified BHVs at much higher levels than in calcified native aortic valves. Moreover, in mice, anti-Neu5Gc antibodies were unable to promote calcium deposition on subcutaneously implanted BHV tissue engineered to lack αGal and Neu5Gc antigens. These results indicate that BHVs manufactured using donor tissues deficient in αGal and Neu5Gc could be less prone to immune-mediated deterioration and have improved durability."

https://openalex.org/W4212798531,"Studies of successive vaccination suggest that immunological memory against past influenza viruses may limit responses to vaccines containing current strains. The impact of memory induced by prior infection is rarely considered and is difficult to ascertain, because infections are often subclinical. This study investigated influenza vaccination among adults from the Ha Nam cohort (Vietnam), who were purposefully selected to include 72 with and 28 without documented influenza A(H3N2) infection during the preceding 9 years (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 12621000110886). The primary outcome was the effect of prior influenza A(H3N2) infection on hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody responses induced by a locally available influenza vaccine administered in November 2016. Baseline and postvaccination sera were titrated against 40 influenza A(H3N2) strains spanning 1968–2018. At each time point (baseline, day 14 and day 280), geometric mean antibody titers against 2008–2018 strains were higher among participants with recent infection (34 (29–40), 187 (154–227) and 86 (72–103)) than among participants without recent infection (19 (17–22), 91 (64–130) and 38 (30–49)). On days 14 and 280, mean titer rises against 2014–2018 strains were 6.1-fold (5.0- to 7.4-fold) and 2.6-fold (2.2- to 3.1-fold) for participants with recent infection versus 4.8-fold (3.5- to 6.7-fold) and 1.9-fold (1.5- to 2.3-fold) for those without. One of 72 vaccinees with recent infection versus 4 of 28 without developed symptomatic A(H3N2) infection in the season after vaccination (P = 0.021). The range of A(H3N2) viruses recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies was associated with the prior infection strain. These results suggest that recall of immunological memory induced by prior infection enhances antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccine and is important to attain protective antibody titers."
https://openalex.org/W4213001467,"Metabolic reprogramming is central to oncogene-induced tumorigenesis by providing the necessary building blocks and energy sources, but how oncogenic signalling controls metabolites that play regulatory roles in driving cell proliferation and tumour growth is less understood. Here we show that oncogene YAP/TAZ promotes polyamine biosynthesis by activating the transcription of the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase 1. The increased polyamine levels, in turn, promote the hypusination of eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A) to support efficient translation of histone demethylase LSD1, a transcriptional repressor that mediates a bulk of YAP/TAZ-downregulated genes including tumour suppressors in YAP/TAZ-activated cells. Accentuating the importance of the YAP/TAZ–polyamine–eIF5A hypusination–LSD1 axis, inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis or LSD1 suppressed YAP/TAZ-induced cell proliferation and tumour growth. Given the frequent upregulation of YAP/TAZ activity and polyamine levels in diverse cancers, our identification of YAP/TAZ as an upstream regulator and LSD1 as a downstream effector of the oncometabolite polyamine offers a molecular framework in which oncogene-induced metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming coordinately drives tumorigenesis, and suggests potential therapeutic strategies in YAP/TAZ- or polyamine-dependent human malignancies. Li et al. show that YAP/TAZ directly promotes polyamine biosynthesis and activates eIF5A activity to upregulate LSD1 expression, thereby suppressing various genes including tumour suppressors to enhance tumour growth."
https://openalex.org/W4213136583,"Disaggregation of amyloid fibrils is a fundamental biological process required for amyloid propagation. However, due to the lack of experimental systems, the molecular mechanism of how amyloid is disaggregated by cellular factors remains poorly understood. Here, we established a robust in vitro reconstituted system of yeast prion propagation and found that heat-shock protein 104 (Hsp104), Ssa1 and Sis1 chaperones are essential for efficient disaggregation of Sup35 amyloid. Real-time imaging of single-molecule fluorescence coupled with the reconstitution system revealed that amyloid disaggregation is achieved by ordered, timely binding of the chaperones to amyloid. Remarkably, we uncovered two distinct prion strain conformation-dependent modes of disaggregation, fragmentation and dissolution. We characterized distinct chaperone dynamics in each mode and found that transient, repeated binding of Hsp104 to the same site of amyloid results in fragmentation. These findings provide a physical foundation for otherwise puzzling in vivo observations and for therapeutic development for amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Real-time fluorescence imaging analysis with a reconstitution system revealed binding dynamics of Hsp104/Ssa1/Sis1 chaperones to Sup35 amyloid and two distinct modes of amyloid disaggregation, fragmentation and dissolution."
https://openalex.org/W4213336556,"Mounting evidence supports the idea that transcriptional patterns serve as more specific identifiers of active enhancers than histone marks; however, the optimal strategy to identify active enhancers both experimentally and computationally has not been determined. Here, we compared 13 genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assays in K562 cells and show that nuclear run-on followed by cap-selection assay (GRO/PRO-cap) has advantages in enhancer RNA detection and active enhancer identification. We also introduce a tool, peak identifier for nascent transcript starts (PINTS), to identify active promoters and enhancers genome wide and pinpoint the precise location of 5' transcription start sites. Finally, we compiled a comprehensive enhancer candidate compendium based on the detected enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription start sites (TSSs) available in 120 cell and tissue types, which can be accessed at https://pints.yulab.org . With knowledge of the best available assays and pipelines, this large-scale annotation of candidate enhancers will pave the way for selection and characterization of their functions in a time- and labor-efficient manner."
https://openalex.org/W4212859070,"Optimal activation of NF-κB signaling is crucial for the initiation of inflammatory responses and eliminating invading bacteria. Bacteria have likewise evolved the ability to evade immunity; however, mechanisms by which bacteria dysregulate host NF-κB signaling are unclear. In this study, we identify eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3k, a nonessential member of the eIF3 translation initiation complex, as a suppressor of the NF-κB pathway. Mechanistically, we show that eIF3k expression induced by Vibrio harveyi enhances E3 ligase Nrdp1-mediated K27-linked ubiquitination of MyD88, an upstream regulator of NF-κB pathway activation. Furthermore, we show that eIF3k acts as a bridge linking ubiquitin-tagged MyD88 and ATG5, an important mediator of autophagy. We demonstrate that the MyD88-eIF3k-ATG5 complex is transported to the autophagosome for degradation, and that innate immune signaling is subsequently terminated and does not attack invading V. harveyi. Therefore, our study identifies eIF3k as a specific inhibitor of the MyD88-dependent NF-κB pathway and suggests that eIF3k may act as a selective autophagic receptor that synergizes with ATG5 to promote the autophagic degradation of MyD88, which helps V. harveyi to evade innate immunity. We conclude that V. harveyi can manipulate a host's autophagy process to evade immunity in fish and also provide a new perspective on mammalian resistance to bacterial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W4213322919,"Lung cancer has the highest mortality among cancers worldwide due to its high incidence and lack of the effective cures. We have previously demonstrated that the membrane ion channel TMEM16A is a potential drug target for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma and have identified a pocket of inhibitor binding that provides the basis for screening promising new inhibitors. However, conventional drug discovery strategies are lengthy and costly, and the unpredictable side effects lead to a high failure rate in drug development. Therefore, finding new therapeutic directions for already marketed drugs may be a feasible strategy to obtain safe and effective therapeutic drugs. Here, we screened a library of over 1400 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs through virtual screening and activity testing. We identified a drug candidate, Zafirlukast (ZAF), clinically approved for the treatment of asthma, that could inhibit the TMEM16A channel in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that ZAF can bind to S387/N533/R535 in the nonselective inhibitor binding pocket, thereby blocking the channel pore. Furthermore, we demonstrate ZAF can target TMEM16A channel to inhibit the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma LA795 cells. In vivo experiments showed that ZAF can significantly inhibit lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth in mice. Taken together, we identified ZAF as a novel TMEM16A channel inhibitor with excellent anticancer activity, and as such, it represents a promising candidate for future preclinical and clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W4212913400,"Progressive loss of pancreatic β-cell functional mass and anti-diabetic drug responsivity are classic findings in diabetes, frequently attributed to compensatory insulin hypersecretion and β-cell exhaustion. However, loss of β-cell mass and identity still occurs in mouse models of human KATP-gain-of-function induced Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), in the absence of insulin secretion. Here we studied the temporal progression and mechanisms underlying glucotoxicity-induced loss of functional β-cell mass in NDM mice, and the effects of sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) therapy. Upon tamoxifen induction of transgene expression, NDM mice rapidly developed severe diabetes followed by an unexpected loss of insulin content, decreased proinsulin processing and increased proinsulin at 2-weeks of diabetes. These early events were accompanied by a marked increase in β-cell oxidative and ER stress, without changes in islet cell identity. Strikingly, treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin restored insulin content, decreased proinsulin:insulin ratio and reduced oxidative and ER stress. However, despite reduction of blood glucose, dapagliflozin therapy was ineffective in restoring β-cell function in NDM mice when it was initiated at >40 days of diabetes, when loss of β-cell mass and identity had already occurred. Our data from mouse models demonstrate that: i) hyperglycemia per se, and not insulin hypersecretion, drives β-cell failure in diabetes, ii) recovery of β-cell function by SGLT2 inhibitors is potentially through reduction of oxidative and ER stress, iii) SGLT2 inhibitors revert/prevent β-cell failure when used in early stages of diabetes, but not when loss of β-cell mass/identity already occurred, iv) common execution pathways may underlie loss and recovery of β-cell function in different forms of diabetes. These results may have important clinical implications for optimal therapeutic interventions in individuals with diabetes, particularly for those with long-standing diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4213208724,"Introduction Neural tube defect is one of the top five most serious birth defects in the world. In Ethiopia an accurate estimate of the trend and burden of neural tube defects is still unknown. There hasn’t been much research done on the prevalence and trend of neural tube defects in Eastern Ethiopia. To complement previous efforts of studies, the purpose of this study is to estimate the trend and burden of neural tube defects in Eastern Ethiopia as well as to investigate the epidemiological implications of the findings. Methods A facility-based retrospective cohort study was carried out from cohort pregnant women who delivered in selected hospitals. File records of all babies who were found to have neural tube defects could be reached between 2017 and 2019. A structured checklist was used to collect data. The incidence of each case was calculated by dividing the number of cases per year by the total number of live births in each hospital. To determine the linear trend of neural tube defects over time, linear trend of Extended Mantel-Haenszel chi-square was performed. Data were presented using frequencies and percentages. Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 25. Results A total of 48,750 deliveries were recorded during the three years of the study considered for analyses with 522 women having neural tube defect giving an incidence rate of 107.5 per 10,000 live births in the three years. The most common types of neural tube defects found in the area were anencephaly and spina bifida accounting for 48.1% and 22.6%, respectively. The distribution of neural tube defects varied across the study hospitals, with Adama Medical College Hospital having the highest proportion (46.6%). Over half of the mothers (56.7%) live in cities. Mothers in the age group 25–34 (46.9%) and multigravida mothers had higher proportions (64.4%).of neural tube defects. None of the mothers took folic acid before conception, and only 19% took iron folic acid supplementation during their pregnancy. Conclusion and recommendation The findings showed that an increasing trend and burden of neural tube defects and preconception folic acid supplementation is insignificant in the region which showed that where we are in the prevention of neural tube defects. The finding suggests that preconception folic acid supplementation in conjunction with health care services should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the region. Aside from that, intensive prevention efforts for long-term folate intake through dietary diversification and appropriate public health interventions are required. Furthermore, data must be properly recorded in order to address disparities in neonatal death due to neural tube defects, and the determinants of neural tube defects should be investigated using large scale prospective studies with biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4213348548,"Depression stigma has been considered a significant barrier to treatment and rehabilitation. This study aimed to understand the effects of gender, previous mental health care, and symptomatology on depression stigma and analyze the impact of depression stigma on help-seeking attitudes. A total of 969 students with a mean age of 18.87 (SD = 1.49) were included in this study and completed the Depression Stigma Scale, the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help, the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 questionnaire, and a socio-demographic questionnaire. We analyzed data using SPSS 24.0, with a 95% confidence interval. Participants came from all University schools, and 64.6% were women. Personal stigma and help-seeking attitudes were affected by gender (β(male) = 5.65, CI = 4.07, 7.25) and previous access to mental healthcare services (β(previous help) = -4.35, CI = -5.89, -2.82). Perceived depression stigma was affected gender (β(male) = -2.67, CI = -5.00, -0.34) and symptomatology (β(no symptomatology) = -3.29, CI = -6.09, -0.49). Personal (r = -0.42, p<0.01) and perceived (r = 0.10, p<0.01) depression stigma correlated with help-seeking attitudes, but we detected no direct symptomatology effect on help-seeking attitudes. Personal depression stigma significantly affected help-seeking attitudes (β = -0.15, CI = -0.17, -0.12). Promoting literacy may decrease personal depression stigma and increase professional help-seeking attitudes and behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4212967064,"The purpose of our study is to figure out the transitions of the cryptocurrency market due to the outbreak of COVID-19 through network analysis, and we studied the complexity of the market from different perspectives. To construct a cryptocurrency network, we first apply a mutual information method to the daily log return values of 102 digital currencies from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020, and also apply a correlation coefficient method for comparison. Based on these two methods, we construct networks by applying the minimum spanning tree and the planar maximally filtered graph. Furthermore, we study the statistical and topological properties of these networks. Numerical results demonstrate that the degree distribution follows the power-law and the graphs after the COVID-19 outbreak have noticeable differences in network measurements compared to before. Moreover, the results of graphs constructed by each method are different in topological and statistical properties and the network’s behavior. In particular, during the post-COVID-19 period, it can be seen that Ethereum and Qtum are the most influential cryptocurrencies in both methods. Our results provide insight and expectations for investors in terms of sharing information about cryptocurrencies amid the uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4213212582,"Increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are associated with improved patient responses to immunotherapy. As a result, there is interest in enhancing lymphocyte trafficking particularly to colon cancers since the majority are checkpoint blockade-resistant and microsatellite stable. Here, we demonstrate that activated T-cells (ATC) armed with anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR bispecific antibody increases TIL and mediate anti-tumor cytotoxicity while decreasing tumor cell viability. Furthermore, treatment induces endogenous anti-tumor immunity that resisted tumor rechallenge and increased memory T-cell subsets in the tumor. When combined with targeted tumor expression of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member LIGHT, activated T-cell proliferation and infiltration were further enhanced, and human colorectal tumor regressions were observed. Our data indicate that tumor-targeted armed bispecific antibody increases TIL trafficking and is a potentially potent strategy that can be paired with combination immunotherapy to battle microsatellite stable colon cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Enhancing trafficking of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to solid tumors has been shown to improve outcomes. Unfortunately, few strategies have been successful in the clinical setting for solid tumors, particularly for ""cold"" microsatellite stable colon cancers. In order to address this gap in knowledge, this study combined TNFSF14/LIGHT immunomodulation with a bispecific antibody armed with activated T-cells targeted to the tumor. This unique T-cell trafficking strategy successfully generated anti-tumor immunity in a microsatellite stable colon cancer model, stimulated T-cell infiltration, and holds promise as a combination immunotherapy for treating advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3158663546,"Financial portfolio management (PM) is one of the most applicable problems in reinforcement learning (RL) owing to its sequential decision-making nature. However, existing RL-based approaches rarely focus on scalability or reusability to adapt to the ever-changing markets. These approaches are rigid and unscalable to accommodate the varying number of assets of portfolios and increasing need for heterogeneous data input. Also, RL agents in the existing systems are ad-hoc trained and hardly reusable for different portfolios. To confront the above problems, a modular design is desired for the systems to be compatible with reusable asset-dedicated agents. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent RL-based system for PM (MSPM). MSPM involves two types of asynchronously-updated modules: Evolving Agent Module (EAM) and Strategic Agent Module (SAM). An EAM is an information-generating module with a Deep Q-network (DQN) agent, and it receives heterogeneous data and generates signal-comprised information for a particular asset. An SAM is a decision-making module with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent for portfolio optimization, and it connects to multiple EAMs to reallocate the corresponding assets in a financial portfolio. Once been trained, EAMs can be connected to any SAM at will, like assembling LEGO blocks. With its modularized architecture, the multi-step condensation of volatile market information, and the reusable design of EAM, MSPM simultaneously addresses the two challenges in RL-based PM: scalability and reusability. Experiments on 8-year U.S. stock market data prove the effectiveness of MSPM in profit accumulation by its outperformance over five different baselines in terms of accumulated rate of return (ARR), daily rate of return (DRR), and Sortino ratio (SR). MSPM improves ARR by at least 186.5% compared to constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP), a widely-used PM strategy. To validate the indispensability of EAM, we back-test and compare MSPMs on four different portfolios. EAM-enabled MSPMs improve ARR by at least 1341.8% compared to EAM-disabled MSPMs."
https://openalex.org/W4212776886,"Elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) is associated with increased risks of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular-associated mortality. G6PC2 is predominantly expressed in islets, encodes a glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit that converts glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose, and has been linked with variations in FBG in genome-wide association studies. Deletion of G6pc2 in mice has been shown to lower FBG without affecting fasting plasma insulin levels in vivo. At 5 mM glucose, pancreatic islets from G6pc2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit no glucose cycling, increased glycolytic flux, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, the broader effects of G6pc2 KO on β-cell metabolism and redox regulation are unknown. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and metabolic flux analysis in βTC3 cells, a murine pancreatic β-cell line, to examine the role of G6pc2 in regulating glycolytic and mitochondrial fluxes. We found that deletion of G6pc2 led to ∼60% increases in glycolytic and citric acid cycle (CAC) fluxes at both 5 and 11 mM glucose concentrations. Furthermore, intracellular insulin content and GSIS were enhanced by approximately two-fold, along with increased cytosolic redox potential and reductive carboxylation flux. Normalization of fluxes relative to net glucose uptake revealed upregulation in two NADPH-producing pathways in the CAC. These results demonstrate that G6pc2 regulates GSIS by modulating not only glycolysis but also, independently, citric acid cycle activity in β-cells. Overall, our findings implicate G6PC2 as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing insulin secretion and lowering FBG, which could benefit individuals with prediabetes, T2D, and obesity.

Glucose-6-phosphatase, a multicomponent system located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose (1Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M.

This enzyme system is composed of several integral membrane proteins including a G6P transporter, encoded by SLC37A4, which carries the substrate from the cytosol to the ER lumen. Once in the ER, G6P is hydrolyzed by a glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) to glucose and inorganic phosphate, and these products are subsequently transported to the cytosol. Three G6PC isoforms, encoded by G6PC1, G6PC2, and G6PC3, have been identified and are selectively expressed in different tissues (1Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M.

G6PC2, also known as the islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP), is predominantly expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells (1Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit gene family.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29241-29245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous work from our group has shown that G6PC2, along with glucokinase (GK), forms a futile substrate cycle where G6PC2 dephosphorylates G6P, generated by GK, back into glucose. This suggests that G6PC2, in conjunction with GK, may regulate glycolytic flux and consequently affect the glucose sensitivity of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (4Pound L.D. Oeser J.K.

G6pc2 KO islets incubated for short durations (<2 h) in submaximal glucose also show higher glycolytic flux and increased GSIS compared with islets isolated from WT littermates (2Bosma K.J. Rahim M.

G6PC2: A negative regulator of basal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These prior results suggest that G6PC2 negatively regulates GSIS by opposing flux through glycolysis, but the effect of G6pc2 deletion on other downstream pathways that control insulin release, such as the citric acid cycle (CAC) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), is unknown. Genetic studies in humans have generated data that indicate G6PC2 may regulate pulsatile insulin secretion (6Li X. Shu Y.H. Xiang A.H. Trigo E. Kuusisto J. Hartiala J. Swift A.J. Kawakubo M. Stringham H.M. Bonnycastle L.L. Lawrence J.M. Laakso M. Allayee H. Buchanan T.A. Watanabe R.M. Additive effects of genetic variation in GCK and G6PC2 on insulin secretion and fasting glucose.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2946-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which suggests that G6PC2 may regulate aspects of β-cell metabolism other than glycolysis. To better understand the role of G6pc2 in β-cells, we describe here the application of 13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) to assess global changes in glucose and oxidative metabolism in response to G6pc2 deletion. MFA is a stable isotope-based approach that relies on the inherent assumption that the system under investigation is at metabolic steady state. However, obtaining sufficient isotope enrichment to enable precise flux estimation in cell culture systems often requires extended incubation times (≥24 h) (7Antoniewicz M.R. A guide to 13 C metabolic flux analysis for the cancer biologist.Exp. Mol. Med. 2018; 50: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, prolonged culture of primary islets causes gradual loss of their in vivo metabolic phenotype (5Morsi M. Schulze T. Früh E. Brüning D. Panten U. Rustenbeck I. Fresh and cultured mouse islets differ in their response to nutrient stimulation.Endocr. Connect. 2020; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which may explain why we observed a difference in glucose cycling but not in net glucose uptake or media insulin concentration between WT and G6pc2 KO islets (8Wall M.L. Pound L.D. Trenary I. O'Brien R.M. Young J.D. Novel stable isotope analyses demonstrate significant rates of glucose cycling in mouse pancreatic islets.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To minimize the confounding effects of phenotypic instability and cellular heterogeneity that complicate ex vivo studies of primary islets, we used a pancreatic mouse β-cell line (βTC3) to examine the metabolic effects of G6pc2 loss. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate stable G6pc2 KO and WT βTC3 cell lines for MFA studies. We also developed a mathematical model to assess isotope labeling measurements and quantify flux through the major pathways of glycolysis, PPP, CAC, and anaplerosis in β-cells. Metabolic fluxes were estimated by simultaneously regressing isotope enrichment measurements from 21 unique metabolite fragment ions and 13 extracellular uptake and excretion rates obtained from WT and KO cells incubated with 13C isotopes. The results indicate that G6pc2 deletion leads to a significant increase in oxidative fluxes and GSIS. An approximate 60% increase in glycolytic and CAC activity was accompanied by an approximately two-fold upregulation in intracellular insulin content and GSIS. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the cytosolic NADPH:NADP+ ratio along with a two-fold flux increase through the reductive carboxylation pathway from glutamine to citrate. Importantly, normalization of fluxes to the net glucose uptake rate showed increased flux through two NADPH-producing pathways in the CAC, independent of elevated glycolytic flux. These results suggest that G6PC2 also regulates CAC pathways, separate from its modulation of glycolysis. More broadly, these data suggest that G6PC2 could be a potential target for enhancing insulin secretion as well as lowering FBG in individuals with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Prior to conducting metabolic studies on βTC3 cells, we validated that the cell line has characteristics suitable for studying the function of G6PC2. We examined expression of G6pc2, Gck (HK IV), and Slc2a2. Gck and Slc2a2 encode glucokinase and the GLUT2 glucose transporter, respectively (9Berger C. Zdzieblo D. Glucose transporters in pancreatic islets.Pflügers Arch. 2020; 472: 1249-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All three genes were expressed in βTC3 cells, and their expression was not dependent on glucose concentrations (Fig. 1A). We also verified that glucose cycling (Figs. 1B and S1, A, C, and E), a functional readout of G6PC2 activity, was present at levels comparable to those previously measured in primary islets at 5 mM (∼10%) and 11 mM (∼20%) glucose concentrations (8Wall M.L. Pound L.D. Trenary I. O'Brien R.M. Young J.D. Novel stable isotope analyses demonstrate significant rates of glucose cycling in mouse pancreatic islets.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Bosma K.J. Rahim M. Oeser J.K. McGuinness O.P. Young J.D. O'Brien R.M. G6PC2 confers protection against hypoglycemia upon ketogenic diet feeding and prolonged fasting.Mol. Metab. 2020; 41: 101043Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast, glucose cycling studies in INS1-832/13 cells (Figs. 1B and S1, B, D, and F), a rat insulinoma cell line, showed negligible glucose cycling (≤3%) and net release of glucose (Fig. S1F, ∼1 nmol/106 cells/hr), further validating that G6pc2 is a pseudogene in rats (11Martin C.C. Bischof L.J. Bergman B. Hornbuckle L.A. Hilliker C. Frigeri C. Wahl D. Svitek C.A. Wong R. Goldman J.K. Oeser J.K. Leprêtre F. Froguel P. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25197-25207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lastly, uptake and excretion rates of metabolites connected to central carbon metabolism roughly doubled when the glucose concentration was increased from 5 to 11 mM (Fig. 1C), and this was associated with a linear increase in insulin secretion over 72 h (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that β-cell-specific features are conserved within βTC3 cells, making the cell line a representative model for our studies investigating the effects of G6PC2 on metabolism. To examine the effects of G6pc2 deletion in βTC3 cells, we engineered G6pc2 knockout (KO) and control (WT) cell lines by using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique. We first generated a βTC3 cell line with constitutive Cas9 expression using lentiviral transduction (Fig. 2A). The highest Cas9-expressing βTC3 single cell clones were identified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by immunofluorescent imaging (Fig. 2B). To generate KO cells, three unique synthetic gRNAs (crRNA:tracerRNA conjugates, each targeting a specific cut site) were delivered to the highest Cas9-expressing single cell clone using lipofection. To generate WT control cells, only tracerRNA was delivered to the highest Cas9 expressing single cell clone using the same transfection protocol. After three rounds of gRNA or tracerRNA treatment, four biological isolates were expanded and analyzed using the Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition (TIDE) genomic assessment tool to quantify the percentage knockout (see Experimental procedures for details). Computational assessment of Sanger-sequenced genomic DNA showed all three cut sites were predicted to have indel formations with biological isolates 2 and 4 having >90% indel formation at the first cut site (Fig. 2C), which is indicative of highly efficient knockout. To confirm loss of G6PC2 functional activity, we measured glucose cycling in KO isolates 2 and 4. Our results indicate that glucose cycling was almost completely abolished (Fig. 2D) with negligible glucose release flux (Fig. S2D) in the KO cells at 5 and 11 mM glucose concentrations. Additionally, there was no change in the cycled abundance of glucose over time in either KO isolate, whereas an 8 to 10% increase was observed in WT isolates within 24 h of incubation (Fig. S2, A and B). The total glucose uptake flux (Fig. S2C) trended higher in the KO isolates; however, the differences were not significant. Furthermore, microsomes isolated from KO cells showed significant downregulation of G6Pase activity in vitro relative to WT cells (Fig. 2E), validating the loss of functional G6PC2 expression in KO cells. To further validate our novel cell model, we measured intracellular and media insulin concentration in G6pc2 WT and KO cells at 5 and 11 mM glucose concentrations. Contrary to primary islets, where longer incubation times (>24 h) led to normalization of GSIS in KO cells due to metabolic adaptation (8Wall M.L. Pound L.D. Trenary I. O'Brien R.M. Young J.D. Novel stable isotope analyses demonstrate significant rates of glucose cycling in mouse pancreatic islets.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we saw a consistent elevation of media insulin production by βTC3 KO cells compared with WT cells at both glucose concentrations examined (Fig. 3A). Measurement of intracellular insulin content also showed that KO cells not only secreted more insulin but also stored more insulin per cell and per cell surface area (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the engineered βTC3 KO cell clones had negligible G6PC2 activity and therefore provided a cellular model of G6pc2 deletion. These results also further support our previously published results characterizing G6PC2 as a negative regulator of GSIS (4Pound L.D. Oeser J.K. O'Brien T.P. Wang Y. Faulman C.J. Dadi P.K. Jacobson D.A. Hutton J.C. McGuinness O.P. Shiota M. O'Brien R.M. G6PC2: A negative regulator of basal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for increased GSIS in G6pc2 KO cells, we developed a β-cell specific mathematical model to determine metabolic fluxes from 13C labeling measurements. Stable isotope studies were initially conducted on parental βTC3 cells to determine the optimal incubation times required to reach isotopic steady state using different tracers. These studies showed that glycolytic metabolites reached isotopic steady state within 24 h of incubation with [U-13C6]glucose (Fig. S3A), whereas CAC metabolites did not reach isotopic steady state even after 72 h of labeling (Fig. S3B). Labeling with [U-13C5]glutamine, on the other hand, achieved isotopic steady-state 13C enrichment of CAC metabolites between 12 and 24 h of incubation (Fig. S3C). Based on these data, we determined that parallel labelling experiments with [1,2-13C2]glucose and [U-13C5]glutamine for 24 h would provide an optimal experimental design for steady-state MFA. These tracers were previously shown to produce measurements that are highly sensitivity to fluxes in glycolysis/PPP and CAC, respectively (12Metallo C.M. Walther J.L. Stephanopoulos G. Evaluation of 13C isotopic tracers for metabolic flux analysis in mammalian cells.J. Biotechnol. 2009; 144: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A metabolic model including glycolysis and the oxidative PPP was developed (Fig. 4A and Table S1) using previously established carbon atom transitions (12Metallo C.M. Walther J.L. Stephanopoulos G. Evaluation of 13C isotopic tracers for metabolic flux analysis in mammalian cells.J. Biotechnol. 2009; 144: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). CAC metabolism was modeled using both oxidative and reductive pathways (Fig. 4A and Table S1), the latter of which has been shown to promote GSIS in rat islets (13Zhang G.-F. Jensen M.V. Gray S.M. El K. Wang Y. Lu D. Becker T.C. Campbell J.E. Newgard C.B. Reductive TCA cycle metabolism fuels glutamine- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Cell Metab. 2021; 33: 804-817.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to measurements of extracellular uptake and excretion rates (Fig. S4), measured mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) of several media and intracellular metabolites (Figs. S5 and S6) were also provided as inputs to the metabolic model in order to estimate intracellular fluxes using MFA (see Experimental procedures for details). Glucose and glutamine were metabolized largely via the mitochondrial CAC (Fig. 4, B and C). Excretion of overflow products (lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and citrate) represented a minor fate for disposal of excess carbon (Figs. 4, B and C and S4). Negligible fluxes were detected through oxidative PPP and pathways leading to the overflow products aspartate, glycerol, malate, and succinate. Glycolytic and mitochondrial fluxes were substantially elevated in G6pc2 KO cells compared with WT cells at both glucose concentrations examined. At 5 mM glucose, glycolytic (VPK) and mitochondrial (VCS) fluxes were ∼67% and ∼62% higher compared with WT cells (Fig. 4B), respectively. Increased oxidative fluxes were accompanied by a ∼92% and ∼78% increase in serine catabolism (VPSP) and glutamine anaplerosis (VGln.entry), respectively. Additionally, we observed significant increases in the excretion fluxes of pyruvate, alanine, and citrate, but not lactate (Figs. 4B and S4A). We observed similar increases in oxidative fluxes at 11 mM glucose, with glycolytic (VPK) and CAC (VCS) fluxes increased by ∼60% and 56%, respectively, compared with WT cells (Fig. 4C). Anaplerosis from glutamine, but not serine catabolism, was ∼78% higher in KO cells compared with WT cells. We also observed significant increases in the excretion fluxes of pyruvate, alanine, and lactate, but not citrate (Fig. 4C). While we saw a significant elevation in absolute glycolytic and mitochondrial fluxes in KO cells (Fig. 5A), it was important to determine whether there were metabolic effects arising from the loss of G6PC2 that were independent of increased glycolysis. To accomplish this, we normalized all metabolic fluxes to the net glucokinase flux (VGK Net). This normalization revealed more subtle changes in the relative distribution of fluxes within KO cells. In particular, relative fluxes through pyruvate carboxylase (VPC/VGK Net) and malic enzyme (VME/VGK Net) were increased in combination with a decrease in VMDH/VGK at both glucose concentrations (Figs. 5, B and C and S7, A and B). In addition, we observed a shift in overflow products from increased pyruvate excretion at 5 mM glucose concentration, to increased pyruvate, lactate, and alanine release at 11 mM glucose concentration, potentially due to a shift in the redox state of the KO cells (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, this normalization relative to net glucokinase flux also showed that the exchange flux between citrate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) was significantly elevated at both glucose concentrations, suggesting increased reductive activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Reductive carboxylation flux through mitochondrial IDH2 has been proposed as a mechanism that drives NADPH production by cytosolic IDH1, which acts as a coupling factor to regulate insulin secretion (13Zhang G.-F. Jensen M.V. Gray S.M. El K. Wang Y. Lu D. Becker T.C. Campbell J.E. Newgard C.B. Reductive TCA cycle metabolism fuels glutamine- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Cell Metab. 2021; 33: 804-817.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). While our analysis cannot distinguish contributions from cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms to the total IDH exchange flux, increased cycling between citrate and α-KG is consistent with enhanced redox coupling between IDH1/2 in KO cells (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, similar to data obtained in primary KO islets (4Pound L.D. Oeser J.K. O'Brien T.P. Wang Y. Faulman C.J. Dadi P.K. Jacobson D.A. Hutton J.C. McGuinness O.P. Shiota M. O'Brien R.M. G6PC2: A negative regulator of basal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we measured a significant elevation in cytoplasmic calcium levels within the KO cells at 5 and 11 mM glucose concentrations (Fig. 5D). Overall, these results show that deletion of G6pc2 leads to a broad acceleration in glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, primarily by rerouting more glucose and glutamine toward oxidative pathways that supply ATP and redox cofactors linked to GSIS. Our assessment of metabolic fluxes suggested the activation of reductive IDH flux and NADPH-producing pathways that have previously been implicated in augmenting GSIS (13Zhang G.-F. Jensen M.V. Gray S.M. El K. Wang Y. Lu D. Becker T.C. Campbell J.E. Newgard C.B.

Newgard C.B. Mechanisms controlling pancreatic islet cell function in insulin secretion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22: 142-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further investigate the increase in reductive carboxylation seen in KO cells, we analyzed the MID of intracellular citrate (Fig. 6A). Oxidation of labeled glutamine through the forward progression of the CAC results in M + 4 enrichment of citrate. In contrast, M + 5 citrate is indicative of reductive carboxylation of α-KG by IDH2 (13Zhang G.-F. Jensen M.V. Gray S.M. El K. Wang Y. Lu D. Becker T.C. Campbell J.E. Newgard C.B. Reductive TCA cycle metabolism fuels glutamine- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Cell Metab. 2021; 33: 804-817.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A significantly lower (M + 4)/(M + 5) ratio was observed in KO cells, consistent with a two-fold increase in IDH exchange flux estimated by 13C MFA at both glucose concentrations (Fig. 6B). To test if the increased IDH exchange flux is secondary to increased mitochondrial flux, we normalized the metabolic fluxes to CAC activity (VCS). Even after this normalization, the reductive IDH flux was significantly higher in KO cells compared with WT cells at both glucose concentrations (Fig. 6C). This shows that if an equal amount of carbon enters the CAC of WT or KO cells, the KO cells would route a higher percentage through the reductive carboxylation pathway. The redox state of β-cells during glucose stimulation is tightly correlated with their capacity for GSIS (13Zhang G.-F. Jensen M.V. Gray S.M. El K. Wang Y. Lu D. Becker T.C. Campbell J.E.

Therefore, using classical equations and metabolite concentrations (Fig. S8, see Experimental procedures) (16Krebs H.A. Veech R.L. Equilibrium relations between pyridine nucleotides and adenine nucleotides and their roles in the regulation of metabolic processes.Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1969; 7: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we determined the metabolic redox state in WT and KO cells. Cytosolic NADH/NAD+ was unchanged at 5 mM glucose concentration but was increased at 11 mM glucose concentration in KO cells (Fig. 6D). This is consistent with a 55% decrease in pyruvate excretion flux (Fig. S4, A and B) along with a 60% increase in VLDH/VGK flux in KO cells (Fig. 5A) from 5 to 11 mM glucose concentration. Additionally, increased malic enzyme and IDH activity was associated with significant elevation in cytosolic NADPH/NADP+ ratios at both 5 and 11 mM glucose concentrations (Fig. 6E). In agreement with the increase in cytosolic NADPH/NADP+ ratio, the mitochondrial NADPH/NADP+ fraction was reduced in the KO cells at both glucose concentrations (Fig. 6F). These results can be explained by the increase in IDH exchange flux, which has been proposed as a mechanism to transfer reductant (in the form of NADPH) from the mitochondria to the cytosol through the concerted action of IDH1/2 isozymes and the mitochondrial citrate/isocitrate carrier (13Zhang G.-F. Jensen M.V. Gray S.M. El K. Wang Y. Lu D. Becker T.C. Campbell J.E. Newgard C.B.

Importantly, flux through the reductive carboxylation and the malic enzyme pathways was upregulated by 67% and 32% in the KO cells, respectively, independent of the glycolytic flux (Fig. 5C). Consistent with these flux changes, gene expression analysis revealed substantial upregulation of cytosolic malic enzyme (Me1) in KO cells at 5 mM glucose (Fig. S9). Although changes in IDH flux were not strongly coupled to changes in Idh1/2 expression, the activity of this enzyme is largely controlled posttranscriptionally by acetylation/deacetylation (17Xu Y.

Most previous studies have tested bottom-up cognitive training programs but have not shown very good results. Objectives The aim of this study was to test ease of implementation, differential safety and preliminary efficacy of two top-down (strategy-learning) home-based, individualized, cognitive interventions: Goal Management Training (GMT), adapted for PD-MCI (Adapted-GMT), and a psychoeducation program combined with mindfulness exercises (PSYCH-Mind). Methods This was a single-blind block-randomized between-group comparative study. Twelve PD-MCI with mild executive dysfunctions were divided in four blocks and randomly assigned to any of the two interventions. The participants were included if they had PD-MCI diagnosis (no dementia), with stabilized medication. Both groups (Adapted-GMT and PSYCH-mind) received five intervention sessions each lasting 60–90 minutes for five weeks. Measures were collected at baseline, mid-point, one-week, four-week and 12-week follow-ups. Executive functions were assessed with the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) and the Zoo Map Test (ZMT). Quality of life (QoL) and psychiatric symptoms were also evaluated. Repeated measures ANCOVAs (mixed linear analysis) were applied to all outcomes. Results There was one drop out, and both interventions were feasible and acceptable. Despite the small sample size limiting statistical power, patients of both groups significantly improved executive functions per the DEX-patient (Time: F (4,36) = 2.96, p = 0.033, CI95%: 10.75–15.23) and DEX-caregiver scores (Time: F (4,36) = 6.02, p = 0.017, CI95%: 9.63–17.23). Both groups significantly made fewer errors between measurement times on the ZMT (Time: F (3,36) = 16.66, p = 0.001, CI95%: 1.07–2.93). However, QoL significantly increased only in PSYCH-Mind patients at four-week follow-up (interaction Time*Group: F (4,36) = 5.31, p = 0.002, CI95%: 15.33–25.61). Conclusion Both interventions were easily implemented and proved to be safe. Because both interventions are arguably cost-effective, these pilot findings, although promising, need to be replicated in large samples. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04636541 ."

https://openalex.org/W4212865109,"Background Anemia found in diabetes patients is often unrecognized like many other chronic diseases. The occurrence of anemia is also an additional burden to the micro vascular complications of patients with diabetes. In the selected study structure no published data were found on the prevalence of anemia and associated factors in diabetic patients. Hence, the findings of this study are very fruitful as an input for further studies and after the repetition of similar studies in different frameworks. It is helpful as input for the development of guidelines at diabetes clinics to request the laboratory assessment of hemoglobin as a routine activity. Objective This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among diabetic patients who attended Bale zone hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study design was conducted from September 2020–to January 2021 GC among adult diabetic patients who had follow-up at Bale zone hospitals. A total of 238 study participants were determined by single population proportion sample size calculation formula taking prevalence of anemia among adult diabetic patients 19.0%. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Information on demographic and associated factors of anemia in diabetic patients was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Blood sample collection was performed under aseptic conditions by a licensed medical laboratory professional. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1, cleaned and exported to statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 25 software tools. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with anemia in diabetic patients. P-value less than 0.05 and 95% CI were considered as statistically significant. The odds ratios were reported to indicate the strength of associations. Frequencies, percentages, charts and tables were used to summarize the characteristics of study participants. Results In this study anemia among adult diabetic patients is 18.1% (95% CI (13.2, 23.0%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the sex of the study participants and the type of diabetes mellitus were found to be statistically significant to associate with anemia. The odds of having anemia among females are nearly three times higher when compared with males (AOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.40–5.52). In addition, the odds of having anemia among adult diabetic patients who had type II diabetes mellitus (AOR 2.18, 95%CI 1.04–4.54) were 2.18 times higher than those who had type I diabetes mellitus patients. Conclusion Nearly one out of five adult diabetic patients had anemia. Sex of the patients and the type of diabetes are associated with anemia among adult diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W4212925981,"Physical activity has beneficial effects on executive functions and episodic memory, two processes affected by aging. These benefits seem to depend on the type of memory task, but only a few studies have evaluated them despite their importance in understanding aging. This study aimed to confirm that the benefits of physical activity on episodic memory in older adults vary according to the executive resources required by the memory task, comparing free recall and cued recall. Thirty-seven young adults and 37 older adults performed two memory tasks and an updating task. The two groups had a similar level of physical activity over the preceding 12 months, assessed by a questionnaire. Both the memory and the updating tasks were performed better by the younger than the older adults. A similar cueing effect was observed in the two groups. Physical activity was positively correlated with updating and free recall, but not with cued-recall, and only in older adults. Regression analyses indicated that physical activity accounted for 24% of the variance in free recall in older adults. Updating did not predict free recall (ns) when physical activity was entered in the analysis. The present results show that the benefits of physical activity vary with age and episodic memory task. Only free-recall performance, which relies on updating, seems to depend on physical activity, suggesting that the executive resources required for the task play an important role in the effect of physical activity on memory performance. This should be investigated in greater depth in subsequent studies."
https://openalex.org/W4212978685,"Improving the effectiveness of fishways requires a better understanding of fish behavior near hydraulic structures, especially of upstream orientation. One of the most promising approaches to this problem is the use of model behavioral rules. We developed a three-dimensional individual-based model based on observed brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) movement in a laboratory flume and tested it against two hydraulically different flume setups. We used the model to examine which of five behavioral rule versions would best explain upstream trout orientation. The versions differed in the stimulus for swim angle selection. The baseline stimulus was positive rheotaxis with a random component. It was supplemented by attraction towards either lower velocity magnitude, constant turbulence kinetic energy, increased flow acceleration, or shorter wall distance. We found that the baseline stimulus version already explained large parts of the observed behavior. Mixed results for velocity magnitude, turbulence kinetic energy, and flow acceleration indicated that the brown trout did not orient primarily by means of these flow features. The wall distance version produced significantly improved results, suggesting that wall distance was the dominant orientation stimulus for brown trout in our hydraulic conditions. The absolute root mean square error (RMSE) was small for the best parameter set (RMSE = 9 for setup 1, RMSE = 6 for setup 2). Our best explanation for these results is dominance of the visual sense favored by absence of challenging hydraulic stimuli. We conclude that under similar conditions (moderate flow and visible walls), wall distance could be a relevant stimulus in confined space, particularly for fishway studies and design in IBMs, laboratory, and the field."
https://openalex.org/W4213361889,"Bifurcating electron transfer flavoproteins (Bf ETFs) are important redox enzymes that contain two flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactors, with contrasting reactivities and complementary roles in electron bifurcation. However, for both the “electron transfer” (ET) and the “bifurcating” (Bf) FADs, the only charged amino acid within 5 Å of the flavin is a conserved arginine (Arg) residue. To understand how the two sites produce different reactivities utilizing the same residue, we investigated the consequences of replacing each of the Arg residues with lysine, glutamine, histidine, or alanine. We show that absence of a positive charge in the ET site diminishes accumulation of the anionic semiquinone (ASQ) that enables the ET flavin to act as a single electron carrier, due to depression of the oxidized versus. ASQ reduction midpoint potential, E°OX/ASQ. Perturbation of the ET site also affected the remote Bf site, whereas abrogation of Bf FAD binding accelerated chemical modification of the ET flavin. In the Bf site, removal of the positive charge impaired binding of FAD or AMP, resulting in unstable protein. Based on pH dependence, we propose that the Bf site Arg interacts with the phosphate(s) of Bf FAD or AMP, bridging the domain interface via a conserved peptide loop (“zipper”) and favoring nucleotide binding. We further propose a model that rationalizes conservation of the Bf site Arg even in non-Bf ETFs, as well as AMP's stabilizing role in the latter, and provides a mechanism for coupling Bf flavin redox changes to domain-scale motion.

In this, NADH donates a pair of electrons to the ETF-mediated bifurcation reaction, and in this case, a client CoA dehydrogenase may be a high-potential acceptor, of one electron. This exothermic electron transfer (ET) reaction is used to drive endothermic transfer of the other electron to a lower potential (more reducing) acceptor: ferredoxin or flavodoxin semiquinone. The Bf ETFs that support nitrogen fixation were named FixAB on this basis (8Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J.

The FAD that accepts a pair of electrons (2e) from NADH and dispenses them to separate paths is called the bifurcating FAD (Bf FAD, green in Fig. 1), whereas the flavin analogous to that of canonical ETFs is called the ET FAD (yellow in Fig. 1). It is critical that the ET FAD mediates single electron (1e) transfer only, as exergonic transfer of both electrons would dissipate the reducing energy inherent in NADH. The flavin moiety of the Bf FAD is bound between domains I and III while its AMP portion replaces the AMP of canonical ETFs (18Chowdhury N.P. Mowafy A.M. Demmer J.K. Upadhyay V. Koelzer S.

Specifically, the ET FAD should have two high-potential 1e E°s suiting it to transfer electrons one at a time between the Bf FAD and the FixCX (Fig. 1). Thus, the ET FAD should be able to adopt a semiquinone (SQ) state and cycle between it and either the oxidized (OX) state or the fully reduced hydroquinone (HQ) state. Indeed, the ET FAD was observed to accumulate in the anionic SQ state (ASQ) part way through reductive titrations (10Dwyer T.M. Zhang L. Muller M. Marrugo F. Frerman F.E.

In contrast, the Bf FAD should have a single 2e couple with a lower E°, between those of NADH and the ET FAD (21Nitschke W. Russell M.J.

The structural identities of the two FADs were deduced based on the analogy of one with canonical ETFs' FAD, in conjunction with binding of NADH near the other (18Chowdhury N.P. Mowafy A.M.

Experimental tests characterized flavin known to reside in domain II, based on mutagenesis to replace threonine 94 and 97 that hydrogen bond (H-bond) to ribose of the FAD between domains I and III (T94,97A-RpaETF), as well as computation to model each flavin's visible spectrum based on its environment in the protein (24Mohamed-Raseek N.

Sci. 2019; 10: 7762-7772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These site-specific approaches confirmed the structural models in assigning functions to each of the flavins in RpaETF (Fig. 1). Given the contrasting reactivities of the two flavins, it was expected that their two binding sites would be different too, as noncovalent interactions with their protein surroundings are believed to modulate the reactivity of bound flavins (20Yang K.Y.

There are, indeed, differences. However, from an electrostatic standpoint, both sites are dominated by an Arg residue that is highly conserved. Since the Arg residues of interest both derive from the A subunit of ETF, we omit the chain specifier and name them by their residue numbers alone. Residue 273 in the ET site is conserved as Arg in 202 of 216 sequences of Bf ETFs, and as lysine (Lys) in ten of them, whereas residue 165 in the Bf site is Arg in 214 of 216 Bf ETFs (and Lys in 1) (13Garcia Costas A.M.

Bacteriol. 2017; 199e00440-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In each case, the Arg is the only charged residue close enough to interact directly with the flavin. In the case of the ET site, one can rationalize the high E° of the OX/ASQ couple (E°OX/ASQ) in terms of a favorable interaction between the ASQ formed and the nearby Arg-273 side chain (10Dwyer T.M. Zhang L. Muller M. Marrugo F. Frerman F.E. The functions of the flavin contact residues αArg249 and βTyr16, in human electron transfer flavoprotein.Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20190-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to rationalize the unstable ASQ in Bf site with the nearby side chain of Arg-165. Not only is the ASQ thermodynamically suppressed, in that it is not seen as an intermediate between OX and HQ in reductive titrations, but its instability (high energy) is understood to be crucial to the Bf flavin's ability to reduce a low-E° acceptor (21Nitschke W. Russell M.J. Redox bifurcations: Mechanisms and importance to life now, and at its origin.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Peters J.W. Miller A.F. Jones A.K. King P.W. Adams M.W. Electron bifurcation.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2016; 31: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we would expect it to be stabilized by a nearby Arg. To elucidate the paradox of contrasting reactivities stemming from two flavins presumed to be chemically identical and both in contact with a conserved Arg, we replaced each Arg and characterized the resulting variants' stability, nucleotide content, and redox reactivity. Ours are the first biophysical characterizations to our knowledge of Bf ETFs incorporating amino acid substitutions in the Bf site. Our strategy rests on the firm foundation provided by variants of canonical ETFs containing substitutions in the ET site (9Burgess S.G. Messiha H.L. Katona G. Rigby S.E.J. Leys D. Scrutton N.S.

However, our studies extend the approach to the Arg of the Bf site and demonstrate that the status of each flavin site affects the other. These long-range effects raise the possibility of conformational coupling. Indeed, a remarkable 80° rotation of domain II relative to the domain I⋅III base has been documented crystallographically and is proposed to gate electron transfer in Bf ETFs (3Demmer J.K. Bertsch J.

Dynamics driving function : New insights from electron transferring flavoproteins and partner complexes.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5481-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we discuss a mechanism suggested by our finding that mutation of Arg-165 appears to abrogate binding not only of FAD, but even AMP in the Bf site. We propose that Arg-165 establishes a network of H-bonds reaching between domains I and III via a conserved peptide loop that bridges between Arg-165 and the phosphate(s) of AMP/FAD. Such a network stabilizing the dimer interface would explain the conservation of Arg-165 even among non-Bf ETFs, as well as retention of AMP as a stabilizer of the quaternary structure (30Sato K.

However, the Bf ETFs demonstrate that conservation of a nearby Arg does not guarantee a stable ASQ state, as the bifurcating site also contains a conserved Arg, yet suppresses the Bf flavin's SQ states. Thus, the effect appears more nuanced than the identity of the residue, and we expect that the nature of the interaction between Arg and flavin is different in the Bf site than in the ET site. Indeed, Arg-273 is seen in crystal structures to form a π-π stacking interaction with ET FAD (4Demmer J.K. Chowdhury N.P. Selmer T. Ermler U. Buckel W.

Vitt S. Buckel W. Ermler U. Flavins in the electron bifurcation process.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2021; 701: 108796Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To test the natures of the interactions, we generated variants, which remove the positive charge (replacement with alanine or glutamine, Ala or Gln) or remove bidentate H-bonding (replacement with Lys). We also sought to make the charge tunable via modulation of pH, by replacing Arg with histidine (His). Amino acid substitutions were made in each of the two flavin-binding sites separately. The variants affecting Arg-273 in the ET site were expressed in soluble form and purified. The yields of 20 to 25 mg per liter of culture were comparable to that of the WT indicating similarly stable and soluble proteins. Consistent with this, these variants all contained two FADs per heterodimer after purification including exposure to 1 mM FAD at the time of cell lysis, to repopulate any FAD-binding sites having good affinity (Table 1). Of the variants affecting the Bf site, R165K-RpaETF behaved like the WT. (Throughout, the R165K notation is used to indicate the variant in which Lys replaces Arg at position 165 of the EtfA.) However, variants lacking a cation in the Bf site displayed lowered affinity for FAD. The R165H-RpaETF could be purified with close to one bound FAD, whereas R165Q-RpaETF could only be purified in low yield with less than one FAD bound at pH 8 (below). R165A-RpaETF was expressed but partitioned into the insoluble fraction and produced colorless, sparingly stable protein in minute yield.Table 1Flavin contents and thermal stabilitiesRpaETF variantFAD content/dimerTm (°C)aTm values were measured on 17 to 30 μM ETF in 20 mM working buffer with 200 mM KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol at pH 8.WT2.00 ± 0.00bStandard deviations of 0.00 indicate that the two independent trials gave the same value.46 ± 2R273A2.04 ± 0.0644 ± 0R273H2.03 ± 0.0444 ± 0R273K2.09 ± 0.0744 ± 0R165K2.00 ± 0.0044 ± 0R165H0.9 ± 0.140 ± 2a Tm values were measured on 17 to 30 μM ETF in 20 mM working buffer with 200 mM KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol at pH 8.b Standard deviations of 0.00 indicate that the two independent trials gave the same value. Open table in a new tab The Tm values marking the midpoints of thermal denaturation at pH 8 displayed the same trends. Protein secondary structure was monitored via far-UV CD as the temperature was raised. All variants studied displayed similar secondary structure content at 25 °C. The variants that were soluble and readily purified all had Tm values only slightly lower than that of WT. The exception was the R165H-RpaETF for which the Tm was lower. To learn about the environment sensed by the flavins in the modified sites, we compared visible spectra of the variants with those of WT. The absorption bands of the two oxidized flavins overlap almost completely, so for better insight, we exploited the fact that in all variants the ET flavin underwent full reduction before the Bf flavin began to reduce, so a spectrum collected halfway through a reductive titration retained the signature of OX Bf flavin and ET flavin HQ. The difference spectrum from the first half of a titration therefore reflects ET FAD OX minus HQ, and the corresponding difference spectrum for Bf FAD was obtained from the second half of the titration (see Experimental procedures and Fig. S2). We assumed that the two HQ spectra present in the endpoint spectrum are very similar, and in any case they are weak compared with the OX spectra, especially at longer wavelengths. Therefore, we used the end-point spectrum divided by two as a proxy for either flavin's HQ. Addition of this spectrum to the above difference spectra yielded the deduced OX spectra for the ET flavin and Bf flavin. These are compared in Figure 2 and Table 2. The R165H-RpaETF and R165Q-RpaETF variants displayed several distinct properties, so they are discussed together in later sections.Table 2Comparison of absorption maxima of individual flavins in each variant, at pH 8RpaETF variantET FADBf FADBand I (near 450 nm)(±2 nm)Band II (near 380 nm)(±2 nm)Band height ratio II/IBand I (near 450 nm)(±2 nm)Band II (near 380 nm)(±2 nm)Band height ratio II/IWT4483941.044543740.98R273K4503961.064543740.99R273A4463921.054543740.99R273H4463941.054543740.96R165K4483961.074603781.09R165H4523861.01N/AN/AN/A Open table in a new tab In all our variants except R165K-RpaETF, the Bf FAD displayed vibrational features in band I, and in all cases, the two bands were well separated, absorbing around 450 and 370 nm, respectively, with comparable band heights, usually favoring band I. On the other hand, for ET FAD, the separation between bands I and II was smaller, producing a shallower dip between them (band II is shifted to 386–392 nm), and the amplitude of band II was higher than or equal to that of band I.

https://openalex.org/W4213061763,"Upon hearing the phrase Some cats meow , a listener might pragmatically infer that ‘Some but not all cats meow’. This is known as a scalar implicature and it often arises when a speaker produces a weak linguistic expression instead of a stronger one. Several L2 studies claim that pragmatic inferences are generated by default and their comprehension presents no challenges to L2 learners. However, the evidence obtained from these studies largely stems from offline-based tasks that provide limited information about how scalar implicatures are processed. This study investigated scalar implicature processing among L2 speakers of English and the degree to which differences in L2 proficiency and Theory of Mind abilities would modulate pragmatic responding. The experiment used an online sentence verification paradigm that required participants to judge, among multiple control items, the veracity of under-informative sentences, such as Some cats are mammals , and to respond as quickly as possible. A true response to this item is indicative of a logical some and perhaps all reading and a false response to a pragmatic some but not all reading. Our results showed evidence that scalar inferences are not generated by default. The answer linked to the pragmatic reading some but not all took significantly longer to make relative to the answer that relies on the logical interpretation some and perhaps all . This processing slowdown was also significantly larger among participants with lower English proficiency. Further exploratory analyses of participants’ Theory of Mind, as measured by the Social Skill subscale in the Autism Spectrum Quotient, revealed that socially inclined participants are more likely than the socially disinclined to derive a scalar inference. These results together provide new empirical insights into how L2 learners process scalar implicatures and thus implications for processing theories in experimental pragmatics and second language acquisition."

In this study, we characterized nonacid glycosphingolipids isolated from a human gastric adenocarcinoma by mass spectrometry, enzymatic hydrolysis, and by binding with a battery of carbohydrate-recognizing ligands. We show that the majority of the complex nonacid glycosphingolipids had type 2 (Galβ4GlcNAc) core chains (neolactotetraosylceramide, the Lex, H type 2, x2, and the P1 pentaosylceramides, and the Ley, A type 2, and neolacto hexaosylceramides). We also found glycosphingolipids with type 1 (Galβ3GlcNAc) core (lactotetraosylceramide and the H type 1 pentaosylceramide) and globo (GalαGal) core chains (globotriaosylceramide and globotetraosylceramide). Interestingly, we characterized two complex glycosphingolipids as a P1 heptaosylceramide (Galα4Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Gal β4Glcβ1Cer) and a branched P1 decaosylceramide (Galα4Gal β4GlcNAcβ3(Galα4Galβ4GlcNAcβ6)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glc β1Cer). These are novel glycosphingolipid structures and the first reported cases of complex glycosphingolipids larger than pentaosylceramide carrying the P1 trisaccharide. We propose that these P1 glycosphingolipids may represent potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer."

However, collecting and compiling quality indicator data can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Here we explore the utility and feasibility of linked routinely collected health data to capture key elements of quality of care for melanoma in a single-payer, universal health care setting.This pilot study utilized a retrospective population-based cohort from a previously developed linked administrative data set, with a 65% random sample of all invasive cutaneous melanoma cases diagnosed 2007-2012 in the province of Ontario. Data from the Ontario Cancer Registry was utilized, supplemented with linked pathology report data from Cancer Care Ontario, and other linked administrative data describing health care utilization. Quality indicators identified through provincial guidelines and international consensus were evaluated for potential collection with administrative data and measured where possible.A total of 7,654 cases of melanoma were evaluated. Ten of 25 (40%) candidate quality indicators were feasible to be collected with the available administrative data. Many indicators (8/25) could not be measured due to unavailable clinical information (e.g. width of clinical margins). Insufficient pathology information (6/25) or health structure information (1/25) were less common reasons. Reporting of recommended variables in pathology reports varied from 65.2% (satellitosis) to 99.6% (body location). For stage IB-II or T1b-T4a melanoma patients where SLNB should be discussed, approximately two-thirds met with a surgeon experienced in SLNB. Of patients undergoing full lymph node dissection, 76.2% had adequate evaluation of the basin.We found that use of linked administrative data sources is feasible for measurement of melanoma quality in some cases. In those cases, findings suggest opportunities for quality improvement. Consultation with surgeons offering SLNB was limited, and pathology report completeness was sub-optimal, but was prior to routine synoptic reporting. However, to measure more quality indicators, text-based data sources will require alternative approaches to manual collection such as natural language processing or standardized collection. We recommend development of robust data platforms to support continuous re-evaluation of melanoma quality indicators, with the goal of optimizing quality of care for melanoma patients on an ongoing basis."

The objective was to determine the general frequency of CM, the specific frequency of CM by diagnostic test and plasmodial species, and identify its associated factors. A retrospective study was carried out using the records of 567 newborns. qPCR and Thick Blood Smear (TBS) were performed. The frequency of infection was determined with a 95% confidence interval. Associated factors were identified by non-parametric tests and odds ratios; the confusion was controlled with a logistic regression model. All cases corresponded to submicroscopic CM (negative with TBS and positive with PCR), and the frequency was 12.2% (95%CI = 9.4-14.9). The detection was statistically higher in the umbilical cord with 16,2% (95%CI = 12.4-19.9) versus peripheral blood of the newborn with 2.2% (95%CI = 0.7-4.9). CM was statistically higher in newborn whose mothers had malaria in the last year, gestational and placental malaria. The median birth weight in newborn infected with CM was lower compared to the one of healthy neonates. Because the control program in Colombia is based on TBS, it must be improved with the inclusion of other tests that allow the detection of submicroscopic CM. In addition, the program has other limitations such as do not have specific actions for pregnant women and have a passive surveillance system. These difficulties do not allow to show the magnitude of CM, its consequences on neonatal and infant health, constituting a serious problem of health injustice."
https://openalex.org/W4212937938,"Background Patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) often have several chronic comorbidities, which necessitate the use of several medications and hence put them at high risk of polypharmacy. Medication-related problems (MRPs) among HD patients are a serious issue as they can increase morbidity and nonadherence with medications. To overcome this issue, a unique pharmacy practice model including medication review (MR) and motivational interviewing (MI) is needed to improve medication adherence, by reducing MRPs and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of MR and MI in improving medication adherence, quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who are on dialysis. Method and design This pre-post study will be conducted prospectively among patients with ESRD who have been on dialysis at the Hemodialysis Unit, Hospital Kuala Lumpur and the Hemodialysis Affiliated Centers of the University Malaya Medical Centre, from August 2020 till August 2021. Medication adherence will be assessed using the General Medication Adherence Scale (GMAS), whilst patients’ HRQOL will be assessed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 36 (KDQOL-36). Clinical parameters such as blood glucose level, calcium, phosphate, hemoglobin and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels will be obtained from medical records. A total of 70 patients will be recruited. Discussion We hypothesize that the implementation of pharmacy-based MR and MI may expect an increase in medication adherence scores and increase in HRQOL scores from baseline as well as achieving the clinical lab parameters within the desired range. This would indicate a need for a pharmacist to be involved in the multidisciplinary team to achieve a positive impact on medication adherence among hemodialysis patients.

Patients may not fully understand their prognosis and are often unprepared for the course of illness. Little is known about how and when to deliver prognosis-related information to patients with AdvLD, who should participate, and what should be discussed. We conducted in-depth interviews with a multi-profession sample of Hepatology clinicians and patients with AdvLD. Participants were drawn from three geographically diverse facilities (New England, Texas, California). We used inductive and deductive qualitative data analysis approaches to identify themes related to AdvLD prognosis discussions. Thematic analysis focused on content, timing, and participants’ roles in prognosis discussions. In total, 31 patients with AdvLD and 26 multi-profession clinicians completed interviews. Most participants provided a broad conceptualization of prognosis beyond predictions of survival, including expectations about illness course, ways to manage or avoid complications and a need to address patients’ emotions. Patients favored initiating discussions early in the AdvLD course and welcomed a multi-profession approach to conducting discussions. Clinicians favored a larger role for specialty physicians. All participants recognized that AdvLD prognosis discussions occur infrequently and favored a structured, standardized approach to broadly discussing prognosis. Patients with AdvLD and their clinicians favored a multifaceted approach to prognosis conversations including discussions of life expectancy, predictions about likely course of liver disease, and expected changes in function and capabilities over time. Structured and early prognosis discussions should be part of routine AdvLD care."

This study aimed to provide a rich understanding of what experiences adults with ADHD traits have with criticism. As part of a larger study, 162 participants with ADHD and high ADHD traits provided a written response to an open question asking about their experiences of criticism from other people. Thematic analysis was used to identify five common themes in the responses. Behaviours associated with inattention were perceived as the most criticised, whilst impulsive behaviours were mostly criticised in social contexts. Criticism was perceived via numerous conducts and was reported to have negative consequences for self-worth and wellbeing. To cope, some participants avoided criticism or changed how they reacted, including trying to accept themselves as they are. The responses indicated that receiving understanding from others played an important role in whether criticism was perceived. Overall, the findings highlight the need for more knowledge, understanding and acceptance towards neurodiversity from the general population."
https://openalex.org/W4225907416,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) motion artefacts frequently complicate structural and diffusion MRI analyses. While diffusion imaging is easily 'scrubbed' of motion affected volumes, the same is not true for T1w or T2w 'structural' images. Structural images are critical to most diffusion-imaging pipelines thus their corruption can lead to disproportionate data loss. To enable diffusion-image processing when structural images are missing or have been corrupted, we propose a means by which synthetic structural images can be generated from diffusion MRI. This technique combines multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution, which is central to many existing diffusion analyses, with the Bloch equations that allow simulation of MRI intensities for given scanner parameters and magnetic resonance (MR) tissue properties. We applied this technique to 32 scans, including those acquired on different scanners, with different protocols and with pathology present. The resulting synthetic T1w and T2w images were visually convincing and exhibited similar tissue contrast to acquired structural images. These were also of sufficient quality to drive a Freesurfer-based tractographic analysis. In this analysis, probabilistic tractography connecting the thalamus to the primary sensorimotor cortex was delineated with Freesurfer, using either real or synthetic structural images. Tractography for real and synthetic conditions was largely identical in terms of both voxels encountered (Dice 0.88-0.95) and mean fractional anisotropy (intrasubject absolute difference 0.00-0.02). We provide executables for the proposed technique in the hope that these may aid the community in analysing datasets where structural image corruption is common, such as studies of children or cognitively impaired persons."

The consequences of host parasite interactions in otherwise apparently healthy dogs remains largely unknown. This cross-sectional study used complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and fecal flotation data collected from 3,018 young dogs (<3 years of age) enrolled within the Morris Animal Foundation Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) to determine the prevalence of endoparasitism and compare bloodwork values of parasite positive and negative participants using logistic regression. Variables including age, gender, reproductive status, and geographic region at the time of evaluation were assessed to identify potential associations. To the authors' knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of clinicopathological changes associated with endoparasite infection in a large cohort has not been completed in the recent decade. The overall prevalence of endoparasitism was 6.99% (211/3018). Dogs who were parasite positive had statistically lower albumin (P = 0.004), lower RBC count (P = 0.01), higher neutrophil count (P = 0.002), and higher platelet count (P <0.001) as compared to parasite negative dogs. It was also concluded that dogs living in rural areas were more likely to have endoparasites than those living in suburban areas. Epidemiological data is crucial for the design and monitoring of prevention and control strategies. Identification of endoparasites by fecal testing is an essential tool to identify susceptible and resistant animals that can act as spreaders and reservoirs of intestinal parasites thereby enabling appropriate therapy and reducing the risk of new infection to animals and humans. Further epidemiological studies are needed to prevent, monitor, and develop new strategies to control endoparasites."

With the background of public participation in social governance in the future, effective public participation is extremely helpful to solve this issue. Promoting public participation and scientifically evaluating the implementation effect of public participation are urgent problems to be solved at present. This study aims to analysis the factors hindering public participation and improve the implementation effect. Therefore, an evaluation system with 16 factors is established based on literature review and questionnaire survey, namely the basis of participation, participation process, external support, and cost-effectiveness. Interactions among the 16 factors are further evaluated by expert opinions. The objective and subjective weights of indicators are determined and combined by introducing Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and entropy weight method (EWM). Considering the uncertainty and randomness of subjective judgment, cloud model is introduced to evaluate the implementation effect of public participation. Finally, this framework is applied to evaluate the project of Jiu Feng waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in Hangzhou, China, which verifies the applicability of the evaluation framework for the implementation effect of public participation in NIMBY facilities. The results indicate that the implementation of public participation is between ""average"" and ""good"", with significant room for improvement in the involvement of NGOs and the influence of public opinion on decision-making. Additionally, the participation process has a significant impact on the whole system. The framework can provide government departments with guidance in implementing public participation."

We used a 25-item survey to determine whether the strength of Terms of Service (TOS) warnings and the inclusion of a click requirement affect people's willingness to admit to engaging in inappropriate behaviors. A racially and ethnically diverse group of 1,500 people participated in the study; 98.3% were from the US and India and the remainder from 18 other countries. Participants were randomly assigned to five different groups in which warnings and click requirements varied. In the control condition, no warning was provided. In the four experimental groups, two factors were varied in a 2 × 2 factorial design: strength of warning and click requirement. We found that strong warnings were more effective than weak warnings in decreasing personal disclosures and that click requirements added to the deterrent power of both strong and weak warnings. We also found that a commonly used TOS warning has no impact on disclosures. Participants in the control group provided 32.8% more information than participants in the two click requirement groups combined and 24.3% more information than participants in the four experimental groups combined. The pattern according to which people dropped out of the five different groups sheds further light on the surprising power of the click requirement, as well as on the importance of tracking attrition in online studies."
https://openalex.org/W4213209396,"Heterosis is defined as increased performance of the F1 hybrid relative to its parents. In the current study, a cohort of populations and parents were created to evaluate and understand heterosis across generations (i.e., F1 to F3) in lentil, a self-pollinated annual diploid (2n = 2× = 14) crop species. Lentil plants were evaluated for heterotic traits in terms of plant height, biomass fresh weight, seed number, yield per plant and 100 grain weight. A total of 47 selected lentil genotypes were cross hybridized to generate 72 F1 hybrids. The F1 hybrids from the top five crosses exhibited between 31%-62% heterosis for seed number with reference to the better parent. The five best performing heterotic crosses were selected with a negative control for evaluation at the subsequent F2 generation and only the tails of the distribution taken forward to be assessed in the F3 generation as a sub selection. Overall, heterosis decreases across the subsequent generations for all traits studied. However, some individual genotypes were identified at the F2 and sub-selected F3 generations with higher levels of heterosis than the best F1 mean value (hybrid mimics). The phenotypic data for the selected F2 and sub selected F3 hybrids were analysed, and the study suggested that 100 grain weight was the biggest driver of yield followed by seed number. A genetic diversity analysis of all the F1 parents failed to correlate genetic distance and divergence among parents with heterotic F1's. Therefore, genetic distance was not a key factor to determine heterosis in lentil. The study highlights the challenges associated with different breeding systems for heterosis (i.e., F1 hybrid-based breeding systems and/or via hybrid mimics) but demonstrates the potential significant gains that could be achieved in lentil productivity."
https://openalex.org/W4213328086,"Background Envenomation by the European adder, Vipera berus berus (Vbb) , is a medical emergency. The overall in vivo haemostatic effects of pro- and anticoagulant components in Vbb venom, and the downstream effects of cellular injury and systemic inflammation, are unclear. Objectives To longitudinally describe the global coagulation status of dogs after Vbb envenomation and compare to healthy controls. A secondary aim was to investigate differences between dogs treated with and without antivenom. Methods Citrated plasma was collected at presentation, 12 hours (h), 24 h, 36 h and 15 days after bite from 28 dogs envenomated by Vbb , and from 28 healthy controls at a single timepoint. Thrombin generation (initiated with and without exogenous phospholipids and tissue factor), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT)-complexes and the procoagulant activity of phosphatidylserine (PS)-expressing extracellular vesicles (EVs), expressed as PS-equivalents, were measured. Results At presentation the envenomated dogs were hypercoagulable compared to controls, measured as increased thrombin generation, TAT-complexes and PS-equivalents. The hypercoagulability decreased gradually but compared to controls thrombin generation and PS-equivalents were still increased at day 15. The discrepancy in peak thrombin between envenomated dogs and controls was greater when the measurement was phospholipid-dependent, indicating that PS-positive EVs contribute to hypercoagulability. Lag time was shorter in non-antivenom treated dogs, compared to antivenom treated dogs &lt;24 h after envenomation. Conclusions Hypercoagulability was measured in dogs up to 15 days after Vbb envenomation. Dogs treated with antivenom may be less hypercoagulable than their non-antivenom treated counterparts. Thrombin generation is a promising diagnostic and monitoring tool for Vbb envenomation."

However, CCs are found extensively in atherosclerotic plaques and sclerotic cardiac valves. Interactions between pathogenic bacteria and CCs could provide insights into destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques and bacterial adhesion to cardiac valves.Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to assess in vitro bacterial adhesion to CCs and proliferation in the presence of CCs compared to plastic microspheres and glass shards as controls. Ex vivo studies evaluated bacterial adhesion to atherosclerotic rabbit arteries compared to normal arteries and human atherosclerotic carotid plaques compared to normal carotid arteries. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize bacterial adhesion to CCs and confocal microscopy was used to detect cholesterol binding to bacteria grown in the presence or absence of CCs.In vitro, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa displayed significantly greater adhesion, 36% (p<0.0001) and 89% (p<0.0001), respectively, and growth upon exposure to CCs compared to microspheres or glass shards. Rabbit and human atherosclerotic arteries contained significantly greater bacterial burdens compared to controls (4× (p<0.0004); 3× (p<0.019), respectively. SEM demonstrated that bacteria adhered and appeared to degrade CCs. Consistent with this, confocal microscopy indicated increased cholesterol bound to the bacterial cells.This study is the first to demonstrate an interaction between bacteria and CCs showing that bacteria dissolve and bind to CCs.

Although private local records can contribute significantly to biodiversity evaluation, they are seldom published in scientific journals. In this study, a retired scientist recorded the longhorn beetles (Distiniidae and Cerambycidae) present in Ito on the Izu peninsula, Japan, for 12 years. The records showed the dynamical changes in longhorn beetles, which indicated the environmental changes around the survey site over 12 years. We also compared the longhorn beetle composition in the Ito study site to those in the survey records in 13 other locations in Kanto, Japan. We found that the species composition in Ito was stable throughout the 12 years, while the general composition in Ito reflected the land-use pattern of urban areas and the collecting methods. The species composition in the Ito study site differed from that in some of the other satoyama locations (human-influenced natural environment), but this was possibly due to methodological differences. Long-term backyard biodiversity surveys, especially those conducted by retired professionals, can play important roles in future investigations of insect groups, such as longhorn beetles, even if they are not agricultural pests nor endangered species."

However, it remains unknown if other impairments, such as swallowing impairment (i.e., dysphagia), also present asymmetrically.The primary aim of this study was to examine muscle activity associated with swallow on the most affected side (MAS) and least affected side (LAS) in persons with PD. A secondary aim was to explore the relationship between differences in muscle activity associated with swallow and subjective reports of swallowing impairment and disease severity.Function of muscles associated with swallowing was assessed using surface electromyography placed over the right and left submental and laryngeal regions during three swallows for a THIN and THICK condition. The Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were collected as measures of subjective swallow impairment and disease severity, respectively.Thirty-five participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD and on a stable antiparkinsonian medication regimen completed this study. Results revealed no significant mean difference in muscle activity during swallow between the more and less affected side. For the laryngeal muscle region, a significant difference in coefficient of variation between the MAS and LAS was revealed for peak amplitude for the THIN swallow condition. For the laryngeal muscle region, a significant association was revealed between muscle activity and disease severity but not subjective reports of swallowing impairment.Superficially it appears that swallowing impairment present symmetrical during the early stages of PD, however, our variability data indicates otherwise. These results will be used to inform future studies in specific types of swallowing impairment (i.e., oral dysphagia, pharyngeal dysphagia, and esophageal dysphagia), disease progression, and overall asymmetry."

The present study explored the prediction of longevity from both individual perspective and family perspective based on demographic and psychosocial factors. A total of 186 longevous family members and 237 ordinary elderly family members participated in a cross-sectional study, and a sample of 62 longevous elderly and 57 ordinary elderly were selected for comparative research. The results showed that it was three times more female than male in longevous elderly group. Up to 71.2% of longevous elderly had no experience in education, which was significantly lower than that of ordinary elderly. Due to such extreme age, more widowed (81.4%) elderly than those in married (18.6%). Less than one-seventh of the longevous elderly maintained the habit of smoking, and about one-third of them liked drinking, both were significantly lower than that of ordinary elderly. In terms of psychosocial factors, longevous elderly showed lower neuroticism and social support, while higher extraversion, compared with the ordinary elderly. However, there were no significant differences between the two family groups in demographic and psychosocial variables, except longevous families showing lower scores in neuroticism. Regression analysis found that neuroticism, social support and smoking habit had significant impact on individuals’ life span, then, neuroticism and psychoticism were the key factor to predict families’ longevity. We conclude that good emotional management, benign interpersonal support, and moderation of habits are important factors for individual longevity, and the intergenerational influence of personality is closely related to family longevity."
https://openalex.org/W4213139518,"Creation of artificial forest plantations on a global scale is one of the ways to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on ecosystems, at the same time providing soil protection from erosion, regulation of the hydrological regime and carbon sequestration in soils of different natural and climatic zones. However, the change of the dominant plant community cause significant ecosystem changes, reflecting at the structure and functioning of the soil microbial complex as well. The shifts in prokaryotic community of the meadow soil resulting from the conversion of the native meadow (further grassland) phytocenosis to the artificial forest plantations was investigated with the use of NGS sequencing technology and metabarcoding approach–amplicon sequencing of V4 region of 16 S rRNA (performed on Illumina Miseq platform). The identified shifts in taxonomic structure and diversity may be the result of changes in the physic-chemical conditions of soils and, on the other hand, may serve as indicators of such changes. Cultivation of larch led to an increase in the diversity of the prokaryotic community and its stratification by depth. The acidifying effect of larch manifested itself in an increase in the proportion and diversity of acidobacteria, in the abundance of oligotrophic microorganisms of phyla Chloroflexi , Firmicutes , and a simultaneous comparative decrease in the bacteria of Verrucomicrobia phylum, alphaproteobacteria of or. Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales . The absence of clearly expressed dominants in the prokaryotic community, as well as a significant increase in alpha-diversity indices, compared with the control plot of native mountain-meadow soil under grassland vegetation, suggests a transitional nature of the soil ecosystem of artificial forest plantations."
