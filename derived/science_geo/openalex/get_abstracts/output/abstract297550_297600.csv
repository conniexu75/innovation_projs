https://openalex.org/W2059999045,"The chemical composition of atmospheric particulate material collected at the geographic South Pole indicates that Al, Sc, Th, Sm, V, Mn, Eu, Fe, La, Ce, Co, Cr, Na, K, Mg, and Ca are derived from either crustal weathering or the ocean. The relatively volatile elements Zn, Cu, Sb, Se, Pb, and Br are apparently derived from other sources. Because of their volatility, vapor-phase condensation or a high-temperature dispersion source is suspected for these elements or their compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1963569243,"The sudden appearance of a dislocation, representing an earthquake, in an elastic layer (the lithosphere) overriding a viscoelastic half space (the asthenosphere) is followed by time-dependent surface deformation, which is very similar to in situ postseismic deformation. The spectacular postseismic deformation following the large Nankaido earthquake of 1946 yields for the asthenosphere a viscosity of 5 x 10(19) poise and a 50 percent relaxation of the shear modulus. Large thrust type earthquakes may provide, in the future, a new method for exploring the rheology of the earth's upper mantle."

The patterns arrive later at stations nearer the heads of coastal canyons. Where a canyon heads between two islands, the patterns advance down the axis. The propagation speeds of these patterns were estimated as 25 to 88 centimeters per second. Internal waves are the probable explanation."

The intense blue coloration observed in corresponding sample areas after 200-kilovolt electron microscopy confirms the conclusion that these are color-center aggregates and, conversely, that color centers are primarily responsible for fluorite coloration."

https://openalex.org/W1979546661,"The success of the Arab oil embargo may be encouraging producers of other scarce raw materials to form a cartel against the United States. Pessimistic and optimistic opinions abound. Most third world countries need to sell as much as they can. The political hues of most potential members of a cartel make an arrangement unlikely, such as in the case where Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, Turkey, and the USSR corner the exportable market of chromium, but a coalition is unlikely. The U. S. government has a powerful weapon against cartels in the form of a massive, billion stockpile of strategic minerals. The nonenergy mineral position of the USA seems certain to weaken in the long haul. Technological advances, recycling, substitution, and changing lifestyles to pay for deferred social costs of past consumption and inequities in distribution seem to be in order. (MCW)"

https://openalex.org/W1981927337,"Smaller countries-and even more advanced large countries-need to carefully plan and allocate their limited resources in civil science and technology for maximum impact in terms of national goals. Norway's recently completed 2(1/2)-year attempt at more formal planning in the civil-industrial sector may suggest some useful approaches to this complex problem. It should also offer helpful insights to those interested in broad-scale, government-private planning in science and technology elsewhere."

This first of three articles on OMB discusses the development of the budget agency since World War II and looks at the evolution of the science budget from the OMB perspective."
