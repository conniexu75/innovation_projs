https://openalex.org/W1975722911,Macquarie Islands is formed of probably Pliocene oceanic crust. Intruded into pillow lavas is a belt of harzburgite and layered gabbro mnasses cut by dike swarms. Similar belt-like structures may cause the linear magnetic anomalies of the ocean.
https://openalex.org/W2045642406,"Nearly all of the heavier elements seem to have been assembled by successive neutron captures occurring in two distinct processes: the s (slow) process refers to neutron capture at a rate which is slow compared to the intervening beta-decay; the r (rapid) process refers to neutron capture at a rate which is rapid compared to the beta process. It is becoming increasingly apparent that simple models for galactic r-process nucleosynthesis are inadequate. Modern astronomical observations, which indicate that the bulk of r-process synthesis may have occurred early in the life of the galaxy, cannot be ignored. Recent data on the fissiogenic xenon in whitlockite from the St. Severin meteorite also place stringent conditions on permissible models for element synthesis. It appears that neither sudden nor continuous models for element formation are consistent with isotopic data now available. I propose a more complex model for the synthesis of solar system material in which the r-process is allowed to occur in three distinct modes: a ""prompt"" synthesis early in the history of the galaxy, a ""continuous"" synthesis whereby r-process products are continuously added to the galactic mix, and a ""last-minute"" synthesis which enriches the solar nebula with r-process material shortly before the formation of the solar system. Calculations based on the present abundances of uranium-235, uranium-238, and thorium-232 and the measured abundances of iodine-129 and plutonium-244 present when meteorites began to retain xenon indicate that the galactic age is between 8.0 and 8.8 billion years, with the initial ""prompt"" synthesis accounting for 81 to 89 percent of the total r-process material ever produced, the ""last-minute"" synthesis contributing between 11 and 13 percent, and 0 to 8 percent occurring in the continuous mode. The time interval between the isolation of the solar nebula from galactic r-process and the onset of xenon retention in meteorites lies between 176 and 179 million years."

Syrtis Major appears to be very high with essentially no detectable carbon dioxide above it. The data appear to confirm local trends and, in magnitude at least, the large variations of height found in earlier radar observations. A one-to-one correlation of height with albedo is not evident in the results. Elevated areas are found in both desert and dark regions. In several regions dark areas are associated with relatively steep slopes."
https://openalex.org/W1998651869,"The polymorphism of sulfur has been investigated by static and dynamic methods up to 500 degrees C at 35 kilobars and up to 350 degrees C at 100 kilobars. The melting curve of sulfur to 31 kilobars and phase boundaries of the so-called ""4.04-angstrom phase"" have been determined. Evidence has been obtained for phase fields of nine new high-pressure forms of sulfur."

https://openalex.org/W2046817155,"Infrared reflectance studies of small lunar regions reveal several absorption bands which match those of ferrous iron in laboratory spectra of olivines and orthopyroxenes. The craters Kepler and Aristarchus exhibit absorption bands suggestive of orthopyroxene, whereas the background mare material shows a band probably due to olivine."

Two additional sources, Cygnus 1 and NGC 6334N, have been observed, and the spectra of W49 and VY Canis Majoris were measured over a wider range of radial velocity."

The transparent polymer film is suddenly transformed into a brilliantly reflecting strip with the luster of silver. Extensive formation of voids accounts for the unorthodox behavior."

An optical and x-ray examination of concentrates from this breccia demonstrated that the supposed x-ray reflections of coesite are actually due to barite, introduced into the permeable crushed zone by groundwater."

A few minor changes would make possible simplifications of benefit to every one. Those making a study of perpetual calendars, expecting to eventually secure the adoption of one, should consider not only the ""no-week"" day, but also the ""intercalary week."""
