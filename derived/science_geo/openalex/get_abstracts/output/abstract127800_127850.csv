https://openalex.org/W2018011543,"We have identified two compounds that inhibit the expression of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin. These compounds act by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-α-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α, resulting in decreased nuclear factor-κB and decreased expression of adhesion molecules. The effects on both IκB-α phosphorylation and surface expression of E-selectin were irreversible and occurred at an IC50 of approximately 10 μm. These agents selectively and irreversibly inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-α-inducible phosphorylation of IκB-α without affecting the constitutive IκB-α phosphorylation. Although these compounds exhibited other activities, including stimulation of the stress-activated protein kinases, p38 and JNK-1, and activation of tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130–140-kDa protein, these effects are probably distinct from the effects on adhesion molecule expression since they were reversible. One compound was evaluated in vivo and shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory drug in two animal models of inflammation. The compound reduced edema formation in a dose-dependent manner in the rat carrageenan paw edema assay and reduced paw swelling in a rat adjuvant arthritis model. These studies suggest that inhibitors of cytokine-inducible IκBα phosphorylation exert anti-inflammatory activity in vivo.

The adhesion of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelium is critical to inflammatory responses (reviewed in Refs. 1Springer T. Annu. Rev.

Interaction of the selectin family of adhesion proteins and lectin counter-receptors is the predominant mechanism mediating initial adhesion between leukocytes and the vessel wall. The expression of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (E-selectin, CD62E), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, 1The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; IL, interleukin.

Induction of these molecules by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and other inflammatory cytokines is regulated at the level of gene transcription and requires binding of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the regulatory regions within the promoters of each of these genes (5Lewis H.

The NF-κB/Rel transcription factor family plays an important role in cytokine-induced gene activation (13Grilli M. Chiu J.-S. Lenardo M. Jeon K. Freidlander M. Jarvik J.

The Rel family includes p50 (NFKB1), p52 (NFKB2), p65 (RelA), RelB, v-Rel, and c-Rel. In endothelial cells, the p50·p65 heterodimer is the predominant species that binds to κB consensus sequences in the VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin genes and activates gene transcription. NF-κB is located in the cytoplasm of cells in an inactive form in association with the inhibitor IκB-α. In response to TNFα stimulation, IκB-α is phosphorylated on 2 serine residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36), ubiquitinated, and degraded by a proteosome-dependent pathway allowing active NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it can activate gene expression (16Beg A.

Many NF-κB-dependent genes including the adhesion molecules and several cytokine genes are important mediators of inflammation (reviewed in Ref. 24Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). A diverse range of agents that block NF-κB signaling has been shown to decrease expression of adhesion molecules (25De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H. Thannickai V.J. Ravavashisth T.P.

Recently, several clinically important anti-inflammatory agents including glucocorticoids, salicylates, and nitric oxide have been reported to inhibit NF-κB-driven gene expression which may explain, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory actions of these drugs (24Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 25De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H. Thannickai V.J. Ravavashisth T.P. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J.

In this study, we identified two novel pharmacologic agents that inhibit the TNFα-induced surface expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in human endothelial cells. These compounds were examined for their effects on cytokine-induced NF-κB/IκB-α signaling. Both compounds decreased TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB through inhibition of the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α. Compound 1 selectively inhibited the TNFα-inducible phosphorylation of IκB-α without affecting the constitutive IκB-α phosphorylation. To determine whether these agents may inhibit other cellular phosphorylation events, we examined the effects of compound 1 on TNFα-induced activity of the stress-activated protein kinases, p38 and JNK-1. This agent increased the activity of p38 kinase and JNK-1 but had little or no effect on the activity of the MAP kinase, ERK-1. The agent was also examined for effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation since agents that block tyrosine phosphorylation have been reported to inhibit NF-κB signaling and adhesion molecule expression (29Weber C. Negrescu E. Erl W. Pietsch A. Frankenberger M. Loms Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Siess W. Weber P.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 445-451PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of endothelial cells with the test compound did not detectably inhibit protein tyrosine phosphorylation but rather resulted in an elevated level of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of molecular mass 130–140 kDa. We evaluated compound 2 in two animal models of inflammation. This agent reduced swelling in a dose-dependent manner in both the rat carrageenan paw edema assay and in a rat adjuvant arthritis model. Thus, we have identified a novel class of anti-inflammatory agents that act by selectively inhibiting the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκBα resulting in decreased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. The structures of compounds 1 (BAY-117821; (E)3-[(4-methylphenyl)-sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile (CA number, 195462–67-7)) and 2 (BAY 11-7083; ((E)3-[4-t-butylphenyl)-sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile) are shown in Fig. 1. The compounds were prepared according to previously published procedures (35Richter, S. U. K. A., and Tsolis, A. K., Jr. (1969) U. S. Patent 1,506,186.Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and maintained in culture using previously described procedures (36Gimbrone M. Spaet T. Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. 3. Grune and Stratton, Inc., New York1976: 1-28Google Scholar). For experiments on cytokine induction, cells were exposed to recombinant human TNFα at a final concentration of 100 units/ml in complete media for the times indicated. The proteosomal inhibitor carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal-H (MG115) was prepared as a 40 mm stock solution in Me2SO and added to complete medium to a final concentration of 40 μm. Cell toxicity was assessed by morphology and by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (37Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4322) Google Scholar). Cell surface binding assays were performed at 4 °C on viable human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers in microtiter plates, using saturating concentrations of monoclonal antibody supernatants and a secondary fluorescent-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-murine IgG (Caltag Labs, San Francisco, CA) as previously detailed (38Luscinskas F.W. Brock A.F. Arnaout M.A. Gimbrone M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2257-2263PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to E-selectin (H4/18), VCAM-1 (E1/6), and ICAM-1 (Hu5/3) culture supernatants were kindly provided by Dr. Michael A. Gimbrone, Jr. Fluorescence intensities were determined using an automated microtiter plate reader (Pandex, Baxter Healthcare Corp.). The effects of compounds 1 and 2 on interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production were evaluated on HUVEC that were grown to confluence on 96-well microtiter plates. The cells were preincubated with the drugs at concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, or 25 μm and then incubated with TNFα (10 units/ml) and drug for 16 h. The culture supernatants were removed and assayed for IL-6 and IL-8 content using enzyme-linked immunoassay kits from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Nuclear extracts were prepared from test or control HUVEC in the presence of 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 40 μm ALLN (calpain inhibitor 1), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride as described previously (10Whitley M. Thanos D. Read M. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were gel-purified, annealed, and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (50 μCi; specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Binding reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) and electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (39Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were utilized: VCAM-κB (vNF-WT), 5′ CTGGGTTTCCCCTTGAAGGGATTTCCCTC and the complementary strand. Protein DNA complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels. Following experimental treatment of HUVEC, cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared, subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 5% methanol at 100 V for 1 h as described previously (10Whitley M. Thanos D. Read M. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Read M. Neish A. Luscinskas F. Palombella V. Maniatis T. Collins T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 493-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Anti-IκBα and anti-p38 antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and used at dilutions of 1:1000. Rabbit antisera directed against the phosphorylated p38 (Tyr-182) were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and used at 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (Amersham Corp.) using 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse secondary antiserum. Blots were exposed to film for 1–15 min and then developed. Extracts were prepared from control and TNFα-treated HUVEC. Cells were solubilized with Triton lysis buffer (TLB, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The JNK, p38, or ERK protein kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies bound to protein-A Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal JNK-1 and p38 antibodies have been described (40Raingeaud J.S. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TLB and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of substrate protein and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP) (10 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 25 μl. The reactions were terminated after 15 min at 30 °C by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Control experiments demonstrated that the phosphorylation reaction was linear with time for at least 30 min under these conditions. The phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. In gel kinase assay for the proteins that phosphorylate IκB-α was carried out according to the method of Hibi et al. (41Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) and as detailed below. Whole cell extracts were prepared from HUVEC treated with TNFα (100 units/ml) for 15 min in the presence or absence of compound 1 (20 μm, pretreatment for 1 h) as indicated. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS gel containing 0.5 mg/ml HIS-IκB-α. Gels were washed two times in 20% propanol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, for 30 min and two times in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min, followed by a 1-h incubation with buffer A containing 6 m urea, 1 h each in 3, 1.5, and 0.75 m urea in buffer A and 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 h in buffer A with 0.05% Tween 20. The kinase assay was carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi/ml [32P]ATP, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The gel was washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, dried, and exposed to film. A separate gel with no HIS-IκB-α was assayed as a control. Male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats 150–175 g were used. A 1% suspension of carrageenan (Marine Colloids, Springfield, MA) in distilled water was administered to rats as 0.1 ml subplantar injection into the footpad of the right hind paw as described previously (42Gerritsen M.E. Carley W.W. Ranges G.E. Shen C.-P. Phan S.A. Lignon G.L. Perry C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 278-292PubMed Google Scholar). One h prior to injection rats were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle (polyethylglycol 400 diluted 1:5 in 5% bovine serum albumin/H2O) or a fine suspension of compound 2 (1, 5, or 50 mg/kg) in vehicle. A positive control group was also included in which rats were pretreated with 20 mg/kg ibuprofen. Four hours after carrageenan administration, the volume of the injected paw was measured by means of a water displacement plethysmograph. Edema volumes were determined as the difference between the paw volumes of each rat at time 0 and 4 h. Each group contained five animals. Data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance and, if indicated, differences between groups analyzed by Bonferroni's modifiedt test. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Inbred, male Lewis rats 8–10 weeks of age weighing 250–275 g were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Five animals per group were used, and the animals were allowed to feed ad libitum on laboratory rat chow and water. Heat-inactivated Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco) was suspended at 10 mg/ml in mineral oil (Purepac Lubinol, Purepac Pharmaceuticals, Elizabeth, NJ) and administered as 0.1-ml injection (1 mg/animal) at the base of the tail. Paw volumes were determined by a water displacement plethysmograph as described above. Volumes were determined on the indicated dates and values compared with initial time 0 measurements. Vehicle (0.5% methyl cellulose) or drug (compound 2 or dexamethasone at the indicated concentrations) was administered once a day as an intraperitoneal injection (200 μl). Data from these studies are expressed as the mean difference in foot pad volume. At day 20 animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Two structurally related compounds, compound 1 and compound 2 (Fig. 1), were identified as inhibitors of cytokine-induced surface expression of ICAM-1 as measured by fluorescence immunoassay as described by Gerritsen et al. (42Gerritsen M.E. Carley W.W. Ranges G.E. Shen C.-P. Phan S.A. Lignon G.L. Perry C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 278-292PubMed Google Scholar). Drug effects on TNFα-induced surface expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were determined by fluorescence immunoassay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Compound 1 and compound 2 inhibited the surface expression of all three adhesion molecules with IC50 values in the range of 5–10 μm (Fig. 2). To determine whether the effects of the test compounds were reversible, we compared E-selectin levels in cells stimulated with TNFα in the presence of compound 1 (10 μm) with the levels obtained when the cells were pretreated with compound 1 followed by a 1 h “washout” period and then a 3-h stimulation with TNFα in the absence of test drug. Treatment of HUVEC with 10 μm compound inhibited E-selectin expression by 57% and a similar level of inhibition was seen when the drug was “washed out” prior to TNFα treatment (Fig. 3). Thus, compound 1 irreversibly inhibits surface expression of E-selectin. Other effects of compound 1 were reversible (see below) suggesting that the inability to reverse the inhibition of TNFα-induced E-selectin expression was not due to retention of the compound by the cell. There was no detectable cytotoxicity as measured by MTT assay even after 16 h treatment of cells with this dose (10 μm) of the test compound (IC50 in the MTT assay ranged from 25–38 μm). Thus, it is likely that the drug irreversibly modifies a cellular target.Figure 3Irreversible inhibition of E-selectin surface expression. HUVEC were incubated with 100 units/ml TNFα for 3 h. The test drug (10 μm) was added at the indicated times after the initiation of TNFα treatment (0, drug added simultaneously with TNFα; .25, drug added 0.25 h after TNFα). For the wash out experiment HUVEC were pretreated with drug (10 μm) for 1 h followed by three washes with media alone and then incubated with TNFα in the absence of drug for 3 h. Results of fluorescence immunoassays are presented as mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also determined whether the test compounds could inhibit E-selectin surface expression when added after initiation of TNFα treatment. Maximal inhibition occurred when the test compound was included from the start of the TNFα induction period, and no significant inhibition was observed when the test compound was added after 1 h (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the drug acting rapidly and irreversibly within the 1st h of the TNFα induction. Additionally, we determined whether the test compounds could inhibit cytokine production, as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules. Compounds 1 and 2 also reduced TNFα-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was greater than 50% at 10 μm and virtually complete at 25 μm (data not shown). The TNFα-induced expression of adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 requires the transcription factor NF-κB (5Lewis H. Kaszubska W. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, we evaluated the test compounds for effects on nuclear translocation of NF-κB. We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine the levels of NF-κB in nuclear extracts from HUVEC treated with TNFα in the presence of compound 1 or compound 2. As previously observed, TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB occurs within 15 min in the absence of test compound (Fig. 4 A, lane 2 and Fig. 4 B, lane 2). At 20 μm, both test compounds completely inhibited nuclear NF-κB (Fig. 4 A, lane 4, Fig. 4 B, lane 3). A lower dose of compound 1 (10 μm) also reduced nuclear NF-κB (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The TNFα-induced regulation of NF-κB involves the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor, IκB-α (16Beg A. Finco T. Nantermet P. Baldwin A. Mol. Cell.

In endothelial cells, the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α have been shown to occur within 15 min of TNFα treatment allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it can activate gene expression (8Read M. Whitley M. Williams A. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To determine whether the test compounds may affect TNFα-inducible phosphorylation and/or degradation of IκB-α, we examined the levels of IκB-α in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells pretreated with increasing concentrations of test compounds and then stimulated with TNFα for 15 min. The results of Western blot analysis of endothelial cytoplasmic extracts using IκBα-specific antisera are shown in Fig. 5. A 37-kDa protein was detected in cytoplasmic extracts from unstimulated cells (Fig. 5,lane 1). Treatment of HUVEC with TNFα led to a rapid loss of IκB-α from the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, lane 2). Both test compounds stabilized IκB-α in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of approximately 10 μm(Fig. 5, lanes 3–5). There was a clear correlation between the concentration of drug that stabilized IκB-α, the concentration that inhibited nuclear levels of NF-κB, and the concentration that inhibited adhesion molecule expression. The levels of p38 were not significantly affected by the test compounds (Fig. 5) suggesting that these agents did not result in nonspecific effects on protein stability. In addition, these concentrations of test compounds did not affect protein synthesis as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation into 5% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein. The effects of test compounds on levels of IκB-α protein could be due to an inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation or a block of degradation. To determine whether these agents affect IκB-α phosphorylation, we examined the IκB-α levels in cells treated with both compound 1 and the proteosome inhibitor carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal-H (MG115) (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7).

In this study we show that 25 μm C6-ceramide induced significant H2O2 production within 60 min, which increased up to 180 min in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. Inactive analogue dihydro-C6-ceramide had no effect. Furthermore, no H2O2 production was observed in C6-ceramide-treated U937 ρ° cells, which are mitochondrial respiration-deficient. We also present evidence that ceramide-induced activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 is mediated by mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species. Both H2O2 production, transcription factor activation as well as apoptosis could be inhibited by rotenone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (specific mitochondrial complexes I and II inhibitors) and antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. These effects could be potentiated by antimycin A (specific complex III mitochondrial inhibitor). H2O2 production was also inhibitable by ruthenium red, suggesting a role of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis alterations in ceramide-induced oxidative stress.

The observation that cell-permeant ceramides or natural ceramide (generated by treating cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase) could mimic the biological effects of most SPM-ceramide cycle agonists has provided significant weight as to the role of ceramide in signal transduction. Finally, ceramide has been shown to exert a wide range of biological effects, depending on the cellular model, including cell activation, mitogenic signaling, survival promoting effect, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. As an example, ceramide has been described to induce growth inhibition in Molt-4 cells (14Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawaska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) and lymphoblastoid (16Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl.

Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) cells.The multiplicity of biological activities of ceramide suggests that it possesses several downstream targets, which, in turn, mediate distinct intracellular pathways. Among these targets there may be a serine-threonine phosphatase termed ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (17Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or a proline-directed protein kinase termed ceramide-activated protein kinase (18Mathias S. Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which, in turn, could activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in U937 cells (19Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Ceramide has also been described to activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/c-Jun kinase), which may be more closely related to ceramide-induced apoptosis in U937 and in endothelial cells (9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). In addition, ceramide has been shown to activate transcription factors such as NF-κB (20Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) and AP-1, which could also play an important role since, for example, inhibitors of AP-1 activation or antisense oligonucleotides for c-jun prevented ceramide-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells (21Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to what extent these various signaling proteins are directly or indirectly involved within the SPM-ceramide pathway remains elusive.Despite the characterization of various biochemical changes associated with the SPM-ceramide signaling, such as apoptosis, a consensus on the sequence of cellular events has not been reached. However, there is mounting evidence that radical oxygen species (ROS) may be central (22Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Indeed, ROS are involved in apoptosis induced by agents such as TNF-α (23Larrick J.W. Wright S.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), UV light (24Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), ionizing radiation (25Manome Y. Datta R. Taneja N. Shafman T. Bump E. Hass R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10607-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and anthracyclines (26Quillet-Mary A. Mansat V. Duchayne E. Come M.G. Allouche M. Bailly J.D. Bordier C. Laurent G. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar), which have been all documented to activate the sphingomyelin cycle. Furthermore, ROS themselves, such as low doses of H2O2, or prooxidant conditions, such as UV or γ-irradiation, activate signaling pathways and transcription factors that have been involved in ceramide-induced apoptosis such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (27Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar) or stress-activated protein kinases cascades (28Shafman T.D. Saleem A. Kyriakis J. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3242-3245PubMed Google Scholar) as well as AP-1 and NF-κB activation (for review, see Ref. 29Weichselbaum R.R. Hallahan D. Fuks Z. Kufe D. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1994; 30: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidant production has been shown to be accompanied by cell death triggered by a cell permeant ceramide (C2-ceramide) in lymphoid B cells (30Fang W. Rivard J.J. Ganser J.A. LeBien T.W. Nath K.A. Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 66-75PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations suggest ROS as a common mediator in ceramide-induced apoptosis.Here we show that C6-ceramide induces intracellular H2O2 production followed by DNA fragmentation in U937 cells whereas the inactive analogue (dihydro-C6 ceramide) was ineffective. Ceramide-induced apoptosis was inhibited by ROS scavengers such as dithiocarbamates (PDTC) and N-acetylcysteine, a thiol antioxidant and a glutathione (GSH) precursor. In this study, we provide evidence that H2O2 is produced at the ubiquinone site of the mitochondrial respiratory chain with mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis alterations followed by disregulation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Finally, we show that C6-ceramide could activate the transcriptional factor NF-κB and AP-1 via mitochondrial ROS production.DISCUSSIONROS are produced in all mammalian cells, partly as a result of normal cellular metabolism and in response to various stimuli. ROS comprise essentially the superoxide anion radical (O·̄2), H2O2 which is a catalytically derived intermediate in the conversion of O·̄2 to H2O and O2, and the hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) which is a by-product of both O·̄2 and H2O2 in iron-dependent radical reactions (45Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar). In our study, we demonstrate that a cell-permeant ceramide (C6-ceramide) induced intracellular H2O2 accumulation in U937 cells. This H2O2 generation was significant at 1 h, and preceded ICE activation by 3 h. C6-Ceramide-mediated ROS appeared specific since dihydro-C6-ceramide was essentially ineffective in generating H2O2.Since ceramide does not possess a prooxidant chemical structure, we hypothesized that ceramide acted by stimulating ROS production within cells or cell organelles. We observed that glucose deprivation and addition of deoxyglucose did not change ceramide-induced H2O2 production. These data rule out a role for the cytosolic pentose cycle in C6-ceramide-induced H2O2 production in U937 cells. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that C6-ceramide could inhibit catalase, leading to H2O2 overproduction. In our experiments (not shown), we observed no differences in catalase activity, measuring by continuous recording of the absorbance at 240 nm of a 10 mmsolution of H2O2, in extracts from U937 cells treated or not with C6-ceramide. Several lines of evidence suggested that mitochondria could be involved in ceramide-induced H2O2 production. Indeed, ROS are produced at a high rate as a by-product of aerobic metabolism in mitochondria, which, in fact, constitute the greatest source of ROS as the mitochondrial electron transport system consumes 85–90% of the oxygen utilized by the cell (46Shigenaga M.K.T. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). Intrinsic to this process is the generation of ROS derived from specific segments of the electron transport chain, mainly at the ubiquinone site in complex III. This site catalyzes the conversion of O2 to O·̄2 and, in turn, can lead to the formation of other potent oxygen-derived free radicals (47Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). In fact, our study shows that inhibition of the electron transport at complex I by rotenone resulted in a reduction in ceramide-induced H2O2 accumulation. This suggests that ceramide-induced H2O2 production was distal to complex I. Inhibition at complex II by TTFA also decreased ceramide-induced H2O2 production, suggesting that ceramide did not interfere with complex II function. However, when electron flow was inhibited distal to the ubiquinone pool, by the addition of antimycin A, a marked potentiation of both H2O2 production and DNA fragmentation was observed. Moreover, the observation that C6-ceramide did not lead to H2O2 generation in U937 ρ° cells strongly argues for a mitochondrial electron transport origin for H2O2. Taken together, these results imply that ceramide-induced H2O2 production is centered at the ubiquinone site of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is the only non-protein component of the electron transport chain that can capture one or two electrons, thereby forming ubiquinol (hydroquinone). Since the ubiquinone molecule is not tightly bound to proteins, it can play a strategic role as a mobile carrier of electrons. The function of ubiquinone as a H2O2-producing site is not surprising, since it has previously been shown that the mitochondrial respiratory chain generates superoxide anion secondary to the interruption of electron flow between the rotenone- and antimycin-sensitive sites through one-electron reduction (36Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stroppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 37Cadenas E. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 38Konstantinov A.A. Peskin A.V. Popova E.Y. Khomutov G.B. Ruuge E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Cino M. Del Maestro R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Another respiratory linked function of the mitochondrion is Ca2+ accumulation that has been described to be mediated by a RR-sensitive uniporter (48Nicholls D.G. Akerman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In the last few years a correlation between transmembrane mitochondrial Ca2+ exchange and oxidative stress has been discovered; most reports suggest that oxidative stress may induce the release of mitochondrial Ca2+ via a Na+-independent pathway (41Richter C. Kass G.E.N. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1991; 77: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Conversely, other studies have suggested that alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis may initiate oxidative stress. Thus, it has been reported that an increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration in isolated hepatocytes results in the depletion of mitochondrial GSH, probably as a result of mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling. More recently, RR attenuated doxorubicin-induced ROS in isolated heart mitochondria, suggesting that alteration in mitochondrial Ca2+ transport may be involved in the release of ROS (49Chacon E. Acosta D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1991; 107: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our study shows that RR inhibited H2O2 production in ceramide-treated cells, suggesting that ceramide induced mitochondrial Ca2+homeostasis alterations which, in turn, could be involved in ceramide-induced oxidative stress. Our experiments using flow cytometry and the calcium-specific INDO-1 AM fluorescent probe (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (50Gil M.L. Vita N. Lebel-Binay S. Miloux B. Chalon P. Kaghad M. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Conjeaud H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Fradelizi D. Quillet-Mary A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2826-2833PubMed Google Scholar), in C6-ceramide-treated U937 cells (not shown) and two earlier reports in fibroblasts and T cells have shown that permeant ceramides had no effect on whole cellular Ca2+ content (51Chao C.P. Laulerderkind J.F. Ballou L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,52Breittmayer J.-P. Bernard A. Aussel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5054-5058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In our study, we attempted to determine if ROS were important in ceramide signal transduction. We observed thatN-acetylcysteine or PDTC, two potent antioxidants, significantly decreased in parallel both H2O2production and ceramide-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, rotenone decreased, whereas antimycin A increased ceramide-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Therefore it appears that mitochondrial ROS production is involved in these processes. However, it should be noted that N-acetylcysteine, PDTC, and rotenone significantly decreased but did not abrogate ceramide-induced DNA fragmentation. This observation can be related to the inability of antioxidants to totally block ceramide-induced H2O2 production. Alternatively, it is conceivable that ROS mediated some but not all the multiple downstream signaling cascades activated by ceramide and that other mediators also play an important role in ceramide-induced apoptosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of ROS produced by ceramide on ceramide-activated protein kinase and ceramide-activated protein phosphatase activities as well as their role in the activation of downstream signaling events that have been involved in ceramide-induced apoptosis such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinases cascade activation.By altering the generation of ROS through inhibition of the electron transport chain and Ca2+ homeostasis, our study demonstrates a potentially significant role of ROS in triggering downstream signaling cascades leading to apoptosis in U937 cells. It has recently been reported that apoptosis is preceded by a sequential disregulation of mitochondrial functions, characterized by an initial reduction of ΔΨm followed by a rotenone- and RR-sensitive ROS production in U937 cells treated with TNF-α (34Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsh T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). In our study we found that ceramide-induced H2O2 production (1 h) largely preceded reduction of ΔΨmq, which in fact occurred mainly at 20 h. This suggests that the initial ROS generation produced a ripple effect consisting in the loss of ΔΨm of mitochondria, which, in turn, may accelerate the ongoing cell death process through self-amplification of ROS production and Ca2+ homeostasis disturbances. Altogether our study suggests that mitochondrial ROS production may represent a crucial event for ceramide-induced signaling and apoptosis.ROS have largely been described as potent activators of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1 (21Sawai H.

It has also recently been reported that inhibition of mitochondrial complex III by antimycin A led to a 2–3-fold NF-κB activation as assessed by gel shift assays and that depletion of mitochondrial GSH with diethylmaleate further increased antimycin-induced NF-κB activation (55Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834PubMed Google Scholar). These important studies strongly suggest that oxidative stress within mitochondria can promote extramitochondrial activation of NF-κB (55Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, we found that ceramide-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 was blocked not only by N-acetylcysteine or PDTC but also, and at a similar level, by rotenone and TTFA. Conversely, pretreatment with antimycin A led to further enhancement of ceramide-mediated NF-κB and AP-1 activation. These observations suggest a redox regulation of ceramide-induced NF-κB and AP-1 activation, which appeared to be essentially mediated by mitochondrial ROS production.In conclusion, our study shows that C6-ceramide could induce mitochondrial disturbances such as H2O2production, alteration of calcium homeostasis followed by alteration of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In light of these findings, it is conceivable that increased antioxidative defenses through detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione peroxydase, or radical scavengers can decrease the apoptotic effect of ceramide in U937 cells, and that of anti-tumor agents which are SPM-ceramide agonists. In addition, the role of mitochondrial ROS production in ceramide-induced apoptosis could explain the protective effect of Bcl-2 (56Chen M. Quintans J. Fuks Z. Thompson C. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R.

Finally, two very recent studies have proposed a central role for mitochondrial cytochrome c release within the apoptotic signaling pathway (60Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.

Therefore, it would be of great interest to determine whether ceramide could directly trigger cytochromec release and if this process is closely related to the electron-transport chain. Ceramide has emerged as a potentially important mediator of a number of natural or pharmacological agents that affect cell growth, viability, and differentiation (1Kolesnick R.N. Prog.

The observation that cell-permeant ceramides or natural ceramide (generated by treating cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase) could mimic the biological effects of most SPM-ceramide cycle agonists has provided significant weight as to the role of ceramide in signal transduction. Finally, ceramide has been shown to exert a wide range of biological effects, depending on the cellular model, including cell activation, mitogenic signaling, survival promoting effect, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. As an example, ceramide has been described to induce growth inhibition in Molt-4 cells (14Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawaska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Although structurally different from cannabinoids, AEA by its ability to activate the central CB1 receptor displays pharmacological properties similar to cannabinoids (2Crawley J.N. Corwin R.L.

Martin B.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its central action via the CB1 receptor, AEA displays potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities by interacting with peripheral CB1 and/or CB2 receptors (4Schwartz H. Blanco F.J. Lotz M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 55: 107-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Stefano G.B. Liu Y. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol.

Natarajan V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholarfor a review) and could interact with CB receptors to display some of its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, AEA is also stored esterified to phosphatidylethanolamines and is released by the action of phospholipase D in response to various stimuli (7Schmid H.H.O. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The AEA thus released inside the cell could participate in signal transduction as a second messenger and display some of its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities independent of its interaction with the CB receptors. In fact, AEA has been shown to antagonize CB2 receptors, and it is not clear how this antagonism results in immunomodulatory activities observed in cells only expressing CB2 receptors (8Barnette-Curley D. Cabral G.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that a metabolite of AEA rather than AEA itself could account for all or some of these properties. Furthermore, because of its structural similarities to polyunsaturated fatty acids, endogenously released AEA could serve as substrate for lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases (COX) that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to potent bioactive molecules. It has been demonstrated that lipoxygenase could metabolize AEA, and the metabolites have potent biological activities (9Hapson A.J. Hill W.A.G. Zan-Phillips M. Makriyannis A. Leung E. Eglen R.C.

Arachidonic acid (AA) is the substrate for both COX-1 and COX-2. AEA is structurally identical to AA except that the carboxylic acid group of AA is replaced by an ethanolamide group in AEA. Here, we report for the first time the ability of hCOX-2 but not hCOX-1 to bind and oxidize AEA. We further demonstrate that the products of AEA metabolism by COX-2 are unique and represent a novel class of eicosanoids. Unlabeled AA, PGE2, AEA, and PGE2 ethanolamide were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (specific radioactivity, 55–56 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. [1-14C]Arachidonoyl ethanolamide (specific radioactivity, 55–56 mCi/mmol) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Masjedizadeh (Roche Bioscience, Radiochemistry Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant human COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were expressed in a baculovirus system and partially purified as described previously (16Kurumbali R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A.

The specific activity of the enzymes used were between 13,000 and 21,000 units (1 unit = 1 nmol of oxygen consumed/mg of protein/min) with a purity of ≈60% as judged by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The purified COX enzymes were reconstituted with 2 mm phenol and 1 μmhematin (Sigma), and the cyclooxygenase activity was measured either by the oxygen uptake assay or by the radiometric assay exactly as described previously (17Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen O. Nguyen B. Tsin S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 109: 130-139Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Km values were determined radiometrically using 2–200 μm 1-14C-labeled AA or AEA (specific activity, 3–4 × 105 cpm/nmol). For characterization of the metabolites by RP-HPLC, reconstituted hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 enzymes were incubated in a total volume of 100 μl with 40 μm [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]AEA (specific activity, 3–4 × 105 cpm/nmol) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 2 n HCl and 1 volume of methanol. An aliquot (50–75 μl) was directly injected and analyzed by HPLC as described below. For characterization of the metabolites by HPLC-MS, unlabeled AA and AEA were used and processed as above for RP-HPLC studies. Human promonocytic THP cells were grown in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed, and suspended in fresh RPMI medium. COX-1 was induced by treating cells with 0.1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) for 40–48 h at 37 °C. Primary cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were obtained from ATCC and grown to about 70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then treated with 0.1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem) and 10 ng/ml interleukin-1α (Sigma) to induce COX-2 (18Raz A. Wyche A. Siegel N. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3022-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COX-1-expressing THP cells and COX-2-expressing HFF cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8) containing 2 mm EDTA. Cells (5–8 × 104 cells) were incubated with 50–100 μm of either [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]AEA (specific activity, 3–4 × 105 cpm/nmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of isopropanol:acetic acid (100:1.2, v/v) and 1 volume of chloroform. The tubes were mixed by vortexing and centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min); the lower chloroform layer was aspirated and concentrated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 200 μl of methanol and analyzed by HPLC as described below. Following COX-2 induction, HFF cells were detached by treating with trypsin and washing with phosphate-buffered saline. COX-1-expressing THP cells and COX-2-expressing HFF cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Cells were lysed by homogenization, and the cell lysate was stored on ice until used. Lysates (200–400 μg) from COX-1- or COX-2-expressing cells were incubated with either [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]AEA (40 μm) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped and processed as described above for intact cells. Products from the reaction of [14C]AA and [14C]AEA with purified hCOX-1 and hCOX-2, intact cells, and the cell lysates were separated using a Shimadzu LC-6A HPLC system. RP-HPLC was carried out on a Waters μBondapak C18 column (300 × 3.9 mm, 10-μm particle size) using solvent A (water/trifluoroacetic acid, 100:0.05, v/v) and solvent B (acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, 100:0.05, v/v). The initial settings were 30% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, which was linearly increased to 60% solvent B in the next 30 min, held there for an additional 5 min, linearly increased to 100% solvent B in the next 10 min, and held there for 9 min. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, and the total run time was 60 min. The radioactivity in the column effluent was detected using an on-line Beckman 171 radioactivity detector. The signals from the detector were acquired, stored, and analyzed using Ezychrome software (Shimadzu, Pleasanton, CA). HPLC was performed using a model 140B Applied Biosystems liquid chromatograph with a C-18 Vydac 2.1 × 250-mm column using solvent C (water/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 90:10:0.01, v/v) and solvent D (methanol). The initial settings were 35% solvent B from 0 to 3 min, which was linearly increased to 100% solvent B in the next 57 min and held there for 5 min, and the flow rate was 200 μl/min. The injector was a model 7725i Rheodyne with a 100-μl injection loop. A total of 20 μl of sample was injected on the column. The HPLC flow was sent directly into a Finnigan TSQ 700 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode with a vaporizer temperature of 400 °C and a heated capillary temperature of 150 °C. Nitrogen was used as a sheath gas at 75 p.s.i. to assist in nebulization. The instrument was scanned fromm/z 100 to 750 in 2 s. Data were acquired on a DEC station 5000 data system. There is considerable interest in recent years in understanding the metabolism of AEA as a mechanism of termination of its potent neuromodulatory and immunomodulatory activities. The principal mode of metabolism of AEA appears to be an amidohydrolase-mediated hydrolysis to AA and ethanolamine (19Ueda N. Kurahashi Y. Yamamoto S. Tokunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23823-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Here we test the ability of COX enzymes to metabolize AEA. Fig. 1 shows the relative initial rates of oxygenation of AA and AEA by recombinant hCOX-1 and hCOX-2. Both enzymes effectively oxygenated AA. In contrast, COX-2 oxygenated AEA at 60–85% of the rates observed with AA, whereas COX-1 displayed no detectable activity against this substrate. Using the more sensitive radiometric method (17Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen O. Nguyen B. Tsin S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 109: 130-139Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar) no activity was detected for COX-1 with AEA as substrate (data not shown). Furthermore, when 2–5 molar excess unlabeled AEA was added along with [1-14C]AA, no inhibition of AA metabolism by COX-1 was observed suggesting that not only is AEA not a substrate for COX-1 but it also fails to compete with AA for binding to the enzyme active site (data not shown). The affinity of hCOX-2 for AEA was consistently lower than that for AA as evident form the mean Km values for the two substrates (Table I). The initial rates of oxygenation of AEA by COX-2 were also consistently lower than that of AA but did not achieve statistical significance because of batch to batch variations in the specific activities of COX-2. Furthermore, as with AA, COX-2 underwent inactivation following oxygenation of AEA (data not shown). With both AA and AEA as substrate, the COX-2 enzyme turned over ≈250–400 times before it inactivated. Thus, it appears that the mechanism involved in the oxidation of AEA by COX-2 is similar to that of AA.Table IKinetic parameters of hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 for AA and AEA substratesSubstratehCOX-1hCOX-2KmSpecific activity1-aSpecific activity is the initial rate expressed as μmol of oxygen consumed/mg of protein/min and is the average of two determinations (COX-1) or mean ± S.D. of three determinations (COX-2).KmSpecific activityAA5.1 ± 1.218.25.8 ± 1.317.3 ± 6.2AEAND1-bNot determined.23.7 ± 5.712.5 ± 7.9Partially purified hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 enzymes were reconstituted with phenol and heme as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Km values were determined radiometrically using 2–200 μm of [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]AEA, whereas the specific activity was determined with the O2electrode assay using 100 μm of unlabeled AA or AEA.1-a Specific activity is the initial rate expressed as μmol of oxygen consumed/mg of protein/min and is the average of two determinations (COX-1) or mean ± S.D. of three determinations (COX-2).1-b Not determined.

Next, to characterize the metabolites, the reaction products of AEA with COX-2 were analyzed by HPLC. Fig. 2shows the RP-HPLC profiles of the metabolites of the reaction of hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 with the 14C-labeled AA and AEA. Once again, it is clear that hCOX-1 was unable to use AEA as substrate (Fig. 2 B), whereas it effectively converted AA into one major product (Fig. 2 A, peak 3) that comigrated with the [3H]PGE2 standard. Small amounts of minor metabolites (peaks 4–8) were also formed. The concentrations of these minor metabolites varied from assay to assay and represented <1–5% of the total radioactivity. In contrast to hCOX-1, hCOX-2 effectively oxygenated both AA and AEA as substrates (Fig. 2, C and D). The profiles of the products formed from these two substrates by hCOX-2 were similar except for their retention times (compare Fig. 2 C with 2D). Here again, hCOX-2 produced one major metabolite with AA (Fig. 2 C, peak 3) that comigrated with the [3H]PGE2 standard. It also produced significant amounts of other metabolites (peaks 5–8), which is in agreement with previous reports (21Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Holtzman M.J. Turk J. Shornick L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21438-21445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These minor peaks displayed significant UV absorption at 235 nm, and two of these peaks (peak 6 and 8) had the same retention time as 12-HHT and 15-HETE, respectively. The metabolic profile of the products of hCOX-2 with AEA was very much identical to that with AA, except for shorter retention time because of the ethanolamide group and relative abundance of the individual peaks (Fig. 2 D). The major metabolite of AEA (Fig. 2 D, peak 3a) did not display any UV absorption suggesting that it is unlikely to have conjugated double bonds. To get more structural information, the products of the reaction of hCOX-2 with AA and AEA were subsequently analyzed by LC-MS, and the base peak profiles are shown in Fig. 3. The mass spectra of major peaks of interest are shown in Figs. 4 and5. Peak 3 (Fig. 3 A) displayed a fragmentation ion pattern identical to the synthetic PGE2standard (compare Fig. 4 A with 4B). The base peak at m/z 317 was due to the loss of a –OH group and a molecule of H2O from the molecular ion (M − 35). Other diagnostic fragment ions included M + H2O (atm/z 370), the molecular ion (at m/z 352), and M − OH (at m/z 335). Similarly, peak 3a (Fig. 3 B) displayed a fragmentation ion pattern identical to the synthetic PGE2 ethanolamide (compare Fig. 5 Awith 5B). The base peak at m/z 378 was due to the loss of a –OH group from the molecular ion. Other diagnostic ion fragments included MH+ (at m/z 396), M − (OH + H2O) (at m/z 360) and M − (OH + 2 H2O) (at m/z 342). The fragmentation ion pattern of peak 4a (Fig. 3 B) was identical to that of peak 3a (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that peak 4a is an isomer of PGE2 ethanolamide or PGD2 ethanolamide. Based on the limited fragmentation ions (data not shown), peaks 6, 6a, 8, and 8a (Fig. 3) were tentatively identified as 12-HHT, 12-HHT-ethanolamide, 15-HETE, and 15-HETE-ethanolamide, respectively. Additional studies are needed to confirm their structural identities.Figure 4Mass spectra of PGE2 standard and peak 3.

Furthermore, it seems that in the active site of the enzyme the substrate AEA assumes the same L-shaped configuration and undergoes similar oxidation and cyclization as has been proposed in the case of AA (23Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present we do not know the stereochemistry of the products formed from AEA, and as a result the exact conformation of AEA within the active site of the enzyme may or may not be similar to that of AA. However, it can be presumed that in the case of AA the carboxylate group is anchored at the bottom of the active site channel of COX-2 (as well as COX-1) by a hydrogen bond network involving arginine 120, tyrosine 355, and glutamic acid 524, which is analogous to the way flurbiprofen and zomepirac bind to COX-1 and COX-2, respectively (12Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 13Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.P. Vickers P.J.

Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of a free carboxylate group, AEA effectively bound to COX-2 but not COX-1, which suggests that COX-2 has additional binding site(s) at the bottom of the channel to accommodate non-carboxylic fatty acyl substrates such as AEA. In fact, the recent crystal structure of an inhibitor-bound hCOX-2 shows an alternate salt bridge formation between Tyr-355, Glu-524, and Arg-513 at the bottom of the channel (12Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this network of amino acids helps COX-2 bind AEA. Next, we wanted to test whether cells expressing COX-1 or COX-2 could utilize AEA as substrate and convert it into ethanolamide prostaglandins. Therefore, we incubated HFF cells expressing COX-1 or COX-2 and THP cells expressing COX-1 with 14C-labeled AEA, and the products formed were analyzed by RP-HPLC (Fig. 6). Like the purified enzyme, HFF cells expressing COX-2 effectively oxygenated AEA. The profile of the products formed from AEA by the COX-2-expressing cells was identical to that formed by the purified enzyme (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were also obtained when [14C]AEA was incubated with cell-free preparations of COX-2-expressing HFF cells. On the other hand, neither the intact cells nor the lysates of cells expressing COX-1 oxygenated [14C]AEA (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that AEA is also metabolized by COX-2 in a more physiological environment. At the present time the physiological significance of the metabolism of AEA by COX-2 is not known. Several possible roles for this pathway can be speculated. First, metabolism of AEA by COX-2 is yet another physiological mechanism by which AEA is inactivated. Second, this could be a pathway for generating novel prostaglandins that in turn might have many important pathophysiological functions. Third, by its ability to compete with AA, AEA might modulate the local prostaglandin tone mediated by COX-2. Our future work should provide answers to some of these questions. We thank Drs. David Swinney and Richard Eglen for helpful discussion and comments, M. Masjedizadeh for synthesizing [14C]anandamide, Drs. B. Schwartz and J. Haung for LC-MS analysis, and L. A.

https://openalex.org/W2031504013,"We have previously identified a 160-kDa protein in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin (PY160) (Kuhné, M. R., Zhao, Z., and Lienhard, G. E. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 211, 190–197). The phosphotyrosine form of PY160 was purified from insulin-treated HEK 293 cells by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity chromatography, the sequences of peptides determined, and its cDNA cloned. The PY160 cDNA encodes a 1257-amino acid protein that contains, in order from its N terminus, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and, spread over the C-terminal portion, 12 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Several of these sites are in motifs expected to bind specific SH2 domain-containing proteins: YXXM (7 sites), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; YVNM (1 site), Grb-2; and YIEV (1 site), either the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 or phospholipase Cγ. Furthermore, the PH and PTB domains are highly homologous (at least 40% identical) to those found in insulin receptor substrates 1, 2, and 3 (IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3). Thus, PY160 is a new member of the IRS family, which we have designated IRS-4. We have previously identified a 160-kDa protein in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin (PY160) (Kuhné, M. R., Zhao, Z., and Lienhard, G. E. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 211, 190–197). The phosphotyrosine form of PY160 was purified from insulin-treated HEK 293 cells by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity chromatography, the sequences of peptides determined, and its cDNA cloned. The PY160 cDNA encodes a 1257-amino acid protein that contains, in order from its N terminus, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and, spread over the C-terminal portion, 12 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites.

Furthermore, the PH and PTB domains are highly homologous (at least 40% identical) to those found in insulin receptor substrates 1, 2, and 3 (IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3). Thus, PY160 is a new member of the IRS family, which we have designated IRS-4. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase, which when activated by insulin binding phosphorylates cellular substrates. The most well characterized of these are two members of the IRS 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; SH2, Src homology 2; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); aa, amino acids.1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; SH2, Src homology 2; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); aa, amino acids. family, IRS-1 and IRS-2, and the protein Shc. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS proteins creates binding sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules, including PI 3-kinase, the adapter molecule Grb-2, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Docking of these proteins in turn activates specific signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Recently, we have identified, by purification and cloning, a third member of the IRS family, called IRS-3, which in insulin-treated adipocytes is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with PI 3-kinase (3Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All three IRS family members possess a common domain structure that includes PH and PTB domains at the N terminus and, C-terminal to these, a number of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (1Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Waters S.B. Pessin J.E.

Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The presence of these features can therefore be viewed as defining an IRS. Previously, we have identified a 160-kDa protein in HEK 293 cells, termed PY160, which is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin but which is immunologically unrelated to IRS-1 (6Kuhné M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study we have isolated PY160 from insulin-treated HEK 293 cells and cloned its cDNA. The predicted amino acid sequence shows that PY160 is a new member of the IRS family. HEK 293 cells were grown on 10-cm plates as described previously (6Kuhné M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Before use, confluent plates of cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 2 h and then incubated for 5 min further with either no addition or the addition of 1 μm insulin to activate fully the insulin and IGF-1 receptors present on these cells (7Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Each plate was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 1 ml of 3% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors (10 μm EP475, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 nm pepstatin A, 4 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate)). The lysate was held at 100 °C for 5 min, and the DNA in it was sheared by repeated passage through a syringe needle. Finally, the lysate was diluted by the addition of 5 ml of 3% Triton X-100 in Buffer A; free sulfhydryl groups were capped by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 6.7 mm; and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Aliquots of lysates (1 ml) from basal and insulin-stimulated 293 cells were incubated with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (20 μl of 4G10 agarose from Upstate Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with a wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5% Triton X-100. 0.25% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate with protease inhibitors, pH 7.4), and the Tyr(P)-containing proteins were eluted by the addition of 135 μl of 40 mm phenyl phosphate in the wash buffer. To estimate the recovery of PY160, samples containing the original extract, the depleted extract, and the phenyl phosphate eluate were immunoblotted for Tyr(P), as described (3Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of the Tyr(P) form of PY160 by immunoadsorption from the lysate of insulin-treated cells was approximately 15%. PY160 was purified by anti-Tyr(P) affinity chromatography from an extract derived from a total of thirty-six 10-cm plates of insulin-stimulated HEK 293 cells. In a single purification, half of the extract (110 ml) was passed at 0.2 ml/min through a 1.0-ml column of goat IgG-agarose (Sigma) and then through a 1.5-ml column of immobilized anti-Tyr(P) antibody (4G10 agarose at 1 mg/ml). Once the extract was applied, the goat IgG column was disconnected, and the anti-Tyr(P) column was washed sequentially with (a) 30 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS in wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 0.2 nmpepstatin A)) at 1 ml/min, (b) 30 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in wash buffer with protease inhibitors at 1 ml/min, (c) 300 ml of 0.05% Triton X-100 in wash buffer with protease inhibitors at 0.3 ml/min, and (d) 7 ml of 0.015% sodium deoxycholate in wash buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Elution buffer (3 mm phenyl phosphate, 0.015% sodium deoxycholate in wash buffer) was run onto the column and the flow stopped for 10 min. Tyr(P)-containing proteins were then eluted at 0.5 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected in low protein adsorption tubes (Nunc no. 443990). The purification was repeated with the other half of the lysate, and the two fractions from each preparation containing the bulk of the PY160 were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as detailed in Ref. 3Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The precipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and separated in a single lane on a 7% acrylamide gel. Following transfer to ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems) and staining with Amido Black, the band corresponding to PY160 was excised (about 1.5 μg (10 pmol)). The protein band was subjected to in situ digestion with LysC; the resultant peptides were separated by microbore HPLC; selected fractions were screened by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and microsequenced by the methods described previously (4Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). By UV absorbance, approximately 1–5 pmol of peptides were present in the HPLC separation. Total RNA was obtained from HEK 293 cells using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and mRNA was subsequently purified from it using the Fast-Track kit (Invitrogen). A 10-cm plate of confluent HEK 293 cells yielded about 3 μg of mRNA. A Marathon ReadyTM cDNA library from human fetal kidney was obtained from CLONTECH. The nucleotide sequence encoding the central portion of peptide a (see “Results and Discussion” for peptides) was obtained by PCR amplification. The sequences of the N and C termini of peptide a were used to design degenerate oligonucleotides; restriction sites forEcoRI (sense) and BamHI (antisense) were incorporated to facilitate cloning (5′GCGAATTCYTNGARACNGCNGA3′ and 5′GAGGATCCGCRTTYTCRTARTA3′, where Y is C or T, R is A or G, and N is A, C, G, or T; restriction sites are underlined). cDNA, produced by random hexamer primed reverse transcription of HEK 293 mRNA, was used as the template. A PCR product of the expected size (63 bp) was obtained and cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI site of pBluescript II (SK−). Several clones were sequenced and found to encode the middle portion of the peptide (APARLE; nt 390–408). The 5′-end of the cDNA was obtained in two separate 5′-RACE reactions. In the first, a degenerate antisense primer derived from the C terminus of peptide a (5′TTNCGNGCRTTYTC3′ and 5′TTYCTNGCRTTYTC3′ mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio, respectively) was used to reverse transcribe HEK 293 mRNA. The resulting cDNA was tailed with dCTP and amplified by PCR with an antisense primer derived from the sequence encoding the middle portion of peptide a (5′TCRTARTATTCCAGCCGAGCT3′; exact sequence underlined, see above) and the abridged anchor primer of a 5′-RACE kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The products were reamplified using a nested antisense primer (derived from the N terminus of peptide a (5′TGGGGCGTCNGCNGTYTC3′)) and the abridged universal amplification primer of the kit. A 330-bp product was purified and cloned into pCR-Script (Stratagene), and the sequences of five clones were determined (nt 90–378). In the second 5′-RACE, the Marathon ReadyTM cDNA library from human fetal kidney was amplified with an antisense primer (nt 352–371) and the AP1 primer of the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture was reamplified using a nested antisense primer (nt 270–290) and the AP2 primer of the kit. A mixture of PCR products with a size range of 300–330 bp was purified and sequenced directly (nt 1–267). Upstream of nt 1 the sequence was a mixture; this may reflect heterogeneity in the start point of the PY160 mRNA. The 3′-portion of PY160 cDNA was obtained in a number of 3′-RACE reactions. cDNA was synthesized from HEK 293 mRNA using either degenerate antisense primers derived from the sequences of peptide b (5′XACDATNACYTGCCANACRT3′) and peptide c (5′XTTNCCRAARTARCTNC3′ and 5′XTTNCCRAARTANGANC3′ in a 1:2 molar ratio, respectively) or using oligo(dT) (X(T)17, where X is an adapter sequence 5′GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC3′ and D is A, G, or T). A 550-bp PCR product (produced from amplification of peptide b-primed cDNA using a sense primer (nt 243–260) and the adapter primer) and a 1200-bp PCR product (produced from amplification of peptide c-primed cDNA using a sense primer (nt 754–774) and the adapter primer) were cloned into pCR-Script. The inserts of several clones were sequenced and were found to encode nt 266–774 (peptide b primed) and nt 775–1914 (peptide c primed). The remainder of the sequence was obtained by 3′-RACE using oligo(dT)-primed cDNA. This cDNA was amplified using either of two upstream sense primers (nt 1762–1783 and nt 2956–2978) and the adapter primer. A 1300-bp PCR product was obtained with the nt 1762–1783 primer, while the nt 2956–2978 primer yielded a 980-bp product. These two products which are shorter than the sizes expected from the size of the PY160 mRNA (see “Results and Discussion”) most likely arise due to internal priming by the oligo(dT) primer. The 1300- and 980-bp PCR products were sequenced directly (nt 1840–3052 and nt 2979–3939, respectively). To confirm the DNA sequence, overlapping fragments were generated by PCR amplification of cDNA obtained by random hexamer-primed reverse transcription of total RNA from HEK 293 cells and sequenced directly on both strands (nt 170–637, 598–1124, 1076–1704, 1651–2308, 2139–2889, 2722–3302, and 3200–3898). Sequencing was performed on the Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencing system using the Perkin-Elmer DNA sequencing kit; data were analyzed with the Applied Biosystems software. Homology searches were performed with the BLAST program (8Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar). Treatment of HEK 293 cells with insulin elicits the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of approximately 160 kDa, which is immunologically distinct from IRS-1 (6Kuhné M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of HEK 293 cell lysates with antibodies to IRS-2 detected a protein larger than PY160; this result indicated that PY160 was also not IRS-2 (data not shown). To assess the feasibility of isolating PY160 by anti-Tyr(P) immunoaffinity chromatography, we performed immunoadsorptions with anti-Tyr(P) immobilized on agarose beads. Detergent extracts were prepared from basal and insulin-stimulated HEK 293 cells, incubated in the presence or absence of phenyl phosphate (a ligand competing with Tyr(P)), and then immunoadsorbed with anti-Tyr(P) beads. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with phenyl phosphate and analyzed by immunoblotting and protein staining. Fig. 1 (lanes 1–4) shows the eluted Tyr(P) proteins as detected by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. Two major insulin-elicited Tyr(P) proteins were present. One had the size expected for the Tyr(P) form of PY160. The other, based on its size of about 100 kDa, is most likely a mixture of the tyrosine-phosphorylated β-subunits of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors; both receptors are present in HEK 293 cells, and the latter would be expected to be activated at 1 μm insulin (7Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein staining of the eluates showed a single major protein, which co-migrated with the Tyr(P) form of PY160 (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8). The recovery of this protein from extracts of basal and insulin-treated cells paralleled the recovery of the Tyr(P) form of PY160; this indicates that the protein was PY160 (Fig. 1, compare lanes 5 and6 with lanes 1 and 2). The binding to the anti-Tyr(P) beads was specific; no proteins were present in the eluates from anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates of lysates preincubated with phenyl phosphate (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4 and7 and 8). The results in Fig. 1 showed that it would be possible to purify PY160 from HEK 293 cells by anti-Tyr(P) chromatography in an amount sufficient to obtain peptide sequences. A large scale purification was performed by a slight modification of a method that we previously used to purify Tyr(P) proteins from insulin-treated adipocytes (3Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). This yielded sufficient PY160 to allow determination of the sequences of five peptides: a, LETADAPARLEYYENARK; b, DVWQVIVK; c, RSYFGK; d, FLGRGLDK; and e, EVSYNWDPK (see Fig. 2). A search of the data base using the BLAST program revealed that peptides a and b had significant homology with sequences in IRS-1. PCR products representing PY160 were obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions using HEK 293 mRNA or a human fetal kidney cDNA library, and their sequences were determined. The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of PY160 are presented in Fig. 2. An open reading frame extending from nt 79 to 3852 encodes a 1257-amino acid polypeptide that contains the sequences of all five PY160 LysC peptides. It is not certain that the ATG codon at nt 79–81 initiates translation, since an alternative downstream ATG codon at nt 238–240 also conforms to the human Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (9Dalphin M.E. Brown C.M. Stockwell P.A. Tate W.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although there is no in-frame stop codon upstream of the first ATG codon, the murine gene for PY160 has an in-frame stop codon 117 nt upstream of the ATG codon corresponding to nt 79–81 in the human sequence (data not shown). It is therefore likely that initiation occurs at either of these two ATG codons. If the first ATG codon is used, the predicted molecular mass of PY160 is 133.8 kDa, a value that is smaller than the size of approximately 160 kDa for the Tyr(P) form estimated by SDS gel electrophoresis. The explanation for the difference is most likely an aberrantly low mobility on electrophoresis, as is the case for IRS-1 (10Keller S.R. Aebersold R. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fact that no consensus polyadenylation sequence is present at the 3′-end of the cDNA shown indicates that the 3′-untranslated sequence extends further. In agreement with this conclusion, Northern analysis of HEK 293 mRNA using either of two probes derived from the PY160 cDNA (nt 104–369 and 1428–1895) detects messages of 6 and 10 kilonucleotides (data not shown). Two lines of evidence show that the predicted protein is PY160. First, as described below, the structure of the protein is that expected for a substrate of the insulin receptor. Second, we have prepared affinity-purified antibodies against the C-terminal peptide (16 amino acids) of the predicted protein and used these to show its identity with PY160. Lysates from untreated and insulin-treated 293 cells were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against the C-terminal peptide, and then immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies against Tyr(P) as well as those against the C-terminal peptide. The immunoprecipitates from the untreated and insulin-treated cells contained equal amounts of a 160-kDa protein, as detected with the antibodies against the peptide, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly enhanced in insulin-treated cells (data not shown). A comparison of the amino acid sequence of PY160 with the data base and an examination for the presence of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites revealed that PY160 contains, in order from its N terminus, a PH domain, a PTB domain, and spread over the C-terminal portion, 12 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3 A). This architecture is the same as that of the three known members of the IRS family (see the Introduction). Therefore, PY160 is a new member of the IRS family, and henceforth we refer to it as IRS-4. IRS-4 is of a similar length (1257 aa) to both IRS-1 and IRS-2 (1242 aa for human IRS-1 and 1321 aa for mouse IRS-2 (5Sun X.J. Wang L-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar)). Overall IRS-4 displays limited sequence identity with IRS-1 and IRS-2 (27 and 29%, respectively). However, significant homology is found in the PH and PTB domains. The PH domain of IRS-4 consists of 120 amino acids (residues 78–197) and exhibits a high degree of homology with the domain in IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 (49, 50, and 43% identity, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). This high degree of conservation suggests a common function for the PH domain in IRS family members. In IRS-1, the PH domain is necessary for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation by the insulin receptor in vivo, although it does not appear to interact directly with the receptor (11Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L-M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. J. Biol.

The PTB domain of IRS-4 consists of 101 amino acids (residues 231–331) and exhibits a high degree of homology with this domain in IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 (66, 62, and 43% identity, respectively). The crystal structure of the IRS-1 PTB domain complexed with a 9-residue Tyr(P) peptide modeled on the residues surrounding Tyr-960 in the insulin receptor has been determined (14Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Of interest, 13 out of the 15 amino acids in IRS-1 that interact with the bound peptide are identical in IRS-4, including the two arginines whose guanidinium groups contact the phosphate of the Tyr(P) residue (Fig. 3 B). Thus, it is likely that the PTB domain in IRS-4 will also be found to bind to the activated insulin receptor by association with the Tyr(P) 960 segment. Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 contain non-PTB domains, which are important for interaction with the insulin receptor. These are a domain immediately downstream of the PTB domain, referred to as the SAIN domain (residues 313–462 in human IRS-1 and by homology residues 349–535 in mouse IRS-2), and a second domain C-terminal to the SAIN domain that is present only in IRS-2 (residues 591–786) (13Yenush L.

It will be of interest to determine if these regions in IRS-4 also interact with the insulin receptor. Among the 12 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in IRS-4, seven are in YXXM motifs (Tyr-487, -700, -717, -743, -779, -828, and -921) (Fig. 3 A). This motif, in its Tyr(P) state, binds to the SH2 domains of the PI 3-kinase 85-kDa subunit (18Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S.

IRS-4 also contains a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr-921) in a motif that is expected to bind the SH2 domain of Grb-2, the adapter for Sos (the GDP-releasing factor for Ras), and another site (Tyr-1015) in the motif expected to bind the N-terminal SH2 domain of either the Tyr(P) phosphatase SHP-2 or phospholipase Cγ (18Songyang Z.

https://openalex.org/W1512688896,"In cytosols from animal and plant cells, the abundant heat shock protein hsp90 is associated with several proteins that act together to assemble steroid receptors into receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes. We have reconstituted a minimal receptor·hsp90 assembly system containing four required components, hsp90, hsp70, p60, and p23 (Dittmar, K. D., Hutchison, K. A., Owens-Grillo, J. K., and Pratt, W. B. (1996) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 12833–12839). We have shown that hsp90, p60, and hsp70 are sufficient for carrying out the folding change that converts the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) hormone binding domain (HBD) from a non-steroid binding to a steroid binding conformation, but to form stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes, p23 must also be present in the incubation mix (Dittmar, K. D., and Pratt, W. B. (1997)<i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 272, 13047–13054). In this work, we show that addition of p23 to native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol or to GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes prepared with the minimal (hsp90·p60·hsp70) assembly system inhibits both receptor heterocomplex disassembly and loss of steroid binding activity. p23 stabilizes the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex in a dynamic and ATP-independent manner. In contrast to hsp90 that is bound to the GR, free hsp90 binds p23 in an ATP-dependent manner, and hsp90 in the hsp90·p60·hsp70 heterocomplex is in a conformation that does not bind p23 at all. The effect of p23 in the minimal GR heterocomplex assembly system is to stabilize GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes once they are formed and it does not appear to affect the rate of heterocomplex assembly. Molybdate has the same ability as p23 to stabilize GR heterocomplexes with mammalian hsp90, but GR heterocomplexes with plant hsp90 are stabilized by p23 and not by molybdate. We propose that incubation of the GR with hsp90·p60·hsp70 forms a GR·hsp90 heterocomplex in which hsp90 is in an ATP-dependent conformation. The ATP-dependent conformation of hsp90 is required for the hormone binding domain to have a steroid binding site, and binding of p23 to that state of hsp90 stabilizes the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex to inactivation and disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2087345689,"Abstract High levels of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp), generated in response to amino acid starvation in Escherichia coli, lead to massive accumulations of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP). Inasmuch as the activities of the principal enzymes that synthesize and degrade polyP fluctuate only slightly, the polyP accumulation can be attributed to a singular and profound inhibition by pppGpp and/or ppGpp of the hydrolytic breakdown of polyP by exopolyphosphatase, thereby blocking the dynamic turnover of polyP. The K ivalues of 10 μm for pppGpp and 200 μm for ppGpp are far below the concentrations of these nucleotides in nutritionally stressed cells. In the complex metabolic network of pppGpp and ppGpp, the greater inhibitory effect of pppGpp (compared with ppGpp) leading to the accumulation of polyP, may have some significance in the relative roles played by these regulatory compounds."

Some human cancers and cell lines derived from them also express trypsinogen, but the function of the extrapancreatic trypsin has remained unclear. In this study we cloned and sequenced trypsinogen-2 cDNA from human COLO 205 colon carcinoma cells and characterized the ability of the enzyme to activate latent human type IV procollagenases (proMMP-2 and proMMP-9). As shown by cloning and N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the amino acid sequence of tumor-associated trypsin-2 is identical to that of pancreatic trypsin-2. We found that both pancreatic trypsin-2 and tumor cell-derived trypsin-2 are efficient activators of proMMP-9 and are capable of activating proMMP-9 at a molar ratio of 1:1000, the lowest reported so far. Human trypsin-2 was a more efficient activator than widely used bovine trypsin and converted the 92-kDa proMMP-9 to a single 77-kDa product that was not fragmented further. The single peptide bond cleaved by trypsin-2 in proMMP-9 was Arg87-Phe88. The generation of the 77-kDa species coincided with the increase in specific activity of MMP-9. In contrast, trypsin-2 only partially activated proMMP-2. Trypsin-2 cleaved the Arg99-Lys100 peptide bond of proMMP-2 generating 62–65-kDa MMP-2 species. Trypsin-2-induced proMMP-2 and -9 conversions were inhibited by tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor added either prior to or during activation indicating that proMMPs were not activated autocatalytically. Trypsin-2 also activated proMMPs associated with tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, the complexes of which are thought to be the major MMP forms in vivo.

We and others have found that a serine proteinase very similar or identical to pancreatic trypsinogen is expressed in human cancers such as ovarian carcinoma (7Stenman, U.-H. (1990) Scand. J. Clin.

Production of extrapancreatic trypsinogen isoenzymes has been observed in many established tumor cell lines derived from various human tumors (17Koivunen E. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. J. Biol.

Trypsinogen expression by cancer cells may be associated with elevated levels of the specific inhibitor tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI) observed in serum and urine of cancer patients (7Stenman, U.-H. (1990) Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest., 50, Suppl. 1, 93–102.Google Scholar,26Huhtala M.-L. Pesonen K. Kalkkinen N. Stenman U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13713-13716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two tumor-associated trypsinogens, trypsinogen-1 and trypsinogen-2, have been characterized, of which trypsin-2 is the major isoenzyme (17Koivunen E. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14095-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Koivunen E. Saksela O. Itkonen O. Osman S. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. Int. J.

Trypsinogen-1 corresponds to cationic and trypsinogen-2 to anionic trypsinogen. Expression of trypsin by cancer cells may have a significant effect on their ability to attach and migrate on substratum and this could stimulate invasiveness. Indeed, trypsinogen levels in cyst fluid of ovarian tumors are higher in malignant than in benign cases (27Koivunen E. Itkonen O. Halila H. Stenman U.-H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2375-2378PubMed Google Scholar), and the trypsinogen mRNA levels are high in particular in advanced stages of ovarian carcinoma (20Terada T. Nakanuma Y. Pathol Int. 1996; 46: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 21Terada T. Okada Y. Nakanuma Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1207-1213PubMed Google Scholar, 22Terada T. Ohta T. Minato H.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13713-13716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin may be expected to promote tumor spread if it initiates a protease cascade by activating proMMPs. We have therefore studied the ability of trypsin-2 secreted by COLO 205 cells carcinoma cells to activate proMMP-9 and proMMP-2, which are type IV collagenases thought to play a key role in cell migration (1Tryggvason K. Höyhtyä M. Salo T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 907: 191-207PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

We have also sequenced the cDNA for the COLO 205 cell trypsinogen-2 and found it to be identical with that of pancreatic trypsinogen-2. Our results show that human both tumor cell-derived and pancreatic trypsin-2 are highly potent activators of proMMP-9 and activate proMMPs at the lowest concentrations reported so far.

Pancreatic trypsinogen-2 was purified from urine of pancreatitis patients using ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography followed by reverse phase HPLC essentially as described (17Koivunen E. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14095-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before the final HPLC purification purified trypsinogen was autoactivated by incubating at 37 °C overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mNaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8 (17Koivunen E. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14095-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin-2 activity was determined with the chromogenic substrate S-2222 as described (17Koivunen E. Huhtala M.-L.

Ristimäki A. Itkonen O. Osman S. Vuento M. Stenman U.-H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2107-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified with the acid phenol guanidium thiocyanate method of Chomzcynski et al. (32Chomzcynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) from approximately 108 COLO 205 cells. Poly(A) RNA was purified by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography (Pharmacia) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. gene assembler plus oligosynthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry (Pharmacia). A biotinylated phosphoramidite (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was introduced into the 5′ end of the oligonucleotides. Reverse transcription of poly(A) RNA was performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) as described (33Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). The antisense primers were 5′ GCT GGA TCC GCT ATT GGC AGC TAT GGT GTT 3′ or 5′ ATA GGA TCC GCT GTT GGC AGC TAT GGT GTC 3′ corresponding to the sequence 727–747 in pancreatic trypsinogen-1 and -2 cDNAs, respectively (sequence identification number M27602 in GenBank™). The underlined sequences represent a BamHI restriction site. PCR amplification was performed with one nonbiotinylated primer and one biotinylated primer. The reverse primers were the same as used for reverse transcription of RNA and the forward primer was 5′ GAT GGA TCC TGC TGC CCC CTT TGA TGA 3′ corresponding to the sequence 48–68 of pancreatic trypsinogen-1 and -2. PCR mixtures (100 μl) for amplification of cDNA contained 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin (w/v), 200 μmol of each dNTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase and 5 pmol of each primer. Thirty cycles of amplification were performed at 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. PCR products were directly sequenced as described (34Hultman T. Ståhl S. Hornes E. Uhlén M.

Briefly, the biotinylated PCR product was bound to streptavidin coated magnetic particles (Dynabeads, Dynal, Norway), and the strands were dissociated with 0.1 m NaOH. The bound biotinylated strand was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) with Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Neutrophil progelatinase B (92-kDa MMP-9) was purified essentially as described by Hibbs et al. (37Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Biol.

The neutrophils were stimulated with 2 μg/ml of phorbol myristic acetate (Sigma) for 15 min and pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was collected and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a DE-52 column (Whatman) followed by affinity chromatography on heat-denatured type I collagen (gelatin, Sigma St Louis, Mo, USA) coupled to Sepharose-4B (38Kjeldsen L. Johnsen A.H. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10425-10432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also purified by the modified protocol described by Chen et al.(39Chen J.-M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from serum-free culture medium of human gingival fibroblasts and human gingival keratinocytes, respectively, using affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose and gel filtration (40Salo T.

Res. 1994; 73: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The purity of isolated proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 was estimated by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, zymography, Western blotting, and N-terminal sequence analysis (42Triebel S. Bläser J. Reinke H. Knäuper V. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Triebel S. Bläser J. Reinke H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Human recombinant mutant 72 kDa proMMP-2, in which Glu375 was substituted with Ala, was prepared and purified as described by Bergmann et al. (44Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified human 92-kDa proMMP-9 did not contain neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) as evidenced by lack of collagenase activity. Lack of contaminating proteinases and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was further demonstrated by zymography using gelatin and casein as substrate as well as by immunoblotting using specific antisera to MMP-8, elastase, cathepsin G, TIMPs-1 and -2, and serpins. The purity of the MMP-9 preparation was also confirmed by N-terminal analysis showing the expected sequence (42Triebel S. Bläser J. Reinke H. Knäuper V. Tschesche H.

The proMMP-9 remained inactive for 24 h at 37 °C. Recombinant human proMMP-9 was kindly provided by Dr. Karl Tryggvason, MBB, Matrix Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Purified proMMP-9 (11 μm) and proMMP-2 (10–14 μm) were treated with trypsin-2 or bovine pancreatic TPCK-trypsin (10 nm to 2 μm) for indicated time periods at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C or by adding a 4–10-fold molar excess of TATI. In control experiments, trypsin-2 was pretreated with a 10-fold molar excess of TATI for 60 min. Treatments with bovine pancreatic TPCK-trypsin were stopped by adding 1 mm PMSF. Activation of proMMPs was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, zymography, peptide substrate assay, β-casein degradation assay, and immunoblotting. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were quantitated by densitometry with a LKB Ultroscan laser densitometer (model 2202) (30Sorsa T. Ding Y.-L. Salo T. Lauhio A. Teronen O. Ingman T. Ohtani H.

Gelatinase activity was assayed by zymography in 1.5-mm-thick 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels impregnated with 1 mg/ml gelatin, which had been labeled fluorescently with 2-methoxy-2,4-diphenyl-3-[2H]furanone (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY) (O'Grady et al. (46O'Grady R. Netherty A. Hunter N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). The degradation of gelatin was visualized under long wave UV light. Zymography was also conducted using unlabeled gelatin as a substrate. Samples were electrophoresed without reduction. The gels were then incubated in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, for 10 h at 37 °C and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (40Salo T. Lyons J.G.

Undegraded gelatin was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The radioactivity in the supernatants and precipitates were counted. Radioactivity in the supernatant reflected gelatinase activity (41Mäkelä M. Salo T. Uitto V.-J. Larjava H. J. Dent. Res. 1994; 73: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1362-1370PubMed Google Scholar) genes. The CRS binds a transcription factor similar to Sp1 in size and sequence specificity, and the binding of this factor to the CRS is inhibited by an Sp1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide (24Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1682-1690PubMed Google Scholar). The CRS confers high basal levels of transcription in adrenocortical tumor cells, and gene expression through the CRS is stimulated by forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase (24Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1682-1690PubMed Google Scholar).HL-60/AR leukemia cells (25Bhalla K. Hindenburg A. Taub R.N. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3657-3662PubMed Google Scholar) exhibit a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype with constitutively high Sp1 and CREB DNA binding activities (11Borellini F. Aquino A. Josephs S.F. Glazer R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5541-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Rohlff C. Safa B. Rahman A. Cho-Chung Y.S. Klecker R.W. Glazer R.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar). Reversion of drug resistance by the type I PKA antagonist 8-Cl-cAMP results in the down-regulation of CREB DNA binding activity but not in the levels of CREB and other cAMP-regulated transcription factors (26Rohlff C. Safa B. Rahman A. Cho-Chung Y.S. Klecker R.W. Glazer R.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of PKA-dependent transcription factors in these cells may be a prerequisite for maintenance of the MDR phenotype.In the present study, we investigated whether the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway could modulate the DNA binding and trans-activating properties of Sp1. Our results indicate for the first time that Sp1 is activated by PKA and that a clearly defined cAMP signaling pathway may be responsible for up-regulating the DNA binding and trans-activating properties of this transcription factor.DISCUSSIONThe present study provides strong evidence that Sp1trans-activating and DNA binding activities are modulated through a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Momoi et al. (24Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Zanger U.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1682-1690PubMed Google Scholar) was the first to show that a CRS with homology to the Sp1 response element was involved in the cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation of the bovine CYP 11A and human CYP 21B genes. Our data are consistent with these results and demonstrate further that PKA can stimulate transcription from an Sp1-dependent promoter in intact cells as well as activate the DNA binding activity of Sp1 in vitro. In previous studies, Sp1 was shown to be phosphorylated at multiple sites in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and to be a substrate in vitro for DNA-dependent protein kinase; however, DNA-dependent protein kinase did not affect the extent and specificity of DNA binding or Sp1-dependent transcription (40Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data indicate that not only is Sp1 phosphorylated by PKA but that the DNA binding andtrans-activating activities are stimulated as well. One mechanism that may account for these results is that phosphorylation of the trans-activation domain of Sp1 results in increased Sp1 multimerization. Sp1 domain B confers high affinity DNA binding (41Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and contains a PKA consensus phosphorylation site at Thr366. Although still speculative, PKA phosphorylation may induce conformational changes similar to those that occur by multimerization through this domain (42Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 43Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The tight association between Sp1 and PKA is similar to the complex formed between PKA catalytic subunit and NF-κB (44Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) and gives further credence to this mechanism of Sp1 regulation.PKA activity remained unchanged in HL-60/AR cells regardless of whether cells were maintained in doxorubicin (26Rohlff C. Safa B. Rahman A. Cho-Chung Y.S. Klecker R.W. Glazer R.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that drug-mediated Sp1 activation may require an additional signaling mechanism. One possibility is that protein dephosphorylation is also regulated by PKA and that this process may be a rate-limiting factor in Sp1 deactivation. Maximal activation of Sp1 may require the inactivation of PP1 and PP2A by the PKA-mediated activation of a nuclear inhibitory protein such as NIPP-1 (45Beullen M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism is analogous to the attenuation of CREB by PP1 and PP2A (46Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 47Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S.

Phorbol esters also mediate inactivation of Sp1 DNA binding in HL-60/AR cells (11Borellini F. Aquino A. Josephs S.F. Glazer R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5541-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and although PKC does not phosphorylate Sp1 in vitro(40Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), it does activate PP2A (48Alberts A.S. Deng T. Lin A. Meinkoth J. Schoenthal A. Mumby M.C. Karin M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of phorbol esters on CRS-dependent transcription (49Bakke M. J. L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1323-1331PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism of Sp1 inactivation may comprise multiple signaling pathways involving phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.Sp1 activity was up-regulated by doxorubicin treatment, suggesting that MDR-associated drugs can directly influence trans-activation and the MDR phenotype. Because the promoter region in the Sp1 gene contains five Sp1 sites with three additional elements in the first intron (50Jackson S.P. Courey A. Pugh F. Tanese N. Williams T. Tjian R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 143: 118Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), exposure of cells to doxorubicin may create a positive feedback loop that results in its autoregulation. This mechanism may also account for the increased expression of type I PKA, because the promoter of the R-I gene contains multiple Sp1 response elements (51Nowak I. Seipel K. Schwarz M. Jans D.A. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, the MRP drug transporter gene, which is expressed in HL-60/AR cells, also contains multiple Sp1 elements (52Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, there may be a close association between selective pressure and Sp1 activation as a mediator of resistance. Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that binds to the consensus sequence (G/A)(G/A)GGCG(G/T)(G/A)(G/A)(G/T) or GC box (1Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). It was initially identified as a HeLa cell-derived factor that activated six tandem Sp1 sites in the SV40 early promoter (2Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated at its N terminus by DNA-dependent protein kinase, a nuclear Ser/Thr kinase that is stimulated by 3′-termini in DNA (10Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, phosphorylation of Sp1 by DNA-dependent protein kinase does not affect either its trans-activating or DNA binding activities (10Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). However, dephosphorylation of Sp1 has been suggested to enhance Sp1 DNA binding activity (11Borellini F. Aquino A. Josephs S.F. Glazer R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5541-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol.

Type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of two regulatory cAMP-binding (R-I) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits that dissociate upon binding cAMP (14Kerlavage A.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of PKA results in its activation and the translocation of the catalytic subunit to the nucleus (15Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of PKA is essential to mediate induction of cAMP-regulated genes (16Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5541-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and although PKC does not phosphorylate Sp1 in vitro(40Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), it does activate PP2A (48Alberts A.S. Deng T. Lin A. Meinkoth J. Schoenthal A. Mumby M.C. Karin M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of phorbol esters on CRS-dependent transcription (49Bakke M. J. L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1323-1331PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism of Sp1 inactivation may comprise multiple signaling pathways involving phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Sp1 activity was up-regulated by doxorubicin treatment, suggesting that MDR-associated drugs can directly influence trans-activation and the MDR phenotype. Because the promoter region in the Sp1 gene contains five Sp1 sites with three additional elements in the first intron (50Jackson S.P. Courey A. Pugh F. Tanese N. Williams T. Tjian R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 143: 118Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), exposure of cells to doxorubicin may create a positive feedback loop that results in its autoregulation. This mechanism may also account for the increased expression of type I PKA, because the promoter of the R-I gene contains multiple Sp1 response elements (51Nowak I. Seipel K. Schwarz M. Jans D.A. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, the MRP drug transporter gene, which is expressed in HL-60/AR cells, also contains multiple Sp1 elements (52Zhu Q. Center M.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, there may be a close association between selective pressure and Sp1 activation as a mediator of resistance. We are indebted to Dr. Robert Tjian, University of California at Berkeley, for providing the Sp1 antibody and plasmids pPacSp1 and pADH-βGal and to Dr. Yoon Sang Cho-Chung, National Cancer Institute, for providing pOT1521R-I, pΔ(−71)CAT, and the Cα cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2066671615,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a eukaryotic member of the Rel family of transcription factors whose biological activity is post-translationally regulated by its assembly with various ankyrin-rich cytoplasmic inhibitors, including IκBα. Expression of NF-κB in the nucleus occurs after signal-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα. The induced proteolysis of IκBα unmasks the nuclear localization signal within NF-κB, allowing its rapid migration into the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of many target genes. At present, the identity of the IκBα kinase(s) that triggers the first step in IκBα degradation remains unknown. We have investigated the potential function of the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase, or pp90rsk, as a signal-inducible IκBα kinase. pp90rsk lies downstream of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in the well characterized Ras-Raf-MEK-MAP kinase pathway that is induced by various growth factors and phorbol ester. We now show that pp90rsk, but not pp70S6K or MAP kinase, phosphorylates the regulatory N terminus of IκBα principally on serine 32 and triggers effective IκBα degradation in vitro. When co-expressed in vivo in COS cells, IκBα and pp90rsk readily assemble into a complex that is immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for either partner. While phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate produced rapid activation of pp90rsk, in vivo, other potent NF-κB inducers, including tumor necrosis factor α and the Tax transactivator of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, failed to activate pp90rsk.

At present, nine IκB family members have been identified (IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, IκBδ, IκBε, p105, p100, Bcl-3, and Cactus), each distinguished by the presence of multiple ankyrin repeats. The prototypic and best studied of the IκBs is IκBα (3Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

However, the NF-κB complex is ultimately liberated, allowing its rapid translocation into the nucleus, where it engages cognate enhancer elements and alters the transcriptional activity of various target genes. Although phosphorylation of IκBα is required for its proteolysis and the subsequent activation of NF-κB, the nature of the cellular protein kinase(s) mediating this reaction remains unknown. Signal-induced phosphorylation involves two serine residues located at positions 32 and 36 near the N terminus of IκBα. Substitution of these serines with alanine residues generates a constitutively acting IκBα repressor that readily binds to NF-κB but fails to undergo signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation (7Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 8Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y.

Studies in Drosophila have also yielded valuable insights into the biology of the Rel proteins and their control by the IκBs. In the dorsal-ventral signal transduction pathway ofDrosophila, dorsalizing signals mediated through the receptor Toll (an IL-1 receptor homologue) target Cactus (a member of the IκB family) for degradation and result in activation of Dorsal (a Rel family member) (19Steward R. Govind S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this pathway, Pelle, a serine/threonine protein kinase, regulates the degradation of Cactus through phosphorylation, although it is unknown whether Pelle acts directly or indirectly on Cactus (20Belvin M.P. Jin Y. Anderson K.V. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, a human IL-1 receptor-associated kinase has been cloned that is homologous to Pelle (21Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). This kinase appears to participate in the IL-1-induced signaling pathway leading to NF-κB induction, but no evidence yet exists for its direct phosphorylation of IκBα. Casein kinase II (CKII) also phosphorylates IκBα in vivo(22Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

However, phosphopeptide mapping of phosphorylated IκBα has shown that residues within the C-terminal PEST region, rather than the N-terminal serines, are targeted by CKII. Phosphorylation of the C terminus of IκBα by CKII or other kinases may play a role in the constitutive degradation of uncomplexed IκBα. Additionally, CKII-mediated phosphorylation appears important for the accelerated turnover of IκBα and the persistent induction of NF-κB observed following HIV infection of macrophages (24McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of CKII from these cell extracts results in an inhibition of IκBα degradation in vitro (24McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a novel ubiquitination-stimulated protein kinase has been identified that phosphorylates IκBα in a serine 32/36-dependent manner (25Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). This kinase resides in a large 700-kDa multiprotein complex, and ubiquitination of some component of the complex results in increased IκBα phosphorylating activity. Whether ubiquitination directly activates the kinase or, alternatively, acts indirectly to alter another component of the complex remains unresolved. We have investigated the potential role of a known intracellular protein kinase in the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAP kinase signaling pathway as an IκB kinase. This enzyme, the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase, or pp90rsk, lies immediately downstream of MAP kinase in the phorbol ester and growth factor signaling pathway (26Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 27Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). We now show that pp90rsk phosphorylates the N terminus of IκBα principally on serine 32 and functionally induces IκBα degradationin vitro. We further show that pp90rsk and IκBα can physically associate in vivo. Finally, we show that only a subset of the known NF-κB-inducing signals leads to the activation of pp90rsk. These findings suggest that rather than a single IκB kinase, a family of IκB kinases may exist within the cell that are differentially activated by different inducers of NF-κB. The expression vector containing a hemagglutinin-epitope-tagged pp90rskcDNA (pMT2-HA-RSK1) was provided by Dr. Joseph Avruch (Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Wild type IκBα cDNA provided by Dr. Al Baldwin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) was cloned into the HindIII andXbaI sites of the pCMV4 eukaryotic expression vector provided by Dr. Mark Stinski (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Forin vitro translation, wild type IκBα or mutant IκBα containing alanine for serine substitutions at position 32 and/or 36 (4Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) cloned into the HindIII and XbaI orXmaI sites of the pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Biosynthetically radiolabeled IκBα or its mutant analogues were synthesized by transcription-coupled in vitro translation in wheat germ extracts (Promega). A bacterial expression plasmid encoding hexahistidine (His)-tagged IκBα was constructed by cloning the IκBα cDNA into the pTrcHisC vector (Invitrogen). The N-terminal Δ1–36 IκBα deletion mutant was cloned into the pRSETC vector (identical to the pTrcHis vector except in the promoter region). Wild type IκBα and the S32/36A IκBα mutant containing alanine for serine substitutions at both residues 32 and 36 were isolated from Escherichia colilysates by purification on a nickel chelate column (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). Following an initial wash in high salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl), successive washes were performed with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (0, 10, 50, 100 mm). The His-tagged proteins were eluted in buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the desired proteins were dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT. Jurkat cells and Jurkat cells stably expressing either HTLV-I Tax or Tax antisense cDNA constructs and a neomycin resistance gene were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2; 800 μg/ml G418 was added to the Jurkat-Tax and anti-Tax cell culture media. Cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml) or TNF-α (50 ng/ml) for various periods of time. Vehicle controls corresponding to the amounts of added Me2SO for PMA and water for TNF-α were performed in parallel. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.75 μg/ml bestatin; 0.5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, and trypsin inhibitor; 0.4 μg/ml phosphoramidon; and 0.05 μg/ml pepstatin). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 ×g, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation as described below. Phosphorylation of bacterially expressed IκBα (0.5 μg) was performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures incubated for 15 min at room temperature. ForXenopus laevis egg-derived MAP kinase, X. laevisegg-derived pp90rsk, and mouse pp70S6K, the reaction buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μm EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP, 25 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/μmol). Myelin basic protein (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) or 40 S ribosomal subunits (0.05 mg/ml) generously provided by Dr. James Maller (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO) were used as positive controls for these kinase reactions. Aliquots of the reactions were mixed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated to 98 °C, and microcentrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min, followed by analysis of the supernatants by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, IκBα was immunoprecipitated from the reactions with peptide-specific polyclonal rabbit antisera (2.5 μl) recognizing the C-terminus of IκBα. Immune complexes were reacted with formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin A, 50 μl, Calbiochem) and collected by centrifugation. The Protein A-bound immune complexes were washed three times and similarly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the case of pp90rsk, three independently purified preparations were tested. The specific activities of these pp90rskpreparations were 4.6, 8.9, and 11.2 nmol of ATP incorporated/min/mg of protein assayed using Kemptide as substrate. Bacterially produced His-tagged IκBα was phosphorylated with purified pp90rsk as described above and subjected to mild V8 proteolysis at room temperature for 10 min. The protease inhibitorN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone was added to the reaction mixture together with 100 μg/ml (final concentration) of bovine serum albumin to terminate proteolytic cleavage. IκBα peptides containing the N-terminal His-epitope were immunoprecipitated from the digest using his-tag-specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed with Tris-Tricine gels by the method of Schägger and von Jagow (28Schägger H. von Jagow J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). In vitrosynthesized [35S]-radiolabeled IκBα was phosphorylated with pp90rsk in the presence of unlabeled ATP as described. The phosphorylated or control IκBα proteins (25 μl) were incubated in 100 μl of reticulocyte lysates containing 5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm creatine phosphate, and 200 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase. Samples were removed at various times and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with C-terminalspecific anti-IκBα antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Monkey kidney COS7 cells, maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, were transfected with pMT2-HA-RSK1 (encoding pp90rsk-1) or pCMV4-HA-PP2A (encoding the A regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A) and CMV4-IκBα using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the cells were starved for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 2 h. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysis in ELB buffer, followed by immunoprecipitation analyses as described above using either anti-HA-epitope antibody (BAbCo, Berkeley, CA) or anti-IκBα antisera specific for the C terminus of this inhibitor. Nonradioactive COS cell lysates were also prepared and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA or IκBα antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-pp90rsk-specific antibodies. These immunoblots were developed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemoluminescense (ECL) as described by the manufacturer (Amersham). Cell lysates derived from about 5 × 106 Jurkat cells were precleared for 1 h and incubated with 10 μl of anti-pp90rsk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. 30 μl of Protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) was then added to the mixture, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, followed by washing of the Protein A-agarose resin three times in ELB buffer. Immune complexes were washed three times with kinase buffer (25 mm glycerol-2-phosphate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaF, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and either 20 μm ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/μmol for [32P]labeling of recombinant IκBα) or 100 μm ATP (for phosphorylation of [35S]-labeled IκBα)). 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing 0.3 μg of bacterially expressed IκBα or 2 μl of wheat germ-translated reactions of wild type or mutant IκBα was added to the immune complexes, and the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min for [32P]radiolabeling of IκBα or 2 h for phosphorylation of [35S]-labeled IκBα. The reaction products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Following the phosphorylation reactions, IκBα was immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antiserum specific for the C-terminus and Protein A-agarose. The bound immune complexes were washed three times in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) followed by the addition of 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Phorbol ester is both a potent inducer of NF-κB and a known activator of the MAP kinase pathway. To determine whether kinases positioned along this or related pathways are capable of phosphorylating IκBα, the ability of MAP kinase, pp70S6K, and pp90rsk to phosphorylate IκBαin vitro was examined. These kinases phosphorylate residues that lie within specific consensus sequences. For example, MAP kinase phosphorylates serines and threonines that precede proline residues (proline-directed kinase consensus sequence), while both pp90rsk and pp70S6K phosphorylate serines or threonines within the consensus sequence Arg-X-X-Ser/Thr (29Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged IκBα was used as the substrate in thesein vitro kinase assays. Following the kinase reaction, IκBα was immunoprecipitated from the reaction using polyclonal anti-IκBα antibodies (30Sun S.C. Ganchi P. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed to ensure that the phosphorylated protein was indeed recombinant IκBα. As shown in Fig. 1, pp90rsk(lanes 7 and 8), but not pp70S6K(lanes 3 and 4) or p42MAPK(lanes 11 and 12), phosphorylated recombinant His-tagged IκBα in vitro. The failure of the pp70S6K and p42MAPK preparations to phosphorylate IκBα was not due to inactivation of these enzymes during their purification, as each capably phosphorylated known protein substrates, including the 40S ribosomal subunit for pp70S6K(lanes 1 and 2) and myelin basic protein for p42MAPK (lanes 9 and 10). Of note, while both pp90rsk and pp70S6K recognize the same consensus phosphoacceptor site and phosphorylate the S6 protein of the 40S ribosome, only pp90rsk phosphorylated IκBα. Another kinase, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) also shares the same consensus phosphoacceptor site as pp90rsk and pp70S6K(31Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

However, like pp70S6K, CaMKII failed to phosphorylate IκBα in vitro, although it did phosphorylate one of its physiological substrates, synapsin II (data not shown). These data highlight the ability of pp90rsk to utilize IκBα as a substrate for phosphorylation in vitro. To ascertain whether pp90rsk phosphorylates IκBα at either of the two critical N-terminal serine residues located at positions 32 and 36, a 6xhis-IκBα and a similarly epitope-tagged S32/36A IκBα mutant in which both of these serines were substituted with alanine, was subjected to in vitrophosphorylation as described above. The protein was then subjected to mild V8 (endoprotease Glu C) proteolysis with a sequencing-grade protease. The cleaved proteins were immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for the N-terminal his-epitope. This antiserum recognizes both wild type IκBα and the S32/36A His-tagged mutants. Phosphorylation of IκBα at either serine 32 or 36 should result in a fragment of 84/87 amino acids (including the epitope tag) when exposed to V8 protease, which cleaves at residue 48 or 51. Fig. 2 A depicts the recombinant IκBα protein showing the signal-dependent N-terminal phosphorylation sites in relation to the V8 cleavage sites. The smallest band in the immunoprecipitate shown in the leftmost two lanes of Fig. 2 B, indicated by the arrow, migrates between the 8.16- and 10.6-kDa myoglobin fragment, consistent with the molecular size of the 84/87 N-terminal fragment of IκBα. In contrast, the S32/36A IκBα protein failed to yield a similarly sized band (Fig. 2, fourth and fifth lanes). The even smaller band detected with these samples was also detected in the absence of added V8 protease. These results thus demonstrate that pp90rsk is capable of phosphorylating the regulatory N terminus of IκBα involving serine 32 and/or 36. Although a variety of kinases can phosphorylate IκBα in vitro, the critical functional issue is whether these kinases promote IκBα degradation. Using anin vitro degradation system, we studied whether pp90rsk-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα triggers its destruction. The reticulocyte lysate degradation system employed in these experiments contains all of the component proteins and macromolecules necessary for ubiquitin-dependent and -independent 26S proteasome-mediated degradation (31Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). A variety of proteins have been shown to be degraded in this reticulocyte lysate system, including ornithine decarboxylase, antizyme, and the transcription factors Fos, Jun, and Myc (32Hermida-Matsumoto M.-L.

[35S]-Radiolabeled wild type IκBα (Fig. 3, upper panel) and the S32/36A IκBα mutant (lower panel) were synthesizedin vitro and preincubated with Xenopusegg-derived pp90rsk (lanes 1–4), mammalian pp70S6K (lanes 5–8), or control kinase buffer lacking an added kinase (lanes 9 and 10). The IκBα proteins were then incubated in a degradation-competent reticulocyte lysate that had specifically not been pretreated with RNase or hemin. Hemin is known to inhibit the 26S proteasome but is often added to reticulocyte lysates to improve translation since it prevents premature peptide chain termination (39Gross M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 31: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Degradation of [35S]-IκBα was monitored by immunoprecipitation with specific anti-IκBα antisera over the course of a 120-min incubation conducted in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. As shown inlanes 1–4 of the upper panel, pp90rsk-treated wild type IκBα was significantly degraded during the 2-h incubation. However, IκBα treated with pp70S6K (lanes 5–8) or control buffer (lanes 9 and 10) was not degraded. In contrast to wild type IκBα, the S32/36A IκBα mutant was not degraded when incubated with pp90rsk (lower panel, lanes 1–4), indicating that IκBα degradation in this in vitro system is dependent on the presence of these N-terminal regulatory serines, as it is in vivo. Together, these results suggest that pp90rsk-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα is biologically relevant since it leads to serine 32- and/or serine 36-dependent degradation of wild type IκBα protein in vitro. Previous in vivo studies have shown that both S32 and S36 at the N terminus of IκBα are required for signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation of this inhibitor (7Brown K. Gerstberger S.

To estimate relative turnovers for pumping of the drug vinblastine and ATP hydrolysis, we began by measuring the number of P-glycoprotein molecules on the surface of murine NIH3T3 cells expressing the human MDR1 gene. Fluorescence of cells treated with monoclonal antibody UIC2 was determined as a function of (i) amount of antibody at a fixed number of cells and (ii) increasing cell number at constant antibody.

Initial uptake rates of vinblastine ± verapamil measure the ability of P-glycoprotein to extract vinblastine from the plasma membrane before it enters the cell. As a function of [vinblastine] at 37 °C, they give the maximum rate of this component of outward pumping as 2.1 × 106 molecules s−1 cell−1 or a turnover number of 1.1 s−1. Initial rates of one-way efflux as a function of [vinblastine] at 25 °C ± glucose give the maximum rate of this component of pumping as 0.59 × 106 molecules s−1 cell−1. The ratio of ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein at 37 and 25 °C is 4.6. Appropriating this ratio for pumping, maximum one-way efflux at 37 °C is 4.6 × 0.59 = 2.7 × 106 molecules s−1cell−1, a turnover number of 1.4 s−1. The vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein has a turnover number of 3.5 s−1 at 37 °C, giving 2.8 molecules of ATP hydrolyzed for every vinblastine molecule transported in a particular direction. These calculations involve several approximations, but turnover numbers for pumping of vinblastine and for vinblastine-stimulated ATP hydrolysis are comparable. Thus, ATP hydrolysis is probably directly linked to drug transport by P-glycoprotein.

A very wide range of substrates are pumped out of cells by P-gp (15Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar). Major efforts have been made toward finding clinically useful reversers of P-gp that can block its action, leading to renewed accumulation of drugs within erstwhile resistant cells (16Raderer M. Scheithauer W. Cancer ( Phila. ). 1993; 72: 3553-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Lan L.-B. Ayesh S. Lyubimov E. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1996; 38: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Secure knowledge of the mechanism of action of P-gp is the basis for designing new and more effective reversers.Four lines of evidence indicate that P-gp can expel its substrates directly out of the cell membrane (reviewed in Ref. 18Stein W.D. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 545-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). First, the substrates of P-gp are lipophilic and reside, most of the time, within cell membranes. Thus, it is within the membrane that the pump will find it most easy to locate its substrate. Second, kinetic analyses show that drug accumulation is reduced by the action of P-gp from the earliest times that measurements can be made, i.e. before significant amounts of the drug can enter the cell yet when it is already present within the membrane (19Stein W.D. Cardarelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar). Hence it seems to be pumped out from the membrane itself before it crosses it. Third, Ravivet al. (20Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making use of the ability of the photosensitive probe 5-iodonaphthalene-1-azide to label membrane proteins, showed that doxorubicin was expelled from cell membranes of P-gp-containing but not drug-sensitive cells. In addition, fluorescent dyes such as Hoechst 33342 (21Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and calcein-AM (22Hollo Z. Homolya L. Hegedus T. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have been used to demonstrate removal of substrate from the lipid bilayer by P-gp. These considerations favor a “vacuum cleaner” model (20Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for P-gp in which this protein is an ATP-driven pump that pumps its substrates directly out of the plasma membrane. A major criticism of this model is, however, the lack of reliable information on the stoichiometry of ATP hydrolysis to drug pumping. Attempts to measure this stoichiometry in phospholipid vesicles containing pure P-gp suggested a minimum of 50 ATP molecules hydrolyzed per drug molecule transported, however, such a figure is difficult to reconcile with the metabolic potential of multidrug resistant cells (12Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Eytan et al. (23Eytan G.D. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3172-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) attempted to derive the stoichiometry by measuring the effect of P-gp on valinomycin-facilitated transport of 86Rb+ into proteoliposomes containing P-gp, valinomycin being a P-gp substrate. They reported 0.5–0.8 molecules of the complex valinomycin-Rb+ transported for every ATP molecule hydrolyzed. They assumed, however, that only Rb+-complexed valinomycin molecules were transported by P-gp, whereas we observed 2S. V. Ambudkar, unpublished data.2S. V. Ambudkar, unpublished data. that valinomycin's stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by P-gp is unaffected by its charged state. Transport of charged valinomycin molecules in the experiments by Eytan et al. (23Eytan G.D. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3172-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was carried out in the presence of a substantial excess of the uncharged form, which would not contribute to the measured flux but would contribute to ATP hydrolysis. In addition, their assay was carried out in solutions that were not free of potassium, which would compete with rubidium, complicating their calculations of the stoichiometry. We deemed it important, therefore, to determine this stoichiometry using an independent approach.Here we determine the number of P-gp molecules present on the surface of P-gp-expressing cells using an antibody (Ab) titration procedure and FACS analysis. In the same cell type, we measure the maximum capacity of P-gp to reduce the entry of its substrate vinblastine (VBL) by determining the difference between initial rates of VBL uptake in the presence and absence of the P-gp blocker verapamil. These two numbers, taken together, can determine the catalytic constant (molecules pumped per second) for the effect of P-gp on reducing VBL accumulation. Also, we measure the maximum capacity of such cells to accelerate efflux of loaded VBL in the presence of an energy source, giving another measure of the transport capacity and of the catalytic constant for the effect of P-gp on VBL transport. Comparing these catalytic constants with that obtained for the effect of VBL on accelerating ATP hydrolysis by P-gp, we compute the ratio of the maximum rate of VBL transport to the maximum rate of VBL-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. This ratio is not far from unity. Thus, only a small number of ATP molecules seem hydrolyzed for each VBL molecule transported by P-gp.RESULTSUsing FACS, we first studied binding of P-gp-specific monoclonal Ab UIC2 to cells of various cell lines engineered to express human P-gp. Fig. 1 depicts the results of experiments where we used control mouse IgG2a Ab (A) and UIC2 Ab (B) binding to NIH3T3 cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene (Gly-185 cells) at four concentrations of Ab, 0, 0.2, 1.6, and 4.8 μg/tube containing 200 μl of medium. Inpanel C, at these same concentrations with binding being to Val-185 cells, NIH3T3 cells transfected with a mutant strain ofMDR1 where valine replaces glycine in position 185 of the polypeptide chain of P-gp; in panel D, binding was done with a single amount (1 μg) of antibody to five different cell strains, using the non-transfected NIH3T3 cells, cells transfected with wild type MDR1 gene and selected at low dose (30 ng/ml vincristine; N3–30), with a higher dose (600 ng/ml; N3–600), and with a still higher dose (2400 ng/ml; N3–2400), as well as theMDR1 Gly-185 cell strain grown in the presence of 60 ng/ml colchicine (see panel B). In each case, the data are plotted as the number of cells on the ordinate that are labeled with the fluorescence intensity denoted on the abscissa. Cells tested with the control IgG Ab showed very little fluorescence with no increase as the concentration of Ab is raised, whereas the Gly-185 and Val-185 strains, tested with monoclonal Ab UIC2, demonstrate a clear and similar fluorescence signal that increases in intensity as the concentration of Ab increases. The various cell strains depicted in panel Dshow a marked difference in signal intensity, consistent with differences in the amount of P-gp present on the surface of these different cells (24Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1708-1716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).To determine the number of available P-gp molecules on the cell surface, we used the same monoclonal Ab UIC2 and a depletion assay. We first quantitate how the degree of reaction depends on the amount of Ab. Fig. 2 (panels A andC) depicts the median fluorescence of a sample of Gly-185 and Val-185 3T3 cells, respectively, when treated with increasing Ab concentration (0–8 μg of Ab/sample mixture of 200 μl) using a fixed number of cells, 5 × 105/reaction at 4 °C. We fitted the data by the simple binding equation.BOUND=BOUNDMAX·[Ab]Km+[Ab]Equation 1 where [Ab] is the concentration of the Ab present in the reaction sample, BOUND is the measured median fluorescence due to binding of Ab to the cells, BOUNDMAX is the maximum fluorescence determined by the maximum Ab bound to the amount of cells present, while Km is the concentration of Ab that gives one-half maximal binding (a measure of the affinity of Ab for ligand, here P-gp). Next, we titrated the Ab, present at an amount less than the values of Km found in the previous titrations, against an increasing number of added cells, using up to 8 million cells/reaction sample. As the number of cells per sample increases, less and less Ab is available for each cell. The median fluorescence per cell decreases as Ab is depleted from the reaction mixture by being bound to the cells themselves. We fitted the data by the depletion equation.BOUND=BOUNDinit·KnKn+[Cells]Equation 2 where [Cells] is the number of cells present per reaction sample, BOUND is the measured median fluorescence due to binding of Ab to cells, BOUNDinit is the initial fluorescence determined by the maximum Ab bound per cell at the weight of Ab present, whileKn is that number of cells that depletes by one-half the maximal amount of binding (a measure of the number of sites that bind the Ab, i.e. of P-gp molecules per cell).Figure 2Titration of cell surface P-gp against increasing amounts of UIC2 Ab (panels A and C) or against increasing numbers of cells added (panels B andD). In panels A and B, cells were NIH3T3 transfected with wild-type (Gly-185) MDR1, whereas in panels C and D, these were the mutant Val-185 transfectants. In each case the ordinate is the median fluorescence from an experiment, as depicted in Fig. 1. The fitted curves are binding isotherms of Equations 1 and 2 in the text forpanels A and C, and panels B andD, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the Gly-185 cells, we found Km to be 1.87 ± 0.24 μg of Ab, while Kn was 2.97 ± 0.77 million cells/reaction sample. We calculate the number of P-gp molecules exposed to Ab as follows. In Fig. 2 B, 1 μg of Ab is present per reaction sample, and Kn is 2.97. Therefore 2.97 million cells are sufficient to deplete one-half or 0.5 μg of Ab from the reaction mixture. Now 0.5 μg of Ab is 2.02 × 1012 molecules (assuming molecular mass of the Ab to be 150 kDa). Hence each cell binds 2.02/2.97 or 0.68 million molecules of Ab. But from Fig. 2 A we find the Km of Ab for P-gp as 1.87 μg. Thus at the 1 μg concentration used in Fig. 2 B, Ab-binding sites are only saturated to a fraction of 1/(1 + 1.87) or 0.345. Therefore, the true number of Ab-binding sites is 0.68/0.345 = 1.95 ± 0.53 million P-gp sites/Gly-185 3T3 cell on computing for the combination of errors. Performing the Ab binding procedures at 25 and 37 °C gave essentially the same values (data not shown).For the Val-185 3T3 cells, similarly, the number of P-gp sites per cell is 2.63 ± 0.87 million, not significantly different from the number present per Gly-185 3T3 cell. We performed the same experiments also for the N3–2400 strain of human MDR1-transfected 3T3 cells (see Ref. 24Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1708-1716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 D). For these cells (data not shown), the value of Km was found to be 2.9 ± 0.4 μg of Ab while Kn was 0.56 ± 0.14 × 106 cells. Calculating, as described above, gives 14.2 ± 3.8 × 106 molecules of P-gp/cell for this highly resistant strain.In addition, with the MDR1 Gly-185-transfected 3T3 cells, we used another human P-gp-specific monoclonal Ab with an external epitope, MRK-16 (27Hamada H. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7785-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and also the Fab and F(ab′)2fragments prepared from this Ab. The depletion titration gave aKn value of 1.90 ± 0.37 × 106 cells for the MRK-16 Ab and 2.76 ± 0.62 × 106 for the F(ab′)2 fragment, not significantly different. Similar results were obtained with Fab (monovalent) fragment (data not shown). Considering these data it is reasonable to assume that 1 molecule of Ab binds to 1 P-gp molecule.P-gp can act on its substrates in two ways; it can pump drug from the cytoplasm of the cell and also pump it out from the membrane before it reaches the cytoplasm (19Stein W.D. Cardarelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the maximum rate of VBL pumping by P-gp by these two pathways. First, we studied the extraction of VBL from the membrane before it accumulated inside the cell. Fig. 3 shows the time course of uptake of VBL into Gly-185 3T3 cells at 37 °C in PBS. (In Figs. 3 and4, the ordinate is the amount of VBL taken up and expressed as the volume of external medium cleared of VBL (in μl) per million cells at the time stated (19Stein W.D. Cardarelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar). Multiplying this measure by the concentration of VBL in the external medium would give the amount of VBL that enters the cell in the given time period). In Fig. 3 A, the time course was measured over an extended range. The final level of uptake is dramatically increased by adding 50 μm of the reverser verapamil to the cells (filled circles). In Fig. 3 B, however, uptake is measured for 12 s at 37 °C. Uptake is linear from zero time during this interval. In succeeding experiments, uptakes were performed at 10 s in the initial rate range. Fig. 4 A depicts the uptake of VBL during 10 s in the presence (filled circles) and absence (open squares) of 50 μm verapamil. In the presence of verapamil there is little change in the VBL uptake as the concentration of the drug is increased. In its absence, uptake increases with the concentration of VBL. Two curves, with and without verapamil, begin to approach one another, which is consistent with increasing concentrations of VBL saturating the pumping ability of P-gp so that it cannot cope with the inflow of the drug. Thus, the difference between uptake of VBL in presence and absence of verapamil gives the component of pumping that takes place as the drug crosses the membrane but before it enters the cytoplasm (18Stein W.D. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 545-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Stein W.D. Cardarelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 4 B we plot this difference, i.e. pumping of VBL by P-gp, as a function of [VBL] by combining data from different experiments. The filled circles are from Fig. 4 A,open circles are from a similar experiment at other concentrations of VBL, whereas the open square is from the 10-s data points of Fig. 3 B. The ordinate here, the volume of external medium cleared at the time chosen, is proportional to the velocity of uptake (v) divided by the concentration of VBL in the external medium (S). Using Michaelis-Menten kinetics to describe the pumping action of P-gp leads us tov=Vmax·SKp+S,givingvS=VmaxKp+SEquation 3 where Vmax is the maximum velocity of pumping (in moles/cell/second), whereas Kp is that [VBL] giving one-half maximum pumping velocity. We fitted the data of Fig. 4 B to Equation 3 where v/S is the uptake of VBL (volume of external medium cleared per 10 s) and obtained an estimate of Kp andVmax. We find that Kp is 37.0 ± 9.9 μm, while Vmax is 3.5 ± 0.83 pmol/106 cells/sec or 2.1 ± 0.5 × 106 molecules/cell/s. Since the number of P-gp molecules present on the surface of each cell is 1.95 × 106, this gives a turnover number of 1.08 ± 0.39/s.Figure 3Uptake of vinblastine from an external concentration of 0.1 μm into Gly-185-transfected NIH3T3 cells as a function of time at 37 °C in the presence (circles) or absence (squares) of 50 μm verapamil.

Transport and Diffusion Across Cell Membranes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986Google Scholar) from cells loaded with VBL. In Fig. 5 A, Gly-185 3T3 cells were loaded with 1.4 nm VBL at 25 °C for 40 min in the presence of 10 mm sodium azide and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose to deplete the energy (19Stein W.D. Cardarelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar). (These experiments were performed at 25 rather than 37 °C since we found that during loading of the cells at 37 °C, in the absence of an energy source, they became less adherent to the dishes, preventing an accurate determination of efflux rates.) Cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold PBS and then exposed to a wash-out medium at 25 °C, free of VBL but containing either PBS + 10 mm sodium azide + 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (filled circles) or PBS + 5 mm glucose to restore energy (filled squares). The data were fitted by an exponential efflux equation, giving values for t1/2 of 37 and 4.4 min into azide/2-deoxyglucose or glucose medium, respectively. Efflux into glucose medium is thus some 8× that into azide/2-deoxyglucose. A parallel experiment performed with [VBL] at 100 μm is depicted in Fig. 5 B. Rates into azide/2-deoxyglucose and glucose are now similar to t1/2 values of 13 and 8.4 min, respectively. In addition, results of similar experiments with different concentrations of VBL are depicted in Fig. 5 C. Here we plot efflux during 2 min, reported as the difference between efflux into glucose and into azide/2-deoxyglucose and expressed as a fraction of the zero time value, as a function of [VBL]. Data from Fig. 5, A and B are shown as open squares with circles being from another experiment andtriangles from a third. As for Fig. 4 B, we fitted these data by Equation 3, obtaining a value for the maximum velocity of pumping (fractional loss) as 0.179 ± 0.011/min. The volume of external medium cleared by 106 cells at zero time of efflux was 21.5 ± 1.5 μl (n = 5). TheKp from Fig. 5 C was 15.1 ± 3.0 μm. Thus, at a concentration of VBL in the external medium equal to Kp, there would be 21.5 × 15.1 or 325 pmol of vinblastine present within the cell. This is pumped out at one-half the maximum rate but represents one-half of the pumping capacity of the cell's P-gp. Thus the maximum rate of VBL efflux is 0.179 × 325 pmol/106 cells/min or 0.59 ± 0.12 × 106 molecules/cell/s at 25 °C.Figure 5Time course of efflux of vinblastine at 25 °C from Gly-185-transfected NIH3T3 cells loaded with VBL during 40 min at 25 °C in PBS containing 10 mm sodium azide and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose at VBL concentrations of 1.4 nm (A) or 100 μm (B). Efflux of 3H-VBL was followed into this same medium (filled circles) or into PBS containing 5 mmglucose (filled squares). The solid lines are the best-fitted exponential decay curves. Panel C plots the energy-dependent efflux, calculated as the difference between the VBL efflux during 2 min at 25 °C into glucose and azide/deoxyglucose at various VBL concentrations as indicated on the abscissa.

We determined this activity for the Val-185 3T3 cell line and the N3–2400 cell line that is enriched for P-gp (24Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I.

We assessed the effect of the drugs such as vinblastine, verapamil, and colchicine on stimulation of the ATPase activity (Table I). The VBL-stimulated ATPase activity is reduced 4.63-fold as the temperature is decreased from 37 to 25 °C. Were this ratio to be appropriate for the pumping function of P-gp on VBL, one would conclude that a maximum efflux of 0.59 at 25 °C might be equivalent to a value of 2.73 ± 0.55 × 106 molecules/cell/s at 37 °C or to a turnover number of 1.40 ± 0.43 s−1, which is indistinguishable from the value determined for the inward component of pumping (Fig. 4 B).Table IDrug-stimulated ATPase activity in NIH3T3 transfectants expressing varying levels of human P-glycoproteinDrugGly-1851-aEach column is for the strain ofMDR1-transfected 3T3 cells as indicated at either 37 or 25 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1974235853,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important regulator of endothelial function and vascular tone in biological tissues. While endothelial dysfunction occurs following ischemia and has been attributed to altered NO⋅ formation, the biochemical basis for this dysfunction is unknown. Therefore, studies were performed to determine the effects of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion on eNOS in isolated rat hearts subjected to periods of global ischemia or ischemia followed by reperfusion. eNOS activity was assayed by l-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline conversion and alterations in the amount and distribution of eNOS determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. While activity was preserved after 30 min of ischemia with a value of 1.1 ± 0.1 pmol × min−1 × mg of protein−1, it decreased by 77% after 60 min and became nearly undetectable after 120 min. Reperfusion resulted in only a partial restoration of activity. The decline in activity with ischemia was due, in part, to a loss of eNOS protein. Hemodynamic studies showed that the onset of impaired vascular reactivity paralleled the loss of functional eNOS. Subjecting isolated eNOS to conditions of acidosis, which occur during ischemia, followed by restoration of pH as occurs on reperfusion, caused a combination of reversible and irreversible loss of activity similar to that seen in ischemic and reperfused hearts. Thus, loss of endothelial function following ischemia is paralleled by a loss of eNOS activity due to a combination of pH-dependent denaturation and proteolysis.

Thus, loss of endothelial function following ischemia is paralleled by a loss of eNOS activity due to a combination of pH-dependent denaturation and proteolysis. Over the last decade it has been shown that the endothelium plays a critical role in the control of vascular tone (1Furchgott R.F. Zawadzki J.V. Nature. 1980; 288: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (10026) Google Scholar). A labile vasodilating substance termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor was identified as nitric oxide (NO⋅), 1The abbreviations used are: NO⋅, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; l-NAME, N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. which is synthesized by a calcium dependent nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) in endothelial cells (2Palmer R.M.J.

A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was observed that ischemia causes impaired endothelial reactivity (5Johns R.A. Linden J.M. Peach M.J. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the heart it was observed that coronary artery occlusion, as occurs in heart attack, results in endothelial dysfunction. In both isolated vascular ring andin vivo models, endothelium-dependent vasodilation is markedly decreased after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (6Van Benthuysen K.M. McMurtry I.F. Horwitz L.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 7Tsao P.S. Lefer A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1660-H1666PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mehta J.L. Nichols W.W. Donnelly W.H. Lawson D.L. Saldeen T.G.P. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Studies in humans have identified a similar decline in acetylcholine-induced vasodilation or even paradoxical vasoconstriction in areas adjacent to atherosclerotic plaques present in coronary arteries (9Ludmer P.L. Selwyn A.P. Shook T.L. Wayne R.R. Mudge G.H. Alexander R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). Likewise, a diffuse vasomotor impairment in hypercholesterolemic and diabetic patients was seen showing that vascular dysfunction might occur in different pathological conditions (10Zeiher A.M. Drexler H. Saurier B. Just H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 652-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 11Johnstone M.T. Creager S.J. Scales K.M. Cusco J.A. Lee B.K. Creager M.A. Circulation. 1993; 88: 2510-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Because of the major pathophysiological significance of impaired endothelial reactivity following ischemia, there has been great interest in determining its underlying mechanisms. Earlier studies verified that while receptor mediated endothelial-dependent responses to acetylcholine as well as receptor-independent responses to calcium ionophore A23187 were lost, endothelium-independent agents such as the NO⋅ donor nitroprusside could elicit normal vasodilation in coronary rings of reperfused hearts (5Johns R.A. Linden J.M. Peach M.J. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Van Benthuysen K.M. McMurtry I.F. Horwitz L.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These observations implied the site of inhibition of endothelium-dependent dilation to be distal to receptor-mediated events and proximal to the activation of the vascular smooth muscle, suggesting that impaired enzymatic synthesis of NO⋅ could be one of the mechanisms causing endothelial dysfunction. However, questions remain regarding the contribution of a dysfunctional NO⋅ synthetic pathway to the endothelial impairment of postischemic hearts. The exact alterations in eNOS activity and expression which occur during ischemia or following reperfusion are unknown. Furthermore, it is not known what processes during ischemia cause these alterations. In the heart, the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS or NOS III) present in the endothelium of coronary vessels and myocardium, normally accounts for most NO⋅ production (12Ursell P.C. Mayes M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1920-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Balligand J.L. Kobzik L. Han X. Kaye D.M. Belhassen L. O'Hara D.S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14582-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Catalysis by eNOS involves the oxidation of one of the terminal guanidino nitrogens of l-arginine to yield NO⋅ plusl-citrulline (14Lowenstein C.J. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Since nitric-oxide synthases are relatively labile enzymes (15Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar) whose function can be impaired by a variety of conditions (16Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the metabolic disorders associated with ischemia and reperfusion might also impair eNOS activity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the alterations in eNOS that occur following myocardial ischemia, as well as the mechanisms that trigger this process and their significance in causing endothelial dysfunction. Female Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g) were heparinized and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital. The hearts were excised, the aorta cannulated, and retrograde perfusion initiated at a pressure of 80 mm Hg using Krebs bicarbonate buffer (17 mm glucose, 120 mmsodium chloride, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 2.5 mm calcium chloride, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5.9 mm potassium chloride, and 1.2 mm magnesium chloride) bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas at 37 °C, as described previously (17Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hearts were perfused for 15 min to allow functional stabilization and then subjected to the desired duration of 37 °C global ischemia or ischemia followed by reflow. For studies of endothelial reactivity, coronary flow was measured after 15 min of perfusion. The vasodilatory effect of histamine (10−5m) was then tested to measure base-line endothelium-dependent relaxation. Hearts were then subjected to control perfusion or 30, 60, or 90 min of ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion, and the effect of histamine on coronary flow was reassessed followed by measurement of the effect of the eNOS inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 1 mm). Hearts were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, finely ground, and suspended in 3 ml of ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 12 mm mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitors 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 4 μmleupeptin. The suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 5 °C. The particulate fraction was subsequently washed in 3 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 1 m KCl for 5 min and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 5 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rinsed several times with buffer to remove excess KCl. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing calmodulin (330 nm) and tetrahydrobiopterin (10 μm) which are essential cofactors removed from the pellet by the KCl wash (18Forstermann U. Pollock J.S. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Heller M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). eNOS activity was measured from the conversion rate of l-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline (19Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar) in heart tissue subcellular preparations. The reaction mixture contained 3.0 mm NADPH, 200 μm CaCl2, 30 μm EDTA, 30 μm EGTA, 100 nmcalmodulin, and 3 μm tetrahydrobiopterin in Tris buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of purifiedl-[14C]arginine (317 mCi/mmol) to produce a 10 μm final concentration and carried out for 8 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched with 3 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm HEPES and 2 mm EDTA, pH 5.5). Experiments were also performed in the presence of either EGTA (5.0 mm) or l-NAME (250 μm).l-[14C]Citrulline content was determined by liquid scintillation counting after separation from the reaction mixture by passage through a column of the cation exchange resin Dowex AG 50WX-8 (500 μl of the Na+ form). Samples of buffer containing l-[14C]arginine in the absence of heart tissue were added to the Dowex resin column to determine background counts, which were subtracted from all other measurements. eNOS activity was determined by subtracting total counts froml-NAME blocked counts and normalized for protein content (measured by the Bradford method) and conversion time. All activity detected was calcium-dependent and blocked by EGTA, confirming that it was from eNOS. For studies of the pH dependence of enzyme denaturation, particulate fractions of heart homogenates were mixed with solutions of potassium phthalate buffer producing different final pH values, and eNOS activity was assayed. To simulate pH changes that occur in ischemic and reperfused hearts, pellets were incubated with phthalate buffer at pH 5.5 for 1, 5, or 10 min alone or followed by restoration of pH to 7.4 with NaOH. eNOS activity was measured at each time point either immediately after renormalization of pH or after 10 min. Control, ischemic, and reperfused heart homogenates were aliquoted in 100-μg samples into 62.5 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, followed by heat denaturation at 96 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrilamide gel, and electrophoresis was carried out for 30 min at 200 V. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% milk solution prepared in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies (1:500 dilution) raised against the polypeptides 1030–1209 of human eNOS were incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Then, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were incubated with the membranes for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation with the streptavidin-biotinylated alkaline phosphatase complex. Membrane color was developed for approximately 10 min using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium color development solution. Five-micrometer cryostat sections of heart tissue were fixed in alumina-filtered acetone for 10 min and mounted on Histostik-coated slides. The slides were rinsed twice with Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min in a humidity chamber with 0.1 mg/ml avidin followed by 0.05 mg/ml biotin and then quenched with 0.05% H2O2 (v/v). Sections were blocked with 0.5% dried milk and 1% normal goat serum for 10 min. Immunostaining was accomplished by sequential application of a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the peptides 1030–1209 of the human eNOS (1:100 dilution), biotinylated goat anti-mouse Fc IgG, and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase complex (pH 8.2). The chromogen Fast Red substrate was used for labeling. Slides were counterstained with Mayers modified hematoxylin, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared with xylene, and coverslipped. As negative controls, heart sections were incubated with secondary and tertiary antibodies in the absence of the primary. Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise noted.l-[14C]arginine was obtained from DuPont NEN. Protein assay reagents and secondary and tertiary antibodies were acquired from Bio-Rad. Monoclonal and polyclonal eNOS antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance of differences was evaluated by Student's unpaired t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance. eNOS activity was unchanged in hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia (1.13 ± 0.11 pmol ofl-citrulline/min × mg of protein) compared with controls (1.01 ± 0.10 pmol of l-citrulline/min × mg of protein) (Fig. 1). However, ischemic durations of longer than 30 min caused a sharp decline in eNOS catalytic function, which became almost undetectable after 120 min of global heart ischemia (0.06 ± 0.02 pmol ofl-citrulline/min × mg of protein). These data show that, while in the early period of ischemia, normal enzyme activity persists; after prolonged ischemia of 60 min or more, eNOS activity is markedly impaired and may become a limiting factor for the synthesis of NO⋅. All activity detected in these experiments was Ca2+-dependent, indicating no contribution of the inducible isoform of the nitric-oxide synthase to the global activity measured. Upon reperfusion, a partial but significant recovery of eNOS activity was observed (Fig. 2). After 60 min of ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion, eNOS activity doubled when compared with end ischemic levels rising from a quarter to half of control levels. In addition, this recovery seemed to be more prominent in hearts subjected to shorter rather than longer periods of ischemia, suggesting that metabolic alterations that occur during ischemia may cause the loss of eNOS function. To determine whether alterations in the amount of eNOS protein after ischemia and reperfusion account for the changes in enzyme activity, Western blots of eNOS were performed on the heart samples. A band of approximately 135 kDa compatible with eNOS was detected by the amplified alkaline phosphatase method. Progressive reduction of size and density of the eNOS band was noticeable at 60 and 90 min of myocardial ischemia with decreases of 38 and 62%, respectively (Figs. 3 A and 4 A). However, no further alterations were seen after reperfusion (Figs. 3 B and 4 B). These data suggest that part of the loss in enzyme activity that occurs is due to protein degradation. This process is halted when flow is restored further, indicating that it is ischemia rather than reperfusion which results in enzyme dysfunction.Figure 4Quantitation of eNOS in Western blots of control, ischemic, and reperfused heart tissue. Eachbar corresponds to the mean value of the densitometry data obtained from three experiments and standard error brackets are shown.Panel A shows that 60 min of ischemia induces a 38% reduction in the eNOS protein that further decreases to approximately 40% of control levels after 90 min. In panel B comparative results are shown after 60 or 90 min of ischemia or ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. No significant additional change is seen after reperfusion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In control hearts a typical pattern of endothelial staining was seen with strong staining in arterioles, moderate staining in capillaries, and weak focal myocyte staining (Fig. 5). The changes in eNOS staining with ischemia paralleled those seen in the Western blots. After short periods of ischemia of 30 min or less no detectable change of eNOS staining in endothelial cells or myocytes was evident. In contrast, longer ischemic durations of 60 min induced a marked loss of staining in capillary endothelium and myocytes with a milder loss of staining in arterioles. These observations suggest that initial loss of eNOS occurs in capillary endothelial cells and myocytes followed by subsequent loss in arteriolar endothelium. To evaluate whether the loss of eNOS correlated with the onset of endothelial dysfunction, studies were performed to measure endothelial-dependent relaxation and endothelial-dependent constriction. Infusion of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator histamine (10−5m) in the coronary circulation of rat hearts at basal conditions induced a rapid increase in coronary flow. After the hearts were exposed to 30 min of ischemia followed by 45 min reflow, histamine-induced flow enhancement was only mildly blunted (22 ± 6%) compared with the control group (32 ± 3%;p = NS), whereas flow decrease imposed byl-NAME (1 mm) was still largely preserved (ischemia 30 ± 4% versus control 31 ± 2%). However, longer periods of ischemia were associated with a rapid decline of the endothelial response (Fig. 6). These results indicate that eNOS-associated endothelium-dependent response is just mildly impaired after short ischemic periods but becomes markedly impaired after prolonged ischemia. The time course of the onset of this endothelial dysfunction mirrored that of the loss of eNOS activity. Because pH markedly decreases in ischemic hearts and may cause a loss of enzyme function, the effect of pH on eNOS activity was investigated. Heart particulate fractions that contain cardiac eNOS were titrated over the pH range from 7.4 to 5.5 and activity was measured and plotted as a function of pH (Fig. 7). Maximal eNOS catalytic function was observed at pH 7.4. Activity markedly decreased at pH values below 7.0 and at pH 5.5, enzyme function was almost completely lost. The observed titration curve of activity versus pH was accurately fit by the Henderson Hasselbalch equation with a pK value of 6.6. Therefore, cardiac eNOS activity is maximized in the physiological range and activity is lost as the pH is lowered corresponding with the titration of a functional amino acid group with pK of 6.6. To determine the effect of periods of acidosis similar to that occurring in the ischemic heart after 30 min of ischemia where pH falls to 5.5, as well as the effects of pH normalization as occurs on reperfusion, incubation of the partially purified eNOS was performed in phthalate buffer at pH 5.5 followed by normalization to pH 7.4 and immediate enzyme assay. Incubation in this acidotic buffer caused a rapid loss of enzymatic activity, as indicated in Fig. 8. Exposing the enzyme for 1 min to this acidotic pH resulted in a 29% decrease in eNOS function. Incubations as short as 10 min induced a decline of almost 80% of the enzymatic activity. However, when samples were incubated at pH 7.4 for 10 min after being exposed to pH 5.5 and then assayed for activity, a partial recovery simulating the in vivo response was detected. With enzyme subjected to short periods of acidosis of only 1 or 5 min, almost complete recovery of activity was seen within 10 min following renormalization of pH and with enzyme exposed to acidosis for longer periods of 10 min marked restoration of activity was seen with more than a 2-fold increase in eNOS activity from the value observed immediately after pH normalization. These results imply that the low pH associated with ischemia might play a role in the loss of eNOS activity whereas the recovery of pH to physiological levels during reperfusion may contribute to the partial restoration seen. Loss of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation occurs in hearts subjected to ischemia or ischemia followed by reperfusion (6Van Benthuysen K.M. McMurtry I.F. Horwitz L.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 7Tsao P.S. Lefer A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1660-H1666PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mehta J.L. Nichols W.W. Donnelly W.H.

Res. 1993; 72: 403-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both receptor-mediated and nonreceptor-mediated endothelial responses are abolished, while endothelium-independent responses to vasodilators which directly form NO⋅ are maintained (5Johns R.A. Linden J.M. Peach M.J. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Van Benthuysen K.M. McMurtry I.F. Horwitz L.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that impaired NO⋅ synthesis from eNOS is the cause of postischemic endothelial dysfunction, however, the mechanistic basis for this phenomenon was not known. While it was hypothesized that alterations in eNOS might occur, the presence, magnitude, time course, and nature of these alterations were not previously characterized. The data presented here provide the first determination of the alterations in eNOS protein and activity during myocardial ischemia and the role of these alterations in endothelial dysfunction. The magnitude of NO⋅ formation from NOS can be modulated by a number of factors including the level and activity of the enzyme; the concentration of the requisite substrates l-arginine, NADPH, and oxygen; and the levels of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (16Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). While all of these factors affect NO⋅ generation, the presence and activity of the enzyme is of paramount importance. Therefore, the present study focused on measuring the alterations in enzyme levels and function which occur during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. It was observed that short ischemic durations of 30 min or less did not affect enzyme activity as measured by l-arginine tol-citrulline conversion. Protein levels measured by Western blotting were also unchanged, and on immunohistochemistry no change in the amount or cellular localization of the enzyme was observed. However, with longer ischemic durations of 60 min or more a marked loss of activity was seen with 77% loss after 60 min, 84% loss after 90 min, and near complete loss after 120 min. This loss of activity was partially reversed after reperfusion, however, even after 45 min of reflow eNOS activity was still markedly decreased from preischemic values with residual 50, 35, and 20% levels seen in hearts which were subjected to 60, 90, or 120 min of ischemia, respectively. Thus, ischemia resulted in a marked time-dependent loss of enzyme activity with only partial restoration during subsequent reperfusion. Due to the acute nature of these isolated heart experiments, there was insufficient time for significant protein synthesis, therefore, these observations suggest that ischemia results in a combination of irreversible and reversible denaturation of eNOS. Irreversible loss of activity could be due to degradation of eNOS protein. Western blotting demonstrated that while short ischemic times of 30 min caused no change in enzyme levels, longer ischemic times of 60 or 90 min, caused decreases of 38 and 62%, respectively. It has been previously reported that ischemia results in activation of cellular proteases (22McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that the loss of eNOS on Western blotting is due to protein degradation. This loss of eNOS protein was not reversed after reperfusion further demonstrating that the partial restoration of eNOS activity seen after reperfusion was not due to new protein synthesis. Ischemia results in marked intracellular acidification which can result in enzyme denaturation with a loss of enzyme activity. 31P NMR studies have previously demonstrated that after 30 min of global ischemia intramyocardial pH falls to a value of 5.5 (23Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that eNOS loses its catalytic function when the pH is lowered to this range (24Fleming I. Hecker M. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to determine the precise effect of acidification on the activity of cardiac eNOS. We observed that loss of activity corresponded to the titration of a functional amino acid group with pK of 6.6. Since this pK value corresponds most closely to that expected for titration of the thiol group of cysteine and the critical heme center of eNOS contains an axially bound cysteine, it is possible that the loss of enzyme activity seen may correspond to titration of the heme bound cysteine. Alternatively it could represent titration of other cysteines on the enzyme or be due to effects on cofactor binding. These data suggest that the loss of eNOS activity observed during ischemia could be explained by the following three-step process. First, in step 1, acidosis triggers the titration of a critical amino acid residue. Then, in step 2, this would lead to further altered protein conformation with a partially unfolded protein. Finally, in step 3, the unfolded protein conformation would then be susceptible to proteolytic degradation, leading to the irreversible loss of enzyme activity. This model would explain the stepwise loss of eNOS activity seen during ischemia that progresses from reversible loss of activity to irreversible loss of activity accompanied by degradation of the enzyme. It would also account for the progressive loss of enzyme activity and protein that occurs as a function of ischemic duration. The first two steps with pH-induced alteration in protein conformation could be potentially reversed upon renormalization of pH as occurs upon reperfusion; however, after proteolytic cleavage the loss of activity would be irreversible. The reversibility of steps 1 and 2 would explain why a partial restoration of activity can be seen following reperfusion, while step 3 explains the irreversible loss of enzyme which occurs. The loss of enzyme activity closely correlated with the loss of endothelial vascular reactivity seen in these hearts. While only small changes in reactivity were seen after 30 min of ischemia, after 60 min, marked loss of vascular reactivity occurred. With administration of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME decreased flow is normally observed; however, after 60 min or 90 min of ischemia, this response was decreased by 45 or 68%, respectively, paralleling the loss of eNOS activity (Table I). A marked loss of histamine-induced vasodilation was seen with a 90% decrease after 60 min of ischemia and a 95% decrease seen after 90 min of ischemia. The earlier loss of vasodilation at 30 min may indicate that, in addition to loss of enzyme, other alterations also occur that impair the vasodilatory response. Histamine induces vasodilation by increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, which in turn activate eNOS, a calcium dependent enzyme. During and following ischemia intracellular free calcium concentrations are elevated (25Weiss R.G. Gerstenblith G. Lakatta E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This increase in basal calcium levels in the postischemic heart could result in further base-line activation of eNOS that would subsequently limit the magnitude of stimulated vasodilation to histamine. Previous direct electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of NO⋅ formation in postischemic hearts after 30 min of ischemia confirm that basal NO⋅ levels are increased after reperfusion compared with preischemic levels (26Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that after prolonged periods of ischemia increasing NO⋅ formation occurs due to enzyme independent formation from nitrite (23Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Thus, while the loss in eNOS activity observed in the present study paralleled the observed loss of endothelial reactivity other mechanisms may also contribute to this process.Table ICorrelation of ischemia-induced alterations in eNOS activity, eNOS protein, and vascular reactivityPreischemic controlTime of ischemia30 min60 min90 minNo reflowReflowNo reflowReflowNo reflowReflow%%%%eNOS activity10011210923501635eNOS protein10011462663835Vasoreactivity l-NAME-induced vasocontraction31301710 Histamine-induced vasodilation322232eNOS activity and protein values are expressed as percent of preischemic control values, while vasoreactivity values show either percent decrease in flow due to l-NAME (1 mm) or percent increase due to histamine (10−5m). Open table in a new tab eNOS activity and protein values are expressed as percent of preischemic control values, while vasoreactivity values show either percent decrease in flow due to l-NAME (1 mm) or percent increase due to histamine (10−5m). Prior studies in endothelial cell models have suggested other possible mechanisms that could also result in reduced enzymatic formation of NO⋅. It has been suggested that substrate depletion ofl-arginine or cosubstrate depletion of oxygen or NADPH could be important. It has been shown that endothelial derived relaxation is abolished by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration (27Griffith T.M. Edwards D.H. Newby A.L. Lewis M.J. Henderson A.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1986; 20: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) which result in decreased NADPH availability and thatl-citrulline recycling to l-arginine by endothelial cells can be blocked causing the l-arginine pool to decrease (28Sessa W.C. Hecker M. Mitchel J.A. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8607-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, tetrahydrobiopterin levels also regulate endothelial function (29Cosentino F. Katusic Z.S. Circulation. 1995; 91: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The formation ofN-monomethyl-l-arginine-like endogenous substances that block eNOS has been described (30Vallance P. Leone A. Calver A. Collier J. Moncada S. J. Vasc. Res. 1992; 29: 217Google Scholar). While these other mechanisms could contribute to the alterations in vascular reactivity which occur during ischemia and reperfusion, they all require the presence of functional eNOS, so that loss of active enzyme would be of critical importance even if other alterations also occur. From our observations, these mechanisms could be important in the pathogenesis of altered vascular reactivity with relatively short ischemic durations, where eNOS activity is preserved. It has been suggested that superoxide generated upon reperfusion may also result in rapid inactivation of NO⋅ (31Rubanyi G.M. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H822-H827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that superoxide dismutase can prevent postischemic injury (7Tsao P.S. Lefer A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1660-H1666PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsao P.S. Aoki N. Lefer D.J.

Physiol. 1989; 257: H1240-H1246PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that superoxide and NO⋅ formed during early reperfusion react to form peroxynitrite, which in turn causes cellular injury (34Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Since superoxide formation is increased only during the early period of reperfusion this mechanism could be involved in direct breakdown of NO⋅ during the early minutes of reperfusion. However, since the endothelial impairment persists in late reflow well after the burst of superoxide generation, it is clear that the observed alterations in endothelial function cannot be explained by simple scavenging of NO⋅ by superoxide. It has also been hypothesized that eNOS could be damaged by oxygen radicals generated during early reflow (35Rubanyi G.M. Vanhouette P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 250: H815-H821Google Scholar). However, we observe that enzyme function was impaired during ischemia and actually improved after reperfusion. Thus, we observed that a marked progressive loss of eNOS activity occurred during ischemia with only partial restoration upon reperfusion. This loss of activity paralleled the loss of vascular reactivity observed, indicating that endothelial dysfunction occurred due to decreased functional eNOS. The loss of enzyme activity and protein observed, was best explained by acidosis-dependent denaturation, which was initially reversible, but was followed by proteolysis. These findings indicate that loss of eNOS activity and protein is a critical factor that results in endothelial dysfunction in the postischemic heart.

To analyze the transition from agonist to antagonist and to identify the amino acid residues involved in ligand activation of the GLP-1 receptor, we used exendin analogs with successive N-terminal truncations. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the rat GLP-1 receptor were assayed for changes in intracellular cAMP caused by the test peptides in the absence or presence of half-maximal stimulatory doses of GLP-1. N-terminal truncation of a single amino acid reduced the agonist activity of the exendin peptide, whereas N-terminal truncation of 3–7 amino acids produced antagonists that were 4–10-fold more potent than exendin-(9–39). N-terminal truncation of GLP-1 by 2 amino acids resulted in weak agonist activity, but an 8-amino acid N-terminal truncation inactivated the peptide. Binding studies performed using 125I-labeled GLP-1 confirmed that all bioactive peptides specifically displaced tracer with high potency. In a set of exendin/GLP-1 chimeric peptides, substitution of GLP-1 sequences into exendin-(3–39) produced loss of antagonist activity with conversion to a weak agonist. The results show that receptor binding and activation occur in separate domains of exendin, but they are more closely coupled in GLP-1.

Goke R. Goke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The physiological action of GLP-1 gained considerable interest following the demonstration that GLP-1 acts on the pancreatic islet beta cells as a potent glucose-dependent insulin secretagogue (2Weir G.C.

The GLP-1 receptor is a putative seven-transmembrane domain receptor (9Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors that includes glucagon-secretin-vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors. GLP-1 binding to the pancreatic beta cell receptor induces an increase in intracellular cAMP levels (10Wheeler M.B. Lu M. Dillon J.S. Leng X.-H. Chen C. Boyd III, A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Exendin-4-(1–39) (exendin) was originally isolated from Gila monster venom (11Eng J. Kleinman W.A. Singh L. Singh G. Raufman J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7402-7405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a member of the glucagon-secretin-vasoactive intestinal peptide family of peptides. It has 48% amino acid sequence homology to glucagon and 50% homology to human GLP-1. An antagonist, exendin-4-(9–39) (Ex9), was created by the deletion of 8 N-terminal amino acids from exendin (12Raufman J.-P. Singh L. Eng J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21432-21437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work by Thorens et al. (13Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.-P. Morel P. Widmann C. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that exendin acts directly on the GLP-1 receptor as an agonist, whereas Ex9 acts as an antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor and provided the first high potency antagonist of GLP-1. The purpose of this study is 2-fold: first, to analyze the transition from agonist to antagonist between exendin and Ex9, and second, to characterize the peptide domains of exendin that confer binding and thus antagonist activity by constructing exendin-(3–39)/GLP-1-(9–36)-amide chimeras and by testing them for the retention of antagonist activity. Peptides were synthesized on a PAL resin solid-phase support using activated Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-amino acids on a Milligen 9050 automated peptide synthesizer. Cleavage and deprotection of peptides were performed using 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% anisole, and 2% ethanedithiol. Crude synthetic peptide mixtures were individually purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography. Purified peptides were quantitated by amino acid analysis. Full-length GLP-1 receptor cDNA isolated from rat pancreas (gift from Dr. Bernard Thorens, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) was subcloned in pSVbeta (CLONTEC, Palo Alto, CA) downstream of the SV40 promoter after replacing the β-galactosidase gene with a full-length GLP-1 receptor cDNA to obtain pSVGLPR. CHO cells that overexpress the human insulin receptor (CHO/HIRc cells) were trypsinized and resuspended in Ham's F-12 medium. Cells (106 cells in 800 μl) were cotransfected with 10 μg of HindIII-linearized pSVGLPR plasmid and 1 μg of BamHI-linearized pSVHPH plasmid (conferring hygromycin resistance; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) by electroporation. Electroporation was performed using a Genepulser (Bio-Rad) in a cuvette with a 0.4-cm gap electrode at 300 mV and 960 microfarads. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cells were diluted and plated in multiwell plates and left overnight at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Cells were then treated with 700 μg/ml hygromycin for 10 days, after which single colonies were observed. The clones (CHO/pancGLPR cells) were passaged and allowed to propagate to obtain cells for genomic DNA and RNA preparations. The presence of the GLP-1 receptor in the genomic DNA and the transcripts was observed in six out of eight clones. In addition, the plasmid pSVHPH alone was transfected as a control to obtain CHO/HPH cells. Cultures of CHO/HPH or CHO/pancGLPR cells grown to confluence on 60-mm plates were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were scraped and solubilized in 50 μl of 2 × Tris/glycine/SDS sample buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 s in aerosol-hydrophobic barrier tips (Para Scientific Co., Fairless Hills, PA) placed in microcentrifuge tubes. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 4–12% Tris/glycine gel (Novex) without preheating or boiling and transferred to a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk. After washing the membranes in a solution of 20 mm Tris, 137 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), the membranes were probed with 5 μg/ml anti-N-terminal GLP-1 receptor antibody (a generous gift of Dr. Bernard Thorens) in 1% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antiserum (Amersham Corp.) at a titer of 1:2500 for an additional hour. The membranes were washed three times in TBST for 10 min at room temperature following each antibody incubation. Positive immunoreactions were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). Binding studies were performed on cells plated on 12-well dishes and grown to confluence. Cells were washed with serum-free Ham's F-12 medium for 2 h before the experiment. Cells were then washed twice with 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 13 mm sodium acetate, 5 mmKCl, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 500 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm glucose, 0.03–100 nm GLP-1 or other peptides, and 30,000 cpm125I-GLP-1 (0.01 nm). At the end of the incubation, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at room temperature with 0.5 ml of 0.5n NaOH and 0.1% SDS for 10 min. Radioactivity in cell lysates was measured in an ICN Apec Series γ-counter. Specific binding was determined as total binding minus the radioactivity associated with cells incubated in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled GLP-1 (0.5 μm). Transfected CHO cells grown on 12-well plates were washed three times and incubated with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then exposed to Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and peptides for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 5 min with ice-cold 0.6 mm perchloric acid. The pH values of the cell lysates were then adjusted to 7.0 using 5 mK2CO3, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant was vacuum-dried and solubilized in 500 μl of 500 mm Tris and 4 mmEDTA buffer, pH 7.5. After addition of 50 μl of 0.15 mmNa2CO3 and 50 μl of 0.15 mmZnSO4, followed by incubation for 15 min on ice, the salt precipitate was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 ×g, and 50 μl of supernatant was assayed using a [3H]cAMP assay kit (Amersham Corp.). Cellular protein content was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) by solubilization of samples and standards in formic acid with γ-globulin as the standard. The presence of GLP-1 receptor expression in CHO/pancGLPR cells was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Using an antibody against the N-terminal region of the GLP-1 receptor, we obtained specific bands (Fig. 1, arrowheads) at 65 and 46 kDa in CHO/pancGLPR cells, but not in CHO/HPH cells. These bands were described previously (14Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 62-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to correspond to mature and core-glycosylated GLP-1 receptors, respectively. Similar to previously published results (14Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 62-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this N-terminal antibody also recognizes several other proteins at ∼70, 67, and 50 kDa in all CHO cells. Our data suggest that CHO cells transfected with the pancreatic GLP-1 receptor express and process the GLP-1 receptor similar to pancreatic beta cells (14Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 62-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the dose response to GLP-1 and exendin by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in CHO/pancGLPR cells. As shown in Fig. 2, exendin was a more potent agonist than GLP-1. Concentrations of peptide resulting in a half-maximal response were 0.033 ± 0.006 and 0.118 ± 0.02 nm for exendin and GLP-1, respectively (n = 6;p < 0.01). At the maximum concentration tested (10 nm), both exendin and GLP-1 induced the same maximum rise in cAMP levels (168.8 ± 32.5 and 169.1 ± 31.9 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). Control CHO cells transfected with vector alone (CHO/HPH) did not respond to 10 nm GLP-1 or exendin. The intracellular cAMP content was 1.7 ± 0.4 pmol/mg of protein in the absence of peptides and 2.0 ± 0.4 or 2.0 ± 0.2 pmol/mg of protein in the presence of 10 nm GLP-1 or exendin, respectively. Control experiments confirmed that both agonists acted at a single receptor in CHO/pancGLPR cells since a rise in cAMP levels induced by 10 nm GLP-1 was not further enhanced by 10 nm exendin (data not shown). The results are compared with the response after N-terminal deletion of 1 amino acid from exendin (Ex2). Although agonist activity was maintained with Ex2, the dose-response curve was shifted to the right, and the maximum response was lower than that obtained with 10 nm GLP-1 or full-length exendin. We studied a series of N-terminal truncated exendin and GLP-1 peptides for agonist and antagonist activities. The series of peptides and the nomenclature are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 4 A, we first examined the effect of progressively truncating a single amino acid from the N terminus of exendin peptides. As shown above in Fig. 2, Ex2 retained agonist activity. Substitution of the aspartic acid at position 9 with glutamic acid (des-His-[Glu9]Ex2 (Ex(desHis,Glu9))) completely abolished the agonist activity of Ex2 (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that this residue is essential to agonist activity as it is in the related glucagon molecule (15Unson C.G. Macdonald D. Ray K. Durrah T.L. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2763-2766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that the N-terminal truncation of the exendin peptide by 2–8 amino acids (Ex3–Ex9) as well as the N-terminal truncation of the GLP-1 peptide by 2 or 8 amino acids lead to the loss of agonist activity since these peptides are incapable of elevating intracellular cAMP levels. Therefore, the N-terminal amino acids are important for receptor activation.Figure 4Agonist and antagonist activities of N-terminal truncated analogs of exendin and GLP-1. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured in CHO/pancGLPR cells. A, cells were incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of a 10 nm concentration of various peptides.

As shown in Fig. 4 B, Ex2 (10 nm) had no significant effect. However, Ex3–Ex9 were antagonists since they reduced intracellular cAMP levels induced by GLP-1. Using data obtained from separate experiments, there was a significant inhibition of intracellular cAMP levels by various peptides compared with GLP-1 alone. The substitution of amino acid 9 with glutamic acid in Ex2, des-His-[Glu9]Ex2 (Ex(desHis,Glu9)), converted the peptide to a strong antagonist as it inhibited GLP-1-induced cAMP production by 85.7 ± 3.2% (mean ± S.E., n= 3). Based on these experiments, we also analyzed key truncated GLP-1 peptides for comparison. N-terminal truncation of GLP-1 by 2 or 8 amino acids did not convert the resulting peptides to antagonists since GLP-(9–36) and GLP-(15–36) did not induce a significant inhibition of GLP-1-induced cAMP production (12 ± 7% and 13.4 ± 8.5% decreases, respectively; mean ± S.E., n = 4). Table I compiles information about the antagonist potency (I/A50) of different peptides, showing that Ex3 has ∼3-fold more potent antagonist activity than the known Ex9 antagonist. As shown in Table I, there is increased antagonist activity with further N-terminal truncation. The most potent antagonist was obtained after a 4-amino acid truncation of exendin (Ex5).Table IBinding affinity and antagonist parameters of various GLP-1 analogsGLP-1 analogIC501-aThe concentration that completed 50% of125I-GLP-1 binding was calculated in three to six separate experiments performed in triplicate. cAMP was measured in CHO/pancGLPR in the presence of GLP-1 and various antagonists.I/A50 1-bValues are presented for agonists of analogs with binding affinity that was too low to determine I/A50.,1-cI/A50, the inhibition index is the ratio of the concentration of antagonist to agonist concentration needed to reduce the GLP-1 response to 50% of its response in the absence of an antagonist.GLP-1-(7–36)1.3 ± 0.5GLP-(9–36)122.4 ± 29.4GLP-(15–36)477.7 ± 139.3Exendin-4-(1–39)0.17 ± 0.04Exendin-4-(2–39)0.21 ± 0.04Exendin-4-(3–39)0.41 ± 0.0883Exendin-4-(4–39)0.3 ± 0.141Exendin-4-(5–39)0.3 ± 0.124Exendin-4-(6–39)0.5 ± 0.231Exendin-4-(7–39)0.4 ± 0.141Exendin-4-(8–39)0.9 ± 0.276Exendin-4-(9–39)1.0 ± 0.3258Des-His-[Glu9]Ex20.2 ± 0.116Chimera 1109.8 ± 34.5Chimera 279.5 ± 11.0Chimera 36.04 ± 1.07555Chimera 4176.0 ± 40.8Chimera 5272.3 ± 31.4Chimera 611.4 ± 1.46674125I-GLP-1 binding to intact CHO/pancGLPR cells was completed with various concentrations of different peptides.1-a The concentration that completed 50% of125I-GLP-1 binding was calculated in three to six separate experiments performed in triplicate. cAMP was measured in CHO/pancGLPR in the presence of GLP-1 and various antagonists.1-b Values are presented for agonists of analogs with binding affinity that was too low to determine I/A50.1-c I/A50, the inhibition index is the ratio of the concentration of antagonist to agonist concentration needed to reduce the GLP-1 response to 50% of its response in the absence of an antagonist. Open table in a new tab 125I-GLP-1 binding to intact CHO/pancGLPR cells was completed with various concentrations of different peptides. We performed competition binding studies to assess whether the observed effects among the N-terminal truncated exendin peptides (and lack of activity of various N-terminal truncated GLP-1 peptides) were due to differences in binding affinities for the GLP-1 receptor. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table I, exendin and Ex2–Ex7 displaced 125I-GLP-1 binding with higher affinity than did GLP-1. Ex8 and Ex9 have affinities similar to that of GLP-1. In contrast to the results with exendin peptides, N-terminal truncation of the GLP-1 peptide by 2 and 8 amino acids significantly reduced binding affinity by ∼100- and 500-fold, respectively. This suggests that the binding and activation sites are closely associated in the GLP-1 molecule. Control experiments showed no specific binding of125I-GLP-1 in control CHO/HPH cells transfected with vector alone (data not shown). To assess which amino acid sequences of exendin are important to confer antagonist properties and high binding affinity, we created chimeras between N-terminal truncated GLP-1 and exendin peptides that contain progressively more C-terminal sequences of exendin substituted into the GLP-1 peptide (chimeras 1–6 in Fig. 3). Using GLP-(9–36) and Ex3 sequences, we created chimeras 1–3. Using GLP-(15–36) and Ex9, we created chimeras 4–6. As shown in Fig. 6 A, GLP-(9–36) had 4 orders of magnitude lower agonist potency than the full sequence of GLP-1 or exendin. Substituting increasing amounts of C-terminal exendin sequences (in chimeras 1–3) lowered agonist activity and increased antagonist activity (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6 B, 100 nm GLP-(9–36) had no effect on cAMP production induced by 0.1 nm GLP-1, but 100 nmchimera 3 inhibited GLP-1-induced cAMP production by 52.0 ± 8.9% (mean ± S.E., n = 3). In one experiment, 1 μm GLP-(9–36) did not inhibit cAMP production induced by 0.1 nm GLP-1. For comparison, 100 nm Ex3 inhibited GLP-1-induced cAMP production by 85.4 ± 4.6% (n = 4). The difference between chimera 3 and Ex3 suggests that the GLP-1 sequence in chimera 3 contributes to the function of the chimeric peptide. Therefore, we created chimeras 4–6, in which the N-terminal GLP-1 sequences were shortened by 6 amino acids, thus removing the portion of the molecule most homologous between exendin and GLP-1 (see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 6, increasing the C-terminal exendin sequence in chimeras 4–6 also increased antagonist activity. The 6 amino acids of GLP-1 retained in chimera 6 continued to affect peptide function. Chimera 6 and Ex9 inhibited the GLP-1-induced cAMP increase by 53.3 ± 3.6% (n = 3) and 70 ± 12% (n = 3), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table I, we assessed the ability of the chimeric peptides to displace125I-GLP-1 binding. The results show that chimeras 1, 2, 4, and 5 have ∼2 orders of magnitude lower binding affinity for the GLP-1 receptor than does GLP-1. Increasing the C-terminal exendin sequences in chimeras 3 and 6 increased the binding affinity by an order of magnitude. Chimeras 3 and 6 displaced 125I-GLP-1 binding with only 6–10-fold lower affinity than GLP-1. The model of GLP-1 receptor activation is similar to that of glucagon receptor activation. Two separate steps are important: ligand binding to the receptor, followed by activation of the receptor by the bound ligand (15Unson C.G. Macdonald D. Ray K. Durrah T.L. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2763-2766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Unson C.G. Gurzenda E.M. Iwasa K. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol.

The occurrence of binding together with activation results in agonist activity. However, receptor binding in the absence of receptor activation yields a peptide antagonist. In GLP-1, glucagon, and glucose-independent insulinotropic peptide, the N-terminal region has previously been shown to be important for receptor activation (5Adelhorst K. Hedegaard B.B. Knudsen L.B. Kirk O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6275-6278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Andreu D. Merrifield R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Brown J.C. Dahl M. Kwauk S. McIntosh C.H.S. Otte S.C. Pederson R.A. Peptides. 1981; 2: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using exendin, which has a higher affinity for the GLP-1 receptor compared with GLP-1, we have shown that the successive removal of amino acids from the N terminus of exendin disables the ability of the peptides to promote receptor activation. However, these N-terminal truncated peptides continue to bind the receptor with high affinity, thus becoming antagonists. In this study, we have identified several antagonists of the GLP-1 receptor with 3–16-fold higher potency than the previously known antagonist (13Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.-P. Morel P. Widmann C. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ex9. Receptor binding does not predict agonist or antagonist activity since full-length exendin and Ex2 bind with high affinity and are agonists, whereas Ex3–Ex7 bind equally well but are antagonists. However, among agonists or antagonists, receptor binding affinity predicts the potency of action. Full-length exendin (which has a higher binding affinity than GLP-1) was more potent at inducing cAMP production than was GLP-1. Among the antagonists, Ex3–Ex7 have higher binding affinity than Ex8 or Ex9 and also have higher antagonist potency. The N-terminal domains of exendin and GLP-1 are closely related (see Fig. 3), but manipulation of these closely related sequences had differential effects on receptor binding and activation. Elimination of 2 N-terminal amino acids from exendin (Ex3) yields a peptide that binds with the same affinity as full-length exendin, but antagonizes GLP-1 action. In contrast, truncation of 2 N-terminal amino acids from GLP-1 (GLP-(9–36)) produces a peptide that is a weak agonist with 100-fold lower receptor affinity. Similarly, after truncation of 8 N-terminal amino acids from exendin and GLP-1 peptides, the resultant Ex9 was an antagonist with high affinity, whereas GLP-(15–36) bound with 500-fold lower affinity and became a virtually inactive peptide at the concentrations tested. Our data suggest that similar to glucagon (21Unson C.G. Macdonald D. Merrifield R.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), receptor binding and activation are closely associated in the GLP-1 molecule. In contrast, similar amino acid deletions were able to dissociate binding and activation in the exendin molecule. Aspartic acid at position 9 of the exendin peptide seems to be important for receptor activation. Analogous to the glucagon molecule (22Unson C.G. Andreu D. Gurzenda E.M. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4083-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), this aspartate substitution in Ex2 did not modify the binding affinity, but converted the peptide to a strong GLP-1 antagonist. Our data suggest that in addition to the GLP-1 molecule, in which sequences in the N terminus (this study) and C terminus (23Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1996; 157: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) are important for receptor binding and activation, sequences within the core portion of exendin (aspartic acid at position 9) are also important for activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV degrades GLP-1 by 2 amino acids, thereby inactivating the peptide (24Kieffer T.J. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 25Mentlein R. Gallwitz B. Schmidt W.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 26Deacon C.F. Nauck M.A. Toft-Nielsen M. Pridal L. Willms B. Holst J.J. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, exendin contains a glycine at position 2 and is predicted to be resistant to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. A previous report (27Knudsen L.B. Nielsen P.F. Adelhorst K. Kirk O. Wulff B.S. Regul. Pept. 1996; 64: 92Google Scholar) showed that GLP-(9–36) is an antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor. However, in that study, high micromolar concentrations of the peptide were used to observe antagonist activity. In our study, we could not detect antagonist activity at 100 nm GLP-(9–36), a concentration that displaced 60% of 125I-GLP-1 binding. In addition, in one experiment, 1 μm GLP-(9–36) was incapable of antagonizing the effect of 0.1 nm GLP-1. It is possible that at higher concentrations and/or higher molar ratios of antagonist to agonist, antagonist activity would be detected. However, we detected only weak agonist activity of GLP-(9–36) at 1 μm. This suggests that GLP-(9–36) may be a partial agonist/antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor. Using various chimeric peptides, we have identified specific regions in the exendin peptide that are important for receptor binding. Increasing the C-terminal exendin sequence in chimera 1, 2, or 3 and in chimera 4, 5, or 6 increased binding affinity and antagonist activity. Comparisons between chimera 2 versus 3 and chimera 5 versus 6 suggest that the amino acids within the EEAVRL region of the exendin peptide are important since the addition of this sequence cluster increased the binding affinity by 10–20-fold. In addition, comparisons of chimeras 3 and 6 versus Ex3 and Ex9, respectively, suggest that amino acids within the LSKQM region of the exendin peptide can still improve further the binding affinity by 10-fold. Further mutational analysis of individual amino acids in these domains could identify more precisely the sites important for exendin molecule binding to the receptor. The results also have implications for GLP-1 peptide action. Similar comparisons of chimera 2 versus 3 and chimera 5 versus 6 as well as comparisons of chimeras 3 and 6 versus Ex3 and Ex9, respectively, suggest that the amino acids within the GQAAKE and VSSYL regions of GLP-1 could have no effect or a negative regulatory role in binding affinity. These results are in accord with previously published data (5Adelhorst K. Hedegaard B.B. Knudsen L.B. Kirk O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6275-6278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gallwitz B. Witt M. Paetzold G. Morys-Wortmann C. Zimmermann B. Eckart K. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) where substitutions of some amino acids within these regions of GLP-1 with alanine did not have detrimental effects on binding affinity. In this study, we have identified several potent antagonists of the GLP-1 receptor. Truncating the exendin peptide by 3–6 N-terminal amino acids results in the production of the most potent antagonists of the GLP-1 receptor yet discovered. Structure-function relationships among these various antagonists would allow the creation of models to predict binding sites of the exendin peptide to the receptor. Our data also clearly show that the receptor-binding domain of GLP-1 is distinct from exendin peptide binding. Finally, the use of these potent antagonists of the GLP-1 receptor may allow the discovery of previously unidentified physiological functions of GLP-1 (28Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Eng J. Wang Y. Grieg N. Egan J.M. Regul. Pept. 1996; 64: 131Google Scholar). We thank Lisa G. Adams for expert technical assistance and Michele D. Buckler for valuable secretarial assistance. In addition, we thank Dr. Bernard Thorens for the generous gift of GLP-1 receptor antibody and Dr. Michel Bernier for valuable discussions."

Similarly, immunoblotting analysis of thymocyte Src expression before and after selective depletion of active Src protein indicated that the proportion of active relative to inactive Src protein is markedly reduced in motheaten compared with wild-type cells. These observations, together with the finding of reduced Src activity in HEY cells expressing a dominant negative form of SHP-1, provide compelling evidence that SHP-1 functions include the positive regulation of Src activation.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These observations, together with data implicating the viral transforming v-Src protein in the phosphorylation of SHP-1 (26Matozaki T. Uchida T. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggest that, in at least some cell lineages, SHP-1 interacts with Src and may serve to activate Src by dephosphorylating the COOH-terminal regulatory tyrosine.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether the COOH-terminal or other phosphotyrosine residues within Src are subject to dephosphorylation by SHP-1, the effects of this phosphatase on Src tyrosine phosphorylation were initially examined using CNBr cleavage analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, CNBr treatment of32P-labeled human Src has been shown previously to yield phosphorylated cleavage fragments of about 31, 9.7, and 4.7 kDa, which, respectively, contain the Src NH2-terminal region encompassing the major sites for serine phosphorylation on Src, Ser-12 and Ser-17 (31-kDa fragment), the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation site, Tyr-530 (4.7-kDa fragment), and a key site for autophosphorylation on activated Src, Tyr-419 (9.7-kDa fragment; Refs.14Ostergaard H.L.

As is consistent with these data, Tricine SDS-PAGE and subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis of the cleavage fragments derived by CNBr hydrolysis of Src immunoprecipitates from32P-labeled human T cells (Molt 4 and Jurkat) and freshly-isolated platelets also revealed a predominantly phosphoserine-containing 31-kDa and predominantly phosphotyrosine-containing 9.7- and 4.7-kDa fragments (Fig. 1,B and C). However, in addition to these fragments, the CNBr cleavage products generated in this analysis also included a phosphorylated fragment of about 3.3 kDa (Fig. 1 B), which was shown by phosphoamino acid analysis to contain primarily phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1 C). Based on the apparent molecular weight of this fragment and the locations of methionine residues within Src (Fig. 1 A), the 3.3-kDa cleavage fragment most likely corresponds to amino acids 315–341 within the Src catalytic domain, a possibility that suggests Tyr-338, a residue recently shown to become phosphorylated in the context ofin vitro phosphate labeling of Src (42Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigel D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), represents another site of Src tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo and as such may also be of relevance to the expression of Src kinase activity. By contrast, although one other site of tyrosine phosphorylation (corresponding to Tyr-216 in human Src) has recently been identified within the 31-kDa CNBr fragment (43Stover D.R. Furet P. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12481-12487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this phosphotyrosine was not detected under the conditions used in this current analysis.As CNBr cleavage analysis under the conditions used in this study distinguished the Src region containing Tyr-530 as well as the other major known sites for tyrosine phosphorylation on Src, this approach was next used to determine whether any of these sites represent targets for SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation in vitro. To this end,32P-labeled recombinant Src was incubated with GST fusion proteins carrying SHP-1 or, as a control, a mutated (C453S), catalytically inert form of SHP-1, and the effects of the latter proteins on the profile of phosphorylated CNBr Src cleavage fragments then examined. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the phosphorylated 9.7-, 4.7-, and 3.3-kDa CNBr fragments known to represent phosphotyrosine-containing regions of Src were again detected following CNBr hydrolysis of Src pretreated with inactive SHP-1 (C453S). By contrast, intensities of the bands representing each of these32P-labeled species, but most notably the 4.7- and 3.3-kDa phosphorylated fragments, were markedly reduced in the context of Src pretreatment with SHP-1, a result which suggests that the phosphotyrosine residues located in these fragments can be dephosphorylated in vitro by SHP-1. Along similar lines, SHP-1 treatment of in vitro 32P-labeled Src immunoprecipitates from human platelets was also associated with dramatic decreases in the signal intensities and, by extension, phosphorylation states of the three Tyr-containing CNBr-generated cleavage fragments (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 B, phosphorylation of the Src regions represented by the 4.7- and 3.3-kDa cleavage fragments again appeared to be more sensitive to SHP-1 pretreatment than was phosphorylation of the 9.7-kDa fragment. A further assessment of these changes by densitometric analysis revealed the reduction in phosphorylation levels following a 30-min or 60-min incubation of Src with SHP-1 to be about 8–10-fold and 2-fold, respectively, greater for the 4.7- and 3.3- than for the 9.7-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 C). Thus, while these data suggest the capacity of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate in vitro Tyr-419, Tyr-338, and Tyr-530, the major sites for tyrosine phosphorylation on the 9.7-, 3.3-, and 4.7-kDa cleavage fragments, respectively, these findings also indicate that SHP-1 exerts a more pronounced effect on the phosphorylation of Tyr-338 and Tyr-530 than on Tyr-419.Figure 2The SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase preferentially dephosphorylates Tyr-530 of phosphorylated Src. A, CNBr analysis of cleavage of SHP-1 treated in vitro labeled recombinant Src. Following 32P-labeling in vitro, 7 ng of recombinant Src was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 30 ng of GST fusion proteins containing catalytically inert SHP-1 (C453S) or with 30 ng of in-house-derived (1) or 60 ng of commercially obtained (2; UBI) GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins. The labeled Src was then purified and subjected to CNBr cleavage analysis, as in Fig. 1. B, CNBr cleavage of SHP-1-treated in vitro labeled platelet Src. Src immunoprecipitates prepared from 4 × 108 human platelets were 32P-labeled in vitro, incubated for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C with 30 ng of GST-SHP-1 fusion protein, and then purified and subjected to CNBr hydrolysis as above.C, phosphorylation of each phosphotyrosine-containing CNBr fragment shown in B was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer and tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) of the 9.7-, 4.7-, and 3.3-kDa cleavage fragments derived from SHP-1-treated Src was compared with that of the respective fragments derived from SHP-1 (C453S)-treated Src and the difference expressed as the percentage decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation.D, CNBr cleavage of SHP-1-treated in vivo labeled Src. Human platelets and Jurkat T cells were metabolically labeled with32PO4, and Src was then isolated by immunoprecipitation. Following 30 min of treatment with 30 ng of GST-SHP-1 (C453S) or SHP-1 fusion proteins, the labeled Src was purified and subjected to CNBr cleavage analysis as above. The data shown in each panel are representative results of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether SHP-1 also dephosphorylates Src phosphotyrosine residues labeled in vivo, additional CNBr cleavage studies were performed on SHP-1-treated Src immunoprecipitates derived from32P-biosynthetically labeled human platelets and Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig. 2 D, pretreatment of the in vivo labeled Src with catalytically inert SHP-1 (C453S) was again associated with the generation of the three phosphorylated CNBr cleavage fragments known to contain key residues for Src tyrosine phosphorylation. However, in contrast to the data obtained by analysis of in vitro labeled Src protein, SHP-1 treatment of thein vivo labeled Src immunoprecipitates was associated with a reduction in the phosphorylation of the 4.7-kDa CNBr-derived cleavage fragment, but had little effect on phosphorylation status of the 9.7-and 3.3-kDa fragments. As indicated by the phosphoamino acid analysis of these respective segments shown in Fig. 1 C, this difference in the susceptibility of in vivo versus in vitro 32P-labeled Src to SHP-1 catalytic activity cannot be ascribed to differences in the phospholabeling of serine/threonine residues and may therefore reflect in vivo labeling of additional tyrosine residues not efficiently phosphorylated underin vitro conditions. These residues might include, for example, tyrosines 329 and 343, which are also contained within the 3.3-kDa fragment and which are not susceptible to the action of SHP-1. While this latter issue requires further investigation, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that Src represents a substrate for SHP-1 and raises the possibility that SHP-1 mediates dephosphorylation of the COOH-terminal inhibitory phosphotyrosine site.In view of the data suggesting SHP-1 involvement in the dephosphorylation and potentially regulation of Src, the possibility that these two enzymes physically associate with one another in activated lymphocytes was next investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 A (upper panel), anti-Src immunoblotting analysis of SHP-1 immunoprecipitates prepared from interleukin-2-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, revealed an association of SHP-1 with Src in these cells, although comparison of the amount of Src present in total cell lysates versus the amount coprecipitated with SHP-1 suggests that the fraction of total cellular Src associated with SHP-1 is very low. SHP-1-Src association was also observed in reciprocal experiments involving anti-SHP-1 immunoblotting analysis of anti-Src immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A, lower panel) and in similar studies of Jurkat T lymphocytes and human platelets (data not shown), but was consistently not detected when cell lysates for these studies were prepared in buffer lacking orthovanadate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 3 A). Together these observations link the association of SHP-1 with Src to a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction and, as is consistent with previous data showing that thrombin stimulation induces both association and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet SHP-1 and Src (24Falet H. Ramos-Morales F. Bachelot C. Fischer S. Rendu F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggest that the interaction of these enzymes may be mediated through the binding of one or both of the SHP-1 SH2 domains with Src phosphotyrosine residues. To address this issue, GST fusion proteins carrying full-length SHP-1 and SHP-1 (C453S) or the tandem or single SHP-1 SH2 domains were evaluated for their capacities to interact with phosphorylated recombinant Src. The results of this in vitro analysis revealed specific binding of phosphorylated Src (Fig. 3 B), but not phosphorylated Fyn or Lck to the SHP-1 (C453S) fusion protein. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 C, Src was also precipitated by the fusion proteins containing both SH2 or the NH2-terminal SHP-1 SH2 domain, but not by the fusion protein containing only the COOH-terminal SHP-1 SH2 domain. Thus, as has also been described in relation to SHP-1 interactions with other putative substrates, such as the erythropoietin and c-Kit receptors (44Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 45Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that a single (in this instance, the NH2-terminal) SH2 domain mediates the binding of SHP-1 to phosphotyrosine(s) on Src. Conversely, GST fusion proteins containing the Src SH2 domain have been shown to precipitate phosphorylated SHP-1 from thrombin-activated platelets (24Falet H. Ramos-Morales F. Bachelot C. Fischer S. Rendu F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that SHP-1 association with Src involves multiple sites of interaction on these respective proteins. However, in view of our results indicating that GST-SHP-1 (C453S) fusion proteins also precipitate Src from peripheral blood lymphoblast lysates containing orthovanadate, but not from lysates lacking orthovanadate (data not shown) as well as data showing SHP-1 activity to be substantially increased by the binding of its NH2-terminal, but not COOH-terminal SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (46Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the interaction of the SHP-1 NH2-terminal SH2 domain with Src appears to represent a physiologically relevant molecular association, which may facilitate SHP-1 recruitment to and ultimately dephosphorylation of Src.Figure 3Src associates with and phosphorylates SHP-1. A, SHP-1-Src association in activated lymphocytes. Lysates were prepared from human proliferating lymphoblasts in the presence (+) or absence (−) of orthovanadate, the lysate proteins (1.5 mg) immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-1 or anti-Src antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated (Ip) and total cell lysate (Lys) proteins were then immunoblotted with anti-Src (upper panel) or anti-SHP-1 (lower panel) antibodies. Molecular mass standards are indicated on theright, and the positions of Src, SHP-1, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig(H)), are shown byarrows on the left. B, phosphorylated Src, but not Lck or Fyn, binds to SHP-1. GST fusion proteins containing the Cys-453 → Ser catalytically inert form of SHP-1 (GST-SHP-1 (C453S)) were used to precipitate in vitro 32P-labeled recombinant Src and purified Lck and Fyn proteins. Aliquots of the phosphorylated proteins (left laneof each panel) and the GST-SHP-1 (C453S)-bound proteins (right lane of each panel) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transfer to Immobilon-P, and autoradiography. Use of equivalent amounts of GST-SHP-1 (C453S) was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (data not shown). C, binding of phosphorylated Src to the SHP-1 SH2 domains. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins (1 μg) containing the SHP-1 NH2- and COOH-terminal (GST-SH2(N+C)) domains, only the NH2-terminal (GST-SH2(N)) or COOH-terminal (GST-SH2(C)) SH2 domains, the full-length wild-type SHP-1 (GST-SHP-1) or the catalytically inert SHP-1 (GST-SHP-1(C453S)) protein were used to precipitate in vitro 32P-labeled recombinant Src proteins (7 ng/lane) at 4 °C for 2 h; the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transfer to Immobilon-P, and autoradiography. The positions of Src and molecular mass standards are shown on the right.D, Src phosphorylates SHP-1 in vitro. Recombinant Src (10 ng) was incubated with 2 μg of enolase, 2 μg of GST-SHP-1 fusion protein, or 10 μg of GST protein alone in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the samples then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Arrows on theright indicate the positions of GST-SHP-1, enolase, and Src.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)While the analysis of SHP-1 effects on Src tyrosine phosphorylation identify Src as a potential substrate for this PTP, previous data showing that SHP-1 can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by v-Src (26Matozaki T. Uchida T. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the product of the transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus, suggest that SHP-1 may also represent a substrate of the cellular Src homologue. To address this possibility, the capacity of recombinant Src to phosphorylate GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins was investigated using anin vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3 D, the results of this analysis revealed the induction of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by Src, thereby identifying SHP-1 as a potential substrate for this kinase. SHP-1 has also been shown to be a substrate for Lck (47Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and ZAP-70 (48Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and the respective relevance of these PTKs to SHP-1 phosphorylation in vivo thus requires further analysis. However, in view of data showing SHP-1 activity to be enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation (49Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Horita K. Suzuki T. Fujioka Y. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12220-12228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the current data raise the possibility that a reciprocal functional relationship exists between SHP-1 and Src, the physical association of these proteins allowing each enzyme to activate the other in either a coordinate or sequential fashion. Along similar lines, binding of SHP-1 to another putative PTK substrate (ZAP-70) has been shown to induce changes in the catalytic activities of both enzymes, although in contrast to Src, ZAP-70 kinase activity appears to be diminished in conjunction with increases in SHP-1 phosphatase activity (48Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).In addition to SHP-1, a number of other PTPs, including most recently the structurally similar SHP-2 protein, have been shown to dephosphorylate Src in vitro at the COOH-terminal regulatory tyrosine (17Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 18den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1955-1962PubMed Google Scholar), but the extent to which these respective enzymes contribute to Src activation in vivo remains unclear. To specifically ascertain the biologic relevance of SHP-1 to the regulation of Src, activity of this PTK was next investigated in unstimulated thymocytes from motheaten (me) and viable motheaten (me v ) mice, animals that express negligible SHP-1 catalytic activity consequent to loss-of-function mutations in the SHP-1 gene (30Kozlowski M. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Pawson T. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As is consistent with previous data from our group (33Branch D.R. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3678-3685PubMed Google Scholar), the results of anti-Src immunoblotting analysis confirmed the presence of Src in thymocytes from both mutant and normal, congenic mice. However, while levels of Src protein appeared equivalent in the SHP-1-deficient and normal thymocytes, the in vitro kinase activity of Src as evaluated by autophosphorylation following immunoprecipitation was markedly lower in the meand me v cells compared with normal thymocytes (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, levels of Lck autophosphorylation and protein after immunoprecipitation were no different in the me and wild-type cells (Fig. 4 B). These findings are consistent with the in vitro data demonstrating the capacity of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate the Src COOH-terminal inhibitory tyrosine and, although the biologic functions of Src in thymocytes are currently unclear, these data strongly suggest a role for SHP-1 in the activation of Src in vivo. This contention is also supported by the finding that SHP-1 incubation with Src immunoprecipitates from me thymocytes substantially increased the extent of Src autophosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 4 C), a result that again links SHP-1 to not only the dephosphorylation, but also the activation of Src.Figure 4SHP-1 is a positive regulator of Src. A, Src kinase activity is reduced in motheaten thymocytes. Lysates were prepared from thymocytes obtained from motheaten (me/me), viable motheaten (me v /me v ), and congenic wild-type (+/+) mice and the lysate proteins (1.5 mg) immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody.

In the present study, we examined the signaling pathway underlying IGF-I-mediated neurite outgrowth. In SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, treatment with IGF-I induced concentration- and time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1 and 2. These effects of IGF-I were blocked by a neutralizing antibody against IGF-IR. Whereas IGF-IR phosphorylation was observed within 1 min, maximal phosphorylation of ERKs was not reached for 30 min. Both IGF-IR and ERK phosphorylation were maintained for at least 24 h. Also, the concentration dependence of IGF-I-stimulated IGF-IR and ERK tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled that of IGF-I-mediated neurite outgrowth. We further examined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in IGF-I-stimulated neuronal differentiation using the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059. Whereas PD98059 had no effect on IGF-IR phosphorylation, PD98059 reduced IGF-I-mediated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK phosphorylation of the substrate Elk-1. PD98059 also produced a parallel reduction of IGF-I-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Finally, consistent with its ability to block neuronal differentiation, PD98059 inhibited IGF-I-dependent changes of GAP-43 and c-myc gene expression.

IGFs are mitogens for many cell types playing key roles in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and tumor progression (1Humbel R.E. Eur. J.

In the nervous system, IGFs are important for embryonic and early postnatal growth and development (3Zackenfels K. Oppenheim R.W. Rohrer H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They can also act as differentiating agents promoting neurite outgrowth (4Recio-Pinto E. Rechler M.M. Ishii D.N. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synapse formation, and myelin synthesis (5Mozell R.L. McMorris F.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Most of the effects of IGF-I are mediated by binding to its specific receptor, the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). Like its ligand, IGF-IR is also closely related to the insulin receptor (IR) in structure and function (6Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S125-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Ligand binding by the IGF-IR and IR results in the tyrosine autophosphorylation of their β-subunits. The kinase activity intrinsic to β-subunits is essential for the biological actions of IGF-I and insulin, since cells expressing kinase deficient receptors fail to mediate the effects of these growth factors (7Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR or IR initiates a cascade of cellular signal transduction pathways. One key event is the binding of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 to phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor β-subunits. Receptor IRS-1 binding is required for insulin and IGF-I-mediated signal transduction (9White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent to binding by activated receptors, IRS-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and then acts as a docking protein for the downstream signal transduction components including phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the Grb2-SOS complex (6Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S125-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,9White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

GTP-bound (activated) p21 ras then associates with Raf kinase and contributes to its activation. Raf then activates MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein (ERK) kinase (MEK), which in turn activates MAP kinases by phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residues. After activation, ERKs have been shown to phosphorylate and thereby regulate many important proteins involved in diverse cellular activities (13Campbell J.S. Seger R. Graves J.D. Graves L.M. Jensen A.M. Krebs E.G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 131-159PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, ERK1 and -2 are the best studied members of the MAP kinase family (14Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E.

We have also found that the differentiation promoting activity of IGF-I in SH-SY5Y cells is linked to increased expression of growth cone-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and decreased expression of c-myc (24Sumantran V.N.

We found that IGF-I induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR, ERK2, and to a lesser extent ERK1. The tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins correlated with IGF-I-induced neurite outgrowth. This effect of IGF-I on ERK phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth was mediated by IGF-IR and blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. PD98059 also prevented IGF-I-induced changes in GAP-43 and c-myc gene expression. Together these results implicate the importance of the MAP kinase pathway in the regulation of transcriptional events leading to neuronal differentiation.DISCUSSIONOur laboratory is interested in how IGF-IR signal transduction regulates neuronal differentiation. Many reports suggest that the MAP kinases, ERK1 and -2, play an essential role in growth factor signaling leading to cellular differentiation (17Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Peraldi P.

However, the function of these proteins in neuronal differentiation and in the responses to IGF-IR activation have not been well characterized. In these studies we examined IGF-I activation of the ERKs in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We also employed the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to investigate the function of these proteins in IGF-I-stimulated neuronal differentiation.In initial experiments we found that IGF-I induced a rapid autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR that was maintained for up to 24 h. IGF-I also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Despite the fact that there is more ERK1 protein as revealed by anti-MAPK Western blotting, ERK2 is a far better substrate for IGF-I stimulation than ERK1. Even though phosphorylation of IGF-IR is very rapid, tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs is not apparent for 10 min. This long lag between receptor and ERK phosphorylation is unique in this cell compared with the effects of IGF-I in other cell types (38Lamphere L. Lienhard G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2196-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This pattern is not an intrinsic characteristic of the MAP kinase pathway in SH-SY5Y cells because both EGF and NGF can stimulate very rapid phosphorylation of ERKs (data not shown). Besides IGF-IR and ERKs, IGF-I also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with mobilities of approximately 200, 130, and 70 kDa. In the work by Leventhal et al. (23Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5214-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we proved that SH-SY5Y cells express both paxillin and focal adhesion kinase, and both proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated by IGF-I. Based on a previous study, it is likely that the 200-kDa protein is IRS-2, which SH-SY5Y cells express and use in the absence of IRS-1. 2B. Kim, unpublished observations.We believe that prolonged ERK activation is characteristic of growth factor-mediated differentation. In the current study, IGF-I-mediated ERK activation was maintained for extended periods of time,i.e. up to 24 h. This time course paralleled IGF-I-mediated neurite outgrowth and supports previous reports from us (24Sumantran V.N. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and others (19Lavenius E. Parrow V. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Recio-Pinto E. Ishii D.N. Brain Res. 1984; 302: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 39Påhlman S. Meyerson G. Lindgren E. Schalling M. Johansson I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9994-9998Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that IGF-I promotes neuronal differentiation. In PC12 cells, NGF-induced differentiation is also associated with prolonged activation of ERK, whereas EGF induces transient activation (32Qui M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Prolonged ERK activation is accompanied by translocation of ERK into the nucleus (17Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.-L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where it can regulate gene expression of proteins important in differentiation. Collectively, these data suggest that sustained ERK activation may be instrumental in growth factor-mediated differentiation.Inhibition of ERK tyrosine phosphorylation by α-IR3 indicates that IGF-I acted through IGF-IR and not by binding to IGF-binding proteins. Kato et al. (7Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported IGF-I mimetic effects of α-IR3 for cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. In our laboratory, however, we have consistently found an inhibitory effect of α-IR3 on the various effects of IGF-I (22Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Sumantran V.N. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the previous report showing the IGF-I mimetic effect of α-IR3, IGF-IR-overexpressing fibroblasts were used as an experimental model. Therefore we suspect that the IGF-I mimetic effect of α-IR3 is a feature of receptor overexpression. Alternatively this may be due to differences in the cell types used (fibroblast versus neuroblastoma cells).The tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK correlated well with neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. The role of the MAP kinase pathway in SH-SY5Y cell differentiation was confirmed by the use of an inhibitor of MEK, PD98059. This compound selectively inhibits the activity of MEK and subsequent activation of ERKs (33Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 37Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). We found that PD98059 effectively blocks IGF-I-induced activation of ERK without affecting the phosphorylation of IGF-IR. Inhibition of ERK paralleled the reduction in IGF-I-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting a critical role of ERK in the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. Our results are similar to those of Pang et al. (37Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) who showed that PD98059 blocked NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. In both our work and that of Pang et al. (37Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), PD98059 treatment did not completely inhibit growth factor-mediated differentiation, suggesting that other signaling cascades may also be operative. In sharp contrast, Coolican et al. (40Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) recently reported that PD98059 greatly enhanced IGF-I-induced differentiation of L6A1 myoblasts. Therefore, it is possible that the requirement of MAP kinase activation for cellular differentiation is a neuron-specific feature.Our results suggest that ERKs can regulate neuronal differentiation by modulating gene expression. IGF-I enhanced GAP-43 expression and depressed c-myc expression. In each instance, PD98059 blocked the effect of IGF-I. Recent evidence indicates that in PC12 cells the MAP kinases translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus after differentiation signals such as NGF or overexpression of the EGF receptor (17Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.-L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H.

J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). These results suggest a direct role of MAP kinases in the regulation of gene expression inside the nucleus. Consistent with our study, several previous reports have shown that ERKs can regulate transcription and translation of Myc (43Oliver B.L. Sha'afi R.I. Hajjra J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oliveret al. (43Oliver B.L. Sha'afi R.I. Hajjra J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggested that MAP kinase can increase the synthesis of c-Myc as well as the message level of c-myc. Furthermore, Chuang and Ng (45Chuang C.F. Ng S.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported that ERK2 but not ERK1 activated Myc. The preferential tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 over ERK1 in SH-SY5Y cells is in agreement with their results. Thus, it is likely that, in SH-SY5Y cells, ERK2 plays a key role in IGF-I regulation of c-myc and GAP-43 gene expression. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed changes in gene expression are merely temporally associated with SH-SY5Y differentiation and not directly regulated by ERK activation.In summary, we show that IGF-I induces a time- and a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of IGF-IR and ERK2 in SH-SY5Y cells. The phosphorylation of these proteins parallels IGF-I-induced neurite outgrowth and changes in c-myc and GAP-43 gene expression. Moreover, inhibition of ERK activation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocks these effects of IGF-I. Collectively, these results indicate that IGF-IR-mediated activation of MAP kinases is essential for IGF-I-induced neuronal differentiation.

IGFs are mitogens for many cell types playing key roles in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and tumor progression (1Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 2Jones J. Clemmons D. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nervous system, IGFs are important for embryonic and early postnatal growth and development (3Zackenfels K. Oppenheim R.W. Rohrer H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They can also act as differentiating agents promoting neurite outgrowth (4Recio-Pinto E. Rechler M.M. Ishii D.N. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synapse formation, and myelin synthesis (5Mozell R.L. McMorris F.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Most of the effects of IGF-I are mediated by binding to its specific receptor, the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). Like its ligand, IGF-IR is also closely related to the insulin receptor (IR) in structure and function (6Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S125-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ligand binding by the IGF-IR and IR results in the tyrosine autophosphorylation of their β-subunits. The kinase activity intrinsic to β-subunits is essential for the biological actions of IGF-I and insulin, since cells expressing kinase deficient receptors fail to mediate the effects of these growth factors (7Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR or IR initiates a cascade of cellular signal transduction pathways. One key event is the binding of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 to phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor β-subunits. Receptor IRS-1 binding is required for insulin and IGF-I-mediated signal transduction (9White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent to binding by activated receptors, IRS-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and then acts as a docking protein for the downstream signal transduction components including phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the Grb2-SOS complex (6Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S125-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,9White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade is one of the major signaling pathways by which cells transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses (reviewed in Refs. 10Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Trends Biochem.

GTP-bound (activated) p21 ras then associates with Raf kinase and contributes to its activation. Raf then activates MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein (ERK) kinase (MEK), which in turn activates MAP kinases by phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residues.

In PC12 cells, NGF-induced differentiation is also associated with prolonged activation of ERK, whereas EGF induces transient activation (32Qui M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Prolonged ERK activation is accompanied by translocation of ERK into the nucleus (17Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where it can regulate gene expression of proteins important in differentiation. Collectively, these data suggest that sustained ERK activation may be instrumental in growth factor-mediated differentiation.Inhibition of ERK tyrosine phosphorylation by α-IR3 indicates that IGF-I acted through IGF-IR and not by binding to IGF-binding proteins. Kato et al. (7Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported IGF-I mimetic effects of α-IR3 for cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. In our laboratory, however, we have consistently found an inhibitory effect of α-IR3 on the various effects of IGF-I (22Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Sumantran V.N. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the previous report showing the IGF-I mimetic effect of α-IR3, IGF-IR-overexpressing fibroblasts were used as an experimental model. Therefore we suspect that the IGF-I mimetic effect of α-IR3 is a feature of receptor overexpression. Alternatively this may be due to differences in the cell types used (fibroblast versus neuroblastoma cells).The tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK correlated well with neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. The role of the MAP kinase pathway in SH-SY5Y cell differentiation was confirmed by the use of an inhibitor of MEK, PD98059. This compound selectively inhibits the activity of MEK and subsequent activation of ERKs (33Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 37Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). We found that PD98059 effectively blocks IGF-I-induced activation of ERK without affecting the phosphorylation of IGF-IR. Inhibition of ERK paralleled the reduction in IGF-I-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting a critical role of ERK in the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. Our results are similar to those of Pang et al. (37Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) who showed that PD98059 blocked NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. In both our work and that of Pang et al. (37Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), PD98059 treatment did not completely inhibit growth factor-mediated differentiation, suggesting that other signaling cascades may also be operative. In sharp contrast, Coolican et al. (40Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) recently reported that PD98059 greatly enhanced IGF-I-induced differentiation of L6A1 myoblasts. Therefore, it is possible that the requirement of MAP kinase activation for cellular differentiation is a neuron-specific feature.Our results suggest that ERKs can regulate neuronal differentiation by modulating gene expression. IGF-I enhanced GAP-43 expression and depressed c-myc expression. In each instance, PD98059 blocked the effect of IGF-I. Recent evidence indicates that in PC12 cells the MAP kinases translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus after differentiation signals such as NGF or overexpression of the EGF receptor (17Nguyen T.T.

J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). These results suggest a direct role of MAP kinases in the regulation of gene expression inside the nucleus. Consistent with our study, several previous reports have shown that ERKs can regulate transcription and translation of Myc (43Oliver B.L. Sha'afi R.I. Hajjra J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 210: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggested that MAP kinase can increase the synthesis of c-Myc as well as the message level of c-myc. Furthermore, Chuang and Ng (45Chuang C.F. Ng S.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported that ERK2 but not ERK1 activated Myc. The preferential tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 over ERK1 in SH-SY5Y cells is in agreement with their results. Thus, it is likely that, in SH-SY5Y cells, ERK2 plays a key role in IGF-I regulation of c-myc and GAP-43 gene expression. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed changes in gene expression are merely temporally associated with SH-SY5Y differentiation and not directly regulated by ERK activation.In summary, we show that IGF-I induces a time- and a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of IGF-IR and ERK2 in SH-SY5Y cells. The phosphorylation of these proteins parallels IGF-I-induced neurite outgrowth and changes in c-myc and GAP-43 gene expression. Moreover, inhibition of ERK activation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocks these effects of IGF-I. Collectively, these results indicate that IGF-IR-mediated activation of MAP kinases is essential for IGF-I-induced neuronal differentiation. Our laboratory is interested in how IGF-IR signal transduction regulates neuronal differentiation. Many reports suggest that the MAP kinases, ERK1 and -2, play an essential role in growth factor signaling leading to cellular differentiation (17Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.-L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). However, the function of these proteins in neuronal differentiation and in the responses to IGF-IR activation have not been well characterized. In these studies we examined IGF-I activation of the ERKs in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We also employed the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to investigate the function of these proteins in IGF-I-stimulated neuronal differentiation. In initial experiments we found that IGF-I induced a rapid autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR that was maintained for up to 24 h. IGF-I also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Despite the fact that there is more ERK1 protein as revealed by anti-MAPK Western blotting, ERK2 is a far better substrate for IGF-I stimulation than ERK1. Even though phosphorylation of IGF-IR is very rapid, tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs is not apparent for 10 min. This long lag between receptor and ERK phosphorylation is unique in this cell compared with the effects of IGF-I in other cell types (38Lamphere L. Lienhard G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2196-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This pattern is not an intrinsic characteristic of the MAP kinase pathway in SH-SY5Y cells because both EGF and NGF can stimulate very rapid phosphorylation of ERKs (data not shown). Besides IGF-IR and ERKs, IGF-I also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with mobilities of approximately 200, 130, and 70 kDa. In the work by Leventhal et al. (23Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5214-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we proved that SH-SY5Y cells express both paxillin and focal adhesion kinase, and both proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated by IGF-I. Based on a previous study, it is likely that the 200-kDa protein is IRS-2, which SH-SY5Y cells express and use in the absence of IRS-1. 2B. Kim, unpublished observations. We believe that prolonged ERK activation is characteristic of growth factor-mediated differentation. In the current study, IGF-I-mediated ERK activation was maintained for extended periods of time,i.e. up to 24 h. This time course paralleled IGF-I-mediated neurite outgrowth and supports previous reports from us (24Sumantran V.N. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and others (19Lavenius E. Parrow V. Nånberg E. Påhlman S.

Previously, we described transgenic mice with α-myosin heavy chain-directed expression of a constitutively active mutant α1B-AR that had a phenotype of myocardial hypertrophy (Milano, C. A., Dolber, P. C., Rockman, H. A., Bond, R. A., Venable M. E., Allen, L. F., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 10109–10113). In animals with >40-fold WT α1-AR overexpression, basal myocardial diacylglycerol content was significantly increased, indicating enhanced α1-adrenergic signaling and phospholipase C activity. In contrast to the mice overexpressing constitutively active mutant α1B-ARs, the hearts of these mice did not develop cardiac hypertrophy despite an 8-fold increase in ventricular mRNA for atrial natriuretic factor. In vivo physiology was studied in anesthetized intact animals and showed left ventricular contractility in response to the β-agonist isoproterenol to be significantly depressed in animals overexpressing WT α1B-ARs. Membranes purified from the hearts of WT α1BAR-overexpressing mice demonstrated significantly attenuated adenylyl cyclase activity basally and after stimulation with isoproterenol, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Interestingly, thesein vitro changes in signaling were reversed after treating the mice with pertussis toxin, suggesting that the extraordinarily high levels of WT α1B-ARs can lead to coupling to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Another potential contributor to the observed decreased myocardial signaling and function could be enhanced β-AR desensitization as β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1) activity was found to be significantly elevated (>3-fold) in myocardial extracts isolated from WT α1B-AR-overexpressing mice. This type of altered signal transduction may become critical in disease conditions such as heart failure where βARK1 levels are elevated and β-ARs are down-regulated, leading to a higher percentage of cardiac α1-ARs. Thus, these mice serve as a unique experimental model to study the in vivo interactions between α- and β-ARs in the heart. Transgenic mice were generated with cardiac-specific overexpression of the wild-type (WT) α1B-adrenergic receptor (AR) using the murine α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter. Previously, we described transgenic mice with α-myosin heavy chain-directed expression of a constitutively active mutant α1B-AR that had a phenotype of myocardial hypertrophy (Milano, C.

Agents that stimulate α1-ARs, leading to the activation of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gq, have been shown to induce nuclear transcription factors such as c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun and to mediate morphological changes including increases in myocyte size and volume (1Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Signaling through the α1-AR/Gq pathway leads to the activation of the effector enzyme phospholipase C and protein kinase C, both of which may act as biochemical initiators of myocardial hypertrophy (2Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Gq-mediated hypertrophy, recent studies have implicated a p21ras(Ras)-dependent hypertrophic pathway initiated by α1-AR activation (3LaMorte V.J. Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other in vitroα1-AR/Gq-mediated signaling events reported to exist in myocytes include positive inotropy and chronotropy and induction of the egr-1 gene (4Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to coupling to Gq, α1-ARs have also been reported to activate pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive G proteins, leading, in myocytes, to negative chronotropy, positive inotropy, Na+-K+-ATPase activation, and modulation of intracellular calcium transients and cell shortening (5Steinberg S.F. Drugge E.D. Bilezikian J.P. Robinson R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In contrast to these studies, very few reports have investigatedin vivo cardiac α1-AR signaling particularly with respect to physiological sequelae and the potential in vivo significance of dual G protein coupling. α1A- and α1B-ARs have been shown to exist in neonatal myocytes (6Knowlton K.U. Michel M.C. Itani M. Shubeita H.E. Ishihara K. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15374-15380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in adult human myocardium, the α1A-AR appears to predominate (7Weinberg D.H. Trivedi P. Tan C.P. Mitra S. Perkins-Barrow A. Borkowski D. Strader C.D. Bayne M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both the α1A and α1B subtypes have been implicated in myocyte growth and hypertrophy (6Knowlton K.U. Michel M.C. Itani M. Shubeita H.E. Ishihara K. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15374-15380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible functional role of α1-ARs is as a source of inotropic reserve in pathophysiological conditions where the β-AR system is down-regulated and uncoupled (8Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1993; 60: 405-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, an interrelationship may exist in the heart between α1- and β-ARs. Previous work from our laboratory revealed that cardiac-specific expression of a constitutively active mutant (CAM) of the α1B-AR in transgenic mice leads to myocardial hypertrophy, demonstrating that cardiac α1-adrenergic signaling in vivo can trigger responses similar to myocytes in culture (9Milano C.A.

We have previously observed for the WT β2-AR that when overexpression of these WT receptors reaches extraordinarily high levels, agonist-independent signaling can occur due to a small percentage of spontaneously activated receptors that is significant at high levels of receptor density (10Milano C.A.

Both α1- and β-AR signal transduction was assessed, including measurements of myocardial diacylglycerol (DAG) content, ventricular atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNA levels, adenylyl cyclase activity, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) activity. In addition, the presence of myocardial hypertrophy was assessed. Finally, in vivo basal and β-AR-mediated cardiac function was assessed by catheterization of anesthetized mice. The results from these studies reveal findings that point to potentially important interactions between α- and β-adrenergic signaling in the heart.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTwo transgenic lines were established expressing the WT α1B-AR and were named TG α43 and TG α47. Cardiac-specific transgene expression was documented by Northern analysis of RNAs from different tissues, including heart, lung, diaphragm, quadriceps muscle, kidney, and liver (data not shown). This cardiac-specific expression is consistent with the previously documented pattern of transgene expression achieved with the murine α-MyHC promoter (9Milano C.A. Dolber P.C. Rockman H.A. Bond R.A.

At 10 weeks of age, transgene expression was quantitated by radioligand binding assays performed on purified myocardial membranes using 125I-HEAT, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. Total cardiac α1-AR density in TG α43 animals was 43-fold greater than in nontransgenic littermate controls (NLC) and 26-fold greater in the TG α47 line compared with NLC. Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent studies were performed on TG α43 animals.Classical α1-AR/Gq coupling leads to stimulation of phospholipase C, generating the second messengers inositol trisphosphate and DAG, which subsequently leads to the activation of protein kinase C (18Wu D.

Commun. 1991; 174: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To assess the functional coupling of overexpressed WT α1B-ARs, myocardial DAG content was quantitated, and as shown in Fig. 2, base-line DAG content in TG α43 hearts was significantly higher than in control hearts. This indicates that α1B-AR/Gq signaling is enhanced under basal conditions.Figure 2Basal myocardial diacylglycerol content.Lipid extraction was performed from NLC (n = 5) and TG α43 (n = 5) hearts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Diacylglycerol content was quantified using 50 nmol of lipid phosphate as described.

Glembotski C.C. Chien K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the levels of ANF mRNA present in the ventricles of these transgenic mice. ANF is a gene normally inactive in the ventricles after maturation and has been shown to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy (21Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). To examine ANF gene activation present in TG α43 mice, Northern blots of ventricular RNA were generated and probed with a mouse ANF cDNA (Fig. 3 A). Control ventricles showed minimal or undetectable ANF signals, which is consistent with the inactivation of this gene in normal adult ventricular myocytes (21Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was a strong ANF signal in RNA isolated from TG α43 ventricles, which, when normalized to the control GAPDH mRNA, was ∼9-fold higher compared with controls (Fig. 3 B). The increase in ventricular ANF mRNA in TG α43 mice was twice that seen in our previously described CAM α1B-AR-overexpressing mice (9Milano C.A. Dolber P.C. Rockman H.A. Bond R.A. Venable M.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite the extraordinarily high ANF mRNA levels, TG α43 animals did not have significantly different LV/body weight ratios or increased LV myocyte cross-sectional areas compared with controls (data not shown). Nonsignificant changes in heart mass were also found in TG α47 animals (data not shown). This is unlike the phenotype in the CAM α1B-AR transgenic animals, which had increased heart mass and increased cross-sectional areas of ventricular myocytes that accompanied the increased ANF signal (9Milano C.A. Dolber P.C. Rockman H.A. Bond R.A. Venable M.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The lack of a hypertrophic phenotype in these animals is not clearly understood since signaling through α1-ARs is clearly elevated, and ventricular ANF expression is high (Figs. 2 and 3). This suggests that signaling through CAM α1-ARs is somehow different from that through WT receptors.Figure 3Ventricular ANF mRNA Levels.

In vivo measurements of α1-AR-mediated cardiac hemodynamics using a pharmacological approach is difficult since α-agonists are potent vasoconstrictors that can change the loading conditions and secondarily affect cardiac function. In TG α43 mice, we chose to initially study basal cardiac physiological parameters to determine whether the enhanced α1-AR/Gq signaling indicated by increased DAG content can affect basal function. In addition, we examined cardiac responses to the β-agonist isoproterenol to determine if enhanced α1-AR signaling affects this response, which is the primary mechanism for increasing performance of normal hearts. Following catheterization of anesthetized mice (10Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1997; 94: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we measured several hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate and LVdP/dtmax and LV dP/dtmin, measures of cardiac contractility and relaxation, respectively. The results found in TG α43 animals and NLC mice under basal conditions and in response to isoproterenol are shown in Fig. 4. There was no difference in LV systolic pressure between the two groups (Fig. 4 A). Base-line and β-agonist-stimulated heart rates were significantly depressed in TG α43 mice compared with NLC mice (Fig. 4 B). There was no statistically significant difference in basaldP/dtmax or dP/dtmin in TG α43 mice versus NLC mice (Fig. 4, C andD), although the trend was for lower values in TG α43 animals. There was, however, a significant decrease in these parameters in TG α43 animals compared with NLC mice in response to progressive isoproterenol infusion. Thus, β-AR-mediated LV function is depressed in these animals, suggesting that there is significant cross-talk between the signaling of α1-ARs and β-ARs in the hearts of these transgenic animals. The increased constitutive α1-AR signaling present in TG α43 mice has a significant effect on cardiac physiological responses elicited by β-AR stimulation. Although previous studies have demonstrated that α1-AR stimulation can lead to negative chronotropy (5Steinberg S.F. Drugge E.D. Bilezikian J.P. Robinson R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), α1-AR-mediated negative inotropy is a novel finding. To further study α1-AR-mediated effects on cardiac contractility, it would be relevant to study these in vivoparameters in the presence of an α-agonist such as phenylephrine. However, the use of phenylephrine presents major fundamental problems due to its predominant peripheral effects on systolic pressure, which would influence myocardial function independent of any myocardial α1-AR signaling. The data presented above could have important clinical significance since, in pathophysiological conditions such as heart failure, there is significant loss of both β-AR density and functional coupling, which could potentially increase the role of α1-AR signaling in response to endogenous catecholamines.Figure 4In vivo assessment of cardiac function of TG α43 (n = 19) (•) and NLC (n= 12) (○) mice.

Signaling through β-ARs involves the activation of the G protein Gs, which activates adenylyl cyclase, leading to increases in intracellular cAMP and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (22Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Activated protein kinase A phosphorylates several myocardial proteins, leading to positive inotropy as well as chronotropy. The β-AR system as well as several other G protein-coupled receptors undergo rapid desensitization, which is the loss of response in the continued presence of agonist. This is initiated by targeted receptor phosphorylation via a family of serine/threonine kinases known as the GRKs, of which the β-AR kinase (βARK1) is a prototypic member (23Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined β-AR density in myocardial membranes purified from TG α43 hearts and control nontransgenic myocardial membranes using125I-CYP and found no significant difference in total β-AR density (46.5 ± 0.8 fmol/mg of membrane protein in TG α43 mice versus 44.3 ± 1.6 in controls). Therefore, changes in myocardial β-AR density cannot account for the differences in cardiac contractility seen in TG α43 mice.We then studied myocardial membrane adenylyl cyclase activity. There was significantly lower basal adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes purified from TG α43 hearts compared with nontransgenic myocardial membranes (Table I). This could account for the decreased basal heart rate seen in these animals. As shown in Table I, agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in TG α43 membranes compared with control membranes was also significantly depressed following addition of isoproterenol or norepinephrine. Interestingly, the depressed response to norepinephrine, a mixed α/β-agonist, was greater than with the strict β-agonist isoproterenol. These results indicate that the depressed in vivo cardiac function shown above (Fig. 4) is likely due, at least in part, to the lower adenylyl cyclase activity and an attenuated β-AR-mediated cAMP response. To examine whether decreased adenylyl cyclase activity in TG α43 membranes was secondary to enhanced α1-AR signaling, we studied adenylyl cyclase activity following addition of an α-agonist. Surprisingly, the addition of 100 μm phenylephrine resulted in significant lowering of basal activity in TG α43 membranes, whereas control membranes had no α1AR-mediated cAMP response (Table I). This strongly suggests that further α1-AR stimulation leads to inhibition of membrane adenylyl cyclase activity. This also suggests that the significant decrease in basal adenylyl cyclase activity is due to enhanced basal α1-AR signaling present in TG α43 hearts. Strengthening these conclusions of a receptor-mediated phenomenon, NaF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were similar in membranes from TG α43 animals and nontransgenic controls (Table I).Table IAdenylyl cyclase activity in control and TG α43 myocardial membranesHeartsBasalISO1-aISO, isoproterenol; NE, norepinephrine; PE, phenylephrine.NEPENaF10 −4 m10 −4 m10 −4 m10 −2 mControl38.53 ± 2.9668.25 ± 6.5578.60 ± 4.3634.70 ± 4.90269.60 ± 12.78TG α4316.87 ± 2.131-bp < 0.05 compared with control activity.24.55 ± 4.471-bp < 0.05 compared with control activity.20.02 ± 5.571-bp < 0.05 compared with control activity.10.21 ± 1.801-bp < 0.05 compared with control activity.,1-cp < 0.05 compared with TG α43 basal activity (Student's t test).245.65 ± 11.83Activity is presented as pmol of cAMP/min/mg of protein.

Open table in a new tab One hypothesis for the decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity in TG α43 myocardial membranes is coupling of WT α1B-ARs to the adenylyl cyclase inhibitory G protein, Gi. As mentioned above, dual coupling of α1-ARs to Gq and Gi has been demonstrated in vitro, but not yet investigated in vivo. To examine the potential involvement of Gi in the α1-AR-mediated cyclase responses, we intraperitoneally injected TG α43 and NLC mice with either 100 μg/kg PTx or 150 μl of saline and sacrificed the animals 24 h later. Myocardial membranes were purified from these animals, and adenylyl cyclase activities were measured. As shown in Table II, PTx treatment reversed the depressed basal cyclase activity in TG α43 membranes, and in fact, the percent increase in TG α43 basal activity was significantly higher compared with PTx-treated controls (Table II), indicating the enhanced Gi coupling of overexpressed WT α1B-ARs. Isoproterenol- and norepinephrine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were also significantly increased in TG α43 membranes following PTx treatment. Additionally and in contrast to findings in saline-treated transgenic animals, phenylephrine did not decrease membrane adenylyl cyclase activity (Table II). PTx treatment also enhanced NaF-stimulated activities compared with saline treatment, as expected, but TG α43 membranes did not differ from controls, indicating that there is no change in the levels or function of myocardial G proteins. To confirm this, we carried out protein immunoblotting of membranes for Gαs and Gαiand found no difference in protein levels in TG α43 versuscontrol hearts (data not shown). Overall, PTx treatment converted TG α43 membranes to having the biochemical characteristics of control membranes. Thus, these results indicate that the involvement of PTx-sensitive G proteins is significantly higher in hearts overexpressing the WT α1B-AR, which could lead t"

In a mannitol medium containing 10 mm Pi and ethanol (oxidizable substrate), yeast mitochondria accumulate large amounts of Ca2+ (>400 nmol/mg of protein) upon the addition of an electrophoretic Ca2+ ionophore (ETH129). Pore opening does not occur following Ca2+ uptake, even though ruthenium red-inhibited rat liver mitochondria undergo rapid pore opening under analogous conditions. However, a pore does arise in yeast mitochondria when Ca2+ and Pi are not present, as monitored by swelling, ultrastructure, and matrix solute release. Pore opening is slow unless a respiratory substrate is provided (ethanol or NADH) but also occurs rapidly in response to ATP (2 mm) when oligomycin is present. Pi and ADP inhibit pore opening (EC50 ∼1 and 4 mm, respectively), however, cyclosporin A (7 μg/ml), oligomycin (20 μg/ml), or carboxyatractyloside (25 μm) have no effect. The pore arising during respiration is also inhibited by nigericin or uncoupler, indicating that an acidic matrix pH antagonizes the process. Pi also inhibits pore opening by lowering the matrix pH (Pi/OH− antiport). However, inhibition of the ATP-induced pore by Pi is seen in the presence of mersalyl, suggesting a second mechanism of action. Since pore induction by ATP is not sensitive to carboxyatractyloside, ATP appears to act at an external site and Pi may antagonize the interaction. Isoosmotic polyethylene glycol-induced contraction of yeast mitochondria swollen during respiration, or in the presence of ATP, is 50% effective at a solute size of 1.0–1.1 kDa.

Thus, the function of the mPTP is also not known although it has been postulated to have a role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, mMt protein import, thermal regulation, and apoptosis, to name some of the possibilities.

Manon and Guerin (20Manon S. Guérin M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar), investigating electrophoretic pathways of ion transport, reported that Ca2+ is without an effect on the coupling state or swelling and concluded that the existence of a PTP in yMt (yPTP) is uncertain. Szabo et al. (21Szabó I. Báthori G. Wolff D. Starc T. Cola C. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) applied the patch-clamp technique to isolated yMt and observed a channel with multiple conductance levels (100–600 pS) that is not inhibited by CsA, ADP, or H+. These authors also did not observe Ca2+ related swelling of yMt and were inconclusive regarding the existence of a PTP (21Szabó I. Báthori G. Wolff D. Starc T. Cola C. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, Lohret and Kinnally (15Lohret T.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15950-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Lohret T.A. Kinnally K.W. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2299-2309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) described a channel with multiple conductance levels, having a peak conductance of 1–1.5 nS, in patch-clamped yeast mitoplasts. They concluded that this channel represents the yPTP, or the megachannel to use their nomenclature. In addition, Ballarin and Sorgato (23Ballarin C. Sorgato M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19262-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), also using the patch clamp technique on yeast mitoplasts, described a channel of lower conductance (400–800 pS), which remains open in the presence of ATP. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether or not a PTP is present in yMt, and subsequently to investigate its regulation. The results show that a PTP is induced in the isolated organelle by respiration or the presence of external ATP. It is inhibited by ADP, is comparable in size to the homologous structure in mMt, but is Ca2+ independent and not subject to inhibition by CsA. Pi, which promotes opening of the mPTP, is an inhibitor of the yPTP through an action exerted via the matrix pH, and through a second action exerted at a site that is probably accessible from the extramitochondrial volume. Possible functions of the yPTP and other implications of these findings are considered. The yeast strain YPH250 (MATa, ura3–52,lys2-801, ade2–101, trp1-Δ1,his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1) (ATCC 96519) or W303–1A (MATa, ade2–1, his3–11 & 3–15,trp1–1, leu2–3 & 2–112, ura3–1,can1–100) were grown at pH 5 in 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 0.05% dextrose, 0.01% adenine, and either 3% glycerol or 2% lactate. One 4-liter or two 2-liter baffled flasks were employed per liter of culture medium. The culture was inoculated with 50 ml of a preculture (36–48 h, A600 = 1.5–2) and incubated in an orbital shaker (180 rpm, 30 °C). The cells (15–30 g) were harvested after 24 h. yMt were isolated essentially as described by Daum et al. (24Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 2 mg of Zymolyase 20T (ICN) per g of cells to form spheroplasts. The isolated yMt (typically 50 mg of protein) were suspended in 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm HEPES (K+), pH 6.8, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm EGTA (K+), and stored on ice. Rat liver mMt were prepared as described previously (25Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in 0.23 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, and 3 mm HEPES (Na+), pH 7.4. Media composition and the additions made are described in the figure legends. Incubations were performed at 25 °C in a 3-ml cuvette. In most cases, the permeability transition was monitored by swelling (ΔA540), using an SLM Aminco DW-2C spectrophotometer operated in the split beam mode (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Some variability in this parameter was encountered between different yMt preparations and the two yeast strains that were used, similar to the differences that are seen when separate preparations of mMt are compared. The data shown are typical experiments. The uptake and release of Ca2+ by mitochondria were followed using antipyrylazo III as an indicator of the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration (27Scarpa A. Brinley Jr., F.J. Dubyak G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Changes in ΔA720–790 were recorded in the DW-2C operated in the dual wavelength mode and converted to Ca2+concentration values using a calibration curve that was generated with a standard solution of Ca2+. Estimates of membrane potential (Δ Ψ) were made using safranine (18 μm) as an indicator. Safranine accumulation was also followed spectrophotometrically, as a change in ΔA511–533 (28Åkerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The solute exclusion method (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7422-7428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to estimate the size of the yPTP. After the swelling which follows opening was complete, polyethylene glycol (PEG) of varying molecular weight was added and shrinkage was observed. Shrinkage, under these conditions, indicates that the yPTP remains open with respect to mannitol permeation while the added PEG is excluded. Varying the molecular weight of PEG reveals a size exclusion property since no shrinkage is seen when the PEG can also penetrate (29Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). PEGs were added from stock solutions that were 300 mosM with respect to the osmotic pressure arising from PEG and that were buffered with 10 mm HEPES (Na+), pH 7.35. These solutions were isoosmotic with respect to the incubation medium and were added to 10% of the final volume. Approximately 30 mosM of the total osmotic pressure was then derived from PEG during shrinkage (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Since PEGs are highly non-ideal solutes with respect to their osmotic characteristics, the concentration required to produce a particular osmotic pressure is a function of the PEG molecular weight (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For the 300 mosM stock solutions, the following values were used, in units of mm; 199 (0.4 kDa), 172 (0.6 kDa), 136 (1.0 kDa), 111 (1.5 kDa), 93 (2.0 kDa), 58 (3.4 kDa), and 50 (4.0 kDa). The osmotic pressure of these solutions was confirmed using a vapor pressure osmometer. PEGs were obtained from Aldrich or Sigma. Oligomycin, CsA, FCCP, antimycin A, and alamethicin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, rather than ethanol, since the latter solvent is a respiratory substrate for yMt. The procedures employed for electron microscopy were as described previously (32Igbavboa U. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1405-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the yMt were sedimented prior to fixation. The nucleotide profile of yMt was obtained by HPLC (8Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Brierley G.P. Pfeiffer D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) of alkaline extracts. Intramitochondrial Ca2+ has a central role in regulating the mPTP (1Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zoratti M. Szabó I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar); however, yMt lack a high activity Ca2+ uniporter (20Manon S. Guérin M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar, 33Carafoli E. Balcavage W.X. Lehninger A.L. Mattoon J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 205: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These circumstances complicate the interpretation of earlier studies that reported the absence of an obvious permeability transition in yMt exposed to Ca2+ (20Manon S. Guérin M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar, 21Szabó I. Báthori G. Wolff D. Starc T. Cola C. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We used the electrophoretic Ca2+ ionophore ETH129 (34Caroni P. Gazzotti P. Vuilleumier P. Simon W. Carafoli E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Prestipino G. Falugi C. Falchetto R. Gazzotti P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to determine if high internal Ca2+ loads trigger a permeability transition in yMt. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 1 A. When oxidizing ethanol in a medium containing 10 mm Pi, yMt fail to accumulate significant Ca2+ when 160 nmol/mg of protein is added externally (Fig. 1 A, trace a). However, a rapid accumulation occurs upon the addition of ETH129, which continues until a steady state is reached at approximately 10 μmexternal Ca2+ (trace b). Significant swelling does not occur under these conditions, indicating that the inner membrane remains impermeant to low molecular weight solutes (data not shown, and see Fig. 2). Indeed, Ca2+ is retained for extensive periods (Fig. 1 A,trace b) and is released only upon uncoupling (trace c) or when oxygen or the oxidizable substrate is depleted. Similar data are obtained at Ca2+ loads of 400 nmol/mg of protein or higher (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of Pi concentration on yMt Ca2+ uptake (panel A) and swelling (panel B). Conditions were the same as described for Fig. 1,panel A, except that ethanol was omitted initially, the EGTA concentration was 25 μm, the protein concentration was 0.35 mg/ml, and the KH2PO4 concentration was either 1 or 10 mm as indicated. Additions where indicated were as follows; a, CaCl2 (285 nmol/mg protein);b, ETH129 (2.4 μm); and c, ethanol (0.5 mm). For panel B, in addition to the components described above, the medium contained CsA (1.67 μm) for one of the two experiments conducted at 1 mm Pi. For the experiment conducted at 10 mm Pi, alamethicin was added where indicated at 2.6 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under comparable conditions, rat liver mMt, oxidizing succinate instead of ethanol (Fig. 1 B), do not retain Ca2+regardless of whether initial uptake occurs via the endogenous uniporter (trace a, ruthenium red absent (−RRed)), or via ETH129 (trace b, ruthenium red present (+RRed)). The release of Ca2+ from rat liver mMt under either condition is accompanied by swelling and is inhibited by CsA (data not shown), indicating that the mPTP is responsible. These contrasts indicate that yMt do not contain a PTP that is induced by Ca2+ plus Pi, unlike mMt. However, the capacity of yMt to carry out ETH129 mediated Ca2+ accumulation is dependent upon the medium Pi concentration as shown in Fig. 2. In the presence of 10 mm Pi, Ca2+ is accumulated and retained for over 50 min, but when Pi is reduced to 1 mm significant accumulation is not seen (Fig. 2 A). Parallel experiments using safranine to estimate ΔΨ showed that in the presence of 1 mm Pi, yMt respiring on ethanol develop a small ΔΨ which decays to no measurable value within 60 s (detection limit ∼80 mV). In contrast, a large ΔΨ is generated and maintained when the medium contains 10 mm Pi (data not shown). The fact that ΔΨ is not maintained explains the absence of Ca2+uptake in the medium containing 1 mm Pi, but it is not clear immediately why yMt depolarize under that condition. CsA does not substitute for the high Pi concentration, suggesting that depolarization and the failure to accumulate Ca2+ at 1 mm Pi is unrelated to a yPTP (Fig. 2 A). Nevertheless, parallel swelling and related experiments yield the opposite conclusion, as follows. While no swelling is associated with Ca2+ accumulation at 10 mm Pi, a CsA-insensitive swelling is apparent at 1 mm Pi (Fig. 2 B). The magnitude of swelling, expressed as ΔA540, is relatively small, compared with mPTP-dependent swelling of mMt (e.g. Ref. 26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, it is comparable with the swelling induced by alamethicin (compare Fig. 2 B,trace a with traces b and c), which is an antibiotic that forms large pores in the mMt inner membrane (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,36Ritov V.B. Murzakhmetova M.K. Tverdislova I.L.

These data are consistent with the presence of a CsA-insensitive PTP in yMt that allows mannitol to enter the matrix space, with swelling arising from an accumulation of mannitol/water driven by the Donnan potential and the oncotic pressure differential. Fig. 3 confirms this interpretation by showing that the swelling seen in Fig. 2 B reflects ultrastructural changes characteristic of the permeability transition in mMt (32Igbavboa U. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1405-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7161-7171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, marked release of matrix nucleotides is also seen, as expected if swelling results from the opening of a large and solute-nonselective pore (e.g. Ref. 8Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Brierley G.P. Pfeiffer D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We interpret these findings to indicate that yMt contain an endogenous PTP. Additional experiments revealed that neither exogenous Ca2+ nor ETH129 are required to induce swelling of yMt and that the depletion of endogenous Ca2+ using ionomycin plus an external chelator is without effect (data not shown). Thus, yPTP opening is apparently a Ca2+-independent process. However, respiration and Pi play central roles in regulating the yPTP. Swelling occurs slowly in the absence of Pi and an exogenous respiratory substrate but accelerates dramatically upon the addition of ethanol (Fig. 4 A). The same result is obtained when exogenous NADH is used in place of ethanol (data not shown). Antimycin A prevents the accelerated swelling produced by either substrate (data not shown) indicating that it is respiration/energization that is responsible. On the other hand, ATP can be substituted for ethanol or NADH, even in the presence of excess oligomycin. Thus, the action of ATP on yPTP opening is unrelated to the energetic state (Fig. 4 A). Regardless of whether swelling is spontaneous or promoted by respiration or exogenous ATP, it is strongly antagonized by the presence of 10 mm Pi (Fig. 4 A). The inhibitory action of Pi is concentration-dependent, with a half-maximal effect obtained near 1 mm, regardless of whether ethanol or ATP is employed. (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of Pi, spontaneous and ATP-induced swelling are pH-dependent, occurring faster as the medium pH is increased. This is less apparent in the case of ethanol-induced swelling, which occurs at similar rates as the medium pH is varied (Fig. 5). The size of the mPTP has been estimated by observing the ability of different size PEG to inhibit swelling (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or to induce contraction of previously swollen mMt, (e.g. Ref. 29Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We used the latter approach to further examine the solute size-exclusion properties of the yPTP. Ethanol-supported respiration or exogenous ATP was used to open the yPTP initially. After swelling reached completion, PEG of various molecular weights were added under isoosmotic conditions to determine their effectiveness in causing contraction. Small PEG (0.4 and 0.6 kDa) readily penetrate through the open yPTP since little or no contraction is observed upon their addition (Fig. 6 A). Contraction is seen with larger PEG, indicating that they are excluded or pass through the yPTP at a much slower rate. Although the rate of contraction declines for PEG larger than 1.5 kDa (Fig. 6 A), the extent of contraction that is ultimately attained is similar for PEG of 2 kDa and larger. Plotting the maximum extent of contraction versus PEG size indicates a half-maximal effect at ∼1.1 kDa when yMt have swollen during respiration on ethanol (Fig. 6 B) or in response to ATP (data not shown). This value is virtually identical to that reported for the PEG-induced contraction of beef heart mMt following mPTP opening induced by Ca2+ (29Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). It is somewhat greater than the values obtained by examining PEG-dependent inhibition of swelling in rat liver mMt when mPTP opening is induced by Ca2+ plus phosphate, or by mastoparan. In these cases, a half-maximal effect is obtained at 0.65 and 0.95 kDa PEG, respectively (26Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is not apparent why the rate of contraction decreases progressively with PEG larger than 1.5 kDa, but the same effect is seen with mMt (31Le-Quoc K. Le-Quoc D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7422-7428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reduced rate indicates that the membrane has become less permeable to internal solutes. Thus, fewer PTPs may be open at a given time when the larger PEGs are present. Since pretreatment in the present experiments was the same for PEG of all sizes, the same number of yPTPs should be open initially. Accordingly, the larger PEG may reduce the yPTP open probability through a physical-chemical mechanism (39Vodyanoy I. Bezrukov S.M. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2097-2105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the reduced rate of contraction might result from a decreased penetration of the larger PEG through channels in the outer membrane since the relationship between swelling and outer membrane rupture has not been determined for yMt. The pH dependence of contraction induced by 1.5 kDa PEG in the absence of Pi is shown in Fig. 7. Although ethanol-induced swelling is relatively independent of pH (Fig. 5), the rate of subsequent PEG-induced contraction displays a significant dependence (initial rate), increasing as the pH becomes more basic (Fig. 7). This is also true for contraction following spontaneous swelling (ethanol and ATP absent), however, contraction of ATP-swollen yMt is relatively pH independent (Fig. 6). The modest effect of pH on contraction in the presence of ATP is in contrast to ATP-induced swelling, which is pH-dependent (Fig. 5). At the highest pH examined (7.75), contraction is rapid regardless of how an open PTP was initially attained. The effects of medium pH on the swelling and contraction of yMt raise the"

DNA sequence analysis of the library clones revealed a gene which we have named fucT, encoding a protein with localized homology to the human α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts. We have demonstrated that fucT encodes an active Fuc-T enzyme by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme shows a strong preference for type 2 (e.g. LacNAc) over type 1 (e.g. lacto-N-biose) acceptors in vitro. Certain residues in a short segment of the H. pylori protein are completely conserved throughout the α(1,3)-Fuc-T family, defining an α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif which may be of use in identifying new fucosyltransferase genes.

The recombinant enzyme shows a strong preference for type 2 (e.g. LacNAc) over type 1 (e.g. lacto-N-biose) acceptors in vitro. Certain residues in a short segment of the H. pylori protein are completely conserved throughout the α(1,3)-Fuc-T family, defining an α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif which may be of use in identifying new fucosyltransferase genes.

H. pylori is a chronic pathogen, and the means by which this organism is able to persist in the stomach and resist or evade destruction by the immune system is central to its involvement in disease.

It was further established that the bacterium contains endogenous galactosyltransferase (Gal-T) and fucosyltransferase (Fuc-T) activities necessary for biosynthesis of these structures (18Chan N.W.C.

Lex is an oncofetal antigen (19Feizi T. Nature. 1985; 314: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 20Kannagi R. Nudelman E. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Watanabe T. Nakazato H. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1993; 88: 475-479Google Scholar), and its presence on H. pylori lipopolysaccharides may play a role in survival and pathogenesis. H. pylori infection is known to induce antibodies that cross-react with human gastric mucosa (22Negrini R. Lisato L. Zanella I. Cavazzini L. Gullini S. Villanacci V. Poiesil C. Albertini A.

Interestingly, molecular mimicry of Lex is also thought to be responsible for autoantibody production by Schistosoma mansoni (24Ko A.I. Dräger U.C. Harn D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4159-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Srivatsan J. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20196-20203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, surface carbohydrate antigens containing Lex structures may play a part in the immunopathology of H. pylori infection by promoting Th-1 to Th-2 switching as has been reported in schistosomal infections (26Velupillai P. Harn D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Two recent reports (27Wirth H-P. Yang M. Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect.

Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that over 85% of H. pylori isolates from geographically widespread locations express Lex and/or Ley antigens would also seem to imply selective pressure for maintenance of these structures, given the considerable structural variability often shown by lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria.In mammals, the defining step of Lex biosynthesis is fucosylation of a type 2 core structure (Galβ1→4GlcNAc). This reaction is catalyzed in humans by one or more members of a family of α(1,3)-fucosyltransferases which employ GDP-fucose as an activated sugar donor (29Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D.

If, as evidence is beginning to suggest, cell-surface Lex/yepitopes play an important role in H. pylori persistence and pathogenesis (23Appelmelk B.J. Simoons-Smit I.M. Negrini R. Moran A.P.

The remarkable degree of sequence conservation between mammalian α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts and the recently cloned chicken α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase (CFT1) (45Lee K.P. Carlson L.M. Woodcock J.B. Ramachandra N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32960-32967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggests that other nonmammalian α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts may also show significant homology to the known members of this enzyme family. We describe here the identification and cloning of a gene from H. pylori,fucT, which encodes an active Fuc-T with localized sequence similarity to the α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts.DISCUSSIONBy searching an H. pylori genomic data set with part of the catalytic domain sequence of a human α(1,3)-Fuc-T and sequencing corresponding clones from a plasmid library of H. pylori DNA we were able to identify a gene (fucT) with highly localized similarity to known α(1,3)-Fuc-T enzymes. Cell extracts from library clones containing the H. pylori gene possessed Fuc-T activity, and by subcloning fucT into an E. coliexpression vector we were able to confirm that it encodes an active α(1,3)-Fuc-T. H. pylori fucT is the first Fuc-T gene to be cloned from an invertebrate, although enzyme activity has been detected in the freshwater snail Lymnea stagnalis (56Mulder H. Schachter H. Thomas J.R. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart F.G. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in the parasite S. mansoni (53DeBose-Boyd R. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Sequence similarity between the mammalian Fuc-Ts and chick fucosyltransferase (CFT1) provided evidence for evolutionary conservation of α(1,3)-Fuc-T sequences (45Lee K.P. Carlson L.M. Woodcock J.B. Ramachandra N. Schultz T.L. Davis T.A. Lowe J.B. Thompson C.B. Larsen R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32960-32967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Conservation betweenH. pylori FucT and the mammalian enzymes, although limited and highly localized, suggests that aspects of the α(1,3)-Fuc-T sequence have survived unchanged through evolution from bacteria to higher mammals and man. The lack of overall sequence similarity to human α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts would seem to preclude the idea that H. pylori acquired the Fuc-T gene from a mammalian source. The base composition of the gene (35% GC) is also much closer to the average for H. pylori (36%) than to mammalian and avian α(1,3)-Fuc-T genes, which are typically GC-rich (e.g. CFT-1, 69% GC).Unlike eukaryotic Fuc-Ts which have a hydrophobic transmembrane domain near their N terminus and share a common type II membrane protein topology, the H. pylori enzyme contains no recognizable membrane insertion elements. Aligned on the basis of the short, highly conserved region of homology (Fig. 2), the bacterial enzyme appears to lack a region corresponding to the transmembrane and stem domains of other Fuc-Ts. Most of the “hypervariable region” previously implicated in acceptor binding specificity in human Fuc-TIII and -V (residues 34 to 161 in Fuc-TIII) (57Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is also absent, suggesting that the architecture of the H. pylori protein is substantially different from the rest of the enzyme family. The alignment also reveals that the C terminus of the bacterial sequence extends for approximately 100 amino acids beyond that of the other Fuc-Ts, half of this C-terminal extension being taken up by a periodic 7-amino acid leucine zipper-like motif. The function of this region, which has no counterpart in mammalian or avian Fuc-T sequences, is unknown. One possibility is that it mediates homo- or heteromultimer formation through coiled-coil type interactions, but at present the subunit structure of the H. pylori protein is unknown and further work will be necessary to establish the role of the zipper-like region.Recombinant H. pylori Fuc-T has a strong preference for type 2 acceptors, and analysis of oligosaccharides generated by fucosidase digestion of the product generated by this Fuc-T with LacNAc indicates that H. pylori Fuc-T is indeed capable of synthesizing the Lex epitope. Some type 1 structures are also fucosylated, but our studies suggest that with these acceptors fucose may be transferred predominantly to glucose rather than GlcNAc, implying that the enzyme has little α(1,2)- or α(1,4)-Fuc-T activity, as has been reported for human Fuc-TV (51de Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M. Swiedler S.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8712-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the Leyepitope found on the surface of many H. pylori isolates is therefore likely to involve a separate α(1,2)-Fuc-T activity. Overall, the acceptor specificity of H. pylori Fuc-T does not match that reported for any of the human enzymes or indeed that ofS. mansoni α(1,3)-Fuc-T (53DeBose-Boyd R. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Like the schistosome enzyme and human Fuc-Ts IV and VII, however, H. pylori Fuc-T shows only slight sensitivity to NEM inhibition. Interestingly, 3′-sialyl-LacNAc is an efficient acceptor (although 6′-sialyl-LacNAc is not), implying that H. pylori Fuc-T may be capable of synthesizing the sialyl-Lex (sLex) structure which was recently detected in a small number of H. pyloriisolates by Wirth et al. (27Wirth H-P. Yang M. Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4958-4965Crossref Google Scholar). The absence of sLex from the majority of H. pylori isolates may therefore reflect a lack of sialyltransferase activity in these strains.Mammalian α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts are a closely-related family of enzymes, making it difficult to identify residues of potential structural and/or catalytic importance from sequence alignments. The recently cloned avian α(1,3)-Fuc-T, CFT-1 (45Lee K.P. Carlson L.M. Woodcock J.B. Ramachandra N. Schultz T.L. Davis T.A. Lowe J.B. Thompson C.B. Larsen R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32960-32967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), also shows a high level of sequence similarity to the corresponding mammalian proteins, with 46.3% sequence identity to human Fuc-TIV. This is not the case with the H. pylori enzyme, which shows significant homology to the other α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts only in one short region. A consensus motif derived from this local area of homology (Fig. 2 B) is unique to members of the α(1,3)-Fuc-T family, including the H. pylori enzyme and an open reading frame from aCaenorhabditis eleganscosmid 4GenPept accession number 1041349. (58Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). This highly conserved α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif may be useful in identifying novel α(1,3)-Fuc-T genes in genomic and expressed sequence tag sequence data, since its appearance seems to be a reliable predictor of membership of this enzyme family. It may also provide a tool for cloning α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts in a manner similar to the demonstrated utility of the l- and S-sialyl motifs in cloning novel sialyltransferases (59Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).The functional significance of the α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif is at present unclear. Marked differences in acceptor preferences among members of the α(1,3)-Fuc-T family would seem to argue against a role in acceptor binding. Human Fuc-TIV and -VII for example both contain the α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif, but while Fuc-TVII uses 2,3-sialylated acceptors almost exclusively, Fuc-TIV strongly prefers neutral type 2 substrates (41Gersten K.M. Natsuka S. Trinchera M. Petryniak B. Kelly R.J. Hiraiwa N. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25047-25056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in in vitro assays. The behavior of Fuc-TIV in vivo is apparently more complex (60Goelz S. Kumar R. Potvin B. Sundaram S. Brickelmaier M. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1033-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif lies outside sequence regions implicated by efforts to define acceptor-discriminating residues in α(1,3)-Fuc-Ts (51de Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Given that the enzymes transfer fucose from a common sugar nucleotide donor, it seems more likely that the α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif is involved in binding GDP-fucose or Mn2+. The motif lies some considerable distance from a cysteine residue implicated in GDP-fucose protectable inhibition by NEM (62Holmes E.H. Xu Z. Sherwood A.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8145-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although it may be much closer in space within the folded protein than the primary sequence suggests. The corresponding position in the H. pylori Fuc-T is occupied by tyrosine (Fig. 2 A), in keeping with observations that enzymes with Cys at this location are inhibited by NEM while those with other amino acids (Fuc-TIV has Ser, Fuc-TVII has Thr) are resistant to NEM inhibition (62Holmes E.H.

Bird, manuscript in preparation.Interestingly, the conserved motif contains a lysine residue (Fig. 2 A), possibly a candidate for the so far unidentified GDP-fucose-protected lysine residue identified by pyridoxal phosphate labeling of a human fucosyltransferase (63Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Further work is clearly needed to test these speculations, but in this respect the lack of overall similarity between the H. pylori and mammalian transferase sequences may be advantageous. The relatively small number of conserved residues inside and outside the α(1,3)-Fuc-T motif may provide a useful focus for mutagenesis experiments to probe structural and mechanistic aspects of the α(1,3)-fucosyltransferases. The dissimilarity of H. pylori and human Fuc-T enzymes would also seem to auger well for the design of selective inhibitors of the bacterial enzyme.The H. pylori enzyme, which lacks a transmembrane domain and is, presumably, nonglycosylated, is devoid of some of the features which make eukaryotic Fuc-Ts difficult to work with. The possibility of bacterial expression also makes this enzyme a promising candidate for chemoenzymatic glycoconjugate synthesis. The same features may simplify the task of structural determination. Given the conserved motif, it seems reasonable to assume that this enzyme shares at least some structural features in common with its mammalian counterparts which have so far resisted structural elucidation.Mounting evidence appears to point to a role for Lewis antigen mimicry in H. pylori pathogenesis. Identification and cloning of a Fuc-T gene from this organism will allow us to probe the biosynthesis of Lex by H. pylori in vivo via disruption offucT and may make it possible to test the role of Lex directly in models of H. pyloripathogenesis.

This microorganism has been shown to express cell surface glycoconjugates including Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y. These bacterial oligosaccharides are structurally similar to tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens found in mammals. In this study, we report the cloning of a novel α1,3-fucosyltransferase gene (HpfucT) involved in the biosynthesis of Lex within H. pylori. The deduced amino acid sequence of HpfucT consists of 478 residues with the calculated molecular mass of 56,194 daltons, which is approximately 100 amino acids longer than known mammalian α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases. The ∼52-kDa protein encoded byHpfucT was expressed in Escherichia coli CSRDE3 cells and gave rise to α1,3-fucosyltransferase activity but neither α1,4-fucosyltransferase nor α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity as characterized by radiochemical assays and capillary zone electrophoresis. Truncation of the C-terminal 100 amino acids of HpFuc-T abolished the enzyme activity. An approximately 72-amino acid region of HpFuc-T exhibits significant sequence identity (40–45%) with the highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain among known mammalian and chicken α1,3-fucosyltransferases. These lines of evidence indicate that the HpFuc-T represents the bacterial α1,3-fucosyltransferase. In addition, several structural features unique to HpFuc-T, including 10 direct repeats of seven amino acids and the lack of the transmembrane segment typical for known eukaryotic α1,3-fucosyltransferases, were revealed.

Helicobacter pylori is a spiral, microaerophilic Gram-negative bacterium which has been recognized as an important human pathogen causing gastritis and both peptic and duodenal ulcers (1Warren J.R.

Fujishima M. Tsuneyoshi M. Cancer. 1997; 79: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This pathogen is highly adapted to colonize human gastric mucosa and may remain in the stomach with or without causing symptoms for many years (7Lee A. Hazel S.L. Microb. Ecol. Health Dis. 1988; 1: 1-16Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although H. pylori elicits local as well as systemic antibody responses (8Rathbone B.J. Wyatt I.J. Worsley B.W. Shires S.E.

Another mechanism by which H. pylori may protect itself from the action of the host immune response is the production of surface antigens mimicking those in the host. Cell surface α(1,3)- and α(1,2)-fucosylated oligosaccharides, that is, Lewis X (Lex) 1The abbreviations used are: Lex, Lewis X; Ley, Lewis Y; Fuc-T, α1,3-fucosyltransferase unless specified; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; HD-Zip, homeodomain-leucine zipper; bZip, basic region-zipper; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; LacNAc-R, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8COOMe; Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R, Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8COOMe; LacNAc-TMR, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8CO-NHCH2CH2NH-TMR; Phenyl-Gal, phenyl-β-galactoside.1The abbreviations used are: Lex, Lewis X; Ley, Lewis Y; Fuc-T, α1,3-fucosyltransferase unless specified; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; HD-Zip, homeodomain-leucine zipper; bZip, basic region-zipper; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; LacNAc-R, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8COOMe; Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R, Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8COOMe; LacNAc-TMR, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8CO-NHCH2CH2NH-TMR; Phenyl-Gal, phenyl-β-galactoside. and Lewis Y (Ley), are present on both eukaryotic and microbial cell surfaces. In mammals, Lex is a stage-specific embryonic antigen, and Lex, sLex, and Ley are all regarded as tumor-associated markers (9Feizi T.

It has been proposed that Lex plays a similar function during physiological and pathological processes (14Hakomori S. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Bacterial Lex and Ley were first identified inH. pylori by Aspinall and Monteiro (15Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and Aspinallet al. (16Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Pang H. Walsh E.J. Moran A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2489-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that Lex and Ley structures are present in the O-antigen regions of the lipopolysaccharides purified from H. pylori cells using one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Expression of Lex in H. pylori was further confirmed by examination using immunoelectron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (17Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Infect.

Recently it was reported that production of Lex and Ley is related to cagA+H. pylori isolates which are associated with an increased risk for the development of gastric cancer (20Wirth H.-P. Yang M. Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of these bacterial oligosaccharide structures are not fully understood. It has been suggested that such glycoconjugates produced byH. pylori may mimic host cell antigens and could mask the bacterium and thus reduce the immune response (19Appelmelk B.J. Simoons-Smit I. Negrini R. Moran A.P. Aspinall G.O. Forte J.G. De Vries T. Quan H. Verboom T. Maaskant J.J. Ghiara P. Kuipers E.J. Bloemena E. Tadema T.M. Townsend R.R. Tyagarajan K. Crothers J.M.

Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that these bacterial Lewis antigens could down-regulate the host T-cell response (17Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4564-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, production of such antigens may contribute to colonization and long-term infection of the stomach byH. pylori. The final step in the synthesis of cell surface α1,3- and α1,4-fucosylated oligosaccharides in mammals is catalyzed by α1,3- or α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-Ts). The human FUTgenes encoding at least five distinct Fuc-Ts generating Lexand related structures have been cloned and sequenced (21Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffiths B. Tizard R. Newman B.

Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Lexproduced by H. pylori is synthesized by the addition of galactose from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc and then fucose from GDP-Fuc to Galβ1–4GlcNAc (LacNAc), catalyzed by β1,4-galactosyltransferase and Fuc-T, respectively. This pathway is identical to that found in humans. However, the genetic basis for the bacterial Fuc-T was unclear. Characterization of a gene encoding the α1,3-fucosyltransferase would not only lead to elucidation of the pathogenic role of the Lex determinant in the H. pylori infection but would also provide new insights into the structure-function relationship by comparison between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Fuc-Ts. We now report the cloning and heterologous expression of the novel bacterial Fuc-T gene, designated HpfucT, obtained fromH. pylori. The deduced amino acid sequence ofHpfucT is similar to the highly conserved catalytic domain among known mammalian and chicken Fuc-Ts. Several sequence features unique to this bacterial Fuc-T were also identified. In addition, the HpFuc-T protein produced in Escherichia coli was characterized biochemically. Bacteria were used in this study, includingH. pylori strain NCTC11639 for cloning, E. colistrain DH10B for production of recombinant plasmids, and E. coli CSRDE3 containing a Plac-controlled T7 RNA polymerase (36Ge Z. Taylor D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6151-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for overexpressing proteins of interest. H. pylori cells were cultured on BHI-YE agar or in BHI-YE broth under microaerobic conditions as described previously (36Ge Z. Taylor D.E. J.

Either ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or rifampicin (200 μg/ml) were added to the above media for growth of plasmid-containing cells and for expression of plasmid-encoded proteins. Plasmid vectors pBluescript II SK(+/−) and pCRTMII were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), respectively. Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8COOMe (LacNAc-R), Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ -O-(CH2)8COOMe (Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R), and Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-O-(CH2)8CO-NHCH2CH2NH-TMR (LacNAc-TMR) were provided by Dr. O.

(St. Louis, MO) and phenyl-β-galactoside (Phenyl-Gal) as well as almond meal α-fucosidase from Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Ltd. (Mississauga, Ontario), whereas GDP-fucose was synthesized by the method of Gokhale et al. (38Gokhale U.B. Hindsgaul O. Palcic M.M. Can. J. Chem. 1990; 68: 1063-1071Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sep-Pak Plus C-18 reverse-phase cartridges were purchased from Waters (Mississauga, Ontario). [α-32P]dCTP was from DuPont Canada Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the supplier's instructions (Pierce). All restriction endonucleases and other modified enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. unless specified. Plasmid and H. pylori chromosomal DNA was prepared as described previously (36Ge Z. Taylor D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6151-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard molecular cloning procedures and Southern hybridization were detailed by Sambrook et al. (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

Both strands of recombinant plasmid DNA were sequenced using the Thermo sequenase sequencing kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). [α-32P] dCTP-labeled probes were prepared using a random priming kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). To clone the fucosyltransferase gene from H. pylori NCTC11639, degenerate primers were generated from the several regions conserved by three mammalian α1–3 fucosyltransferases including human Fuc-TVI (29Natsuka S. Gersten K.M. Zenita K. Kannagi R. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16789-16794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine Fuc-TIII (33Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Primer FUTF3 (5′TT(T/C)TA(T/C)CT(T/C/A/G)GC(G/A/T/C)TT(T/C)GA(A/G)AA3′) corresponds to residues 242–248 of human Fuc-TVI, whereas primer FUCTR2 (5′AA(A/G)TC(A/G)TC(G/ATC)AC(A/G)TG(G/A/T/C)AG(A/G)AA3′) is complementary to the sequence deduced from its residues 289–295. An expected DNA fragment of ∼170 nucleotides was PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of H. pylori NCTC11639 with the primer pair of FUCTF3 and FUCTR2 under a thermocycling program of 40 cycles: for the first two cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 40 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C; for the remaining cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C, followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were cloned into vector pCRTMII according to the supplier's instructions. Subsequently, the inserts in recombinant plasmids were sequenced with Thermo sequenase, and their nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were used in the search for related proteins in data bases with the software of Blast included in the GCG package (version 8.0, Genetic Computing Group, Inc., Madison, WI). A clone, designated pCRHpfucT3, was demonstrated to contain the insert encoding the amino acid sequence homologous to known mammalian α1,3-fucosyltransferases. To clone a putative intact fucT gene from H. pylori, chromosomal DNA from H. pylori NCTC11639 was digested with restriction endonucleases, including BglII,EcoRI, BamHI, BglII-EcoRI,EcoRI-BamHI, andBglII-BamHI and then separated in a 1% agarose gel. DNA fragments containing the putative fucT gene were demonstrated by Southern hybridization with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe made from pCRHpfucT3 DNA. The 2.2-kb EcoRl-BglII and 4.5-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragments were cloned into vector pBluescript II KS− which was digested with EcoRI andBamHI. Two clones, pBKHpfucT8 carrying a 2.2-kbEcoRl-BglII fragment and pBKHpfucT31 carrying a 4.5-kb, EcoRI-BamHI fragment, were selected for further characterization. To construct recombinant plasmids containing an intact or partial H. pylori fucT gene, three primers were generated from the nucleotide sequence in Fig. 1: ZGE37 corresponding to nucleotides 1–19; ZGE38 and ZGE39 complementary to nucleotides 1215–1233 and 1692–1710, respectively. ZGE37 contained aBamHI site, whereas ZGE38 and ZGE39 contained anEcoRI site. PCR products were amplified from pBKHpfucT31 with a primer pair of either ZGE37/ZGE38 or ZGE37/ZGE39. These PCR-amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRl andBamHl and then cloned into pBluescript II KS−. The respective clones containing the H. pylori fucT gene of interest were screened by PCR with the corresponding pair of the above primers. Two clones, designated pBKHp763fucT38 and pBKHp763fucT39, contained a partial and an intact H. pylori fucT gene, respectively. The coding region of the H. pylori fucT gene was controlled under the T7 promoter. The sequence of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments in pBKHp763fucT38 and pBKHp763fucT39 was demonstrated by sequencing to be identical to that of the native template. Recombinant plasmids pBKHp763fucT38 and pBKHp763fucT39 were introduced into E. coli CSRDE3 cells by electroporation. The proteins encoded by the recombinant plasmids were overexpressed in the presence of either [35S]methionine or cold methionine as described previously (36Ge Z. Taylor D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6151-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells expressing [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were boiled for 5 min in 1 × sample buffer and separated in a 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Ge Z. Taylor D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6151-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli CSRDE3 cells expressing nonradioactively labeled proteins encoded by pBKHp763fucT38 and pBKHp763fucT39 were harvested and suspended in Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a proteinase inhibitor). Subsequently, membrane and soluble fractions of the cells were prepared after disruption with a French press as described previously (36Ge Z. Taylor D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6151-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane pellets were resuspended in the same Hepes buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C prior to use. Assays of H. pylori α1,3- and α1,4-fucosyltransferase activities were carried out according to the method described by Chanet al. (18Chan N.W.C. Stangier K. Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Zhang Y. Dovichi N. Palcic M.M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 20 min in a volume of 20 μl containing either 720 μm LacNAc-R for α1,3-fucosyltransferase activity, Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R for α1,4-fucosyltransferase activity, or 5.33 mm Phenyl-Gal for α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity, 50 μm GDP-fucose, 100,000 dpm GDP-[3H]fucose, 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), 20 mm MnCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 8.5 μl of the enzyme fraction. The incubation mixtures contained 16 μl of the membrane fraction containing the intact HpFuc-T protein, 100 μm LacNAc-TMR, 100 μmGDP-fucose in a total volume of 20 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) containing 20 mm MnCl2 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Incubation was done at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the sample was prepared and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis by injecting 12 pl onto an electrophoresis column (60 cm long) at 1 kV for 5 s as described previously (18Chan N.W.C. Stangier K. Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Zhang Y. Dovichi N. Palcic M.M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic separations were performed at a running voltage of 400 V/cm. α-Fucosidase treatment was done by incubating the sample (10 μm total TMR) with 4 microunits of almond meal α-fucosidase in a total volume of 40 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 90 h. Products were isolated and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis as described above. Three recombinant plasmids, pCRHpfucT3, pBKHpfucT8, and pBKHpfucT31 containing the intact or partial sequence of thefucT gene from H. pylori NCTC11639 were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequences of these recombinant clones were sequenced from both strands using nested primers. Fig. 2 A gave rise to the nucleotide sequence of 1710 base pairs derived from clone pBKHpfucT31. A major open reading frame (ORF), starting at nucleotide 145 and ending at nucleotide 1578, was predicted in this region. An unusual sequence feature of this ORF was 10 direct repeats of 21 nucleotides (Fig. 2 A). An AA to GG transition at positions 12 and 13 of this repeat has occurred in repeat copies III, V, and VIII. An SD sequence, a ribosomal binding site in prokaryotes (39Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar), precedes the predicted translation initiation codon AUG. In addition, the sequence “ACCATGT,” which is similar to the Kozak's consensus context “ACCATGG” (a common ribosomal binding site in eukaryotes) (40Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), is also present at the beginning of the ORF. Putative transcription elements including −10 and −35 regions immediately upstream of the ORF and a stem-loop structure following the stop codon of the ORF, which probably act as a transcription promoter and ρ-independent transcription terminator (41Platt T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 339-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were identified (Fig. 2 A). An asymmetric inverted repeat sequence was found, encompassing 18 nucleotides and containing the putative −10 region (Fig. 2 A). Another ORF downstream from the major ORF, in the opposite orientation as indicated in Fig. 2 A, encodes the amino acid sequence similar to the corresponding region of the glutamate dehydrogenase identified in Corynebacterium glutamicum (nucleotide sequence accession number S32227). A protein consisting of 478 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56,194 daltons was predicted from this ORF. A hydropathy profile calculated by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (42Kyte J. Doolittle R.F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) indicates that the deduced amino acid sequence is primarily hydrophilic and does not contain a potential transmembrane segment (Fig. 2 B). The predicted protein carries 10 direct repeats of seven amino acid residues proximal to the C terminus. There is a conservative replacement of valine with isoleucine at position 5 found in repeats III, V, and VIII, which results from the corresponding AA to GG mutations as mentioned above. Five putative N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted, two of which are proximal to the N terminus similar to those identified in mammalian Fuc-Ts. However, the remaining three such sites are close to the C terminus. This latter feature is similar to the sites identified in rabbit and human α1,2-fucosyltransferases (43Paulson S. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Comparison of this polypeptide sequence with other proteins in the data bases using the Blast search revealed significant sequence similarity (40–45% identity) to α1–3 and 1–3/1–4 fucosyltransferases from mammalian sources including human Fuc-Ts III to VII (21Goelz S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2087821055,"Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) leads to its rapid uptake by macrophages in vitro, but no detailed studies have addressed the effect of oxidation on the binding of LDL to proteoglycans. We therefore treated LDL with various substances: copper sulfate, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), soybean lipoxygenase, and mouse peritoneal macrophages, and determined the extent to which the oxidatively modified LDL bound to human aortic proteoglycans in an affinity column. Oxidation of LDL with copper, AAPH, or macrophages, all of which increased its electrophoretic mobility, was associated with reduced binding to proteoglycans, until strongly oxidized LDL was totally unable to bind to them. After treatment of LDL with soybean lipoxygenase, the change in electrophoretic mobility was small, and the amount of binding to proteoglycans was only slightly decreased. The increased electrophoretic mobility of oxidized LDL reflects modification of the lysine residues of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). To mimic the oxidative modification of lysines, we treated LDL with malondialdehyde. This treatment also totally prevented the binding of LDL to proteoglycans. In contrast, if the lysine residues of apoB-100 were methylated to shield them against oxidative modification, subsequent treatment of LDL with copper sulfate failed to reduce the degree of LDL binding to proteoglycans. Finally, the active lysine residues in the oxidized LDL particles, which are thought to be involved in this binding, were quantified with NMR spectroscopy. In oxidized LDL, the number of these residues was found to be decreased. The present results show that, after modification of the lysine residues of apoB-100 during oxidation, the binding of LDL to proteoglycans is decreased, and suggest that oxidation of LDL tends to lead to intracellular rather than extracellular accumulation of LDL during atherogenesis.

Human atherosclerosis is characterized by accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; apo, apolipoprotein; MDA, malondialdehyde; BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene; AAPH, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances.1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; apo, apolipoprotein; MDA, malondialdehyde; BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene; AAPH, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. in the arterial intima. In atherosclerostic lesions, LDL is modified and accumulates both intra- and extracellularly. The LDL modification that has been most studied is oxidation. The role of LDL oxidation in intracellular accumulation is well established. Thus, oxidized LDL is taken up by macrophage scavenger receptors, which transform the macrophages into foam cells (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of oxidation of LDL in extracellular accumulation of LDL is not known. An important component of extracellular accumulation of LDL is binding of LDL to the extracellular matrix consisting mainly of proteoglycans (2Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Fogelman A.M. Mottino G. Frank J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Frank J.S. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native LDL binds proteoglycans via ionic interactions between the positively charged lysine and arginine residues of the apolipoprotein component of LDL, the apoB-100, and the negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups of glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycans (4Iverius P.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2607-2613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol.

Upon oxidation of LDL, the unsaturated fatty acids of LDL lipids are decomposed, for instance, to malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal. These compounds can then react with the lysine residues of apoB-100, thereby neutralizing them and so interfering with their ability to interact with other molecules. Indeed, Haberland et al. (8Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) found that MDA-modified LDL failed to bind to heparin. In this study we oxidized LDL in vitro by several methods and analyzed the effect of oxidation on its degree of binding to proteoglycans isolated from human aortas. We also studied the effects of lysine modification on the degree of binding, by specifically modifying the lysine residues of apoB-100, and by preventing lysine oxidation by prior methylation of the lysine residues. Since the lysine residues of apoB-100 are of two types having different pKa values, 8.9 and 10.5 (9Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of which the former “active lysines” are thought to be located in the areas of apoB-100 that bind to proteoglycans, we also investigated the effect of oxidation on this population of lysine residues in LDL. Bovine serum albumin, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), cholesteryl linoleate, ε-aminocaproic acid, and soybean lipoxygenase type V were from Sigma; copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, EDTA, and CHOD-iodide kit (catalog no 14359) for peroxide measurement were from Merck; malondialdehyde bis(dimethyl acetal) was from Aldrich; and 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH) was from Polysciences. Chondroitinase ABC and AC, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and the unsaturated chondro-disaccharide kit for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were from Seikagaku Kogyo. [1,2-3H]Cholesteryl linoleate was from Amersham. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Boehringer Mannheim, Celite 545 (acid-washed) was from Fluka, and the Schrynel nylon filter from Zürcher Beuteltuchfabrik AG. [13C]Formaldehyde (99% isotope enrichment) as a 20% solution in water was from Isotec Inc., and [14C]formaldehyde from DuPont. NaCNBH3 from Sigma was purified by recrystallization from dichloromethane before use (10Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), RPMI 1640 culture medium with 25 mm HEPES, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Female NMRI mice (20–30 g) were obtained from a licensed animal center (Poikkijoki). Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns, HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide activated columns, HiTrap heparin columns, HiTrap Q columns, and PD-10 columns were from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology; Bio-Gel A-0.5m gel filtration medium was from Bio-Rad; the 5-μm NH2 (0.3 × 25 cm) and S5 ODS (0.3 × 25 cm) columns were from Spherisorb. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein was a kind gift from Drs. C. Ehnholm and M. Jauhiainen, National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.050) was isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation in the presence of 3 mm EDTA (11Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 77: 757-761Google Scholar). [3H]Cholesteryl linoleate-LDL ([3H]CL-LDL) was prepared by incubating LDL and cholesteryl ester transfer protein with solid dispersions of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate on Celite for 18–24 h as described previously (12Paananen K. Saarinen J. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amount of LDL is expressed in terms of its protein concentration. LDL was oxidized with copper by incubating LDL or [3H]CL-LDL (1 mg/ml) in PBS supplemented with 5 μm copper sulfate at 37 °C for the time periods indicated (13Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized with AAPH by incubating [3H]CL-LDL (1 mg/ml) in buffer A (150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with 25 mm AAPH at 37 °C for the time periods indicated (14Stocker R. Bowry V.W. Frei B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Oxidation was terminated by addition of BHT and EDTA (see below) and cooling the sample on ice. AAPH was removed from the sample over a PD-10 column equilibrated and eluted with ice-cold buffer A. LDL was oxidized by mouse peritoneal macrophages essentially as described elsewhere (15Pentikäinen M.O. Lindstedt K.A. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, [3H]CL-LDL (100 μg/ml) was incubated in 300 μl of RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 300 nm copper sulfate in a 24-well plastic culture plate seeded with 1 × 106 macrophages in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2 in air) at 37 °C for the time periods indicated. LDL was oxidized with soybean lipoxygenase by incubating [3H]CL-LDL (2.5 mg/ml) in buffer A containing 1.25 mm linoleate-albumin and 60 units/μl soybean lipoxygenase at 37 °C for 18 h (16Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL was reisolated by gel filtration chromatography on an A-0.5m column (1 × 50 cm). In all systems, oxidation was terminated by addition of BHT and EDTA to give final concentrations of 20 μm and 1 mm, respectively. LDL was modified with MDA by incubating [3H]CL-LDL (1 mg/ml in PBS) with increasing amounts of MDA on an ice bath for 3 h (17Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentrations of MDA are given in the figure legends. After incubation, LDL was dialyzed extensively against buffer A. To 2 mg of [3H]CL-LDL in 2 ml of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.2 m NaCNBH3 was added to give a final concentration of 20 mm. After addition of 15 × 10−6 mol of formaldehyde to the sample, the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 18 h (10Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). β-Carotene was analyzed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the β-carotene in LDL (1 mg/ml) at 482 nm (18Chang G.J. Woo P. Honda H.M. Ignarro L.J. Young L. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive lysine residues (ε-amino groups of lysine residues) were determined with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (19Habeeb A.F.S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar), using valine as standard, and expressed as percentages of the value for native LDL. The quantity of conjugated dienes in LDL was assessed by measuring the absorbance of LDL (0.1 mg/ml) at 234 nm with a spectrophotometer fitted with a cuvette with a 1-cm light path (20Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxides were measured as described by El-Saadani et al. (21El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a commercial CHOD-iodide kit. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were measured essentially as described by Hessler et al. (22Hessler J.R. Morel D.W. Lewis L.J. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 215-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and expressed as MDA equivalents, with 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as standard. The electrophoretic mobility of LDL was determined on cellulose acetate plates (Helena Laboratories). The extent of LDL aggregation was determined by analyzing oxidized [3H]CL-LDL with gel filtration column chromatography on two Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns connected in series. The degree of aggregation was measured as the proportion of3H radioactivity eluting in the void volume of the column. Proteoglycans from intima-media of human aortas obtained at autopsy within 24 h of accidental death were prepared essentially as described by Hurt-Camejo et al. (23Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. López F. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1397-1398Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, proteoglycans were extracted from the intima-media at 4 °C for 24 h with 15 volumes of 6 m urea, 1 mNaCl in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmε-aminocaproic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. After extraction, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was diluted with 6 m urea to give a final concentration of 0.25 m NaCl and loaded on a HiTrap Q column (5 ml) equilibrated with 6 m urea, 0.25m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm acetate, pH 6.2, and the protease inhibitors. The column was washed with the above buffer, and the proteoglycans were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25 to 1.0 m NaCl in the buffer (120 ml) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The peaks at 280 nm were collected, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The disaccharide composition of the proteoglycans was analyzed by HPLC, using a 5-μm NH2 column, after treatment of the proteoglycans with chondroitinase ABC and AC (24Macek J. Krajickova J. Adam M. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 414: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The proteoglycan preparation used here contained 56% of chondroitin-6-sulfate, 25% of chondroitin-4-sulfate, and 19% of dermatan sulfate. The amounts of the proteoglycans are expressed in terms of their glycosaminoglycan content. Human arterial proteoglycans or chondroitin-6-sulfate were coupled to anN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HiTrap column (1 ml or 5 ml, respectively) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For this purpose, 1.0 mg of proteoglycans or 10 mg of chondroitin-6-sulfate in 0.2 m NaHCO3 and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, were coupled to the column at 25 °C for 2 h. The column was blocked with 0.5 m ethanolamine, pH 8.3, containing 0.5m NaCl. Under these conditions, 0.7 mg of the proteoglycans and 7.4 mg of the chondroitin-6-sulfate were found to be coupled to the column. The columns were equilibrated with buffer B (10 mmHEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) before use. LDL or [3H]CL-LDL was oxidized as described above, and 20–30-μl samples of the incubation mixtures corresponding to 20–30 μg of LDL were analyzed on the proteoglycan or heparin affinity columns by elution with a linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 250 mm or 0 to 500 mm, respectively, in 10 min) in buffer B. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. LDL was eluted from the chondroitin-6-sulfate column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with buffer B containing 250 mm NaCl. Proteins were detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm or, in some experiments in which radiolabeled LDL was used, by collecting fractions and determining their radioactivity. The conductivity of the eluent was also monitored. The chromatographic apparatus was Smart system (Pharmacia). LDL (30 mg) was incubated for 6 h with 5 μm CuSO4 in 30 ml of PBS at 37 °C. Oxidation was terminated by addition of BHT and EDTA to give final concentrations of 20 μm and 1 mm, respectively. For NMR analysis, the amino groups of the free lysine residues of apoB-100 of native or oxidized LDL were13C-labeled by reductive methylation with [13C]formaldehyde (9Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). First, 0.2 mNaCNBH3 was added to 30 mg of native or oxidized LDL in 30 ml of buffer A to give a final concentration of 20 mm. After addition of 2 × 10−4 mol of [13C]formaldehyde to the samples, the mixtures were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. The reactions were stopped by extensive dialysis against buffer A, and the labeled LDL solutions were concentrated in Amicon 100 concentrators with a 100-kDa cut-off membrane. The H13CHO was doped with a trace of [14C]formaldehyde to give a known specific radioactivity. The degree of reductive methylation was calculated by counting the amount of [14C]formaldehyde incorporated into the lysine residues of apoB-100. Broad-band proton-decoupled13C NMR spectra were measured from LDL samples comprising 11.2–11.4 mg of protein/ml in a solution containing 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and 10% of D2O for the spectrometer field-lock.13C NMR spectra were obtained at 150.8 MHz with a Varian Unity 600 NMR spectrometer. All experiments were recorded at 37 ± 0.5 °C, and the spectral width was 250 ppm, corresponding to 16,000 points in 0.219 s. Pulse length was 8 μs. Proton decoupling was performed with a GARP sequence (25Shaka A.J. Barker P. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547Google Scholar). Total running times varied from 4 to 6 h, depending on the sample. Relaxation delay was 1.0 s to gain a good signal-to-noise ratio. The repetition time of these measurements was on the order of the longitudinal relaxation time of the active lysines (26Lund-Katz S. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Curtiss L.K. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2701-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the number of active lysines in these measurements was underestimated compared with the normal lysines which relax faster. We therefore measured 13C-labeled LDL using relaxation delays of 1.0 and 5.0 s and obtained a correction factor of 1.47 to subsequently multiply the integrated dimethyl-lysine resonances of the active lysines. Prior to Fourier transformations, free induction decays were filled to 32,000 and weighted by 2-Hz line broadening. Macrophages from unstimulated NMRI mice were harvested into Dulbecco's PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (27Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). The peritoneal cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (1–2 × 106) were seeded into plastic 24-well plates (Falcon) and incubated overnight in a humidified CO2 (5% CO2 in air) incubator. Before the experiments, the dishes were washed to remove nonadherent cells. Each monolayer received 300 μl of RPMI medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 μmoleate-albumin, and 30 μg of native or oxidized LDL. After incubation for 18 h at 37 °C, the amount of cholesteryl oleate in the cells was determined with reverse phase HPLC, using an S5 ODS (0.3 × 25 cm) column as described previously (28Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowryet al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Glycosaminoglycans were determined by the method of Bartold and Page (30Bartold P.M. Page R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To study the effect of LDL oxidation on the amount of LDL bound to human aortic proteoglycans, LDL was oxidized by incubation with 5 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for various periods of time up to 18 h. At the indicated time points, the degree of LDL oxidation was analyzed by measuring changes in several parameters known to be associated with LDL oxidation (Fig. 1, left panels): loss of β-carotene and of ε-amino groups (lysine); formation of conjugated dienes, TBARS, and peroxides; and increase in the electrophoretic mobility of LDL. The amount of oxidized LDL bound to aortic proteoglycans was determined by applying aliquots of the incubation mixtures to a proteoglycan affinity column. The column was then washed for 1 min with buffer B, and the bound LDL was eluted with a 10-min linear NaCl gradient (0–250 mm NaCl) in buffer B. Elution was monitored with UV absorbance at 280 nm, and the gradient was checked by measuring the changes in conductivity (Fig. 1, right panels, dotted lines). Of the 20 μg of native LDL applied, 95% bound to the column and eluted as a single peak at 65 mm NaCl (Fig. 1, right panels, top). As shown by the elution profiles of the samples treated with CuSO4 for various time periods, the higher the degree of oxidation (Fig. 1, left panels), the smaller was the amount of LDL bound to the proteoglycans, until, after oxidation for 18 h, the modified LDL particles failed to bind to the proteoglycans (Fig. 1, right panels, bottom). Progressive copper-induced oxidation of LDL generates aggregation of the lipoprotein (31Lougheed M. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11798-11805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To assess whether the observed loss in the ability of LDL to bind to proteoglycans is due to aggregation of LDL, we determined the degree of particle aggregation in our oxidized LDL samples by gel filtration chromatography. When LDL was oxidized for 18 h, which fully abolishes binding of LDL to proteoglycans (Fig. 1), the amount of LDL aggregated (eluting in the void volume of the column) was 24%. Since only a fraction of the oxidized LDL particles had aggregated, aggregation cannot be responsible for the loss in the ability of LDL to bind to proteoglycans. As oxidation progressed, the electrophoretic mobility of LDL increased (Fig. 1, left panels). Since only one band of LDL was formed, the particles must have been modified to roughly the same extent at any given time point. Yet, when analyzed with the proteoglycan affinity column, two populations of LDL emerged, one eluting without binding to the proteoglycans, and the other binding to the column and eluting only at the higher NaCl concentrations (Fig. 1,right panels). To examine whether these two populations of LDL had been differently oxidized, we performed an experiment in which LDL was oxidized by incubation with CuSO4 for 6 h. The sample was then applied to a chondroitin-6-sulfate affinity column, the unbound LDL was collected in buffer B, and the bound LDL was eluted with buffer B containing 250 mm NaCl. Both fractions were concentrated in Amicon 10 concentrators with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane. Aliquots of the fractions were then rechromatographed on the same affinity column: most (90%) of the bound LDL did bind again, and most (85%) of the unbound LDL remained unbound. The same result was obtained when a proteoglycan affinity column was used. The bound and unbound oxidized LDL fractions were examined for their contents of peroxides and number of free ε-amino groups in lysines. No difference in peroxide content was found between the two fractions. In striking contrast, the amount of free lysine residues was 90% in the bound LDL and only 65% in the unbound LDL. When LDL was oxidized for 18 h, a similar difference in the number of lysine residues was observed between the bound and unbound LDL fractions, although the proportion of LDL that was bound was smaller than after oxidation for 6 h (above). In an additional experiment, LDL was oxidized for 18 h and chromatographed on a heparin HiTrap (1 ml) affinity column. Again, although there was no difference in peroxide content between the two oxidized LDL fractions, the bound LDL contained a higher proportion (75%) of free lysine residues than the unbound LDL (58%). As expected, the relative electrophoretic mobility of the unbound LDL was higher than that of the bound LDL. Taken together, the above results are compatible with the idea that the factor which had rendered LDL particles unable to bind to glycosaminoglycans or to proteoglycans was the reduction in the number of free lysine residues of apoB-100. LDL was next oxidized with AAPH for various time periods. At the indicated time points, one sample of the incubation mixture was taken for analysis of the amounts of ε-amino groups, TBARS, peroxides, and relative electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2, left panels), while another was applied to the proteoglycan affinity column (Fig. 2, right panels). As with copper-modified LDL, it was found that as oxidation advanced, the binding of LDL to the column decreased. After oxidation for 12 h, when 60% of the lysine residues were modified, the LDL failed to bind to the proteoglycans. Finally, AAPH-oxidized LDL, which contained 70% of free lysines, was applied to a chondroitin-6-sulfate affinity column, and the percentages of the free lysine residues in the bound and the unbound LDL fractions were found to be 72 and 64%, respectively. Thus, in the AAPH-oxidized, as in the copper-oxidized LDL preparations, the number of free lysine residues was higher in the bound fraction than in the fraction that failed to bind to the glycosaminoglycans. To obtain LDL oxidized in a more physiological way, LDL was incubated with mouse peritoneal macrophages for up to 12 h. At the indicated times, formation of TBARS and the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDL particles were determined (Fig. 3, left panels), and the degree of binding to proteoglycans was determined on the proteoglycan column (Fig. 3, right panels). As the incubation time increased, LDL was progressively oxidized, the degree of oxidation being comparable to that obtained with CuSO4 or AAPH. As in the previous experiments, the increasing extent of oxidation progressively decreased the amount of binding, so that after incubation with the macrophages for 12 h, when the production of TBARS had reached a value of about 10 nmol of MDA/mg of LDL protein, no LDL was bound to the proteoglycan column. Oxidation of LDL by lipoxygenases has recently received attention as a possible mode of oxidation in the arterial wall (17Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether lipoxygenase-mediated oxidation of LDL might play a role in the interaction of LDL with arterial proteoglycans, LDL was next oxidized with soybean lipoxygenase in buffer A containing 1.25 mmlinoleate-albumin. After oxidation for 18 h, the samples were chromatographed on an A-0.5m column (1 × 50 cm) to separate the linoleate-albumin from the LDL. Fractions containing LDL were pooled and concentrated, and their peroxide content, number of ε-amino groups, electrophoretic mobility, and degree of binding to proteoglycans were determined. As shown in Table I, soybean lipoxygenase oxidized LDL in the presence of linoleate-albumin. The peroxide content of the oxidized samples was similar to that observed with the other methods of oxidation. However, the changes in electrophoretic mobility were smaller and the differences in the degree of lysine modification less pronounced than with the other methods of oxidation, and, as expected, the amount of binding to proteoglycans was only slightly decreased.Table IOxidation of LDL with soybean lipoxygenaseLDLɛ-Amino groupsPeroxidesElectrophoretic mobilityLDL bound to proteoglycan column% of native LDLA365/50 μg of LDLrelative to LDL%Control LDL1000.051.192Lipoxygenase-treated LDL870.241.275After incubation for 18 h of [3H]CL-LDL (2.5 mg/ml) in buffer A containing 1.25 mm linoleate-albumin and 60 units/μl soybean lipoxygenase at 37"
https://openalex.org/W1984350319,"Ninjurin is a novel protein that is up-regulated after nerve injury both in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and in Schwann cells. We previously reported that ninjurin demonstrates properties of a homophilic adhesion molecule and promotes neurite outgrowth from primary cultured DRG neurons. We have now found that ninjurin is widely expressed in both adult and embryonic tissues, primarily in those of epithelial origin. Aggregation assays were used to demonstrate that ninjurin-mediated adhesion requires divalent cations and is an energy-dependent process. The critical domain for ninjurin-mediated homophilic adhesion was localized to an 11-residue region (between Pro26 and Asn37) by mutagenesis and by employing synthetic oligopeptides as competitive inhibitors of ninjurin-mediated adhesion. Of particular importance are the Trp residue at position 29 and the 3 arginines in the region. Furthermore, we show that the peptide which inhibits aggregation of Jurkat cells expressing ninjurin is also capable of blocking the ability of ninjurin to promote neurite extension from DRG neurons. Using FISH analysis, the ninjurin gene was localized to human chromosome 9q22. Several genetic diseases of unknown etiology have been mapped to this region, including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, self-healing squamous epithelioma, split-hand/foot deformity type 1, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy."

Smooth muscle cells were shown to express adenylyl cyclases types V and/or VI. Acetylcholine (ACh) stimulated the binding of [35S]GTPγS·Gα complexes in smooth muscle membranes to Gαq/11 and Gαi3 antibody. Binding to Gαq/11 antibody was inhibited by the m3receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP, and binding to Gαi3 antibody was inhibited by the m2 receptor antagonist,N,N′-bis[6[[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]amino]hexyl]-1,8-octanediamine tetrahydrochloride (methoctramine). The decrease in basal cAMP (35 ± 5%) induced by ACh in dispersed muscle cells was accentuated by 4-DAMP or Gβ antibody (55 ± 8 to 63 ± 6%). In contrast, methoctramine, pertussis toxin (PTx), or Gαi3 antibody converted the decrease in cAMP to increase above basal level (+28 ± 5 to +32 ± 6%); the increase in cAMP was abolished by 4-DAMP or Gβ antibody. In muscle cells where only m3 receptors were preserved by selective receptor protection, ACh caused only an increase in cAMP that was abolished by 4-DAMP. Conversely, in muscle cells where only m2 receptors were preserved, ACh caused an accentuated decrease in cAMP that was abolished by methoctramine or PTx. In conclusion, m2 receptors in smooth muscle couple to inhibition of adenylyl cyclases V/VI via Gαi3, and m3 receptors couple to activation of the enzymes via Gβγq/11.

Thus, inhibition induced by somatostatin (acting via sstr3) is mediated by Gi1 and Go (33Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and inhibition induced by opioid agonists (acting via μ, δ, and κ receptors) is mediated by Gi2 and Go (34Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar); inhibition induced by adenosine (acting via A1 receptors) is mediated by Gi3 but not by Go (35Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1172-1179PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation is inhibited in feedback fashion by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (36Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1175Google Scholar). Phorbol esters have no effect on basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation (37Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1102Google Scholar). However, inhibition of cAMP formation induced by agonists acting via Gi1 or Gi2 (but not Gi3) is partly reversed by concomitant activation of PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; 4-DAMP, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine; ACh, acetylcholine; methoctramine,N,N′-bis[6[[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]amino]hexyl]-1,8-octanediamine tetrahydrochloride; PTx, pertussis toxin; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.; the effect reflects selective PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Gαi1 and Gαi2 but not Gαi3 or Gαo (37Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1102Google Scholar). It is well established that the muscarinic receptors, m2and m4, are preferentially coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; the odd-numbered receptors, m1, m3, and m5, are preferentially coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis but, in some cells, can also increase the levels of cAMP (38Baumgold J.

The mechanisms responsible for the increase in cAMP are likely to reflect the type of adenylyl cyclase expressed in various cells. In cells expressing predominantly Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclases types I, III, and VIII, activation could result from Ca2+ mobilization and activation of PKC (43Suh B.-C. Kim K.-T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This, however, is unlikely in cells expressing predominantly Ca2+/calmodulin-insensitive types II and IV or in cells expressing types V and VI that are inhibited by physiological levels of Ca2+ (10Cooper D.M.F.

In the present study, we show that types V and/or VI, the isoforms of adenylyl cyclase expressed in smooth muscle cells, are inhibited by m2receptors via the α subunit of Gi3 and concurrently activated by m3 receptors via the βγ subunits of Gq/11. Muscle cells were isolated from the circular muscle layer of the rabbit stomach by successive enzymatic digestion, filtration, and centrifugation as described previously (31Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15977-15980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, muscle strips were incubated for 30 min at 31 °C in 15 ml of HEPES medium containing 0.1% collagenase (type II) and 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The composition of the medium was 120 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 2.6 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 14 mm glucose, and 2.1% Eagle's essential amino acid mixture. After washing, the tissues were re-incubated in the same medium for 30 min. The digested tissue was washed with enzyme-free medium, and the cells were allowed to disperse spontaneously for 30 min. Suspensions of single muscle cells were harvested by filtration through 500-μm Nitex mesh. The suspensions were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 350 × g. In experiments with G protein antibodies, the cells were permeabilized as described previously (31Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15977-15980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

The cells were centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min, washed free of saponin, and resuspended in the same medium. Radioligand binding to dispersed muscle cells was done as described previously (33Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Muscle cells were suspended in HEPES medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Triplicate aliquots (0.5 ml) of cell suspension (106 cells/ml) were incubated for 15 min with 1 nm [3H]scopolamine alone or in the presence of acetylcholine, methoctramine, or 4-DAMP. Bound and free radioligand were separated by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through 5-μm polycarbonate Nucleopore filters followed by repeated washing (4 times) with 3 ml of ice-cold HEPES medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was measured as the amount of radioactivity associated with the muscle cells in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ligand. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding (mean ± S.E. 33 ± 6%). IC50 values were calculated from competition curves using the P.fit program (Biosoft; Elsevier Publishing, Cambridge, UK). cAMP was measured in dispersed cells by radioimmunoassay as described previously (33Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (0.5 ml) containing 106 cells/ml were incubated with 0.1 μm acetylcholine, and the reaction was terminated after 60 s with 6% cold trichloroacetic acid (v/v). The mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was extracted three times with 2 ml of diethyl ether and lyophilized. The samples were reconstituted for radioimmunoassay in 500 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.2) and acetylated with triethylamine/acetic anhydride (3:1 v/v) for 30 min. cAMP was measured in duplicate using 100-μl aliquots and expressed as pmol/106 cells. A technique of selective receptor protection was used to determine the presence and function of m2 and m3 receptors. The technique was previously used to determine the co-existence and function of opioid μ, δ, and κ receptors (45Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G269-G276PubMed Google Scholar), 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptors (32Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), histamine H1 and H2 receptors (46Morini G. Kuemmerle J.F. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 598-603PubMed Google Scholar), and tachykinin NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors (47Hellstrom P.M. Murthy K.S. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 236-243PubMed Google Scholar). The technique involves protection of one receptor type with a selective agonist or antagonist followed by inactivation of all unprotected receptors by brief treatment with a low concentration ofN-ethylmaleimide. In the present study, the selective m2 receptor antagonist, methoctramine (10 nm), and m3 receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP (10 nm), were used in separate experiments to protect m2 and m3 receptors, respectively. Freshly dispersed muscle cells were incubated with one antagonist at 31 °C for 2 min followed by addition of 5 μm N-ethylmaleimide for 20 min. The cells were centrifuged twice at 150 × g for 10 min to eliminate the protective antagonist and N-ethylmaleimide and resuspended in fresh HEPES medium. The cAMP response of cells treated in this fashion was compared with the response of untreated (naive) cells. Previous studies have shown that the coupling of protected receptors to signaling pathways remains intact (32Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M.

Smooth muscle cells incubated with N-ethylmaleimide without protective ligand lost their ability to respond to receptor-linked agonists but retained their ability to respond to agents that bypass receptors (e.g. ionomycin, KCl, forskolin), implying that post-receptor mechanisms were intact (46Morini G.

Cell homogenates were prepared from dispersed gastric muscle cells and solubilized on ice for 1 h in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% sodium cholate. For control studies, homogenates were prepared from rat brain. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Solubilized membrane proteins (60–70 μg) were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation in 5% non-fat dry milk to block nonspecific antibody binding, the blots were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with antibodies to types II, III, and IV, and a common antibody to types V and VI, and then for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The bands were identified by enhanced chemiluminescence. G proteins selectively activated by acetylcholine were identified by the method of Okamoto et al. (48Okomoto T. Ikezu T. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ten ml of muscle cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES medium (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 15 min, the crude membranes were solubilized for 60 min at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES medium (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA, 240 mm NaCl, and 1% CHAPS. The membranes were incubated for various periods at 37 °C with 60 nm [35S]GTPγS in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped with 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl medium (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μm GTP, and the mixture was placed in wells pre-coated with specific G protein antibodies. After incubation for 2 h on ice, the wells were washed three times with phosphate buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the radioactivity from each well was counted. Coating with G protein antibodies (1:1000) was done after the wells were first coated with anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) for 2 h on ice. The selective m2 receptor antagonist, methoctramine, and m3 receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP, were used to identify the receptor subtype coupled to a given G protein. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. of n separate experiments and evaluated statistically using Student's t test for paired or unpaired values. 125I-cAMP, [3H]scopolamine, and [35S]GTPγS were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; HEPES was from Research Organics, Cleveland, OH; soybean trypsin inhibitor and collagenase (type II) were from Worthington; 4-DAMP, methoctramine,p-fluorohexahydro-siladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD) were from Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA;N-ethylmaleimide and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Antibodies to adenylyl cyclase types II, III, and IV, a common antibody to types V and VI, and antibody to Gβ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Pertussis toxin and antibodies to Gαq/11, Gαi1–2, Gαi3, Gαo, and Gαs and peptide fragments against which antibodies to Gαq/11(QLNLKEYNLV) and Gαi3 (KNNKECGLY) were raised were obtained from Calbiochem. The ability of these antibodies to block activation or inhibition of specific effector enzymes (phospholipase-β1, phospholipase-β3, nitric oxide synthase, adenylyl cyclase) has been demonstrated in recent studies (31Murthy K.S.

Studies of cloned muscarinic m3 and m2 receptors have established 4-DAMP (Kd 0.5 nm) and methoctramine (Kd 12 nm) as selective antagonists of m3 and m2 receptors, respectively (39Eglen R. Reddy H. Watson N. Chaliss R.A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 49Barlow R.B. Berry K.J. Glenton P.A.M. Nikolaou N.M. Soh K.S. Br. J.

Competition binding studies in dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells using [3H]scopolamine as radioligand confirmed the selectivity of the two antagonists. In muscle cells where only m3 receptors were preserved, [3H]scopolamine binding was preferentially inhibited by 4-DAMP (IC500.4 ± 0.1 nm) with a potency 104 greater than that of methoctramine (IC50 4 ± 1 μm) (Fig. 1). Conversely, in muscle cells where only m2 receptors were preserved, [3H]scopolamine binding was preferentially inhibited by methoctramine (IC50 8 ± 3 nm) with a potency 2 × 103 greater than that of 4-DAMP (IC50 15 ± 4 μm). The affinities of 4-DAMP and methoctramine in cells where only one native receptor type was preserved matched closely those obtained with cloned m2and m3 receptors. Schild analysis of the relative potencies of the two antagonists in inhibiting acetylcholine-induced contraction confirmed that 4-DAMP was about 6 × 103-fold more potent than methoctramine as an antagonist of m3 receptors that mediate contraction. Contraction in dispersed muscle cells was measured by scanning micrometry as described previously (33Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle cells in which only m2 receptors were preserved lost the ability to contract in response to acetylcholine, whereas muscle cells in which only m3 receptors were preserved retained fully their ability to contract (EC50 0.4 nm in muscle cells expressing one or both receptor types). The concentration of acetylcholine that elicited maximal contraction (0.1 μm) abolished [3H]scopolamine binding. The radioligand binding and pharmacological studies in dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells confirmed the selectivity of the antagonists and the validity of the receptor protection technique. Western blot analysis of homogenates derived from dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells using antibodies to adenylyl cyclase type II, type III, type IV, and a common antibody to types V and VI disclosed the presence of type V and/or type VI only (Fig. 2). In contrast, homogenates from rat brain disclosed the presence of types II, III, IV, and V/VI (Fig. 2). The selective expression of types V and/or type VI in smooth muscle conforms to the predominant expression of these two types in peripheral tissues (8Iyengar R.

https://openalex.org/W2084033845,"Echovirus 22 (EV22) is a picornavirus forming a distinct molecular cluster together with echovirus 23. EV22 has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide motif in its capsid protein VP1; similar motifs are known to mediate many cell-cell and microbe-host interactions. To identify peptide sequences that specifically bind to EV22 and potentially play a role in receptor recognition, we have used here peptide libraries displayed in filamentous phage. We isolated an EV22-binding motif CLRSG(R/F)GC. The synthetic CLRSGRGC peptide was able to inhibit EV22 infection. The infection was also inhibited by an RGD-containing peptide representing the C terminus of the EV22 capsid protein VP1 and CWDDGWLC (an RGD-binding peptide; Pasqualini, R., Koivunen, E., and Ruoslahti, E. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 130, 1189–1196). As the EV22-recognizing sequence LRSG is found in the integrin β1 chain and the entire LRSGRG hexapeptide occurs in the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), we carried out blocking experiments with anti-integrin and anti-MMP-9 antibodies. EV22 infection could be blocked in cell cultures with anti-αv, -β1, and, to a lesser extent, with anti-MMP-9 antibodies. These results imply that EV22 recognizes preferentially αvβ1-integrin as a cellular receptor and MMP-9 may also play a role in the cell-surface interactions of the virus.

Picornaviruses are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that include several pathogens of man and animals, and their medical and economic importance has stimulated considerable research activity. These viruses have a single-stranded mRNA genome, between about 7 and 8.5 kilobases in length, surrounded by an icosahedral capsid consisting of 60 copies of four structural proteins VP1–VP4 (for a review, see Ref. 2Stanway G. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2483-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); however, in EV22 the maturation cleavage between VP2 and VP4 does not seem to occur (3Stanway G. Kalkkinen N. Roivainen M. Ghazi F. Khan M. Smyth M. Meurman O. Hyypiä T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8232-8238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EV22 is known to cause both diarrhea and respiratory infections, and occasionally the infection is complicated by the involvement of the central nervous system (4Ehrnst A. Eriksson M. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 25: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). EV22 infection is common in childhood and more than 85% of young adults have EV22 antibodies. 2P. Joki-Korpela and T.

Such an RGD motif is involved in multiple biological recognition reactions; in particular, the cellular matrix proteins vitronectin and fibronectin use their RGD sequence in binding to cell-surface receptors known as integrins (for reviews, see Refs. 5Ruoslahti E.

Integrins that recognize the RGD motif include α5β1, αIIbβ3, αvβ1, αvβ3, and αvβ5subunit combinations.

During the past few years, several other picornavirus receptors, in addition to those recognized by CAV9, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and EV22, have been identified. The cellular receptor of the major group of rhinoviruses is the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (14Staunton D.E. Merluzzi V.J. Rothlein R. Barton R. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Furthermore, it has been reported that the integrin α2β1 (VLA-2) acts as a cellular receptor for EV1 (17Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W.

At least six EV serotypes (subtypes 6, 7, 11, 12, 20, and 21) and three coxsackie-B viruses (subtypes 1, 3, and 5; Refs. 21Bergelson J.M. Mohanty J.G. Crowell R.L. St. John N.F. Lublin D.M.

A polypeptide belonging to the nucleolin family is also involved in coxsackie-B viruses cell-surface interactions (23De Verdugo U.R. Selinka H.-C. Huber M. Kramer B. Kellerman J. Hofschneider P.H. Kandolf R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6751-6757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported previously that CAV9 can compete with the binding of EV22 to green monkey kidney cells (9Roivainen M. Piirainen L. Hovi T. Virtanen I. Riikonen T. Heino J. Hyypiä T. Virology. 1994; 203: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This suggests that EV22 and CAV9 may share a common cellular receptor. The aim of the present study was to illustrate further the interactions of these RGD-containing human picornaviruses with the host-cell membrane proteins and to identify receptors interacting with the viruses. For this purpose, the technique of affinity selection of virus-binding peptides from a phage display random peptide library was applied. We have isolated peptide motifs that suggest the involvement of integrins and also, quite unexpectedly, of a proteolytic enzyme MMP-9 in the cellular entry of EV22. A549, a human lung carcinoma cell line (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, ATCC), was used for EV22 (1Hyypiä T. Horsnell C. Maaronen M. Khan M. Kalkkinen N. Auvinen P. Kinnunen L. Stanway G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) propagation and plaque tests, and LLC-Mk2cells (ATCC) were used to grow CAV9 (strain Griggs; ATCC). The viruses were purified in sucrose gradients as described previously (24Abraham G. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 340-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used a combination of phage libraries containing 5–9 amino acid long cyclic peptides inserted in the pIII capsid protein in the M13 phage. The libraries were constructed using the fuse5 vector (25Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) as described earlier (26Koivunen E. Wang B. Dickinson G.D. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 346-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J.

In the first round of biopanning, the purified EV22 or CAV9 was used at a concentration of 5 μg per well in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mmMgCl2 and incubated overnight at 4 °C in microtiter wells. The wells were then saturated with the blocking solution (0.1m NaHCO3, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 h at 4 °C. Prior to panning with the virus, the phages were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in BSA-coated wells in 500 μl of Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.5 mm MgCl2. The phage solution was then transferred to the virus-coated wells, and after incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the unbound phages were removed by washing 10 times with the Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. The bound phages were eluted with 400 μl of 0.1 m HCl (pH 2.2, adjusted with glycine) in the presence of 1 mg/ml BSA. After the elution, pH was neutralized with 75 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl. The eluted phages were amplified using K91kan bacteria and purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol as described earlier (25Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). After amplification, the panning procedure was repeated twice as described above with the exception that the wells were coated with 1 μg of the purified virus. Phage DNA was purified (25Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and sequenced using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Peptide sequences found in the phages were compared against protein sequences in the SwissProt data base using the FASTA program (29Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. CLRSGRGC was reduced and alkylated essentially as described (30Koivunen E. Gay D.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20205-20210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The following antibodies were used in the virus blocking experiments: the monoclonal antibodies included anti-αv L230 (ATCC), anti-α5 P1D6 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and anti-β3 90BB10 B7 (kindly provided by Prof. Ismo Virtanen, Department of Anatomy, University of Helsinki). Anti-MMP-9 (Ref. 31Kjeldsen L. Johnsen A.H. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10425-10432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. Timo Sorsa, Department of Periodontology, University of Helsinki) and anti-β1 R322 (a gift from Dr. Jyrki Heino, MediCity Research Laboratory, University of Turku) were polyclonal rabbit antisera. The A549 cells were grown as a monolayer in 3.5-cm diameter wells (8Roivainen M. Hyypiä T. Piirainen L. Kalkkinen N. Stanway G. Hovi T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (h-Hanks), and 50 μl of antibodies or peptides (dilutions made in h-Hanks, containing 0.6% fetal calf serum) was added on the cells and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Fifty μl (approximately 100 plaque-forming units) of EV22 or CAV9 dilution (made in h-Hanks, 0.6% fetal calf serum, containing the corresponding antibody or peptide) was added onto the cells and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The virus solution in the plates was replaced with 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose in the culture medium, and the incubation was continued for 48 h in a CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C. Prior to counting the number of the virus plaques, the cells were stained for 5 min with crystal violet solution (0.25% crystal violet, 2% formaline, 10% ethanol, 0.5% CaCl2, 35 mmTris). EV22- and CAV9-binding peptides were selected from phage display peptide libraries containing random peptides from five to nine amino acids, each peptide flanked by cysteine residues. Microtiter wells were coated with the purified viruses, and the phages exhibiting binding activity to the virus were selected by a biopanning protocol. After three cycles of panning in EV22-coated wells, 170 times more phages could be eluted from the virus-coated wells than from those coated with BSA (control wells). Seventeen phage plaques were selected for further sequence analysis. Twelve of them carried the cyclic peptide CLRSGRGC, and five phages had the CLRSGFGC sequence (Table II). After three rounds of panning in CAV9-coated wells, approximately five times more phage were eluted from the wells containing the virus than from the control wells. Fifteen of the CAV9-binding phages were sequenced. Eleven had a sequence CVWDWGDC, two contained CVWDLGRC, and two CVWDQGIC sequence (Table II). Although the phage libraries used in the study contained peptides of different length, all the sequenced phage carried a hexapeptide. This suggests that the cyclic hexapeptide motifs bind more tightly to the viruses than other peptides in the libraries.Table IISelection of peptides binding to EV22 and CAV9 from the phage display libraryEV22 binding peptidesCAV9 binding peptidesCLRSGRGC (12)CVWDWGDC (11)CLRSGFGC (5)CVWDLGRC (2)CVWDQGIC (2)The phage were selected using wells coated with purified EV22 or CAV9.

The consensus sequences LRSG (EV22) and VWD (CAV9) were compared against the sequences in the SwissProt data bank (Table III). Since it is known that integrins α5β1 and αvβ1 recognize the RGD sequence in fibronectin (32Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar), it is notable that, for instance, the β1 integrin subunit also shares the sequence LRSG in its extracellular domain (33Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A complete identity with the LRSGRG peptide was found in the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9; Ref. 34Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that MMP-2 is colocalized with integrin αvβ3 on the cell surface of invasive cells (35Brooks P.C. Strömblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A.

Open table in a new tab The sequence source was the SwissProt database, FASTA program was used for the sequence homology analysis. The amino acids identical to those found in the phage sequences are shown in bold. Among the VWD-containing proteins is integrin β5 subunit which contains a VWDQ sequence in its extracellular domain; integrin αvβ5 recognizes the RGD sequence in vitronectin (32Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). To study further the functional role of selected virus-binding peptides in the cell-surface interactions of EV22 and CAV9, the capability of synthetic peptides to block the infection was assayed. An RGD-containing peptide representing the C terminus of EV22 VP1 polypeptide (SRALRGDMANLTNQ) and an RGD-binding peptide (CWDDGWLC; Ref. 36Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) were also used in the blocking experiments. The results of these experiments, obtained by the plaque tests, are shown in Fig. 1. The C-terminal EV22 VP1 peptide and the cyclic CLRSGRGC peptide blocked EV22 infection at a concentration of 0.1 mm, whereas the control peptide (NGKKKNWKKIM, the N terminus of EV22 VP3) did not interfere with the initiation of infection at this concentration. The activity of CLRSGRGC was lost after reduction and alkylation of the cysteines (not shown). At a concentration of 1 mm, the RGD-recognizing CWDDGWLC peptide blocked the infection, whereas at lower concentrations the effect disappeared. The peptide found in the CAV9-binding phages (CVWDWGDC) had no effect on the EV22 growth. For comparison, blocking experiments with the peptides were also studied in CAV9 infection. Only the RGD-containing peptide blocked the infectivity of this virus. The blocking effect at a peptide concentration of 0.1 mm was even 40% higher, when compared with the EV22 blocking activity. None of the other peptides significantly inhibited CAV9 infection. Since the consensus sequence LRSG (found in the EV22-binding phage) is present in the integrin β1 subunit and in MMP-9, we carried out blocking experiments using anti-integrin and anti-MMP-9 antibodies (Fig. 2 A). The monoclonal anti-αv antibody and polyclonal serum recognizing the β1 integrin subunit exhibited blocking of the EV22 infection at high dilutions (1:1000), whereas the monoclonal anti-β3 antibody had some effect on the virus growth only at a dilution of 1:10. The polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody inhibited EV22 infection but to a lesser extent than the anti-αvand -β1 antibodies. The monoclonal anti-α5antibody used had no effect on the virus growth at any dilution. The inhibitory effect of the antibodies was also studied in CAV9 infection (Fig. 2 B). CAV9 infection was blocked with the anti-αv and -β1 antibodies (30 and 60% inhibition, respectively) at dilutions of 1:100. The anti-β3 antibody also blocked the virus infection at the same dilution, although the effect was significantly lower. Some blocking of CAV9 infection was also seen with the anti-MMP-9 antibody, but the effect vanished at the antibody dilution of 1:100. As in the case of EV22, the anti-α5 antibody had no effect on the initiation of the growth cycle of CAV9. In this study we have applied an approach based on phage display peptide libraries to elucidate cell-surface interactions of EV22. We demonstrate that EV22 infection can be blocked with (i) the CLRSGRGC peptide found in the EV22-binding phages, (ii) an RGD-containing peptide representing the C terminus of EV22 capsid protein VP1, and (iii) an RGD-binding peptide (36Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The LRSG consensus sequence, found in the EV22 binding phages, is present in the extracellular domain of integrin β1 subunit. Integrins αvβ1 and α5β1are known to bind to the RGD sequence (32Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence found in the EV22-binding phages is also identical to the sequence in the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). To illuminate further the role of integrins and MMP-9 in the cell-surface interactions of EV22, we carried out blocking experiments with anti-integrin and anti-MMP-9 antibodies. The monoclonal αv antibody and polyclonal β1 antiserum clearly inhibited the infection, whereas the anti-β3antibody had a blocking effect only at high concentrations. Furthermore, anti-MMP-9 antibody also inhibited EV22 infection, although less efficiently. These results suggest that integrin αvβ1 acts preferentially as a cellular receptor for EV22 and MMP-9 may also be involved in the receptor interactions of the virus. CAV9-binding peptides were also selected from the phage display library, and blocking experiments were performed. Only the RGD-containing peptide clearly blocked the virus infection. Because the sequence (VWDQ) found in the CAV9 binding phage is present in the integrin β5 chain, we carried out virus blocking tests with a monoclonal anti-αvβ5 antibody, but it had no effect on the virus growth (data not shown). However, the CAV9 infection was blocked by the anti-αv monoclonal antibody and rabbit antiserum recognizing the β1 subunit. It is possible that the peptide identified by the phage display library and the RGD-recognizing peptide both bind the RGD-containing motif in CAV9, but this interaction does not necessarily block infectivity. This phenomenon has also been observed in experiments where the motif has been deleted by trypsin treatment (8Roivainen M. Hyypiä T. Piirainen L. Kalkkinen N. Stanway G. Hovi T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by mutation (10Hughes P.J. Horsnell C. Hyypiä T. Stanway G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8035-8040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-β3 integrin subunit as well as the anti-MMP-9 antibody also had a blocking effect but only when used at the higher concentrations. Previously published data support the idea that at least αvβ3 integrin plays a role in the cell-surface interactions of CAV9 (9Roivainen M. Piirainen L. Hovi T. Virtanen I. Riikonen T. Heino J. Hyypiä T. Virology. 1994; 203: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The blocking experiments suggest that EV22 may bind to the αvβ1 integrin with the RGD-containing C terminus of capsid protein VP1. In addition, our results indicate that at least one of the virus-binding sites is evidently located in the region of amino acids 103–106 (LRSG) in the β1 chain. This site is located near the I domain, a region in the β1 subunit that is known to participate in the binding to the ligand (37Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the results do not reveal how the αv chain is involved in the virus-receptor interactions. One possibility is that in the experimental conditions the anti-αv antibody binds to the αv subunit in such a manner that sterically blocks the binding of EV22 to the β1 chain. Our results raise the possibility that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is involved in the cell-surface interactions of EV22 because the infection could be inhibited by the CLRSGRGC peptide and by anti-MMP-9 antibody. The LRSGRG sequence is present in the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-9 which has been shown to be important for the ability of the protein to dimerize (38Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also independently isolated the LRSGXG motif (where X is preferentially arginine) during panning on purified MMP-9 using the same phage libraries described here. 3E. Koivunen, H. Valtanen, A. Rainsalo, C. Kantor, C. G. Gahmberg, T. Salo, Y. T. Konttinen, and T. Sorsa, submitted for publication. These results suggest that the LRSGRG sequence could be involved in the dimerization of MMP-9, and EV22 may be able to bind MMP-9 through the dimer interface. It has been shown recently that matrix metalloproteinase 2 interacts with integrin αvβ3 on the cell surface (35Brooks P.C. Strömblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), and the integrin can simultaneously bind to proteolyzed collagen fragments. The αvβ1 integrin could also interact with MMP-9, and the complex might then be involved in the internalization of EV22. Alternatively, EV22 could separately interact with either αvβ1 or MMP-9. Three human picornaviruses (CAV9, EV22, and EV23) have a functional RGD motif; in addition, foot-and-mouth disease virus interacts with the αvβ3 integrin using the viral RGD sequence (11Fox G. Parry N.R. Barnett P.V. McGinn B. Rowlands D. Brown F. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 39Berinstein A. Roivainen M. Hovi T. Mason P.W. Baxt B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2664-2666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the three human viruses, the motif is located at the C terminus of the capsid polypeptide VP1. In CAV9, this region can be deleted by trypsin treatment (8Roivainen M. Hyypiä T. Piirainen L. Kalkkinen N. Stanway G. Hovi T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the RGD motif mutated (10Hughes P.J. Horsnell C. Hyypiä T. Stanway G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8035-8040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without complete loss of infectivity indicating that the virus can use alternative pathways in its entry into the host cell. The processing of the C-terminal extension of CAV9 VP1 by proteolytic enzymes may have implications in the pathogenicity because during the infection in the gut the virus is prone to the action of intestinal proteases. Whether destruction of the RGD motif in EV22 abolishes the infectivity is, however, currently unknown. EV22 and CAV9 compete for cell-surface binding, and the latter is known to interact with the vitronectin receptor (αvβ3-integrin; Ref. 9Roivainen M. Piirainen L. Hovi T. Virtanen I. Riikonen T. Heino J. Hyypiä T. Virology. 1994; 203: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This observation, suggesting that EV22 would also utilize an RGD-recognizing integrin on the cell surface, is strongly supported by our findings that peptides interacting specifically with the virus share sequence homology with the integrin β1-subunit, and the infection is blocked by β1-antibodies. Although CAV9 and EV22 exhibit similarities in the cell-surface recognition mechanisms, there are also clear differences. A monoclonal antibody that is able to block the infection caused by typical echoviruses (excluding serotypes 22 and 23) and CAV9 is unable to inhibit EV22 infectivity (40Mbida A.D. Pozzetto F. Grattard F. Gaudin O.D. Res. Virol. 1992; 143: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional receptor activities can also be important and may be crucial in the determination of tissue tropism and pathogenesis of these viruses. Due to the possibility of rapidly selecting large numbers of peptides that recognize target molecules, the phage display peptide libraries represent a powerful approach in detailed studies of virus-cell interactions.

In our study, we used the phage peptide library to investigate the receptor interactions of EV22 and CAV9. Although the EV22 peptides obtained by using the phage display technique blocked the infectivity of the virus, the peptides identified in a similar manner by using CAV9 as a target did not inhibit the growth cycle of CAV9. This can be explained either by inefficient binding of the latter peptides or by the differences in cell-surface recognition mechanisms of these two viruses; the RGD-mediated attachment may be the major mechanism in EV22, whereas CAV9 is able to use alternative pathways in its entry as already shown by mutation analysis of the RGD-containing region in CAV9 (10Hughes P.J.

In some situations its activity is controlled by complex interactions with other cell surface components (1Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

However, in contrast to TGF-βRII and the cell surface proteoglycan also termed TGF-βRIII or betaglycan, expression of TGF-βRI is maintained on differentiated bone cells (4Centrella M. Casinghino S. Kim J. Pham T. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, and because little is known about the molecular control of TGF-βRI expression, we cloned the rat TGF-βRI promoter and characterized several of its functional aspects in cultures of primary and continuous skeletal and nonskeletal cells derived from fetal rats. The rat TGF-βRI promoter lacks a typical TATA box, but initiates transcription at multiple sites within a 220-bp span upstream of the initial methionine codon in differentiated bone cells. The 3′-terminal 300-bp sequence encompassing this region contains a GC-rich CpG island, seven consensus Sp1 binding sites, and two CCAAT boxes. Transfection studies using different fragments of TGF-βRI promoter cloned upstream of the reporter gene luciferase demonstrated maximal activity by a 1.0-kb fragment that encompassed these and other possible cis-acting elements. Importantly, several dispersed elements appeared to cooperate for maximal reporter gene expression in osteoblast-enriched cultures (5Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Coincident with this work, the human TGF-βRI promoter was cloned, and its sequence reveals a similar organization with identically spaced CCAAT box motifs (6Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.-P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).These features suggested that the TGF-βRI gene is driven by a constitutively active promoter that maintains expression of TGF-βRI in many cells. Nevertheless, this promoter is partly unusual to the extent that other promoters organized in a similar way tend to lack CCAAT box sequences. Imposed on this are our previous observations that the proportions of TGF-βRI mRNA and protein may vary with the osteoblast phenotype and that its levels are rapidly controlled by certain stimulatory and inhibitory bone growth regulators (4Centrella M.

Centrella, unpublished results. Therefore, the widespread expression of TGF-βRI, driven by a constitutively active promoter, may in some instances be regulated by othercis-acting regulatory elements.In the present study we investigated in more detail sequences within the TGF-βRI promoter that are required for maximal and basal activity. We examined the importance of two CCAAT boxes and various consensus and putative binding sites for Sp1 transcription factor family members that occur in this region and identified the presence of PEBP2/CBFα binding sites. Our results identify that some of elements are not used under basal conditions, some appear to be essential components of constitutive TGF-βRI gene expression, and yet others may help to determine phenotype-dependent TGF-βRI expression by differentiated bone cells.DISCUSSIONThe rat TGF-βRI promoter contains a variety ofcis-acting elements that could contribute to constitutive or conditional expression. By transfecting reporter gene constructs into osteoblast-enriched cultures, we previously defined regions within the TGF-βRI promoter that are associated with maximal and basal activity. To understand TGF-βRI gene expression in more detail, we have now defined certain important transcription factor binding sites that may control basal promoter activity in many cells.Similar to various growth factor receptor promoters, the TGF-βRI promoter lacks TATA box sequence but contains a GC-enriched so-called CpG island (22Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 23Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) with many transcription factor Sp1 binding sites. Analogous to the human TGF-βRI promoter (6Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.-P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), CCAAT box-like sequences that occur in this region make them unlike promoters for many other growth factors or growth factor receptors (24Ishii S.

Nonetheless, oligonucleotides spanning the CCAAT box sites do not bind detectable levels of nuclear protein, and reporter gene expression was not reduced when these sites were disrupted. Therefore, flanking sequences or the association of other transcription elements in nearby areas may limit the contribution of the CCAAT boxes to TGF-βRI expression under the conditions that we have examined so far.Unlike genes controlled by CCAAT box and TATA box elements, rat TGF-βRI mRNA transcription initiates from multiple locations, characteristic of a constitutively expressed gene controlled by an Sp1-dependent promoter (5Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Although deletions that included various Sp1 binding sites invariably limited TGF-βRI promoter activity, some of these elements, clustered within a 0.3-kb sequence at the 3′ end of the promoter, appeared more essential than others. By gel shift and immunodetection assays, we determined that these regions associated to equivalent extents with either Sp1 or with the closely related transcription factor Sp3, also present in the rat cell nuclear extracts that we examined. This result is consistent with the similar structural features, conservation of DNA binding domains, and similar abilities of both Sp1 family members factors to recognize specific cis-acting elements with identical affinities (13Hagen G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We detected two complexes reactive with antibody specific for Sp3 by gel shift analysis consistent with earlier reports (14Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Majello B. DeLuca P. Suske G. Lania L.

Furthermore, whereas TGF-βRI and its mRNA levels vary by relation to other TGF-β receptors on various bone- and skin-derived cells, we did not find changes in the amounts of Sp1 or the ratio of Sp1 to Sp3 that could account for those differences in the various cell types, or in osteoblast-enriched cultures at various stages of differentiation. Consequently, in the basal state, constitutively low levels of TGF-βRI expression may be tempered by the presence of both Sp1 and Sp3.In other situations the proportions of Sp1 and Sp3 may change, or other cellular proteins may modify their function. For example, Sp1 forms heteromeric complexes with several cellular proteins. p107, a member of the retinoblastoma family of proteins, binds Sp1 and represses Sp1-dependent transcription, whereas retinoblastoma itself has been reported to interact with Sp1 and Sp3. Furthermore, p107 and retinoblastoma may complex with E2F, with cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases. Sp1 also interacts with the RelA subunit of transcription factor NF-κB, and the cellular protein YY1 (36Datta P.K. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, several conditions may arise that could account for variations in Sp1 activity, and its ability to drive TGF-βRI gene expression during the cell cycle, in various cell lineages, or in cell phenotype development.Overall, our studies support a crucial role for several sequences throughout the TGF-βRI promoter that contain Sp1 binding sites. Deletion of 5′ upstream sequences, reducing the promoter region to 0.7 kb, decreases its activity by 40–60%. Elimination of either another 0.4 kb from the 5′ end or an internal downstream sequence further suppresses promoter function. However, elimination of 0.1 kb of sequence from the 3′ end, a region that itself directs only moderate reporter gene expression, potently suppresses the activity of longer promoter fragments that still retain multiple Sp1 binding sites. Therefore, several regions can contribute to optimal TGF-βRI gene expression, although sequence information within the 0.1-kb 3′ span is essential for basal promoter activity. Using several overlapping oligonucleotides spanning this region, we located a specific sequence where substitution by two nucleotides completely eliminated Sp1 binding and suppressed reporter gene expression from a minimal promoter fragment. These results confirm the importance of multiple Sp1 sites throughout the TGF-βRI promoter and establish that one downstream site at position −63 to −54, ∼90% homologous to consensus Sp1 binding sites, contributes heavily to basal promoter activity. This finding is analogous results with the TGF-α promoter, where several related but nonconsensus Sp1 binding sites are also required for optimal promoter activity (41Chen X. Wright K.L. Berkowitz E.A. Azizkhan J.C. Ting J.P. Lee D.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3179-3187PubMed Google Scholar). It is difficult to compare our results directly with those for the human TGF-βRI promoter. Even the longest construct used to assess the human promoter region reached upstream only as far as 0.7 kb and, most importantly, did not contain the 3′ 109-bp sequence where we detect an essential Sp1 site (6Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.-P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, at least two regulatory sites, including the important downstream Sp1 binding site (numbered −80 to −71 in the human promoter), have not yet been assessed for their effect on gene expression driven by the human TGF-βRI promoter.Within the 3′-terminal 0.1-kb region of the TGF-βRI promoter, we also found a related binding site for members of the PEBP2/CBFα transcription factor family. PEBP2/CBFα family members (also termed polyoma virus enhancer binding protein 2, or PEBP2α; and acute myelogenous leukemia factors; Refs. 19Ito Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 122: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Hiebert S.W. Downing J.R. Lenny N. Meyers S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 221: 253-258Google Scholar, 21Wang S. Speck N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our studies with the TGF-βRI have now identified a new target for PEBP2/CBFα activity beyond the virus-infected or immunological tissues where their identity was first established (19Ito Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 122: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of a PEBP2/CBFα-related element in this downstream region of the TGF-βRI promoter may account in part for the high level of TGF-βRI mRNA and protein expression and promoter activity by differentiated osteoblasts (4Centrella M. Casinghino S. Kim J. Pham T. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), imposed upon the constitutive levels regulated by Sp1 and other basal elements. We are continuing to characterize this and several other even more potent PEBP2/CBFα binding sites further upstream (see Fig. 1) to identify the osteoblast-enriched PEBP2/CBFα family members that bind to these sequences and to examine variations in PEBP2/CBFα expression during osteoblast differentiation.2,3In addition to the Sp1 and PEBP2/CBFα-related complexes, others designated as band U also form with an oligonucleotide from this important 3′-terminal control region. This sequence contains elements for two other transcriptional regulators, HNF-5 and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). By relative migration, the slower migrating band presently seems inconsistent with a complex containing theMr of transcription factor HNF-5. It also seems unlikely to be accounted for by Hsp70 because of the basal growth conditions of our studies and the presence of another possible Hsp70 site in oligonucleotide SX1 that does not exhibit the same complex. However, it may represent a complex containing a basal transcription factor of the TFII family. TFII-related proteins are commonly involved in the expression of many genes transcribed by polymerase II, although the TGF-βRI promoter lacks a TATA box where these agents customarily bind (5Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.-P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our studies demonstrate that basal gene expression from the TGF-βRI promoter relies heavily on several Sp1 binding sites. One of these cis-acting elements, which occurs far downstream, appears essential for optimal TGF-βRI promoter activity. However, the effectiveness of these sites may be modified by other negative or positive transcription regulators whose expression may vary with cell phenotype or with other extracellular circumstances. These and other differences may account for changes in TGF-βRI levels and therefore sensitivity to this important growth regulator during development, differentiation, or hormonal control in skeletal tissue (4Centrella M.

Initial TGF-βRI promoter activity studies substantiate that osteoblast-related variations in steady state mRNA levels are controlled at least in part at the level of gene transcription (4Centrella M.

In the present study we investigated in more detail sequences within the TGF-βRI promoter that are required for maximal and basal activity. We examined the importance of two CCAAT boxes and various consensus and putative binding sites for Sp1 transcription factor family members that occur in this region and identified the presence of PEBP2/CBFα binding sites. Our results identify that some of elements are not used under basal conditions, some appear to be essential components of constitutive TGF-βRI gene expression, and yet others may help to determine phenotype-dependent TGF-βRI expression by differentiated bone cells. DISCUSSIONThe rat TGF-βRI promoter contains a variety ofcis-acting elements that could contribute to constitutive or conditional expression. By transfecting reporter gene constructs into osteoblast-enriched cultures, we previously defined regions within the TGF-βRI promoter that are associated with maximal and basal activity. To understand TGF-βRI gene expression in more detail, we have now defined certain important transcription factor binding sites that may control basal promoter activity in many cells.Similar to various growth factor receptor promoters, the TGF-βRI promoter lacks TATA box sequence but contains a GC-enriched so-called CpG island (22Gardiner-Garden M.

Nonetheless, oligonucleotides spanning the CCAAT box sites do not bind detectable levels of nuclear protein, and reporter gene expression was not reduced when these sites were disrupted. Therefore, flanking sequences or the association of other transcription elements in nearby areas may limit the contribution of the CCAAT boxes to TGF-βRI expression under the conditions that we have examined so far.Unlike genes controlled by CCAAT box and TATA box elements, rat TGF-βRI mRNA transcription initiates from multiple locations, characteristic of a constitutively expressed gene controlled by an Sp1-dependent promoter (5Ji C.

When 6-[N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl-DH-Cer (C6-NBD-DH-Cer) was incubated with HT29, NRK, BHK, or HL-60 cells, it was efficiently converted to dihydrosphingomyelin and dihydroglucosylceramide, and a number of other sphingolipids, with the nature of the products depending on the cell line. In addition, complex sphingolipids were formed that contained a desaturated (sphingosine) backbone, indicating that DH-Cer (and/or its metabolites) were substrates for the desaturase(s) that introduce the 4,5-trans double bond. Based on the kinetics and inhibitor studies, double bond addition did not appear to occur with the complex sphingolipids directly, but rather, during turnover and resynthesis. The conversion of C6-NBD-DH-Cer to more complex sphingolipids was highly stereoselective for the naturald,erythro isomer of C6-NBD-DH-Cer. Interestingly, the stereochemistry of the sphingoid base backbone also affected the localization of fluorescent sphingolipids: thed,erythro species appeared in the Golgi apparatus, whereas other stereo-isomers accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to C6-NBD-Cer and C6-NBD-DH-Cer, C6-NBD-4-d-hydroxy-DH-Cer gave rise to formation of complex sphingolipids and localized at the Golgi apparatus. These studies indicate that dihydroceramide is used as the initial backbone of complex (glyco)sphingolipids, perhaps to avoid build up of ceramide as an intermediate since this is such a potent bioactive compound.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mathias S. Kolesnick R. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 65-90PubMed Google Scholar). For most of these biological activities, ceramide appears to require a “desaturated” sphingoid base backbone (sphingosine; Ref. 3Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about introduction of the 4-transdouble bond into the sphingoid base backbone during de novobiosynthesis of sphingolipids or about the fate of dihydroceramide (DH-Cer) of complex sphingolipids when they are turned over. The latter is particularly relevant given the fact that Cer-mediated signal transduction involves hydrolysis of more complex sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin (SM). Ceramide synthesis begins with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase to form 3-ketosphinganine, which is subsequently reduced to sphinganine. The addition of an amide-linked fatty acid by ceramide synthase yields DH-Cer (4Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of the 4-trans double bond to form Cer has been demonstrated to occur after the synthesis of DH-Cer (4Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rother J. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The initial steps up to the formation of DH-Cer have been shown to take place at the cytosolic surface of the ER (6Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, the biosynthesis of SM (8Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer; Refs. 9Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and 10Trinchera M. Fabbri M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20907-20912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from Cer occurs at the (early) Golgi apparatus. Thus, similar to glycoprotein processing, most (glyco)sphingolipid biosynthesis appears to be coupled to vectorial transport through the ER/Golgi system. Since GlcCer is synthesized at the cytosolic surface of the Golgi membrane (9Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.J.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Coste H. Martel M.B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), one can envision that Cer, after synthesis at the cytosolic surface of the ER, is transferred to the cytosolic surface of the Golgi, where it can be used as a substrate for GlcCer synthesis. In addition, a fraction of the Cer must be translocated at the Golgi to reach the luminal leaflet for SM biosynthesis (13Hoekstra D. Kok J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to clarify the metabolic pathways for conversion of DH-Cer to Cer and more complex sphingolipids, as well as their intracellular localization and transport. For this purpose, we made use of a fluorescent analog of DH-Cer, 6-[N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl-dihydroceramide (C6-NBD-DH-Cer) in analogy to C6-NBD-Cer (14Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,15Pagano R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 29: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which after insertion into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane undergoes transbilayer movement and diffusion into the cell interior, where it integrates into the membranes of various organelles (16Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The major part of the intracellular C6-NBD-Cer pool is located at the ER, by virtue of its large membrane surface, but during prolonged incubation of the cells at 37 °C, becomes concentrated in the Golgi apparatus (16Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the Golgi, conversion of C6-NBD-Cer to C6-NBD-SM and C6-NBD-glycolipids takes place, that subsequently find their way to the plasma membrane (16Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), at least in part via a vesicular transport system (18Babia T. Kok J.W. van der Haar M. Kalicharan R. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known how (C6-NBD-)Cer is translocated from the ER to the Golgi, whether by co-transport with proteins in vesicular shuttles or by (protein-mediated) transport through the cytosol. The results of our studies show that the incorporation of C6-NBD-DH-Cer into more complex sphingolipids can occur prior to addition of the 4-trans double bond; furthermore, the structural requirements for metabolism and intracellular localization of fluorescent sphingolipids at the Golgi apparatus are highly correlated. The absence of the 4-trans double bond (C6-NBD-DH-Cer) or the presence of an -OH group at the C4 position of the sphingoid backbone (C6-NBD-4-d-hydroxy-DH-Cer) did not interfere with biosynthesis of (glyco)sphingolipids from ceramides, but compounds without the natural (d,erythro) stereochemistry were poorly metabolized and did not concentrate in the Golgi apparatus. It appears that the level of C6-NBD-Cer as an intermediate in biosynthesis of complex desaturated sphingolipids is kept low in cells, which may be related to the potency of this sphingolipid in the regulation of cell function as a second messenger (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mathias S. Kolesnick R. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 65-90PubMed Google Scholar).

Menaldino D. Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3037-3040Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The succinimidyl ester of C6-NBD and propidium iodide were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Reduced streptolysin O (SL-O) was purchased from Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur (Marnes-la-coquette, France). 4-d-Hydroxysphinganine, ATP, phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase, bovine serum albumin, EGTA, uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose, brefeldin A (BFA), sphingomyelinase (from Staphylococcus aureus), α-galactosidase (from Aspergillus niger), β-galactosidase (from A. niger), α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (from bovine epididymis), and neuraminidase (type II from Vibrio cholerae and type X fromClostridium perfringens) were purchased from Sigma. NADH and ceramide glycanase were from Boehringer Mannheim.dl-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) was from Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). C6-NBD-ceramides were synthesized from various sphingoid bases and the succinimidyl ester of C6-NBD according to Kok et al. (20Kok J.W. Hoekstra D. Mason W.T. Relf G. Fluorescent Probes for Biological Function of Living Cells: A Practical Guide. Academic Press, London1993: 100-119Google Scholar). Synthesized C6-NBD-sphingolipids were purified by HPTLC and checked for purity by HPLC, before and after acid hydrolysis (see below). Purity was ≥99%. C6-NBD-DH-GlcCer and C6-NBD-DH-SM were synthesized in HT29 cells from C6-NBD-DH-Cer. These products were purified by HPTLC, followed by HPLC, until homogeneity. For cell incubations, the C6-NBD-sphingolipids in ethanol were injected into serum-free culture medium (0.5%, v/v, final ethanol concentration) at concentrations of C6-NBD-sphingolipid up to 5 μm (see also Ref. 21Kok J.W. Hoekstra K. Eskelinen S. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Following these incubations, equal amounts of cells for each condition were subjected to lipid extraction by the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Extracted lipids were analyzed by HPTLC, HPLC, or both. For HPTLC, the plates were developed in two dimensions, employing solvent system A (CH3Cl/CH3OH/20% (w/v) NH4OH, 14:6:1, v/v/v) in the first dimension and solvent sytem B (CH3Cl/CH3OH/86% (v/v) CH3COOH, 45:20:7, v/v/v) in the second. This procedure allowed separation of most C6-NBD-sphingolipid species, but does not clearly separate C6-NBD-GlcCer from C6-NBD-GalCer (cf. Ref. 23Babia T. Kok J.W. Hulstaert C. de Weerd H. Hoekstra D. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For further analysis, individual C6-NBD-sphingolipids were scraped from the HPTLC plates and eluted from the silica by washing with 10 ml of CH3Cl/CH3OH (1:1, v/v), followed by 10 ml of CH3OH. The individual C6-NBD-sphingolipid species were quantified by measuring the NBD fluorescence in CH3OH in a fluorimeter at excitation wavelength 465 nm and emission wavelength 530 nm. Thereafter, C6-NBD-GlcCer and C6-NBD-GalCer were separated on HPTLC plates, sprayed with boric acid (1.25 g/50 ml CH3OH), using solvent system C (CH3Cl/CH3OH/25% (w/v) NH4OH, 13:7:1, v/v/v), followed by quantification as described. In some cases, individual biosynthesized C6-NBD-sphingolipids were subjected to enzymatic analysis for identification purposes. After extraction from cells, HPTLC separation, and elution from the silica, these assays were usually performed in a 50 mm CH3COONa solution at pH 4.5 at 37 °C, in the presence of 0.1% of Triton X-100 or 150 μg of taurodeoxycholate. The resulting products were analyzed either by HPTLC or HPLC. During incubation of HT29 G+ cells with C6-NBD-DH-Cer, a substantial amount of a C6-NBD-lipid was synthesized that did not migrate with the standards (see also Ref. 23Babia T. Kok J.W. Hulstaert C. de Weerd H. Hoekstra D. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An attempt was made to identify this NBD-lipid by enzymatic analysis. It was completely resistant to (bacterial) sphingomyelinase in the presence of Triton X-100 and Mg2+ at pH 7.4, but was almost completely (circa 95%) degraded to ceramide by ceramide glycanase, when incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of taurodeoxycholate at pH 5.0. Various glycosidases were tested for their capacity to degrade this C6-NBD-glycolipid. α- and β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and neuraminidase (either fromV. cholerae or C. perfringens) were ineffective; however, the C6-NBD-glycolipid was converted to C6-NBD-LacCer by α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which suggests it is a ceramide trihexoside (CTH), containing a terminalN-acetylgalactosamine linked in α configuration to the galactose of C6-NBD-LacCer. Further structure identification was not performed, due to the small amounts of C6-NBD-lipid available and contamination of this C6-NBD-lipid by endogenous cell lipids comigrating on HPTLC. HPTLC does not separate C6-NBD-DH-sphingolipids from their desaturated counterparts; therefore, HPLC analyses were employed using a system described by Pagano and Martin (24Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that allows separation of C6-NBD-DH-Cer from C6-NBD-Cer. We found that not only the two ceramide species, but virtually all C6-NBD-sphingolipids synthesized from C6-NBD-DH-Cer were resolved by this system. The fluorescent sphingolipids were separated on an analytical reverse-phase C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) with CH3OH/H2O/H3PO4(850:150:1.5, v/v/v) as the mobile phase (24Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4439-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and detected with a Shimadzu RF-535 fluorescence detector and a C-R5A plotter/integrator. Total lipid extracts or individual C6-NBD-sphingolipid species, previously separated on HPTLC, were dissolved in 500 μl of mobile phase, and an aliquot was loaded on the HPLC column, followed by elution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fluorescent sphingolipids were detected at 530 nm by excitation at 465 nm, and quantified by means of the peak area (3270 arbitrary units/pmol of C6-NBD-sphingolipid). The peak area was proportional to the injected amount of fluorescent lipid at least up to 300 pmol. When a total lipid extract from HT29 G+ cells, incubated with C6-NBD-DH-Cer for 24 h, was analyzed by HPLC, a number of peaks appeared, as shown in Fig. 1. These peaks were identified as follows. 1) Some peaks could be directly identified by comparison to synthesized standards (C6-NBD derivatives of DH-Cer/DH-LacCer/Cer/GlcCer/GalCer/SM). 2) Further identification was performed by separation of a total C6-NBD-sphingolipid extract on two-dimensional HPTLC, as described above, followed by separation of C6-NBD-GlcCer from C6-NBD-GalCer. The resulting individual sphingolipid species, which were in fact mixtures of the desaturated and saturated counterpart, were then separated on HPLC. This allowed identification of all C6-NBD-sphingolipid peaks in the HPLC profile. All quantitative measurements of C6-NBD-(DH-)-sphingolipids were performed according to this methodology. 3) Confirmation of identification was obtained in the case of C6-NBD derivatives of (DH-)SM, (DH-)-LacCer, and (DH-)CTH, by enzymatic degradation of these C6-NBD-sphingolipids by sphingomyelinase and ceramide glycanase, respectively. The products were identified as C6-NBD-(DH-)Cer by HPLC. In the HPLC profile of a total C6-NBD-sphingolipid extract, two series of sphingolipid species could be discerned, one containing DH-Cer as the backbone and the other Cer. In each series the elution order is C6-NBD-CTH → LacCer → GlcCer + GalCer → SM → Cer (C6-NBD-GlcCer and C6-NBD-GalCer have the same retention times). The desaturated and saturated form of each sphingolipid species were separated by 6.7 min, on average. The sphingoid base composition of endogenous sphingolipids was analyzed as follows. Total lipid extracts were subjected to base hydrolysis in 0.1 n KOH in CH3OH for 90 min at 37 °C. After neutralization and reextraction, the sphingoid base composition of either the total sphingolipid pool or of individual lipid species was analyzed. In the latter case, base hydrolyzed extracts were separated on HPTLC, employing solvent system D (CH3Cl/CH3OH/67% (v/v) CH3COOH, 28:15:3, v/v/v), followed by elution of lipid species from the silica. Either a total sphingolipid extract or individual sphingolipid species were subsequently acid hydrolyzed in 0.5 n HCl in CH3OH for 16 h at 63–64 °C, followed by neutralization and reextraction. Released sphingoid bases were derivatized with ortho-phthaldialdehyde and analyzed by HPLC, as described previously (25Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C.

To correct for possible losses during the acid hydrolysis and extraction procedures, samples were spiked with 100 pmol of N-acetyl-C20-sphinganine as an internal standard. This was done before the lipid extraction in the case of total sphingolipid analysis and before lipid elution from the silica, in the case of analysis of the sphingoid base composition of individual sphingolipid species. Monocultures of HT29 G+ cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, containing 25 mm glucose), supplemented with 10% (v/v) decomplemented (56 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum (FCS), in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. During the exponential phase of growth, the culture medium was changed every 48 h. NRK cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FCS, BHK cells in Glasgow minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS and 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and HL-60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Cells were permeabilized with SL-O according to the procedure of Tan et al. (26Tan A. Bolscher J. Ploegh H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using 1.3 units/ml SL-O. Efficiency of permeabilization (>90%) was checked in every experiment by counting propidium iodide-labeled (permeabilized) and total cells. Experiments with SL-O-permeabilized cells were performed in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (18Babia T. Kok J.W. van der Haar M. Kalicharan R. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar). Cell homogenates were prepared from approximately 5 × 107HT29 cells. Cells were washed two times with Hank's buffer, followed by scraping and centrifugation. The cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C for 30 min and thawed. The pellet was then resuspended in buffer (140 mm KCl, 0.5 mmKH2PO4, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and homogenized by 100 strokes in a tight Dounce homogenizer. Cytosol was prepared from HT29 G+ cells as described before (18Babia T. Kok J.W. van der Haar M. Kalicharan R. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar). Rat liver ER membranes were isolated as described by Croze and Morré (27Croze E.M. Morré D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rat liver Golgi membranes were isolated as described previously (28Kok J.W. Babia T. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Forin vitro C6-NBD-DH-GlcCer desaturation studies, ER and/or Golgi membranes were incubated in the presence of 1 mm NADH. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, placed in 35-mm diameter plastic Petri dishes. Experiments were carried out 72 h after passage. Cells were incubated with C6-NBD-(DH-)- Cer (2.5–5 μm) in culture medium without FCS for 1 or 24 h at 37 °C, followed by extensive washing. After the 1-h incubation, a “back-exchange” was performed by incubating the cells with 5% bovine serum albumin in cold (2 °C) medium for 30 min, followed by extensive washing. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Leitz Orthoplan microscope equipped with a Leitz Vario Orthomat 2 photography system. Photomicrographs were taken at 10-s exposure times using Illford HP5 film that was processed at 3200 ASA. Protein was determined by the Lowry procedure, modified as described by Peterson (29Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. C6-NBD-Cer, a short-chain fluorescent analog of ceramide, is a well established precursor for (glyco)sphingolipid biosynthesis (17Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J.

In HT29 G+ cells, a number of products are synthesized during a 24-h incubation with C6-NBD-Cer, the main products being C6-NBD-SM and C6-NBD-GlcCer, plus lesser amounts of C6-NBD-GalCer, C6-NBD-LacCer and C6-NBD-CTH (see “Experimental Procedures”;cf.

In this study, we examined the fate of a C6-NBD-analog of dihydroceramide(C6-NBD-DH-Cer, Fig. 2 C), which should, in principle, serve as a precursor for the synthesis of C6-NBD-Cer via double bond introduction between C4 and C5 of the sphinganine backbone. When HT29 G+ cells were incubated with 2.5 μmC6-NBD-DH-Cer for 24 h at 37 °C, the product profile was qualitatively comparable to that obtained after C6-NBD-Cer incubation; however, there were quantitative differences (Fig. 1, Table I; cf.

https://openalex.org/W2096976107,"Limited information is available regarding domains within the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) which participate in amiloride binding. We previously utilized the anti-amiloride antibody (BA7.1) as a surrogate amiloride receptor to delineate amino acid residues that contact amiloride, and identified a putative amiloride binding domain WYRFHY (residues 278–283) within the extracellular domain of αrENaC. Mutations were generated to examine the role of this sequence in amiloride binding. Functional analyses of wild type (wt) and mutant αrENaCs were performed by cRNA expression in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes and by reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers. Wild type αrENaC was inhibited by amiloride with a<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 169 nm. Deletion of the entire WYRFHY tract (αrENaC Δ278–283) resulted in a loss of sensitivity of the channel to submicromolar concentrations of amiloride (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 26.5 μm). Similar results were obtained when either αrENaC or αrENaC Δ278–283 were co-expressed with wt β- and γrENaC (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> values of 155 nm and 22.8 μm, respectively). Moreover, αrENaC H282D was insensitive to submicromolar concentrations of amiloride (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 6.52 μm), whereas αrENaC H282R was inhibited by amiloride with a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>of 29 nm. These mutations do not alter ENaC Na<sup>+</sup>:K<sup>+</sup> selectivity nor single-channel conductance. These data suggest that residues within the tract WYRFHY participate in amiloride binding. Our results, in conjunction with recent studies demonstrating that mutations within the membrane-spanning domains of αrENaC and mutations preceding the second membrane-spanning domains of α-, β-, and γrENaC alters amiloride's <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>, suggest that selected regions of the extracellular loop of αrENaC may be in close proximity to residues within the channel pore."

Ther. 1993; 57: 79-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, persistent or inappropriately high TNF-α expression has grave consequences, including multiorgan failure and death (5Beutler B. Milsark I.W. Cerami A.C. Science. 1985; 229: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, 6Chollet-Martin S. Montravers P. Gilbert C. Elbim C. Desmonts J.M. Fagon J.Y. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 164: 990-996Google Scholar). Thus, stringent control of TNF-α regulation is critical for host survival and has led to the evolution of multiple levels of macrophage TNF-α regulation (7Beutler B. Oncogenesis. 1990; 2: 9-18Google Scholar).The TNF-α gene lies between the lymphotoxin-α and lymphotoxin-β genes in a tightly linked array, but these genes are regulated by distinct promoters (8Nedospasov S.A. Hirt B. Shakhov A.N. Dobrynin V.N. Kawashima E. Accolla R.S. Jongeneel C.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7713-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Pokholok D.K. Maroulakou I.G.

TNF-α transcription occurs in plastic-adherent but otherwise unstimulated macrophages in the absence of detectable translation (10Haskill S. Johnson C. Eierman D. Becker S. Warren K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1690-1694PubMed Google Scholar, 11Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The TNF-α promoter shares several regulatory elements with other genes, including, but not limited to, four κB-like elements, a GC box/Sp-1 binding site, a Y-box like decanucleotide, a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein binding site, and binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2 (12Jongeneel C.V. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several macrophage activators induce a modest increase in TNF-α transcription (13Jongeneel C.V. Shakhov A.N. Nedospasov S.A. Cerottini J.-C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is blocked by agents that enhance intracellular cyclic AMP levels (14Prada J. Prager C. Neifer S. Bienzle U. Kremsner P.G. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2737-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the ANA-1 macrophage cell line, TNF-α transcript elongation is blocked in unstimulated cells. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation both increases TNF-α transcription initiation and reverses the transcript elongation block (15Biragyn A. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 674-683PubMed Google Scholar). Once transcribed, TNF-α mRNA is stabilized by the same stimuli that induce TNF-α release in macrophages, including LPS (16Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Enhancement of transcription initiation, release of the transcript elongation block, and transcript stabilization contribute to the accumulation of TNF-α mRNA in stimulated macrophages. The TNF-α mRNA that is present in unstimulated macrophages is translationally silent. Macrophage activation induces both accumulation and translation of TNF-α mRNA (11Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 13Jongeneel C.V. Shakhov A.N. Nedospasov S.A. Cerottini J.-C. Eur. J.

Cis acting elements in the TNF-α 3′-untranslated region are sufficient for both translational silencing in unstimulated macrophages and the LPS-induced activation of TNF-α translation (17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).We (18Crawford E.K. Ensor J.E. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149 (abstr.): A716Google Scholar) and others (19Ulich T.R. Watson L.R. Yin S. Guo K. Wang P. Thang H. del Castillo J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1485-1496PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the translationally silent TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages migrates faster than the translationally active TNF-α transcripts in LPS-stimulated macrophages in Northern blot analyses. Possible causes of the observed differences in TNF-α transcript size in unstimulated and stimulated macrophages include: 1) isoforms of the TNF-α gene; 2) use of an alternative poly(A) signal site(s); 3) mRNA splice variants in unstimulated macrophages lacking one or two internal exons; or 4) heterogeneity in poly(A) tail length. Current data do not support the first two possible possibilities. Previous searches of genomic libraries did not reveal any genes with homology to TNF-α (8Nedospasov S.A. Hirt B. Shakhov A.N. Dobrynin V.N. Kawashima E. Accolla R.S. Jongeneel C.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7713-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and only a single AAUAAA canonical nuclear poly(A) signal site is present in mouse and human TNF-α sequences (20Pennica D. Hayflick J.S. Bringman T.S. Palladino M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6060-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).The objectives of this study are to determine the cause of the TNF-α mRNA size heterogeneity in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages and to evaluate its relevance to the regulation of TNF-α expression. We show that the TNF-α mRNA in adherent, unstimulated monocytes and macrophages is approximately 200 nucleotides shorter than those that appear after LPS stimulation. The size difference is due to markedly shorter or absent 3′ poly(A) tails on the TNF-α mRNA in the unstimulated macrophages. We show that the 3′ poly(A) tail shortening is not caused by either ongoing translation or dissociation of TNF-α mRNA from polysomes and suggest that 3′ poly(A) tail metabolism may play a critical role in TNF-α regulation.DISCUSSIONMacrophage activation causes dramatic changes in posttranscriptional processing of TNF-α mRNA (16Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As previously reported in other macrophage models (11Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 16Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), basal TNF-α protein secretion was not detectable in adherent RAW macrophages (Fig. 1 C) in the face of active TNF-α transcription (Fig. 1 B) and the accumulation of cytoplasmic TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 1 A). We also could not detect TNF-α protein in unstimulated RAW cell lysates (data not shown). Han et al. (17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) directly showed that translation of TNF-α was blocked in unstimulated RAW cells and LPS stimulation reversed the inhibition of TNF-α protein synthesis. We have extended these data by showing that virtually all detectable TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW macrophages was not associated with polysomes (Fig. 4), indicating TNF-α translation initiation was blocked in these cells (38Yenofsky R. Bergmann I. Brawerman G. Biochemistry. 1982; 79: 5876-5880Google Scholar). LPS treatment induced both the appearance of polysome-associated TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 4) and onset of TNF-α secretion (Fig. 1 C).We previously reported preliminary evidence suggesting TNF-α transcripts are shorter in unstimulated adherent RAW macrophages than in LPS-stimulated cells (18Crawford E.K. Ensor J.E. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149 (abstr.): A716Google Scholar) and now report similar findings in human monocyte-derived macrophages and three other mouse macrophage cell lines (Fig. 1). Ulich et al. (19Ulich T.R. Watson L.R. Yin S. Guo K. Wang P. Thang H. del Castillo J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1485-1496PubMed Google Scholar) reported similar TNF-α mRNA size heterogeneity in rat alveolar macrophages in vitro and in rat spleen and liver in vivo, but the mechanisms by which these shifts in apparent TNF-α mRNA length occur were not described. In each of these cases TNF-α protein was not detectable in the absence of longer TNF-α transcripts. In the present study, enzymatic removal of the 3′ poly(A) tail reduced the apparent length of TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells by approximately 200 nucleotides. The same digestion of RNA from unstimulated cells did not cause any detectable change in the apparent 1.6-kb TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 2 C). Oligo(dT)/RNase H digestion shortens poly(A) tails to within 20 nucleotides of the transcript body (35Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli A. Strickland S. Vassalli J.-D. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and the resolution of our electrophoresis system was 20–30 nucleotides. Thus, these data indicate that the TNF-α mRNA 3′ poly(A) tail is <30 nucleotides long in unstimulated macrophages. Our inability to amplify TNF-α from unstimulated RAW cells using oligo(dT)12–18-primed RT-PCR (data not shown) suggests the TNF-α poly(A) tail may be even shorter in these cells. In contrast, poly(A) tail length of the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene transcript GAPDH was unaffected by the macrophage activation state (Fig. 2 C). A similar analysis of other cytokine transcripts, including granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, was not possible in this study because these transcripts were not detectable in unstimulated RAW cells (data not shown).In unstimulated RAW cells, the apparent TNF-α transcription rate measured by nuclear run-on assay was almost one-third the maximal rate achieved in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 B). Biragyn and Nedospasov (15Biragyn A. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 674-683PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that elongation of TNF-α transcripts is partially blocked in unstimulated macrophages despite modest rates of transcription initiation. These authors suggested that this process may limit effective transcription in unstimulated macrophages. Because the TNF-α gene contains a single poly(A) signal site near its 3′ terminus, incomplete transcription could account for the lack of 3′ polyadenylation. Three lines of evidence suggest that this is not the major mechanism responsible for the accumulation of hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages. First, Northern analysis of cytoplasmic RNA from unstimulated RAW cells only showed a single 1.6-kb TNF-α band. Second, RT-PCR amplification of cytoplasmic RNA using a primer complementary to the TNF-α 3′ terminus generated an amplicon of the expected size in unstimulated macrophages. Finally, the nuclear run-on assay that demonstrated basal TNF-α transcription utilized an exon 4 TNF-α cDNA fragment to detect radiolabeled transcripts (Fig. 1 B).Detection of only 1.6-kb TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages, in the face of ongoing TNF-α transcription, suggests either a block in nuclear 3′ polyadenylation of TNF-α mRNA or rapid TNF-α transcript deadenylation in these cells. Specific cytoplasmic deadenylation of polyadenylated mRNA has been described in mammalian cells (39Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 40Waller, S. J., Carter, D. A., Ang, H.-L., Ho, M.-Y., Zeng, Q., and Murphy, D. (1993) Regul. Pep. 37–41.Google Scholar). Poly(A) tails of mRNA are nearly ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes. The only mRNAs known to lack poly(A) are those encoding the major histones that possess unique 3′ secondary structure that is not present in TNF-α mRNA (41Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, synthesis and nuclear export of both adenylated and deadenylated forms of the same transcript have not been reported. Therefore, we believe that TNF-α mRNA is synthesized and exported to the cytoplasm with a 3′ poly(A) tail, which is rapidly removed in the cytoplasm of unstimulated macrophages.The process responsible for the accumulation of deadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW cells appears to be distinct from the gradual poly(A) tail shortening of polyadenylated TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells. Gradual TNF-α mRNA poly(A) tail shortening is evident within 30 min of LPS stimulation (Fig. 2 C) and proceeds over the next 8 h in RAW cells as we have previously described (25Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a typical distributive, translation-dependent deadenylation process (42Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2088-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By comparison, only hypoadenylated, ribonucleoprotein-associated TNF-α mRNA was detectable in unstimulated macrophages (Figs. 1,2 C, and 4).Surprisingly, hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW cells was more stable (Fig. 3 C) than polyadenylated TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells (25Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, mRNA deadenylation is followed by 5′ cap removal and transcript degradation (43Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The relative stability of the hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA pool may be due to its translational dormancy, since at least some RNases are polysome-associated (44Bandyopadhyay R. Coutts M. Krowczynska A. Brawerman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By failing to associate with polysomes, hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages may not be accessible to these RNases.The data presented in this report suggest that unstimulated macrophages transcribe TNF-α but convert TNF-α mRNA to a relatively stable, hypoadenylated, translationally dormant form. The possible importance of this process as a negative regulator of TNF-α expression in unstimulated macrophages is apparent. The advantage to the host of this ostensibly inefficient process of synthesizing translationally dormant TNF-α mRNA is less obvious, but its presence suggests that the pool of hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA may serve an important function.Gene regulation in developmental systems may provide clues about the role of TNF-α mRNA deadenylation in macrophages. Translational activation of certain maternal genes during oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryogenesis is orchestrated by cytoplasmic deadenylation and poly(A) elongation (33Wickens M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For certain genes, premature expression is prevented by truncating the poly(A) tails of newly synthesized transcripts before translation is initiated (45Huarte J. Stutz A. O'Connell M.L. Gubler P. Belin D. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Vassalli J.-D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Stable pools of these translationally dormant, hypoadenylated transcripts are stored for eventual expression. Translation is subsequently initiated by poly(A) tail elongation and continues until the 3′ poly(A) tail is removed. In many ways TNF-α mRNA in macrophages behaves like the developmental mRNAs that are regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. Unstimulated macrophages contain only hypoadenylated cytoplasmic TNF-α mRNA, which is relatively stable and translationally silent (17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Moreover, in macrophages pretreated with actinomycin D to block synthesis of new TNF-α mRNA, LPS stimulated an elongation of TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 6) and low level secretion of TNF-α protein (Table I), suggesting TNF-α mRNA may undergo polyadenylation and translation in the macrophage cytoplasm. This process may provide the macrophage with a means of rapid, limited TNF-α synthesis. Furthermore, this alternative pathway may allow TNF-α synthesis to occur in the face of transcriptional arrest. Cytoplasmic deadenylation/polyadenylation in developmental systems requires the canonical nuclear polyadenylation signal, AAUAAA, and a second, less defined U-rich 3′-untranslated region element that is similar to several stretches of AU-rich sequences in the TNF-α 3′-untranslated region (46Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar).We have identified two possible new regulatory sites in TNF-α expression, 3′ poly(A) tail metabolism and association of TNF-α mRNA with polysomes. Additionally, macrophages may be able to readenylate cytoplasmic pools of deadenylated TNF-α mRNA, which may provide an alternative, transcription-independent source of translationally active TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 7).

J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α stimulates effector cell microbicidal and tumoricidal activity, enhancing survival of the infected host (2Cross A.S. Sadoff J.C. Kelly N. Bernton E. Gemski P. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 3Cross A. Asher L. Seguin M. Yuan L. Kelly N. Hammack C. Sadoff J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 676-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and causing regression of some tumors (4Sidhu R.S. Bollon A.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 79-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, persistent or inappropriately high TNF-α expression has grave consequences, including multiorgan failure and death (5Beutler B. Milsark I.W. Cerami A.C. Science. 1985; 229: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, 6Chollet-Martin S. Montravers P. Gilbert C. Elbim C. Desmonts J.M. Fagon J.Y. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 164: 990-996Google Scholar). Thus, stringent control of TNF-α regulation is critical for host survival and has led to the evolution of multiple levels of macrophage TNF-α regulation (7Beutler B. Oncogenesis. 1990; 2: 9-18Google Scholar). The TNF-α gene lies between the lymphotoxin-α and lymphotoxin-β genes in a tightly linked array, but these genes are regulated by distinct promoters (8Nedospasov S.A. Hirt B. Shakhov A.N. Dobrynin V.N. Kawashima E. Accolla R.S. Jongeneel C.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7713-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Pokholok D.K. Maroulakou I.G. Kuprash D.V. Alimzhanov M.B. Kozlov S.V. Novobrantseva T.I. Turetskaya R.L. Green J.E. Nedospasov S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TNF-α transcription occurs in plastic-adherent but otherwise unstimulated macrophages in the absence of detectable translation (10Haskill S. Johnson C. Eierman D. Becker S. Warren K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1690-1694PubMed Google Scholar, 11Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The TNF-α promoter shares several regulatory elements with other genes, including, but not limited to, four κB-like elements, a GC box/Sp-1 binding site, a Y-box like decanucleotide, a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein binding site, and binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2 (12Jongeneel C.V. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several macrophage activators induce a modest increase in TNF-α transcription (13Jongeneel C.V. Shakhov A.N. Nedospasov S.A. Cerottini J.-C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is blocked by agents that enhance intracellular cyclic AMP levels (14Prada J. Prager C. Neifer S. Bienzle U. Kremsner P.G. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2737-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the ANA-1 macrophage cell line, TNF-α transcript elongation is blocked in unstimulated cells. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation both increases TNF-α transcription initiation and reverses the transcript elongation block (15Biragyn A. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 674-683PubMed Google Scholar). Once transcribed, TNF-α mRNA is stabilized by the same stimuli that induce TNF-α release in macrophages, including LPS (16Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Enhancement of transcription initiation, release of the transcript elongation block, and transcript stabilization contribute to the accumulation of TNF-α mRNA in stimulated macrophages. The TNF-α mRNA that is present in unstimulated macrophages is translationally silent. Macrophage activation induces both accumulation and translation of TNF-α mRNA (11Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 13Jongeneel C.V. Shakhov A.N. Nedospasov S.A. Cerottini J.-C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Cis acting elements in the TNF-α 3′-untranslated region are sufficient for both translational silencing in unstimulated macrophages and the LPS-induced activation of TNF-α translation (17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We (18Crawford E.K. Ensor J.E. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149 (abstr.): A716Google Scholar) and others (19Ulich T.R. Watson L.R. Yin S. Guo K. Wang P. Thang H. del Castillo J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1485-1496PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the translationally silent TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages migrates faster than the translationally active TNF-α transcripts in LPS-stimulated macrophages in Northern blot analyses. Possible causes of the observed differences in TNF-α transcript size in unstimulated and stimulated macrophages include: 1) isoforms of the TNF-α gene; 2) use of an alternative poly(A) signal site(s); 3) mRNA splice variants in unstimulated macrophages lacking one or two internal exons; or 4) heterogeneity in poly(A) tail length. Current data do not support the first two possible possibilities. Previous searches of genomic libraries did not reveal any genes with homology to TNF-α (8Nedospasov S.A. Hirt B. Shakhov A.N. Dobrynin V.N. Kawashima E. Accolla R.S. Jongeneel C.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7713-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and only a single AAUAAA canonical nuclear poly(A) signal site is present in mouse and human TNF-α sequences (20Pennica D. Hayflick J.S. Bringman T.S. Palladino M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6060-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study are to determine the cause of the TNF-α mRNA size heterogeneity in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages and to evaluate its relevance to the regulation of TNF-α expression. We show that the TNF-α mRNA in adherent, unstimulated monocytes and macrophages is approximately 200 nucleotides shorter than those that appear after LPS stimulation. The size difference is due to markedly shorter or absent 3′ poly(A) tails on the TNF-α mRNA in the unstimulated macrophages. We show that the 3′ poly(A) tail shortening is not caused by either ongoing translation or dissociation of TNF-α mRNA from polysomes and suggest that 3′ poly(A) tail metabolism may play a critical role in TNF-α regulation. DISCUSSIONMacrophage activation causes dramatic changes in posttranscriptional processing of TNF-α mRNA (16Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As previously reported in other macrophage models (11Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 16Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), basal TNF-α protein secretion was not detectable in adherent RAW macrophages (Fig. 1 C) in the face of active TNF-α transcription (Fig. 1 B) and the accumulation of cytoplasmic TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 1 A). We also could not detect TNF-α protein in unstimulated RAW cell lysates (data not shown). Han et al. (17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) directly showed that translation of TNF-α was blocked in unstimulated RAW cells and LPS stimulation reversed the inhibition of TNF-α protein synthesis. We have extended these data by showing that virtually all detectable TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW macrophages was not associated with polysomes (Fig. 4), indicating TNF-α translation initiation was blocked in these cells (38Yenofsky R. Bergmann I. Brawerman G. Biochemistry. 1982; 79: 5876-5880Google Scholar). LPS treatment induced both the appearance of polysome-associated TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 4) and onset of TNF-α secretion (Fig. 1 C).We previously reported preliminary evidence suggesting TNF-α transcripts are shorter in unstimulated adherent RAW macrophages than in LPS-stimulated cells (18Crawford E.K. Ensor J.E. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149 (abstr.): A716Google Scholar) and now report similar findings in human monocyte-derived macrophages and three other mouse macrophage cell lines (Fig. 1). Ulich et al. (19Ulich T.R. Watson L.R. Yin S. Guo K. Wang P. Thang H. del Castillo J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1485-1496PubMed Google Scholar) reported similar TNF-α mRNA size heterogeneity in rat alveolar macrophages in vitro and in rat spleen and liver in vivo, but the mechanisms by which these shifts in apparent TNF-α mRNA length occur were not described. In each of these cases TNF-α protein was not detectable in the absence of longer TNF-α transcripts. In the present study, enzymatic removal of the 3′ poly(A) tail reduced the apparent length of TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells by approximately 200 nucleotides. The same digestion of RNA from unstimulated cells did not cause any detectable change in the apparent 1.6-kb TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 2 C). Oligo(dT)/RNase H digestion shortens poly(A) tails to within 20 nucleotides of the transcript body (35Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli A. Strickland S. Vassalli J.-D. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and the resolution of our electrophoresis system was 20–30 nucleotides. Thus, these data indicate that the TNF-α mRNA 3′ poly(A) tail is <30 nucleotides long in unstimulated macrophages. Our inability to amplify TNF-α from unstimulated RAW cells using oligo(dT)12–18-primed RT-PCR (data not shown) suggests the TNF-α poly(A) tail may be even shorter in these cells. In contrast, poly(A) tail length of the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene transcript GAPDH was unaffected by the macrophage activation state (Fig. 2 C). A similar analysis of other cytokine transcripts, including granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, was not possible in this study because these transcripts were not detectable in unstimulated RAW cells (data not shown).In unstimulated RAW cells, the apparent TNF-α transcription rate measured by nuclear run-on assay was almost one-third the maximal rate achieved in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 B). Biragyn and Nedospasov (15Biragyn A. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 674-683PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that elongation of TNF-α transcripts is partially blocked in unstimulated macrophages despite modest rates of transcription initiation. These authors suggested that this process may limit effective transcription in unstimulated macrophages. Because the TNF-α gene contains a single poly(A) signal site near its 3′ terminus, incomplete transcription could account for the lack of 3′ polyadenylation. Three lines of evidence suggest that this is not the major mechanism responsible for the accumulation of hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages. First, Northern analysis of cytoplasmic RNA from unstimulated RAW cells only showed a single 1.6-kb TNF-α band. Second, RT-PCR amplification of cytoplasmic RNA using a primer complementary to the TNF-α 3′ terminus generated an amplicon of the expected size in unstimulated macrophages. Finally, the nuclear run-on assay that demonstrated basal TNF-α transcription utilized an exon 4 TNF-α cDNA fragment to detect radiolabeled transcripts (Fig. 1 B).Detection of only 1.6-kb TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages, in the face of ongoing TNF-α transcription, suggests either a block in nuclear 3′ polyadenylation of TNF-α mRNA or rapid TNF-α transcript deadenylation in these cells. Specific cytoplasmic deadenylation of polyadenylated mRNA has been described in mammalian cells (39Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 40Waller, S. J., Carter, D. A., Ang, H.-L., Ho, M.-Y., Zeng, Q., and Murphy, D. (1993) Regul. Pep. 37–41.Google Scholar). Poly(A) tails of mRNA are nearly ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes. The only mRNAs known to lack poly(A) are those encoding the major histones that possess unique 3′ secondary structure that is not present in TNF-α mRNA (41Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, synthesis and nuclear export of both adenylated and deadenylated forms of the same transcript have not been reported. Therefore, we believe that TNF-α mRNA is synthesized and exported to the cytoplasm with a 3′ poly(A) tail, which is rapidly removed in the cytoplasm of unstimulated macrophages.The process responsible for the accumulation of deadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW cells appears to be distinct from the gradual poly(A) tail shortening of polyadenylated TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells. Gradual TNF-α mRNA poly(A) tail shortening is evident within 30 min of LPS stimulation (Fig. 2 C) and proceeds over the next 8 h in RAW cells as we have previously described (25Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a typical distributive, translation-dependent deadenylation process (42Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2088-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By comparison, only hypoadenylated, ribonucleoprotein-associated TNF-α mRNA was detectable in unstimulated macrophages (Figs. 1,2 C, and 4).Surprisingly, hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW cells was more stable (Fig. 3 C) than polyadenylated TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells (25Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, mRNA deadenylation is followed by 5′ cap removal and transcript degradation (43Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The relative stability of the hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA pool may be due to its translational dormancy, since at least some RNases are polysome-associated (44Bandyopadhyay R. Coutts M. Krowczynska A.

Thus, these data indicate that the TNF-α mRNA 3′ poly(A) tail is <30 nucleotides long in unstimulated macrophages. Our inability to amplify TNF-α from unstimulated RAW cells using oligo(dT)12–18-primed RT-PCR (data not shown) suggests the TNF-α poly(A) tail may be even shorter in these cells. In contrast, poly(A) tail length of the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene transcript GAPDH was unaffected by the macrophage activation state (Fig. 2 C). A similar analysis of other cytokine transcripts, including granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, was not possible in this study because these transcripts were not detectable in unstimulated RAW cells (data not shown). In unstimulated RAW cells, the apparent TNF-α transcription rate measured by nuclear run-on assay was almost one-third the maximal rate achieved in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 B). Biragyn and Nedospasov (15Biragyn A. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 674-683PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that elongation of TNF-α transcripts is partially blocked in unstimulated macrophages despite modest rates of transcription initiation. These authors suggested that this process may limit effective transcription in unstimulated macrophages. Because the TNF-α gene contains a single poly(A) signal site near its 3′ terminus, incomplete transcription could account for the lack of 3′ polyadenylation. Three lines of evidence suggest that this is not the major mechanism responsible for the accumulation of hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages. First, Northern analysis of cytoplasmic RNA from unstimulated RAW cells only showed a single 1.6-kb TNF-α band. Second, RT-PCR amplification of cytoplasmic RNA using a primer complementary to the TNF-α 3′ terminus generated an amplicon of the expected size in unstimulated macrophages. Finally, the nuclear run-on assay that demonstrated basal TNF-α transcription utilized an exon 4 TNF-α cDNA fragment to detect radiolabeled transcripts (Fig. 1 B). Detection of only 1.6-kb TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages, in the face of ongoing TNF-α transcription, suggests either a block in nuclear 3′ polyadenylation of TNF-α mRNA or rapid TNF-α transcript deadenylation in these cells. Specific cytoplasmic deadenylation of polyadenylated mRNA has been described in mammalian cells (39Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 40Waller, S. J., Carter, D. A., Ang, H.-L., Ho, M.-Y., Zeng, Q., and Murphy, D. (1993) Regul. Pep. 37–41.Google Scholar). Poly(A) tails of mRNA are nearly ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes. The only mRNAs known to lack poly(A) are those encoding the major histones that possess unique 3′ secondary structure that is not present in TNF-α mRNA (41Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, synthesis and nuclear export of both adenylated and deadenylated forms of the same transcript have not been reported. Therefore, we believe that TNF-α mRNA is synthesized and exported to the cytoplasm with a 3′ poly(A) tail, which is rapidly removed in the cytoplasm of unstimulated macrophages. The process responsible for the accumulation of deadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW cells appears to be distinct from the gradual poly(A) tail shortening of polyadenylated TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells. Gradual TNF-α mRNA poly(A) tail shortening is evident within 30 min of LPS stimulation (Fig. 2 C) and proceeds over the next 8 h in RAW cells as we have previously described (25Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a typical distributive, translation-dependent deadenylation process (42Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2088-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By comparison, only hypoadenylated, ribonucleoprotein-associated TNF-α mRNA was detectable in unstimulated macrophages (Figs. 1,2 C, and 4). Surprisingly, hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated RAW cells was more stable (Fig. 3 C) than polyadenylated TNF-α mRNA in LPS-stimulated cells (25Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, mRNA deadenylation is followed by 5′ cap removal and transcript degradation (43Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The relative stability of the hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA pool may be due to its translational dormancy, since at least some RNases are polysome-associated (44Bandyopadhyay R. Coutts M. Krowczynska A. Brawerman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By failing to associate with polysomes, hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA in unstimulated macrophages may not be accessible to these RNases. The data presented in this report suggest that unstimulated macrophages transcribe TNF-α but convert TNF-α mRNA to a relatively stable, hypoadenylated, translationally dormant form. The possible importance of this process as a negative regulator of TNF-α expression in unstimulated macrophages is apparent. The advantage to the host of this ostensibly inefficient process of synthesizing translationally dormant TNF-α mRNA is less obvious, but its presence suggests that the pool of hypoadenylated TNF-α mRNA may serve an important function. Gene regulation in developmental systems may provide clues about the role of TNF-α mRNA deadenylation in macrophages. Translational activation of certain maternal genes during oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryogenesis is orchestrated by cytoplasmic deadenylation and poly(A) elongation (33Wickens M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For certain genes, premature expression is prevented by truncating the poly(A) tails of newly synthesized transcripts before translation is initiated (45Huarte J. Stutz A. O'Connell M.L. Gubler P. Belin D. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Vassalli J.-D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Stable pools of these translationally dormant, hypoadenylated transcripts are stored for eventual expression. Translation is subsequently initiated by poly(A) tail elongation and continues until the 3′ poly(A) tail is removed. In many ways TNF-α mRNA in macrophages behaves like the developmental mRNAs that are regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. Unstimulated macrophages contain only hypoadenylated cytoplasmic TNF-α mRNA, which is relatively stable and translationally silent (17Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Moreover, in macrophages pretreated with actinomycin D to block synthesis of new TNF-α mRNA, LPS stimulated an elongation of TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 6) and low level secretion of TNF-α protein (Table I), suggesting TNF-α mRNA may undergo polyadenylation and translation in the macrophage cytoplasm. This process may provide the macrophage with a means of rapid, limited TNF-α synthesis. Furthermore, this alternative pathway may allow TNF-α synthesis to occur in the face of transcriptional arrest. Cytoplasmic deadenylation/polyadenylation in developmental systems requires the canonical nuclear polyadenylation signal, AAUAAA, and a second, less defined U-rich 3′-untranslated region element that is similar to several stretches of AU-rich sequences in the TNF-α 3′-untranslated region (46Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). We have identified two possible new regulatory sites in TNF-α expression, 3′ poly(A) tail metabolism and association of TNF-α mRNA with polysomes. Additionally, macrophages may be able to readenylate cytoplasmic pools of deadenylated TNF-α mRNA, which may provide an alternative, transcription-independent source of translationally active TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 7).

We report that nuclear lamina disassembly in interphase sea urchin egg cytosol is a result of lamin B phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). Lamin B of permeabilized sea urchin sperm nuclei incubated in fertilized egg G1 phase cytosolic extract is phosphorylated within 1 min of incubation and solubilized prior to sperm chromatin decondensation. Phosphorylation is Ca2+-dependent. It is reversibly inhibited by the PKC-specific inhibitor chelerythrine, a PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide, and a PKC substrate peptide, but not by inhibitors of PKA, p34 cdc2 or calmodulin kinase II. Phosphorylation is inhibited by immunodepletion of cytosolic PKC and restored by addition of purified rat brain PKC. Sperm lamin B is a substrate for rat brain PKC in vitro, resulting in lamin B solubilization. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of lamin B phosphorylated by the cytosolic kinase and by purified rat PKC are virtually identical.

Although not a lamin kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II) is also involved in mitotic NE breakdown in sea urchin embryos (12Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PKC has also been shown to phosphorylate chicken lamin B2 in interphase, a process thought to regulate lamin import into the nucleus (13Hennekes H. Peter M. Nigg E.A. J.

These observations imply that multiple kinases regulate the dynamics of the nuclear lamina during the cell cycle.The transformation of the sea urchin sperm nucleus into a pronucleus at fertilization provides an opportunity to investigate NE assembly/disassembly during interphase. Sea urchin eggs are fertilized in G1 phase of the first cell cycle after completion of both meiotic divisions. At fertilization, the sperm NE vesiculates and a new NE reforms around the male pronucleus as the sperm chromatin decondenses (14Longo F.J. Anderson E. J.

Male pronuclear formation has been duplicated in a cell-free system by incubating detergent-permeabilized sperm nuclei in fertilized egg extracts (15Cameron L.A. Poccia D.L. Dev.

Fertilization stimulates phospholipase C in the egg plasma membrane, releasing diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from phosphoinositides. Increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate triggers an intracellular release of Ca2+, which together with diacylglycerol activates PKC (20Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). Activated soluble PKC has been shown to translocate to the plasma membrane (21Olds J.L. Favit A. Nelson T. Ascoli G.

Lamin B phosphorylation and solubilization precedes decondensation of the sperm chromatin, but is not sufficient to promote chromatin decondensation.

https://openalex.org/W2119705421,"The receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. To study the structural elements and mechanisms involved in the internalization of human PAF receptor (hPAFR), we used the following mutants: a truncated mutant in the C-terminal tail of the receptor (Cys317→ Stop) and mutations in the (D/N)P(X)2,3Y motif (Asp289 → Asn,Ala and Tyr293 → Phe,Ala). Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the Cys317→ Stop mutant exhibited a marked reduction in their capacity to internalize PAF, suggesting the existence of determinants important for endocytosis in the last 26 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. Substitution of Asp289 to alanine abolished both internalization and G-protein coupling, whereas substitution of Tyr293 to alanine abolished coupling but not internalization. Inhibition or activation of protein kinase C did not significantly affect the internalization process. Receptor sequestration and ligand uptake was, at least in part, blocked by concanavalin A and blockers of endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated pits. Our data suggest that the internalization of a G-protein-coupled receptor and coupling to a G-protein can be two independent events. Moreover, the C terminus tail of hPAFR, but not the putative internalization motifs, may be involved in the internalization of hPAFR.

These receptors, when exposed to an agonist, activate a heterotrimeric G-protein that in turn activates and regulates events leading to cellular responses. Following repeated or prolonged agonist stimulation, their signal transduction potential becomes modulated and attenuated, a phenomenon termed desensitization (8Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Three distinct events participate in the process of desensitization as follows: the functional uncoupling of the receptor from the G-protein, internalization or sequestration of the receptor from the cell surface toward the intracellular compartments, and finally, the down-regulation of receptor numbers, involving the degradation of the protein in lysosomes (9Nathanson N.M. Brown J.H. The Muscarinic Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Clifton Park, NY1989: 419-454Crossref Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation in receptor desensitization has been widely studied. It seems clear, at this time, that phosphorylation by second messenger kinases (PKC, PKA, PKG) and the GRKs (G-protein-coupled receptor kinases) helps to maintain the receptors uncoupled from the G-protein (10Hargrave P.

Receptor internalization permits ligand entry and seems to participate in resensitization as well as desensitization (16Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell.

In addition, the substitution of residues in this motif was found to affect other functions of the receptor, such as G-protein coupling, affinity for the ligand (37Laporte S.A. Servant G.

These results suggest a global role for this region in the conservation of adequate receptor conformation. It has also been shown that the medium chains (μ1 and μ2) of clathrin-associated protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2 can specifically interact with a tyrosine-based signal YXXΦ (Φ is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) motif (39Ohno H.

Both these motifs are found in the sequenceDPVIYCFL present in the hPAFR. It has been shown that the PAFR undergoes a ligand-specific, temperature-dependent internalization in transfected cells (40Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. Zou A. Cochrane C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to identify the structural elements and mechanisms involved in the internalization of the hPAFR. The role of the two motifs (D/N)P(X)2,3Y and YXXΦ was evaluated with the mutant receptors Asp289 → Ala,Asn (41Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol.

The presence of regulatory elements in the cytoplasmic tail was verified with the mutant Cys317 → Stop that does not contain the last 26 amino acids of the C-terminal tail. The involvement of clathrin-coated vesicles in hPAFR internalization was addressed with internalization blockers. Finally, to determine whether signalization was an important step in the initiation or regulation of the hPAFR internalization process, certain inhibitors and an activator of PKC, in addition to uncoupled mutants of the receptor, D63N (43Parent J.L.

The pJ3M expression vector (45Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene ( Amst .). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the clone Kp132 containing the hPAFR cDNA (40Ye R.D.

Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) and Dr. Richard Ye (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. A tagged hPAFR cDNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction (46Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninski J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) from Kp132 using the oligonucleotide 5′-CCACATGACTCCTCCCACATG-3′ and the M13 sequencing primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′). The resulting fragment was then digested with Acc65I and subcloned into theEco1CR1-Acc65I sites of the pJ3M vector. In this construction, the N-terminal initiator methionine was replaced by the peptide sequence MEQKLISEEDLSRGSPG, resulting in a c-mycepitope-tagged PAF receptor coding sequence. Mutated receptors were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using Kp132 as template. Tyr293 → Phe and Tyr293 → Ala substitutions were created using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGTTATCTTCTGTTTCC-3′ and 5′-CCTGTTATCGCCTGTTTCC-3′ with their reverse complements, respectively. The point mutation was then introduced in the epitope-tagged receptor coding sequence using BstEII andAcc65I restriction enzymes. Truncated forms, Cys317 → Stop and Lys298 → Stop, of the receptor were also constructed. To construct these mutants the polymerase chain reaction product generated with the oligonucleotides 5′-CCACATGACTCCTCCCACATG-3′ and 5′-GCCCGGGATCATTTCCGG-3′ (Cys317 → Stop) or 5′-CCAATTCTAGGTGAGGAAAC-3′ (Lys298 → Stop) were subcloned in the siteEco1CR1 of pJ3M vector. Mutations and the integrity of the coding sequence were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada). COS-7 and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 30-mm dishes (2.0 × 105 COS-7 cells/dish or 3.0 × 105 CHO cells/dish), transiently transfected with the constructions encoding the WT and the mutant receptors using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE and 1 μg of DNA per dish and harvested 48 h after transfection. For studies of biphasic isotherms, 100-mm dishes with 3 × 106 CHO cells/dish were transfected with constructions encoding the WT and Y293A mutant using 30 μl of LipofectAMINE and 4 μg of DNA. Stably transfected CHO cells (44Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol.

Competition binding curves were done on COS-7 cells expressing the WT and mutant receptor species. Cells were harvested and washed twice in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (47Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out on 5 × 104 cells in a total volume of 0.25 ml in the same buffer with 10 nm3H-WEB2086 and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive WEB2086 or PAF for 90 min at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. COS-7 cells were transfected as described above with the WT or mutant receptors and labeled the following day for 18–24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol at 5 μCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol). After labeling, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pretreated or not with the indicated inhibitors (concanavalin A (0.25 mg/ml, 20 min), sucrose (0.45 m, 20 min), NH4Cl (10 mm, 10 min), phenylarsine oxide (80 μm, 5 min with 30-min rest)) and preincubated 5 min in PBS at 37 °C. At the end of this preincubation period, the PBS was removed, and cells were incubated in pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol) containing 0.1% BSA and 20 mmLiCl for 5 min. Cells were then stimulated for 30 s with indicated concentrations of PAF. The reactions were terminated with the addition of perchloric acid followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. Inositol phosphates were extracted (48Martin T.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated on Dowex AG1-X8 columns (49Berridge M.T. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Hyslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Total labeled inositol phosphates were then counted by liquid scintillation. The evaluation of ligand internalization kinetics was done on CHO cells transiently transfected in 12-well dishes with constructions encoding mutant and WT receptors. 48 h after transfection, cells were pretreated or not with the indicated inhibitors (pertussis toxin (150 ng/ml, 20 h), concanavalin A (0.25 mg/ml, 20 min), sucrose (0.45 m, 20 min), NH4Cl (10 mm, 10 min), phenylarsine oxide (80 μm, 5 min with 30 min rest), calphostin C (2 μm, 20 min), staurosporine (3 μm, 20 min), and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (10 μm, 20 min]) or 4α-PMA (inactive) or 4β-PMA (active) (80 nm, 30 min)) and then incubated at 37 °C with 2 nm [3H]hexadecyl-PAF in a buffer containing 150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.25% lipid-free BSA (40Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. Zou A. Cochrane C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) for 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, or 100 min. After the incubation period, cells were washed two times with 1 ml of the same buffer but containing 2% BSA. Cells were then lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and internalized radioactivity was evaluated by liquid scintillation. Stably transfected CHO cells were grown on coverslips (25 mm). The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of sucrose and/or PAF (0.5 μm) for 20 min and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min at RT). The coverslips were then placed in 0.1% Triton (20 min RT) and then sequentially incubated with 5% milk (30 min RT) and 0.1% glycine (60 min RT). The cells were then incubated with anti-PAFR antibodies (polyclonal, directed at the C-terminal tail; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) followed with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario). The cells were then analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) Multi-Probe 2001 confocal argon laser scanning system equipped with a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence inverted microscope. Scanned images were transferred onto a Silicon Graphics Indy 4000 workstation equipped with Molecular Dynamics' Imagespace analysis software. The mutants used in the present report are illustrated in Fig. 1. The deletion mutants, Cys317 → Stop and Lys298 → Stop, were made to analyze the involvement of the cytoplasmic tail in the internalization of the receptor. The tyrosine 293 putatively involved in the motifs (N/D)P(X)2,3Y and YXXΦ was substituted with phenylalanine and alanine. The role of receptor-mediated signal transduction in internalization was studied with the help of G-protein-uncoupled mutants that were distributed in distinct areas of the receptor (D63N, A230E, D289A, and Y293A). The binding characteristics of the WT receptor and the mutants, Cys317 → Stop, Y293A, and Y293F, were examined in transiently transfected COS-7 cells using the agonist (PAF) and an antagonist (WEB2086) (Fig. 2). The Lys298 → Stop mutant was not illustrated as it did not bind either of the ligands, despite comparable cell-surface expression to the WT construct, as examined by cytofluorimetry with an anti-c-myc antibody (results not shown). No significant difference was found in the affinities for WEB2086 (Fig. 2 A) or PAF (Fig. 2 B) between the different mutants and the WT receptor. Similar levels of expression were also obtained in COS-7 as well as in CHO cells (WT, 962,310 ± 163,592; Y293A, 961,945 ± 146,532; Y293F, 857,332 ± 155,432 receptors/CHO cell) except for Cys317 → Stop (342,578 ± 68,515 receptors/CHO cell) which was expressed at a lower level. To further characterize these receptors, the signaling response of the mutant (Cys317 → Stop, Y293A, and Y293F) and WT receptors was measured by IP accumulation (Fig. 3 A). In COS-7 cells, hPAFR-induced IP production would be mediated by PLCβ1 activation via Gq/11 as the IP production is not blocked by pertussis toxin or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (44Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were exposed for 30 s to graded concentrations of PAF, and total IP accumulation was measured. As shown, the Cys317→ Stop deletion of the cytoplasmic tail did not impair the response of the receptor. Since nearly half the potential phosphorylation sites of the cytoplasmic tail were eliminated by this deletion, the slightly augmented response of this mutant could reflect the role played by these residues in controlling the response to PAF. On the other hand, the Y293A mutant did not generate an IP response, except at very high concentrations of PAF (1 μm). In contrast, the substitution of Y293F had no significant effect on the response of the receptor. When conditions of transfection are such that low levels of hPAFR receptors are expressed (44Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), receptors can be observed in both a G-protein-coupled state (high affinity) and uncoupled state (low affinity). As shown in Fig. 3 B, under these conditions of receptor expression, the mutant Y293A appears to exist only in its uncoupled, low affinity state, when compared with the WT, which might explain its inability to activate PLC after PAF stimulation. The effects of different inhibitors of internalization on receptor sequestration and endocytosis of 3H-PAF are illustrated in Fig. 4. After a 20-min stimulation of stably transfected hPAFR-CHO cells with 0.5 μm PAF, sequestration was studied by confocal microscopy with an antibody raised against a peptide sequence of the C-terminal portion of the hPAFR (Fig. 4 A). Cells were pretreated with medium (a and c) or with hyperosmolar concentration of sucrose (b and d) to block clathrin-mediated internalization before stimulation with PAF (c andd). PAF induced the translocation of receptors toward the intracellular compartment (c), whereas sucrose blocked the process of hPAFR sequestration (d). In addition, sucrose as well as other inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis significantly blocked the internalization of3H-PAF (Fig. 4 B), indicating that receptor-specific endocytosis of PAF is mediated via clathrin-coated vesicles. Fig. 4 C shows that inhibition of PAFR endocytosis was not a nonspecific effect of the inhibitors on ligand binding or receptor signal transduction. The level of IP accumulation was measured after PAF stimulation in the presence of the inhibitors, which, except for phenylarsine oxide, did not significantly inhibit PAFR response. In fact, the apparent decrease in PAF-induced response in cells pretreated with phenylarsine oxide was due to enhanced basal levels of IP production. The different mutants were compared with the WT receptor for their capacity to internalize 3H-PAF (Fig. 5). The Lys298 → Stop mutant was used as a control for non-receptor-mediated3H-PAF internalization since it did not detectably bind PAF. The results indicate that the majority of mutants that are uncoupled from G-proteins (Fig. 5 A) were impaired in their capacity to internalize PAF, except for the Y293A mutant. This mutant indicated that receptor signalization does not participate in ligand-mediated internalization of hPAFR. Although PAF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in guinea pig PAFR-transfected CHO cells was reported to be pertussis toxin-sensitive (47Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), internalization of human PAFR in stably transfected CHO cells was not affected by pertussis toxin treatment (data not illustrated). In contrast, the Cys317 → Stop mutant was impaired in its capacity to mediate PAF internalization (Fig. 5 B), despite its efficient signal transduction, indicating that the last 26 amino acids of the C-terminal tail could be important for internalization. As Cys317 → Stop is expressed less than the WT, we expressed the WT at different levels and compared the internalization. When the WT is expressed at 30% maximal level (comparable to Cys317→ Stop expression), its internalization is only 25% less than maximal WT internalization, whereas Cys317 → Stop internalizes 90% less than the WT. In addition, our results indicate (Fig. 5 B) that the substitution of the residues Asp289 or Tyr293, within the putative internalization motifs (N/D)P(X)2,3Y and YXXΦ, by conserved residues (Asn and Phe, respectively) partially decreased but did not abolish the potential for internalization. Phosphorylation by PKC does not appear to be involved in the initiation or control of PAFR internalization. Modulation of PKC activity by inhibitors (calphostin C, staurosporine, and H7) or an activator, in its active 4β-PMA or inactive 4α-PMA form, did not affect PAF-induced internalization (Fig. 6). In agreement with data obtained by Takano et al. (50Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a truncated guinea pig PAF receptor, our data indicate that the last 26 amino acids of the C-terminal end of the hPAFR are not required"
https://openalex.org/W2067915381,"Transport of reduced folates in murine leukemia cells is mediated by the bidirectional reduced folate carrier (RFC1) and independent unidirectional exit pumps. RFC1 has been proposed to be intrinsically equilibrating, generating transmembrane gradients by exchange with inorganic and organic anions. This paper defines the role of high level carrier expression, through transfection with RFC1 cDNA, on concentrative transport of the folate analog, methotrexate (MTX) in murine L1210 leukemia cells. RFC1 was expressed in the MTXrA line, which lacks a functional endogenous carrier to obtain the MTXrA-R16 clonal derivative. Influx was increased ∼9-fold in MTXrA-R16 cells without a change in Km. The efflux rate constant was increased by a factor of 5.1 relative to L1210 cells, and this resulted in only a 2.1-fold increase in the steady-state level of free intracellular MTX, [MTX]i, when [MTX]e was 1 μm. The concentrative advantage for RFC1 (the ratio of [MTX]i in MTXrA-R16 to L1210 cells) increased from 1.8 at 0.1 μm MTX to 3.8 at an [MTX]elevel of 30 μm. Augmented transport in MTXrA-R16 cells was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in accumulation of MTX polyglutamate derivatives and a ∼50% decrease in the EC50 for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid and the MTX IC50 relative to L1210 cells. These alterations paralleled changes in [MTX]i and not the much larger change in influx at low [MTX]e levels, consistent with the critical role that free intracellular folates and drug play in meeting cellular needs for folates and as a determinant of antifolate activity, respectively. The data indicate that RFC1 produces a large and near symmetrical increase in the bidirectional fluxes of MTX resulting in only a small increase in the transmembrane chemical gradient at low extracellular folate levels. Hence, increased expression of RFC1, alone, may not be an efficient adaptive response to folate deprivation, and other factors may come into play to account for the marked increases in concentrative folate transport which occur when cells are subjected to low folate-selective pressure. Transport of reduced folates in murine leukemia cells is mediated by the bidirectional reduced folate carrier (RFC1) and independent unidirectional exit pumps.

The membrane transport of folates and antifolates in L1210 murine leukemia cells is mediated by several distinct processes. The reduced folate carrier mediates the bidirectional fluxes of reduced folates (1Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Goldman I.D. Membrane Transport of Antineoplastic agents. Pergamon Press, Oxford, U.

Nutr. 1990; 10: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Under conditions of low folate-selective pressure, folate receptors can be expressed which are anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinosital moiety and translocate folates into L1210 cells via an endocytotic process (5Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7842-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Finally, there are two independent pumps that export folates (7Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3779-3785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14746-14752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Saxena M. Henderson G.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 975-982Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The properties of the reduced folate carrier have been characterized in detail based largely upon studies with the folate analog methotrexate (MTX). 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; RFC, reduced folate carrier; GAT, glycine, adenosine, thymidine; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; [MTX]e and [MTX]i, extracellular and free intracellular MTX levels, respectively. This carrier is not directly linked to energy metabolism and has a high affinity for reduced folates and 4-aminoantifolates but a low affinity for oxidized folates such as folic acid (1Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Of particular interest, but least well understood, is the impact of the carrier on transmembrane folate gradients. Uphill folate transport is generated through an anion exchange mechanism linked to the transmembrane organic phosphate gradient (10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. Dembo M. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Under steady-state conditions an electrochemical potential difference for free MTX (a bivalent anion) across the cell membrane is observed ([MTX]i > [MTX]e) which decreases as the extracellular drug concentration increases and the carrier saturates (1Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of the transmembrane folate gradient achieved is modulated further by the energy status of the cells through the activity of the independent exit pumps that are highly sensitive to the energy charge of the cell (7Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3779-3785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, glucose depresses and metabolic poisons increase the free intracellular MTX level through their respective stimulation and inhibition of the exit pumps (7Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3779-3785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar,14Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M.

This paper focuses, for the first time, on the role that RFC1 plays in concentrative transport within the context of a highly quantitative analysis of the transport properties of an L1210 murine leukemia cell line, MTXrA-R16, which expresses a high level of RFC1. This line was derived from MTXrA in which endogenous carrier is present at the cell surface but is not functional because of a point mutation in RFC1 (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTXrA-R16 is therefore a model for studying the properties and consequences of a quantifiable level of RFC1 distinct from the properties of the endogenous transporter. The specific issues addressed are: (i) the impact of RFC1 expression on the transmembrane fluxes of MTX and on MTX gradients achieved and (ii) how these parameters correlate with the level of polyglutamyl derivatives formed and changes in the cellular growth requirements for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid and growth inhibition by MTX. Finally, the properties of MTX transport in RFC1-transfected cells are analyzed within the context of what has been reported in cell lines in which carrier-mediated transport is enhanced under conditions of low folate-selective pressure (24Sirotnak F.M.

[3′,5′,7-3H]MTX was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography before use (27Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final specific radioactivity used in transport experiments was 170 dpm/pmol. [carboxyl-14C]Inulin (2.34 mCi/g) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Authentic polyglutamate standards were a gift from Dr. J. Bertino (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). All other reagents were obtained in the highest purity available from various commercial companies. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid, supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 2 mmglutamine, 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For some experiments, cells were grown in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as above and with 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum, 200 μm glycine, 100 μm adenosine, and 10 μm thymidine (GAT). MTXrA-R16 was obtained by transfection of MTXrA with a cDNA encoding the murine reduced folate carrier as reported previously (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Transfection of L1210 cells with RFC1 cDNA produced the L1210-T2 clone that was used in some experiments. This was achieved with the same cDNA and experimental strategy. Briefly, ∼1 × 107 L1210 cells were electroporated (250 V, 200 microfarads) with BglII-linearized pPGK-RFC1(21). Transfected cells were selected in RPMI 1640 medium containing G418 (750 μg/ml). The L1210-T2 line was isolated by dilution cloning. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 30 μg of RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels. Transfer and hybridization were performed as described previously (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) except that the transferred RNA was fixed with a Stratalinker UV cross-linker, (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells grown in 96-well plates (1 × 105 cells/ml) were exposed continuously to the appropriate concentrations of MTX, folic acid, or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate for 72 h after which cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer count and viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were grown in folate-free medium containing GAT for 2 weeks before the assessment of folic acid and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate growth requirements. Influx measurements were performed by methods described previously (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice with HBS (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and resuspended in HBS to 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min after which uptake was initiated by the addition of [3H]MTX and samples taken at the indicated times. Uptake was terminated by injection of 1 ml of the cell suspension into 10 ml of ice-cold HBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold HBS, and processed for determination of intracellular tritium (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For most influx determinations uptake intervals were adjusted so that cell MTX did not exceed the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity assuring that unidirectional uptake conditions were sustained. At high [MTX]e concentrations in transfected cells uptake was so rapid that intracellular levels sometimes exceeded the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity, but under these conditions uptake was always shown to represent initial rates. For influx determinations in L1210 and MTXrA-R16 cells, intracellular tritium was 250–1,000 dpm. Under steady-state conditions intracellular tritium was 1,800 and 2,600 dpm in L1210 and MTXrA-R16 cells, respectively. Intracellular water was determined as reported previously using [carboxyl-14C]inulin as the extracellular marker (15Fyfe M.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5067-5073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For efflux measurements cells were loaded with [3H]MTX, a small portion was taken for measurement of intracellular MTX, and the remaining cells were separated by centrifugation and resuspended into a large volume of MTX-free buffer. Samples of L1210 and RFC1-transfected cells were obtained every 10 or 60 s, respectively, injected into 10 ml of ice-cold HBS, separated by centrifugation, washed twice, and then processed for intracellular tritium. The dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity was the level of MTX remaining in cells after efflux for 30–45 min, an interval sufficient to allow for the exit of all free drug. Cells grown for 3–7 days in folate-free RPMI medium containing GAT were harvested and resuspended at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in fresh medium containing 0.1 μm [3H]MTX. After a 14-h incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold HBS. One portion of the cells was assayed for total antifolate. The larger portion was extracted with 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 4 °C, then neutralized by the addition of 0.25 ml of 1 mNaH2PO4 and 0.15 ml of 6 m NaOH. After separating the precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (28Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Freemantle S.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Authentic MTX-Glu(1–6) standards were included in the samples and the fractions monitored by UV absorbance (280 nm). Fig. 1 is an analysis of the level of endogenous and transfected RFC1 mRNA in the cell lines probed with the full-length murine RFC1 cDNA (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based upon Northern blot determinations of four separate RNA preparations, the mRNA levels were comparable in MTXrA-R16 and L1210-T2 cells and exceeded the level in L1210 cells by factors of 6.8 ± 1.3 and 6.7 ± 0.4, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, when the extracellular MTX level is 1 μm the rate and extent of MTX uptake in the MTXrA-R16 transfectant are increased. Steady-state levels of MTX are reached rapidly in the MTXrA-R16 cells (∼10 min) with about twice that duration required to achieve steady state in L1210 cells. The free intracellular MTX level (indicated by thedouble-headed arrows) is increased by a factor of about 2 in the MTXrA-R16 line based upon the difference between total drug and tightly bound MTX determined when cells are separated by centrifugation and resuspended in MTX-free buffer. As indicated in Fig. 2 B, the initial uptake rate in MTXrA-R16 cells is increased markedly.Figure 2Panel A, representative time course of the net uptake of MTX in L1210 and MTXrA-R16 cells. Cells were exposed to 1 μm [3H-MTX] at time zero and the time course of uptake monitored (closed symbols).

Cells were exposed to [3H-MTX] at time zero, and samples of the suspension were taken for cell MTX determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Efflux of MTX is enhanced in MTXrA-R16 cells as well. When cells are loaded with MTX and then cellular levels are determined upon resuspension into MTX-free buffer, free MTX is cleared from MTXrA-R16 cells within 2 min. Efflux is much slower in L1210 cells (Fig. 3 A). When the efflux of free drug is analyzed by subtracting the bound fraction from total MTX, differences in the efflux rate constants can be derived from the slope of the semilogarithmic plot as shown in Fig. 3 B. The efflux rate constant for MTX in the MTXrA-R16 line is increased markedly. Table I summarizes transport parameters along with other cellular properties in MTXrA-R16 and L1210 cells from four separate experiments in which the extracellular MTX level was 1 μm. The tightly bound fractions are comparable; the ratio of the intracellular water to dry weight is slightly increased in MTXrA-R16 cells. Overall, at this extracellular MTX level, MTX influx is increased by a factor of 9.1, the efflux rate constant is increased by a factor of 5.1, and steady-state [MTX]i is increased by a factor of only 2.1 in MTXrA-R16 cells. Hence, the major impact of the increased expression of RFC1 is a marked increase in the bidirectional fluxes of MTX (influx > efflux) with a much smaller change in the free drug level achieved.Table IComparison of MTX transport between L1210 and MTXr A-R16 cellsL1210MTXr A-R16ΔfoldInitial uptake rate (nmol/min/g dry wt)1.03 ± 0.079.35 ± 0.689.1Efflux rate constant (min−1)0.13 ± 0.050.64 ± 0.105.1Total cell MTX (nmol/g dry wt)7.07 ± 0.3310.15 ± 0.231.4Bound MTX (nmol/g dry wt)4.50 ± 0.094.35 ± 0.071.0Free MTX (nmol/g dry wt)2.56 ± 0.435.82 ± 0.182.3[H2O]i/dry wt (μl/mg)3.52 ± 0.063.86 ± 0.171.1[MTX]i(μm)0.73 ± 0.121.51 ± 0.052.1Transport parameters were measured at [MTX]e = 1 μm.

The extent to which transport properties associated with the overexpression of RFC1 in MTXrA-R16 cells might be influenced by the characteristics of the MTXrA line from which it was derived was assessed. Parent L1210 cells were transfected with RFC1 cDNA and a clone obtained, L1210-T2, with a comparable increase in carrier expression (Fig. 1). Changes in initial uptake rate and steady-state levels achieved in L1210-T2 cells were similar to what was observed in MTXrA-R16 cells (data not shown). Hence, the uptake characteristics produced by overexpression of RFC1 were not unique to the MTXrA-R16 line. MTX influx kinetic parameters determined by the methods of Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee were identical. Based upon three separate experiments, the influx Km for L1210 and MTXrA-R16 cells was identical (5.7 ± 1.0 and 5.8 ± 1.8 μm, respectively). The Vmaxwas increased by a factor of 8.4 in MTXrA-R16 relative to L1210 cells (69.0 ± 9.1 and 8.2 ± 0.78 nmol/g dry weight/min, respectively), comparable to the increase in influx as indicated in Table I. As reported previously for L1210 cells (1Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when [MTX]e is increased the steady-state intracellular MTX concentration approaches maximum values of 8.8 and 41.4 μm, for L1210 and MTXrA-R16 cells, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Further, the concentrating capacity of MTXrA-R16 cells is increased relative to that of L1210 cells over this 300-fold concentration range (Fig. 4 B). Hence, the concentrating advantage,i.e. the ratio of the steady-state [MTX]i levels in MTXrA-R16 to L1210 lines, increased from 1.8 at 0.1 μm to 3.8 at 30 μm MTX. The maximum concentrating advantage for MTXrA-R16 cells based upon the predicted maximum intracellular levels indicated above is 4.8. The monoglutamyl MTX substrate level, controlled by the membrane transport system, is one key determinant of the rate of formation of its polyglutamate derivatives (27Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fry D.W. Anderson L.A. Borst M. Goldman I.D. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1087-1092PubMed Google Scholar). The impact of increased carrier expression on MTX polyglutamate formation was evaluated in MTXrA-R16 cells at the lowest feasible extracellular drug level to approximate those conditions at which cytotoxicity is determined (see below). When cells are incubated with 0.1 μm MTX over 14 h, there is a ∼20% increase in the total antifolate level in MTXrA-R16 cells (representing free, bound, mono-, and polyglutamyl forms of drug). There is, however, a nearly 2-fold increase in the total polyglutamate level in the transfectant (Fig. 5). The major derivative in L1210 cells is the triglutamate, whereas the major derivatives in the MTXrA-R16 line are the tri- and tetraglutamates with appreciable levels of the pentaglutamate as well. The monoglutamate level in the MTXrA-R16 (1.2 nmol/g dry weight) is only a small fraction of the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity (4.5 nmol/g dry weight), indicating that the drug is replaced on the enzyme by the larger levels of polyglutamyl congeners within these cells. Monoglutamyl MTX bound to dihydrofolate reductase in L1210 cells was also replaced by the polyglutamyl forms but less so than in MTXrA-R16 cells. Of particular interest was the impact that increased carrier expression might have on MTX growth inhibition in MTXrA-R16 cells. Would the pharmacologic effect of this agent parallel the large changes in influx or the much smaller change in the free MTX level achieved? As indicated in Fig. 6 A, the MTX IC50decreased by a factor of less than 2 in MTXrA-R16 cells, comparable to the increase in [MTX]i at low levels of [MTX]e (Table I and Fig. 4) and much less than the increase in influx of the drug. Similar to this finding, the EC50for both 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (Fig. 6 B) and folic acid (Fig. 6 C) also decreased by a factor of less than 2. The membrane transport of physiological substrates and antineoplastic agents is often considered within the context of how rapidly drugs enter cells. This, alone, can be an important determinant of the rate of biosynthetic processes and drug activity if, at the extracellular levels achieved, transport is rate-limiting to a critical metabolic event within the intracellular compartment such as, for instance, the metabolism of the substrate or agent to an impermeant derivative. For MTX and related antifolates, influx is a major determinant of the free drug level achieved, the critical determinant of cytotoxicity which is controlled by the membrane transport systems (30Goldman I.D. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1977; 61: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar, 31White J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5722-5727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have quantitated and compared, for the first time, the impact of overexpression of high levels of RFC1 in L1210 leukemia cell lines on the bidirectional fluxes and net transport of MTX. The major focus of these studies is on the MTXrA-R16 transfectant derived from the MTXrA line. The latter is a derivative of L1210 cells resistant to MTX by virtue of an alanine to proline substitution within a predicted transmembrane domain which results in the immobilization of the reduced folate carrier (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This model cell line provided the opportunity for evaluating the transport capacity and properties of RFC1 distinct from the properties of the endogenous transporter. As expected, increased expression of RFC1 produced a large change in the rate of MTX transport into cells. In fact, the 8–9-fold increase in influx in the MTXrA-R16 line approximated the increase in the RFC1 mRNA level as determined by Northern blot analysis. This increase in influx did not, however, translate into a comparable increase in the steady-state free intracellular MTX level achieved. Indeed, at low extracellular MTX levels, the major change that RFC1 produces is a large, near symmetrical, increase in the bidirectional fluxes of MTX. Based upon the increase in the influxVmax for MTX, the net cycling of carrier is more than 8-fold faster in MTXrA-R16 than L1210 cells. There was no change in the influx Km. The small (2-fold) difference between the increase in the influxVmax and the efflux rate constants is consistent with the small but comparable ∼2-fold increase in the net accumulation of MTX in MTXrA-R16 cells. However, as the extracellular MTX level was increased, the concentrating capacity of the transfected cells relative to L1210 cells increased with a maximum achievable gradient difference of nearly 5. This is a level still ∼half the increase in the influx Vmax. Changes in MTX cytotoxicity mirror the changes in accumulation of the drug and not the rate that MTX enters cells in that the IC50 for MTX dropped by a factor of less than 2 in the MTXrA-R16 line. This is consistent with the concept that transport of MTX into cells at the low concentrations utilized in these studies must be much faster than the rate of polyglutamylation to its less permeable derivatives, a phenomenon that was recently shown to be the case at MTX levels at least as low as 0.1 μm (28Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Freemantle S.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further, if drug entry was rate-limiting, then the marked difference in MTX influx between L1210 and MTXrA-R16 cells would result in a similar difference in the rate and extent of formation of polyglutamates. Instead, differences in the accumulation of polyglutamyl derivatives mirror differences in the free monoglutamyl drug levels achieved. Likewise, the 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid growth requirements, as reflected in the EC50, were also decreased by a factor of only 2. Hence, influx must not be rate-limiting to the utilization of these folates under physiological conditions, and free folate levels must be sustained during growth. It is of considerable interest that the change in folic acid growth requirement is exactly the same as that observed for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, suggesting that despite the low affinity of folic acid for the RFC, transport by this route can be an important mechanism of transport for this oxidized folate when expression of RFC1 is sufficiently high. The data also indicate that when cells are deprived of reduced folates, overexpression of RFC1, alone, is not an efficient mechanism of adaptation because this has only a small salutary effect on the free folate level achieved. RFC1 has the characteristics of a large family of membrane-spanning proteins that transport a variety of substrates across cell membranes and do not contain an ATP binding region so that transport is not linked directly to ATP hydrolysis (32Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 33Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N.

Some of these carriers are equilibrating; they facilitate translocation across the cell membrane but do not produce uphill transport (32Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Others are coupled to some other transmembrane gradients and produce uphill transport such as the sodium-dependent iodide and nucleoside transporters (33Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar,34Huang Q.-Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17757-17760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RFC-mediated transport is not sodium-dependent (10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Rather, MTX transport is highly sensitive to the anionic composition of its environment, and virtually any negatively charged species inhibits influx of this agent when present at a high enough concentration. The reduced folate carrier demonstrates a high degree of structural specificity for folates, and there is a spectrum of inhibitory activity observed with structurally unrelated anionic compounds as well. In general, the greater the negative charge, the greater the inhibitory effect. Organic anions are more inhibitory than inorganic anions; the most potent inhibitors are the organic phosphates (10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. Dembo M. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies from this laboratory suggested a model in which the organic phosphate gradient across the cell membrane, through its interaction with carrier, acts as a battery that drives MTX uphill into cells (10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies further supported this concept (36Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 38Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 493-502Google Scholar). According to this paradigm organic phosphates that accumulate within cells inhibit efflux of folates much more than influx is inhibited by extracellular inorganic anions. This asymmetrical inhibition of the bidirectional fluxes results in uphill transport of folates into cells (10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This interaction would not be immediately perturbed by metabolic poisons that decrease the cellular energy charge but not the net organic anion level as phosphate and ADP, both inhibitors of the carrier (10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), are released in the hydrolysis of ATP. This would account for the maintenance, indeed, enhancement of uphill MTX transport under conditions in which cells are energy-depleted (7Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3779-3785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M.

In Ll210 cells then, the free MTX level achieved will be determined by the mobility and number of carriers, the composite anion gradient across the cell membrane, and the relative potency of the independent exit pumps (see the Introduction). As carrier cycling increases relative to efflux via the exit pumps, as occurs with increased carrier expression in transfected cells and with increasing extracellular MTX levels, the relative contribution to the net transport of MTX by the exit pumps decreases, and the free intracellular MTX level rises. Ultimately, when efflux via the pumps becomes negligible compared with efflux mediated by the carrier, the transmembrane MTX gradient increases to a level determined solely by the interaction among inorganic and organic anions, MTX and the reduced folate carrier. Of particular interest is the comparison between these observations and the data obtained when carrier expression is enhanced under low 5-formyltetrahydrofolate-selective pressure. Studies from three laboratories have demonstrated that under these conditions there are marked increases in MTX influx because of an increase in the influxVmax, with little or no change in the efflux rate constant, thereby resulting in a marked increase in the free drug level achieved and the generation of large transmembrane gradients for MTX (24Sirotnak F.M. Moccio D.M. Yang C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13139-13144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J.

As indicated above, the most efficient adaptation to low 5-formyltetrahydrofolate-selective pressure would be one that results in a large increase in the free folate level. Theasymmetrical change in the bidirectional fluxes of MTX obtained with low folate-selective pressure is different from the moresymmetrical changes observed with the transfection of RFC1 into L1210 cells. The basis for this difference is not clear. It is possible that another protein element is expressed, or RFC1 is modified, such that uphill folate transport is increased through the suppression of carrier-mediated efflux, when cells are exposed to low folate-selective pressure. Alternatively, folate deprivation, although increasing carrier expression, might produce a secondary depression in the exit pumps (39Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) holding the net kinetics of the efflux processes essentially constant. The near symmetrical changes in the bidirectional fluxes in MTXrA-R16 cells with only a small increase in net transport at low [MTX]e levels cannot be attributed to the unique properties of the MTXrA line from which the RFC1-transfected subline was derived since a similar phenomenon is observed in the L1210 derivative, L1210-T2, expressing a comparable high level of carrier."

While an assessment of receptor binding using cell adhesion and purified integrin solid-phase assays demonstrated recognition of recombinant RGD kistrin by αVβ3 and α5β1, a series of LDV kistrin chimeras did not bind to these integrins, but instead were recognized specifically by α4β1.

Cell-surface adhesion receptors mediate the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that are fundamental to normal cell behavior and tissue organization. The integrins, a superfamily of structurally related αβ heterodimers, represent a major class of adhesion receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hynes R.

Many studies of the molecular basis of integrin-ligand binding have now been performed, and frequently, integrins have been found to recognize short peptide motifs within their ligands. The RGD motif, which contains a critical aspartate residue, was first identified in the central cell-binding domain of fibronectin (5Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the recognition of the RGD sequence are complex since it binds to a number of different integrins, and receptor specificity varies between different matrix molecules. A second peptide motif, LDV, present within the alternatively spliced CS1 sequence of the IIICS region of fibronectin, also contains a crucial aspartate and is primarily recognized by integrin α4β1 (8Wayner E.A.

In addition, the insertion of peptide motifs into nonadhesive protein scaffolds has previously been reported to generate adhesive activity. The RGD sequence has been incorporated into a long exposed loop within human lysozyme by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant mutant protein was able to promote cell adhesion (20Yamada T.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and nonfunctional RGD and LDV sequences are also present in many molecules. The affinity and selectivity of linear peptides can be improved by the introduction of a conformational constraint, for example, by cyclization (7Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. Jackson S.A. Ramachandran N.S. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in conformation, flanking residues, and the use of synergy sequences may all contribute to the binding specificities of different integrin-ligand combinations. A conformationally constrained, functional RGD motif is also found within many disintegrins, a family of naturally occurring polypeptide integrin antagonists present in snake venoms (for reviews, see Refs.27Blobel C.P.

Disintegrins inhibit platelet aggregation by blocking the adhesive function of integrin αIIbβ3 (30Dennis M.S. Henzel W.J. Pitti R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Deisher T.A. Bunting S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2471-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), but are also able to disrupt the adhesive functions of other RGD-dependent integrins and are therefore relatively nonspecific (31Knudsen K.A. Tuszynski G.P. Huang T.-F. Niewiarowski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Rucinski B. Niewiarowski S. Holt J. Soszka T. Knudsen K.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Int. 1995; 35: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar). It is notable that disintegrins are up to 1000-fold more potent than linear RGD-containing peptides (34Mould A.P. Komoriya A. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3579-3585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably because the RGD sequence exists in a favorable conformation at the apex of a long loop across the surface of the molecule (35Adler M. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. Wagner G. Science. 1991; 253: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The disintegrin molecule may be considered as a model scaffold for the presentation of an integrin recognition motif, and in this study, we have examined the effects of engineering the replacement of the RGD sequence in the disintegrin kistrin with LDV to assess whether it is possible to retain potency in an integrin antagonist while altering specificity. We have reported in preliminary form the design of synthetic kistrin cDNA and the expression of the molecule as a recombinant protein in which specific residues or segments can be mutated to create chimeric kistrins (36Green L.J.

Mouse mAb HP2/1 (IgG), recognizing the human integrin α4 subunit, was purchased from Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, United Kingdom). LM609 mAb (ascites), recognizing human integrin αVβ3, was a gift from D. A. Cheresh (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), and mAb 17E6 (IgG), recognizing the human integrin αV subunit, was from S. Goodman (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Mouse anti-human mAb P1E6 (ascites), recognizing the integrin α2 subunit, was obtained from GIBCO (Paisley, Scotland). All anti-integrin antibodies used were function-blocking, with the exception of mAb 11. An 80-kDa fragment of plasma fibronectin containing the central cell-binding domain was generated as described (38Garcia-Pardo A. Ferreira O.C. Valinsky J. Bianco C. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). H/120, a recombinant fragment of fibronectin containing the HepII/IIICS region, was produced as described (39Makarem R.

Integrin α4β1 was isolated from the MOLT-4 human T lymphoblastic cell line as described (39Makarem R. Newham P. Askari J.A. Green L.J. Clements J. Edwards M. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Kistrin cDNA was generated from complementary oligonucleotides designed from the protein sequence using Escherichia coli codon usage data. BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites were incorporated at the ends of the cDNA sequence to allow cloning into the phagemid vector pUC118. Internal BspMII,NarI, BglII, and KspI restriction sites were also incorporated to allow exchange of different segments of the molecule (Fig. 1). The complementary phosphorylated oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the dephosphorylated vector pUC118. Competent E. coli DH5αF′ cells were transformed with the ligation product, and the kistrin cDNA sequence was verified before subcloning into the pGEX2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Milton Keynes, UK) using the same restriction sites. DH5αF′ cells were transformed, and glutathioneS-transferase-kistrin fusion proteins were induced and isolated as described (41Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 40-ml overnight culture of transformed DH5αF′ cells was diluted 1:10 with fresh LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and cultured for 1 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1m and cultured for a further 4 h. Cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in divalent cation-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by sonication. The extract was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a glutathione-agarose affinity column (Sigma, Poole, UK) pre-equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the fusion protein was eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The glutathioneS-transferase carrier was removed by cleavage with human thrombin (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:500 (w/w). A second glutathione-agarose column was used to separate kistrin from GST, with the kistrin appearing in the column flow-through fraction. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay (Pierce, Chester, UK), and peak fractions were stored at −70 °C. The segment of cDNA encoding the kistrin RGD loop was removed by digestion withBglII and KspI restriction endonucleases and replaced with a double-stranded insert encoding a mutant sequence. The insert was generated from two complementary oligonucleotides that were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated into the dephosphorylated vector. Competent DH5αF′ cells were transformed with the ligation product, and the correct sequence was verified before expression of the mutant kistrins as described above. The purity of the recombinant kistrins was assessed by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris/Tricine buffer system (42Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). The fidelity of bacterial translation and thrombin cleavage were validated by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy. Prior to analysis, recombinant kistrin was dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Approximately 1-nmol samples were sequenced by automated Edman degradation and high pressure liquid chromatography using a Model 476A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). The sequence obtained for recombinant kistrin was GSGKEXDXS(G/S)PENPXXD, which is identical to that of authentic kistrin with the exception of the ambiguous position, which is actually Ser, and the initial Gly and Ser, which are derived from the GST fusion partner following thrombin cleavage. The four unidentified residues (X) are cysteines that are destroyed during sequencing. Recombinant kistrins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a VG-TofSpec E spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Manchester, UK). A mass of 7469 obtained for recombinant RGD kistrin was within 0.1% of the calculated mass of 7474.5 based on the amino acid sequence. For ILDV kistrin, the value of 7451 obtained was also within 0.1% of the calculated mass of 7474.5. Assays were performed using a method based on that of Charo et al. (43Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The 80-kDa fragment of fibronectin (500 μg/ml in PBS) or the H/120 recombinant fragment of fibronectin (450 μg/ml) was biotinylated by mixing with an equal mass of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce). After rotary mixing for 40 min at room temperature, excess biotin was removed from the mixture by dialyzing against several changes of 150 mmNaCl and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. A 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Immulon-3, Dynatech, Billingshurst, UK) was incubated overnight at room temperature with 100-μl aliquots of purified integrins diluted with PBS to a concentration of ∼5 μg/ml. The wells were then blocked with 200 μl of 5% (w/v) BSA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA (buffer A). 100-μl aliquots of biotinylated H/120 (∼0.2 μg/ml), diluted with buffer A, with or without recombinant kistrins, were then added to the wells and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Unbound biotinylated ligand was removed, and the wells were washed three times with buffer A. Bound ligand was quantitated by addition of 100 μl of ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) diluted 1:200 in buffer A for 10 min at room temperature, following which the wells were washed four times with buffer A. The color was developed by addition of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma), and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined from the level of ligand binding to BSA alone, and these values were subtracted from those obtained with integrin-coated wells. Each point represented the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. The A375-SM human melanoma cell line (provided by I. J. Fidler, M. D. Anderson Hospital and University of Texas, Houston, TX) was maintained as described (44Kozlowski J.M. Hart I.R. Fidler I.J. Hanna N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1984; 72: 913-917PubMed Google Scholar) in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, minimal essential medium vitamins, nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, UK) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 2 mml-glutamine. Assays were performed as described by Humphries et al. (45Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K. Komoriya A. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2637-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) using 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, High Wycombe, Bucks, UK). Ligands were diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 100-μl aliquots were used to coat the wells for 1 h at room temperature. The ligand solution was then removed, and sites that could support nonspecific cell adhesion were blocked with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA (45Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K. Komoriya A. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2637-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the BSA was removed, and 50-μl aliquots of inhibitors in PBS were added. Cells were detached using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) EDTA and then washed and resuspended to 2 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. Cell suspensions were allowed to recover at 37 °C for 10 min before addition of 50-μl aliquots to the wells. Following incubation at 37 °C for 90 min in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2, cells were fixed with 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS. Using phase-contrast microscopy, the percentage of cells with a flattened, phase-dark morphology was estimated. Each point was obtained by counting 3 × 100 cells in random fields. No cell spreading was observed on wells coated only with heat-denatured BSA. The disintegrin kistrin was selected for use as a scaffold for the insertion of the LDV motif because the sequence of the RGD loop shows some homology to the LDV-containing CS1 sequence in fibronectin. In both sequences, the critical aspartate is immediately followed by a residue with a hydrophobic side chain, and a proline residue is present on either side of the motif: kistrin RGD loop sequence, RIPRGDMPDDR; and CS1 sequence,PEILDVPSTV. Synthetic kistrin cDNA was generated from overlapping oligonucleotides and expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli. Samples of recombinant kistrin (r-kistrin) from different stages of purification were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The r-kistrin was resolved as a slightly diffuse band of ∼7.5 kDa under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, which corresponds with its expected molecular mass. The band at 26 kDa was the major contaminant, but was removed by repeating the glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and therefore appeared to be GST (data not shown). Following the expression of kistrin as a recombinant protein, the activity of r-kistrin was compared with that of native kistrin isolated from venom. The ability of both molecules to inhibit the spreading of A375-SM cells on the RGD-containing 80-kDa fragment of fibronectin, which is recognized by integrins α5β1 and αVβ3, was examined (Fig. 3). Half-maximal inhibition of cell spreading was obtained at 2 μm for native kistrin and at 7 μm for the recombinant molecule. When compared with the published value of 100 μm for the linear peptide GRGDS (34Mould A.P. Komoriya A. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3579-3585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data demonstrate that both native and recombinant kistrins are potent integrin antagonists; they also suggest that the recombinant molecules are largely correctly folded. The biological activity of disintegrins appears to be dependent on correct disulfide bond-mediated folding, as suggested by the dramatic loss of activity following reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bonds, but nevertheless,E. coli appears to be a suitable host for their recombinant expression (31Knudsen K.A. Tuszynski G.P. Huang T.-F. Niewiarowski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 46Calvete J.J. Schafer W. Soszka T. Lu W. Cook J.J. Jameson B.A. Niewiarowski S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5225-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Having established the anti-adhesive activity of recombinant kistrin, the synthetic cDNA was used as a template for the creation of chimeras with different integrin recognition motifs. In the initial chimera targeting the RGD loop, the entire 11-residue loop sequence was removed by excision of the segment of cDNA encoding this region and replaced with a segment encoding an 11-amino acid sequence from the C-terminal end of the CS1 peptide of fibronectin. A second chimera in which the RGDM tetrapeptide sequence from the loop was replaced by ILDV was also generated, the minimal change needed to convert RGD to LDV. In further mutagenesis, the contribution of individual residues to the activity of the molecule was investigated by replacement with alanine. The active-site aspartate was retained in the same position as in the native kistrin sequence in all mutants. The amino acid sequences of the RGD loop were as follows: r-kistrin, CRIPRGDMPDDRC; CS1 kistrin, CGPEILDVPSTVC; ILDV kistrin, CRIPILDVPDDRC; ALDV kistrin, CRIPALDVPDDRC; IADV kistrin, CRIPIADVPDDRC; ILAV kistrin, CRIPILAVPDDRC; and AAAV kistrin, CRIPAAAVPDDRC. To compare the abilities of mutant kistrins to promote cell spreading, they were purified as fusion proteins retaining the GST carrier and immobilized on the surface of 96-well plates. A high maximal level (>95%) of HT-1080 cell spreading was observed on GST-r-kistrin containing the native sequence, with half-maximal spreading at a coating concentration of 1.1 μg/ml. HT-1080 cell spreading was not supported by any of the mutants (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Since A375-SM cells express integrin α4β1 and recognize the ILDV motif within the CS1 sequence of fibronectin, spreading assays were performed to determine whether these cells were able to recognize the ILDV motif in kistrin chimeras (Fig. 5). Dose-dependent promotion of spreading was observed, but activity varied between the different mutant kistrins. GST-r-kistrin supported up to 98% spreading, with half-maximal spreading observed at a coating concentration of 0.7 μg/ml. Half-maximal spreading was supported at 7.4 μg/ml by the ILDV kistrin chimera and at 19 μg/ml by the ALDV kistrin mutant. Cell spreading on either the IADV kistrin or CS1 kistrin fusion proteins reached a maximum of 20% at ∼200 μg/ml (data not shown). No cell spreading was observed on GST alone or on the two mutants AAAV kistrin and ILAV kistrin. The results of the cell spreading assay were mirrored by A375-SM cell attachment assays (data not shown). To investigate which receptors were used by the HT-1080 and A375-SM cells to spread on the kistrin chimeras, the effects of function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies were tested. The effects of anti-integrin antibodies on the spreading of HT-1080 cells on RGD kistrin are shown in Fig. 6. Spreading was partially inhibited by function-blocking anti-α5 (33%), anti-αV (43%), anti-β1 (46%), and anti-αVβ3 (40%) antibodies, but not by anti-α4 or anti-α2 antibodies. Substantial inhibition was observed when anti-β1 and anti-αVβ3 (97%) antibodies or when anti-α5 and anti-αV (95%) antibodies were used together. A combination of anti-α5 and anti-αVβ3 antibodies gave ∼77% inhibition of spreading. These data suggest that the receptors used by HT-1080 cells to recognize r-kistrin are integrins αVβ3, α5β1, and possibly αVβ1. Spreading of A375-SM cells on RGD kistrin (Fig. 7 A) was substantially inhibited by anti-αV (85%) and anti-αVβ3 (73%) antibodies and was slightly reduced by anti-α5 (14%) and anti-β1 (14%) antibodies. These data suggest that A375-SM cells employ αVβ3 as the primary receptor for r-kistrin, but that α5β1 may also have a minor contribution. A375-SM cell spreading on ILDV kistrin (Fig. 7 B),"

Bacteriophage λ protein phosphatase is also considered to be a member of this family based on sequence comparisons (Lohse, D. L., Denu, J. M., and Dixon, J. E. (1995)Structure 3, 987–990). Using EPR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that λ protein phosphatase accommodates a dinuclear metal center. Calcineurin and λ protein phosphatase likewise contain a conserved histidine that is not a metal ligand but is within 5 Å of either metal in calcineurin. In this study the conserved histidine in calcineurin was mutated to glutamine and the mutant protein analyzed by EPR spectroscopy and kinetic methods. Parallel studies with an analogous λ protein phosphatase mutant were also carried out. Kinetic studies using paranitrophenyl phosphate as substrate showed a decrease in kcat of 460- and 590-fold for the calcineurin and λ protein phosphatase mutants, respectively, compared with the wild type enzymes. With a phosphopeptide substrate, mutagenesis of the conserved histidine resulted in a decrease inkcat of 1,300-fold for calcineurin. With the analogous λ protein phosphatase mutant, kcatdecreased 530-fold compared with wild type λ protein phosphatase using phenyl phosphate as a substrate. EPR studies of the iron-reconstituted enzymes indicated that although both mutant enzymes can accommodate a dinuclear metal center, spectroscopic differences compared with wild type proteins suggest a perturbation of the ligand environment, possibly by disruption of a hydrogen bond between the histidine and a metal-coordinated solvent molecule. Calcineurin belongs to a family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases that contain active site dinuclear metal cofactors.

Calcineurin, also known as protein phosphatase 2B, consists of a 58-kDa catalytic subunit, calcineurin A, and a 19-kDa regulatory subunit, calcineurin B. It is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase whose activity is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin. Calcineurin is the target of the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 (1Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar, 2Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). These drugs bind to intracellular proteins, termed immunophilins; cyclophilin is the binding protein for cyclosporin A, and FK506 binds to the FK506-binding proteins. The complex of immunosuppressant drug and immunophilin in turn binds to and inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. Calcineurin inhibition prevents the transcriptional activation of the interleukin 2 gene in helper T cells, leading to suppression of the immune response. Calcineurin is a member of the class of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, whose members include protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; λPP, λ protein phosphatase; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; [P]-RII peptide, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the RII subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; λPP(H76N), λPP with asparagine in place of histidine at position 76; CN(H151Q), calcineurin with glutamine in place of histidine at position 151; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BME, β-mercaptoethanol.1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; λPP, λ protein phosphatase; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; [P]-RII peptide, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the RII subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; λPP(H76N), λPP with asparagine in place of histidine at position 76; CN(H151Q), calcineurin with glutamine in place of histidine at position 151; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BME, β-mercaptoethanol. and 2A (PP2A), phosphatases essential for a number of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells (3Cohen P.

A variety of experimental evidence indicates that this cluster in calcineurin is an Fe3+-Zn2+ center. Although little is known about the catalytic mechanism of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases, several pieces of experimental data indicate that the dinuclear metal center is a key component of the active site. First, x-ray crystallographic data of calcineurin and PP1 indicate that the dinuclear metal center has a ligand environment nearly identical to that of mammalian and plant purple acid phosphatases, enzymes that contain either dinuclear Fe-Fe or Fe-Zn centers that have been demonstrated to be essential for catalytic activity (14Kurtz Jr., D.M. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 585-606Crossref Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 15Vincent J.B. Olivier-Lilley G.L. Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1447-1467Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Second, these crystallographic studies indicate that the product of the reaction, phosphate, and the product analog, tungstate, directly coordinate both metal ions (10Egloff M.-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 11Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J.

Soc. 1995; 117: 10147-10148Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or Fe3+-Fe2+forms 2Yu, L., Golbeck, J., Yao, J., and Rusnak, F. (1997) Biochemistry, in press.2Yu, L., Golbeck, J., Yao, J., and Rusnak, F. (1997) Biochemistry, in press. of calcineurin indicate a correlation between enzyme activity and the oxidation state of the bound metal ions. In addition to the dinuclear metal center, there are several conserved amino acids within the active site which are likely to contribute to catalysis. One of these residues in calcineurin is histidine 151 (numbering based on the rat calcineurin Aα sequence (18Saitoh Y. Maeda S. Fukunaga K. Yasugawa S. Sakamoto Y. Uyemura K. Shimada K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. Biomed. Res. 1991; 12: 215-218Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). His-151 is not a ligand to either metal but is within 5 Å of both metal ions and is conserved in other metallophosphoesterases such as PP1 (histidine 125) and λPP (histidine 76) (7Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In one crystal structure, His-151 was modeled to participate in a hydrogen bond to a metal-coordinated solvent molecule (13Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The importance of this residue has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of both λPP and PP1 which found substantial effects on catalytic activity and/or protein stability. In this study the conserved histidine residue in calcineurin A, His-151, was changed to glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. After reconstitution with calcineurin B, the calcineurin H151Q heterodimer was purified to homogeneity. EPR spectroscopy was used to assess whether mutagenesis affected the ligand environment of the dinuclear metal center. Kinetic studies were also carried out using either pNPP or [P]-RII peptide as substrates. The analogous λPP mutant, H76N, was characterized by EPR in a similar fashion and assayed using either pNPP or phenyl phosphate. For both enzymes, mutagenesis resulted in decreases in kcat of 102–103. EPR spectroscopy of iron-reconstituted λPP confirms that this enzyme accommodates a dinuclear metal center as predicted for members of the metallophosphatase family. EPR also indicates that mutagenesis does not prevent assembly of the dinuclear metal center in either calcineurin H151Q or λPP(H76N). Nevertheless, differences observed in the EPR spectra of wild type versus mutant enzymes indicate a perturbation of the ligand environment, possibly by disruption of a hydrogen bond between the histidine and a metal-coordinated water molecule. Competent BL21(DE3) cells were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Bovine serum albumin, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, bovine pancreatic DNase I, type II, pNPP, phenyl phosphate, and Sephacryl S300 were purchased from Sigma. Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent and 8 m guanidine hydrochloride were from Pierce Chemical Co. [γ-32P]ATP (∼3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Calmodulin was prepared from bovine brain (19Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 20Dedman J.R.

PM30 and YM30 membranes and Centricon-30 concentrators were purchased from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Tryptone, yeast extract, and Luria Bertani medium were purchased from Difco. Sephadex NAP-25 columns were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The protein expression vectors used were pRCNAT77 (21Haddy A. Rusnak F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The construction of pT7-7 plasmids containing the genes for wild type and H76N mutant of λPP is described elsewhere (5Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The Wizard Maxipreps and Wizard Minipreps DNA purification kits and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The Geneclean II kit was purchased from BIO 101, Inc. (Vista, CA). The oligonucleotide required for site-directed mutagenesis was synthesized by the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility. RII peptide (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE) and [31P]-RII peptide (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVS(p)VAAE) were synthesized by the Mayo Clinic Protein Core Facility. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Pierce Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar). Alternatively, calcineurin concentrations were determined by UV-visible spectrophotometry (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) using ε281 = 50,000m−1 cm−1. Protein concentration values determined using this extinction coefficient agreed within 10% with concentrations determined by amino acid analysis. The H151Q mutation of calcineurin A, CN(H151Q), was created using a 5 Prime → 3 Prime MORPH site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (Boulder, CO). The primer 5′-GCCTACATTCCTGGTTTCCAC-3′, complementary to the coding strand of calcineurin A, was used for mutagenesis with the underlined bases representing the codon of the mutated residue. This primer was phosphorylated by T4 kinase and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Half-mutant plasmid DNA was subsequently transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BMH 71-18. Plasmid DNA isolated from colonies was screened for the desired mutation by DNA sequencing of the entire calcineurin A gene and yielded the expression plasmid pCNAT77(H151Q). The plasmid pCNAT77(H151Q) was transformed into competent BL21(DE3) cells. The growth of these cells, crude extract isolation, reconstitution with myristoylated calcineurin B, and purification of the calcineurin heterodimer were performed as described previously (21Haddy A. Rusnak F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 22Sikkink R. Haddy A. MacKelvie S. Mertz P. Litwiller R. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8348-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of wild type λPP was performed as described (5Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. After growth and induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,400 × g for 30 min, washed with 250 ml of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and recentrifuged at 4,200 × g for 20 min. The cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA (TGE buffer) and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell operating at 16,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 3 h. The supernatant (40 ml) was batch adsorbed onto 150 ml of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B preequilibrated with TGE buffer. The resin was washed in a fritted funnel with 300 ml of TGE and λPP eluted with TGE buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. Fractions containing λPP were pooled and precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. After centrifugation at 34,800 × g, the protein pellet was resuspended in TGE buffer + 0.5 mNaCl and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (20 × 1-cm diameter) previously equilibrated with TGE buffer + 0.5 mNaCl. The column was washed with 200–300 ml of the same buffer and then with 250 ml of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The enzyme was eluted with 250 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl in 50% glycerol, pH 7.5. Fractions were assayed using pNPP as a substrate, pooled, and stored at −70 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl and 50% glycerol, pH 7.5. The λPPT77(H76N) plasmid (25Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and single colonies used to inoculate 10 ml of Luria Bertani medium/ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) for overnight culture at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 5 liters of 2 × YT/ampicillin medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter NaCl, 0.05 g/liter ampicillin) in a New Brunswick Bioflo 3000 fermentor. Cells were grown overnight at 22 °C maintaining aeration at 30% of air saturation to a cell density that gave an absorbance at 595 nm of ∼9. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 0.4%, and the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Another aliquot of glucose was added to a final concentration of 0.4% when the cell density corresponded to an absorbance at 595 nm of 16. The cells were harvested 20 h postinduction by centrifugation at 3,400 × g for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in ∼2 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5/g of cells, wet weight. To this resuspension, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, 23 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100 were added sequentially with stirring on ice for 30 min followed by a freeze/thaw process to lyse the cells. To reduce the viscosity, MgCl2 (20 mm), DNase (0.1 unit/ml final concentration), and 2% protamine sulfate (1/6 total volume) were added sequentially with stirring on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h, the protein was purified as described above for wild type λPP. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Jasco J-710 circular dichroism spectrometer. A quartz cell of 0.0202-cm path length was used for all measurements. Mean residue ellipticities were calculated from the relationship θm = θobs/(10Cr l) where θm is the mean residue ellipticity, θobs is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and l is the path length of cell in cm. θm is measured in degree cm2 dmol−1. Samples of calcineurin (18 μm) and CN(H151Q) (24 μm) were examined in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m EGTA, 0.2 mm DTT. Calmodulin-dependent phosphatase activity of calcineurin and CN(H151Q) was measured using pNPP as a substrate at 30 °C in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, and 15–23 nm wild type calcineurin or 710 nm CN(H151Q). Wild type λPP and λPP(H76N) activities were measured at 30 °C in 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm DTT, 1 mmMnCl2, and 0.64 nm wild type λPP or 860 nm λPP(H76N). After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, reactions were started by the addition of pNPP. Specific activity was measured by following the increase in absorbance at 410 nm with time using ε410 = 7,180 m−1cm−1 at pH 7.0 and 14,400 m−1cm−1 at pH 7.8 based on a pKa of 7.17 and ε410 = 17,800 m−1cm−1 for the p-nitrophenolate anion. The concentration of pNPP was varied from 2 to 100 mm, and the kinetic parameters kcat andKm were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear least squares analysis method. RIIpeptide was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 833 μCi/μmol using the catalytic subunit of bovine cardiac cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase and purified as described (28Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 135-157Google Scholar). Assays were done as described (28Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 135-157Google Scholar) in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1–28 μm calmodulin, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. [32P]-RII peptide was diluted with [31P]-RII peptide and substrate added in final concentrations from 9 μm to 1 mm. Calcineurin concentrations were 10 nm for wild type and 7.7–15 μm for CN(H151Q). Data were obtained in duplicate and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by a nonlinear least squares analysis method. Assays were performed by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate released during hydrolysis of phenyl phosphate as described (29Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Assays were done in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mmMnCl2 and 10 mm DTT. Phenyl phosphate concentrations were varied from 1 to 70 mm for λPP and 1 to 90 mm for λPP(H76N). Wild type protein concentrations ranged from 7.0 to 630 nm, whereas λPP(H76N) concentrations ranged from 2.2 to 12 μm. Enzyme was incubated 30 °C, 5 min, and reactions started by the addition of phenyl phosphate. At various times from 0.5 to 7.0 min, 50 μl of the reaction was taken and added to 800 μl of a solution containing a 3:1 ratio of 0.045% malachite green hydrochloride to 4.2% ammonium molybdate in 4 n HCl. After 1 min, 100 μl of 34% sodium citrate was added and the absorbance at 660 nm measured. Free phosphate was determined from a standard curve prepared using solutions of KH2PO4. Kinetic parameters for λPP and λPP(H76N) were determined as described above. About 0.4 mg/ml CN(H151Q) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm magnesium acetate, 1.0 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, or 0.6 mg/ml λPP(H76N) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol was added to septum-sealed vials and made anaerobic by flushing repeatedly with oxygen-free argon. BME was added to a final concentration of 0.715 m and Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.375 mm. The solutions were flushed with argon and incubated an additional 17 h at room temperature. Samples were concentrated using YM30 membranes in an Amicon filtration cell to ∼ 2 ml; buffer exchanged over Sephadex NAP-25 gel filtration columns equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm BME; and concentrated using Centricon-30 membranes to ∼250 μl. Samples were then transferred to quartz EPR cuvettes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Iron-reconstituted forms of wild type calcineurin and λPP were prepared in a similar manner except that incubation proceeded at 4 °C for 17 h, and both enzymes were desalted into 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm BME prior to the final concentration step. To the iron-reconstituted EPR sample of CN(H151Q), a solution of 0.5m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added anaerobically to a final concentration of 20 mm, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer operating at 9 GHz (X-band) microwave frequency equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 continuous flow cryostat for temperature regulation. Background cavity resonances were subtracted from all spectra. Metal analysis was performed by the Mayo Clinic Metals Laboratory using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry. The relationship of His-151 in calcineurin relative to the dinuclear metal center can be seen in Fig. 1. His-151 was mutated to a glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the effect on enzyme activity and assembly of the dinuclear metal cofactor. The mutant calcineurin A subunit was expressed in E. coli in a fashion identical to that of the wild type calcineurin A subunit and reconstituted with myristoylated calcineurin B to generate the mutant protein CN(H151Q). The presence of the proper codon as well as the lack of inadvertently introduced mutations in the entire calcineurin A gene were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Although the yield of CN(H151Q) was less than that obtained for the wild type reconstituted protein, enough material could be obtained and purified to homogeneity for biochemical and spectroscopic (EPR) analyses. A typical purification yielded approximately 1 mg of CN(H151Q) protein/liter of cell culture. The analogous residue in λPP, identified by primary sequence comparisons as His-76 (7Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was mutated to an asparagine residue (25Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the λPP(H76N) protein was purified to homogeneity as described under “Methods” to yield approximately 17 mg/liter of culture. Circular dichroism analysis of wild type calcineurin and CN(H151Q) provided evidence for a native-like conformation of CN(H151Q); CD spectra from 200 to 250 nm of both recombinant wild type calcineurin and CN(H151Q) are comparable to spectra of bovine calcineurin (30Wolff D.J. Sved D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4195-4202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Kinetic parameters using pNPP and [P]-RIIpeptide as substrates for wild type calcineurin and CN(H151Q) in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 are compared in Table I. Using either substrate, the values ofkcat for the mutant enzyme were significantly lower than the kcat values for wild type enzyme. Thus, the kcat for CN(H151Q) using pNPP as a substrate, 5.6 × 10−2 s−1, is 460-fold lower than recombinant wild type calcineurin prepared in an identical fashion. Using [P]-RII peptide, thekcat values for wild type calcineurin and CN(H151Q) were 1.2 × 101 s−1 and 9.0 × 10−3 s−1, respectively, a difference of 1,300-fold. Using [P]-RII peptide,Km values for both forms of calcineurin were the same within the error of the measurement. However, a 10-fold decrease in Km was observed for CN(H151Q) compared with wild type calcineurin using pNPP as a substrate.Table IKinetic parameters for recombinant wild type and H151Q calcineurin using pNPP and [P]-RII peptide as substratesEnzymekcatKmRelativekcat1-aRelative kcat compared with wild type calcineurin for each substrate listed.s −1pNPP hydrolysis Wild type calcineurin2.6 × 101 ± 323 ± 7 mm1 CN(H151Q)5.6 × 10−2 ± 1 × 10−32.2 ± 0.20 mm460[P]-RIIhydrolysis Wild type calcineurin1.2 × 101 ± 1 × 10−1110 ± 40 μm1 CN(H151Q)9.0 × 10−3 ± 1 × 10−4130 ± 60 μm1,300Kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values for kinetic constants were determined by a least squares analysis with the uncertainties in the coefficients noted.

Data were from at least two separate determinations. Kinetic parameters using pNPP and phenyl phosphate as substrates for wild type λPP and λPP(H76N) are compared in Table II. These parameters were also determined by inclusion of 1.0 mm MnCl2 in assay buffers. Using pNPP as substrate, the kcat values for wild type λPP and λPP(H76N) were 3.9 × 102s−1 and 6.6 × 10−1 s−1, respectively. This represents a 590-fold difference, which is comparable to the decrease in kcat observed for calcineurin for the analogous substitution. The difference inkcat for λPP is less than the ≈105 fold difference found previously (25Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mostly because of a 30-fold higher activity measured for the λPP(H76N) protein isolated in the present study. Using phenyl phosphate as substrate, thekcat value for λPP was 1.7 × 101 s−1, compared with 3.2 × 10−2 s−1 for λPP(H76N), a difference of 530-fold.

https://openalex.org/W2000735865,"Ligand recognition of the NK1 receptor (substance P receptor) by peptide agonist and non-peptide antagonist has been investigated and compared by the use of fluorescent ligands and spectrofluorometric methods. Analogues of substance P (SP) labeled with the environment-sensitive fluorescent group 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) at either position 3, 8, or 11 or with fluorescein at theN α position were synthesized and characterized. Peptides modified at the α-amino group or at positions 3 or 11 conserved a relatively good affinity for NK1 and agonistic properties. Modification at position 8 resulted in an 18,000-fold decrease in affinity. A fluorescent dansyl analogue of the non-peptide antagonist CP96,345 was prepared and characterized. The quantum yield of fluorescence for dansyl-CP96,345 was much higher than for any of the dansyl-labeled peptides indicating that the micro-environment of the binding site is more hydrophobic for the non-peptide antagonist than for the peptide agonists. Comparison of collisional quenching of fluorescence by the water-soluble hydroxy-Tempo compound showed that dansyl-CP96,345 is buried and virtually inaccessible to aqueous quenchers, whereas dansyl- or fluoresceinyl-labeled peptides were exposed to the solvent. Anisotropy of all fluorescent ligands increased upon binding to NK1 indicating a restricted motional freedom. However, this increase in anisotropy was more pronounced for the dansyl attached to the non-peptide antagonist CP96,345 than for the fluorescent probes attached to different positions of SP. In conclusion, our data indicate that the environment surrounding non-peptide antagonist and peptide agonists are vastly different when bound to the NK1 receptor. These results support recent observations by mutagenesis and cross-linking work suggesting that peptide agonists have their major interaction points in the N-terminal extension and the loops forming the extracellular face of the NK1 receptor. Our data also suggest that neither the C terminus nor the N terminus of SP appears to penetrate deeply below the extracellular surface in the transmembrane domain of the receptor.

Comparison of collisional quenching of fluorescence by the water-soluble hydroxy-Tempo compound showed that dansyl-CP96,345 is buried and virtually inaccessible to aqueous quenchers, whereas dansyl- or fluoresceinyl-labeled peptides were exposed to the solvent. Anisotropy of all fluorescent ligands increased upon binding to NK1 indicating a restricted motional freedom. However, this increase in anisotropy was more pronounced for the dansyl attached to the non-peptide antagonist CP96,345 than for the fluorescent probes attached to different positions of SP. In conclusion, our data indicate that the environment surrounding non-peptide antagonist and peptide agonists are vastly different when bound to the NK1 receptor. These results support recent observations by mutagenesis and cross-linking work suggesting that peptide agonists have their major interaction points in the N-terminal extension and the loops forming the extracellular face of the NK1 receptor. Our data also suggest that neither the C terminus nor the N terminus of SP appears to penetrate deeply below the extracellular surface in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Many peptide hormones and neuropeptides act via known receptors belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by a seven membrane-spanning topology. There is considerable interest in understanding ligand-receptor recognition and the mechanisms of action of both non-peptide ligands and natural peptides for peptide receptors.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 1-37Crossref Google Scholar). The cellular actions of SP are mediated by the tachykinin (neurokinin) NK1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. Therefore, the NK1 receptor has been the target for the development of multiple non-peptide antagonists. The prototype NK1 non-peptide antagonist is the quinuclidine compound CP96,345, which acts as a high affinity and highly selective non-peptide inhibitor of SP in both binding and functional assays (3Snider R.M.

Traditionally, the identification of binding domains for peptide agonists and non-peptide antagonists has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of receptors and by the construction of chimeric receptors (5Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the case of NK1, studies by different groups have localized a binding pocket for the antagonist CP96,345 in the outer portion of the transmembrane domain of the receptor with presumed contacts points clustering on transmembrane domains TM-III, -IV, -V, VI, and VII and facing the interior of the seven-helix bundle (Fig. 1) (6Gether U.

In contrast, the binding site for substance P appears to involve multiple domains on the extracellular side of NK1 including the N-terminal segment, the first extracellular loop, and the top of TM-III and -VII (Fig. 1) (10Fong T.M. Huang R.R.C. Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25664-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fong T.M. Yu H. Huang R.R.C. Strader C.D.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One still open and debated question is whether substance P makes additional contacts within the transmembrane domains. So far mutational analysis of this region has failed to give any clear answer to this (12Huang R.R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Rosenkilde M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main problem with mutational mapping experiments is that they do not necessarily reveal direct contact points between amino acids on the receptor and ligand functional group. Loss of binding affinity can be due to either a true contact residue or to indirect allosteric effect on the receptor folding. Covalent labeling of NK1 with photolabile SP analogues has identified agonist peptide-binding domains of NK1 in the N-terminal region and the second extracellular loop using ligands labeled at either position 3 or 8 of the peptide (14Li Y.M.

Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is therefore very important to complement the mutational approach with biochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Recently, we developed novel fluorescence methodology to investigate ligand-receptor recognition and to map subdomains of binding sites with fluorescent ligands. In the NK2 receptor system, we demonstrated that agonist and antagonist peptides of similar molecular size have distinct binding sites (16Turcatti G. Vogel H. Chollet A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and we built a molecular model for ligand-receptor interactions using experimental determination of distances by fluorescence energy transfer between a fluorophore on the ligand and another fluorophore placed at specific sites in the receptor through biosynthetic incorporation by suppression of nonsense codons (17Turcatti G. Nemeth K. Edgerton M.D. Meseth U. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Knowles J. Vogel H. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19991-19998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we have used site-specific fluorescent-labeled analogues of substance P at positions 1, 3, and 11 and a fluorescent CP96,345 analogue to probe the polarity and solvent accessibility of NK1 binding pockets and to measure the motional freedom of receptor-bound ligands. In this study we present spectrofluorometric evidence for the existence of different ligand binding pockets on the NK1 receptor for substance P and the antagonist CP96,345, respectively. To 2.34 mg of SP (1.73 μmol) in 360 μl of 50 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, at 4 °C was added 42 μl of 50 mm dansyl chloride in acetone (2.07 μmol). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 4 °C. The mono-dansylated SP derivative was recovered as the major peak by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Nucleosil 300–7 C8 column Machery-Nagel ET 250/8/4; gradient 0–75% of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile, in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in water over 60 min). Compounds were detected by absorbance at 214 and 350 nm. Fractions containing pure material were pooled and lyophilized. Electrospray MS: calculated, 1580.9; found, 1581.2. N-terminal Edman degradation and analysis of PTH derivatives were as follows: at cycle 1, Arg-PTH was recovered for both SP and Dns-Lys3-SP, whereas at cycle 3, Lys-PTH was recovered for SP only. The modification of Lys3 was further confirmed by compositional amino acid analysis. Dns-Dap8-SP was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis according to the general methods previously reported (18Bradshaw C. Ceszkowski K. Turcatti G. Beresford I. Chollet A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A base-labile resin linker preloaded with Fmoc-Met was used. At the third cycle, Dap was coupled usingN α-Fmoc and side chaint-butoxycarbonyl protections. After coupling, thet-butoxycarbonyl group was removed with trifluoroacetic acid, and the resin was then incubated with dansyl chloride in acetone. The peptide synthesis was continued. The peptide was cleaved from the resin as C-terminal amide using liquid ammonia. Electrospray MS: calculated, 1519.86; found, 1519.69. Dns-Hcy11-SP was prepared as described by Chassaing et al. (19Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Marquet A. J. Org. Chem. 1983; 48: 1757-1760Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To 4.35 mg of SP (2.84 μmol) in 500 μl of 25 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, at 4 °C was added 62 μl of 50 mm fluorescein isothiocyanate inN,N-dimethylformamide. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 4 °C, and then 100 μl ofN,N-dimethylformamide and 500 μl of 0.2m acetic acid were added. Monofluorescein SP was recovered by high performance liquid chromatography (same conditions as above) as the major peak of the mixture. Yield: 2.3 mg (47%). Electrospray-MS: calculated, 1737.1; found, 1736.9. Edman degradation: cycle 1 yielded Arg-PTH for SP but not for [N α-Flu-SP]; cycles 2 and 3 yielded Pro-PTH and Lys-PTH respectively, for both SP andN α-Flu-SP. To a 150-ml round-bottomed flask equipped with condenser and N2 inlet were added 3.42 g (11.71 mmol) of (−)-diphenylmethyl-1-azabicyclo[3.2.2]octan-3-amine, prepared as described in Ref. 20Lowe III, J.A.

The solution was stirred 40 min at room temperature, and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and dried. It was then taken up in 46 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran, 28 ml (56 mmol) of a 2.0 m solution of borane methyl sulfide in tetrahydrofuran added, and the reaction refluxed for 4 days. The reaction was cooled, evaporated, and taken up in 50 ml of ethanol, treated with 5 g of sodium carbonate and 4 g of cesium fluoride. The resulting mixture was refluxed 3 days, cooled, and taken up in methylene chloride and water. The organic layer was separated, dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated.

Mills A. Buell G. Allet E. Adami N. Liljestrom P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured as monolayers in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% (w/v) Pen-Strep, and 0.5% (w/v) Nystatin. Cells were harvested at 80% confluence with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and washed with ice-cold PBS. Membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (23Turcatti G. Ceszkowski K. Chollet A. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For radioligand binding assays, the expression plasmids containing the receptor cDNAs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation methods as described previously (24Gether U. Johansen T.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7893-7898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mono-iodinated 125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled substance P (125I-BH-SP) was prepared and purified as described (24Gether U. Johansen T.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7893-7898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected COS-7 cells were transferred to 12-well culture plates, 0.1–0.6 × 105 cells/well, 1 day after transfection and 24 h before performing the binding experiments. The number of cells per well was adjusted according to the expression efficiency of the individual plasmid aiming at 5–10% binding of the added radioligand in the competition binding experiments. Binding experiments were performed for 3 h at 4 °C with 50 pm125I-BH-SP plus variable amounts of unlabeled peptide or non-peptide compound in 0.5 ml of a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) supplemented with 100 μg/ml bacitracin (Sigma). All determinations were performed in triplicate, and the nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 1 μm SP. The specific binding constituted more than 80% total binding. The binding data were analyzed and IC50 values determined by computerized nonlinear regression analysis using InPlot (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy measurements were made using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer at ambient temperature. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were recorded using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorimeter with 0.2 × 1.0 cm and 0.5 × 1.0 cm quartz cuvettes with 0.2- and 0.5-ml sample volume, respectively. Unless stated otherwise, fluorescence measurements were made on cell membrane preparations at 20 °C. Solvents and buffers were degassed by bubbling nitrogen to prevent quenching of fluorescence by solubilized oxygen. The fluorescence emission signals were stable to photobleaching under measuring conditions. For dansyl-labeled ligands, the excitation wavelength was 343 nm, and the emission was recorded from 400 to 600 nm or at 530 nm in collisional quenching and anisotropy experiments. For fluorescein-labeled SP, excitation was at 475 nm and emission from 500 to 600 nm. For collisional quenching and anisotropy measurements, the emission was set at 520 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidth were 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Membrane suspensions from NK1/CHO cells were suspended in PBS, pH 7.2, containing MgCl2 (3 mm), bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml), at a concentration of 5 nm3H-SP binding sites and incubated with 50 nmfluorescent ligand in the presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (total binding) of 50 μm nonfluorescent ligand at 20 °C for 1 h. As an additional control, membranes were also incubated in the absence of fluorescent ligand. Membranes were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.2, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and homogenized by sonication in an ice-cold bath for 3 min immediately prior fluorometry measurements. During fluorescence recordings, membranes were kept in suspension by continuous stirring. Fluorescence was corrected for light scattering and background fluorescence from control samples. For dansyl compounds excited at 343 nm, the scattering caused by irradiation of membranes particles was not important in the 520–540-nm emission region. For the fluorescein ligandN α-Flu-SP, the effect of scattering was low in comparison to the high quantum yield of this fluorophore. Fluorescence collisional quenching experiments were performed at 20 °C by adding increasing amounts of quencher stock solution in water to suspended NK1/CHO cell membranes. Typically, a complete quenching experiment was performed in 6–8 min. Under these conditions, the contribution of fluorescence signal from dissociated ligand was negligible. The quencher stock solutions were either 0.153m KI containing 1 mmNa2S2O3 to prevent I3− formation or 0.1 mTempo or 0.1 m hydroxy-Tempo. Changes in fluorescence due to the addition of quencher were corrected by subtracting the fluorescence measured in parallel samples in which quencher was added to membranes in PBS or membranes saturated with an excess (1000-fold) of non-fluorescent CP99,994 (36Desai M.C. Lefkowitz S.L. Thadeio P.F. Longo K.P. Snider R.M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 4911-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Moreover, in quenching experiments with the nitroxide radical compounds Tempo and hydroxy-Tempo, the fluorescence intensities were corrected for the absorption increments caused by added quenchers at the excitation and emission wavelengths (inner filter effect) as described (25London E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The quenching of the fluorescence emission at the wavelength of maximum emission was calculated with the Stern-Volmer equation (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 1983; (and 258–265, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York): 111-153Crossref Google Scholar):Fo/F = 1 +KSV [C], whereFo/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher Q. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant KSV was determined from the slope of Fo/F as a function of the quencher concentration [Q]. Steady-state anisotropy measurements were recorded using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer equipped with a model ADP-301 fluorescence polarization accessory. The polarizer and analyzer were placed in the thermostatic sample chamber. The emission intensity was measured by setting the excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position (V) and the emission-side polarizer either in the horizontal (H) or vertical position. The emission intensities, in respective V and H positions, were corrected by subtracting the corresponding background signals from the cells or membrane suspensions and converted to anisotropy (A), see Equation 1:A=[(lV/lH)/G−1]/[(lV/lH)/G+2]Equation 1 where IV/IH is the ratio of the vertical and horizontal emission intensities when the excitation polarizer is in the vertical position, and G is the same ratio when the excitation light is horizontally polarized. Binding of fluorescent ligands to NK1 in CHO cell membranes was made as described above. The limiting anisotropy A0 in the absence of rotation was calculated with the Perrin equation (Equation 2) for the case of a spherical molecule (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 1983; (and 258–265, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York): 111-153Crossref Google Scholar):A−1−A0−1(1+τ/φ)=A0−1(1+τkT/Vhη)Equation 2 where τ is the fluorescence lifetime of the dansyl or fluorescein chromophore attached to the ligand, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature,Vh is the partial molecular volume of a hydrated sphere, and η is the viscosity. Perrin plots were constructed by measuring anisotropy of free ligands, 0.1 to 10 μm in PBS solution, or bound to membranes from NK1/CHO cells, as a function of either temperature or viscosity. Anisotropy on free, unbound ligand was also measured in the presence of membranes and 1000-fold excess nonfluorescent ligand. The experiments started at 2 °C and several points were measured by increasing the temperature up to 37 °C over a period of 25–30 min. In control experiments, identical values were obtained when separate samples were measured at corresponding temperatures after 4–5 min only, indicating that the measured anisotropy accounted for NK1 bound rather than dissociated ligand. Alternatively, the viscosity was varied by addition of increasing amounts of glycerol (0–80% w/v) at constant temperature (20 °C). The viscosity at each temperature was determined from standard tables (40). Anisotropy measurements were made using different membrane concentrations (39Tota M.R. Daniel S. Sirotina A. Mazina K.E. Fong T.M. Longmore J. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13079-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A series of undecapeptides derived from substance P and labeled with either dansyl (Dns) or fluoresceinyl (Flu) fluorophores at different positions in the sequence were prepared (Fig. 2). The control of selectivity for the N-terminal amino group or the ε-amino group in the lysyl side chain during chemical modification of peptides can be controlled by the pH of the reaction and the nature of the electrophilic reagent. Thus, substance P was derivatized with an equimolar amount of dansyl chloride at pH 9.0 to afford the mono-labeled compound Dns-Lys3-SP. Reaction of SP with an equimolar quantity of fluorescein isothiocyanate gave the N-terminally labeled N α-Flu-SP. The respective positions of the dansyl and fluoresceinyl groups was confirmed by Edman sequencing and amino acid analysis. The fluorescent peptide Dns-Dap8-SP, in which Phe8 of SP is replaced by β-dansyldiaminopropionic acid, was prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis. After the third coupling cycle with Dap, the β-amino group of Dap was selectively deprotected and derivatized with dansyl chloride. Coupling of the remaining seven amino acids was then resumed. The S-dansyl homocysteine derivative Dns-Hcy11-SP in which Met11 of SP is replaced by S-(2-dansylamino)ethyl homocysteine was prepared as reported before (19Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Marquet A. J. Org. Chem. 1983; 48: 1757-1760Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The quinuclidine derivative Dns-CP96,345, a dansyl-labeled analogue of the well known NK1 antagonist CP96,345 (3Snider R.M.

We show that Brn-3a overexpression also enhances the expression of the three neurofilament genes at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas Brn-3b overexpression has no effect. In addition Brn-3a activates the three neurofilament gene promoters in co-transfection assays in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. As observed for enhanced neurite outgrowth, the stimulation of neurofilament gene expression and activation of the neurofilament gene promoters is observed with the isolated POU domain of Brn-3a. A single amino acid change in the POU homeodomain of Brn-3a to the equivalent amino acid in Brn-3b abolishes its ability to activate the neurofilament promoters, whereas the reciprocal change converts Brn-3b to an activator of these promoters.

The POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors (for reviews see Refs. 1Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and 2Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1988; 55: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A number of subsequent studies (see for example Ref. 5He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) have defined a large number of other POU family transcription factors in a variety of organisms that have been classified into subgroups according to their relationships to one another (for review see Ref. 2Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Among the mammalian POU factors identified in this way, the Brn-3 factors show the closest homology to the nematode protein Unc-86 and together with the Drosophila factors I-POU and tI-POU (6Treacy M.N.

Cell. 1992; 68: 491-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) these factors constitute the POU IV subfamily within the POU family (2Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Indeed it has been proposed (8Erkman L. McEvilly J. Luo L. Ryan A.K. Hooshmand F. O'Connell S.M. Keithley E.M. Rapaport D.H. Ryan A.F. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1996; 381: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) that the Brn-3 factors constitute the mammalian homologues of Unc-86 (8Erkman L. McEvilly J. Luo L.

Unlike the situation in the nematode, however, three distinct Brn-3 factors have been identified in mammals that show close homology in the DNA binding POU domain but are considerably less homologous outside it and are encoded by three different genes (9Theil T.

Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These factors are Brn-3a (also known as Brn-3 or Brn-3.0) (5He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3175-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Each of these three factors is expressed in distinct but overlapping sets of neurons in the developing and adult nervous system (5He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.S.

Turner E.E. Mech. Dev. 1996; 53: 291-304Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This suggests that, like Unc-86, the mammalian Brn-3 factors may play a critical role in the development of specific neuronal cells within the nervous system with each factor having distinct but possibly related roles. In agreement with this, recent experiments (8Erkman L. McEvilly J. Luo L. Ryan A.K. Hooshmand F. O'Connell S.M. Keithley E.M. Rapaport D.H. Ryan A.F. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1996; 381: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 16Xiang M. Gan L. Zhou L. Klein W.H. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11950-11955Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have shown that inactivation of the Brn-3b gene results in considerable loss of retinal neurons, whereas mice in which the Brn-3c gene has been inactivated show loss of olfactory neurons, and Brn-3a inactivation results in the loss of neurons in the brain stem and trigeminal ganglia (16Xiang M. Gan L. Zhou L. Klein W.H. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11950-11955Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These distinct functional roles and expression patterns of the Brn-3 factors are paralleled by their distinct effects on target genes. Thus it has previously been shown that the Brn-3a factor can activate a wide variety of target genes expressed in neuronal cells including those encoding pro-opiomelanocortin (11Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Tuner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast Brn-3b represses the promoters of the α-internexin and the gene encoding SNAP-25 and also interferes with their activation by Brn-3a (17Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T.

Brain Res. 1996; 43: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although it can stimulate the promoter of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α2 subunit gene which is not affected by Brn-3a (20Milton N.G.N. Bessis A. Changeux J.P. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15143-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To analyze the functional effects of the Brn-3 factors in more detail, we have used the ND7 neuronal cell line which was generated by the fusion of a mouse neuroblastoma cell line and primary rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (21Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (12Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that when these cells are induced to differentiate to a non-dividing phenotype bearing numerous neurite processes (23Suburo A.M. Wheatley S.C. Horn D.A. Gibson S.J. Jahn R. Fischer-Colbrie R. Wood J.W. Latchman D.S. Polak J.M. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the levels of Brn-3a rise dramatically from a low level in the proliferating cells to a much higher level in the non-dividing cells. Conversely, the levels of Brn-3b fall from a high level in the dividing cells to a much lower level in the differentiated cells, whereas the levels of Brn-3c remain unchanged. Moreover, such changes in the expression of Brn-3a and Brn-3b appear to have functional effects. Thus as would be expected, the rise in the level of the Brn-3a activator together with the fall in the level of the Brn-3b repressor which occur during ND7 cell differentiation result in the activation of a transfected synthetic target promoter containing a binding site for these factors, when ND7 cells are induced to differentiate (22Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of the endogenous gene encoding SNAP-25 (whose promoter is activated by Brn-3a and repressed by Brn-3b in co-transfection experiments) (18Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Dawson S.J. Ryabanin A.E. Kilimann M.W. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is considerably enhanced during ND7 cell differentiation. Indeed we have recently obtained evidence that the rise in Brn-3a and the fall in Brn-3b occurring during ND7 cell differentiation play a critical role in the differentiation process itself. Thus preventing the rise in Brn-3a using an antisense approach prevents ND7 cell differentiation and the rise in SNAP-25 expression which normally occurs in response to differentiation-inducing stimuli such as serum removal (18Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, artificial overexpression of Brn-3a in ND7 cells results in clonal cell lines which extend neurite processes when grown in full serum-containing medium which does not normally induce the differentiation of these cells (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely ND7-derived cell lines overexpressing Brn-3b fail to show neurite outgrowth when removed from serum which would normally induce such outgrowth in parental ND7 cells (26Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1382-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings indicate therefore that the balance between Brn-3a and Brn-3b is likely to play a critical role in the differentiation of ND7 cells, and they allow the use of these cells as a model system to understand the role of these factors in neuronal differentiation and to elucidate the mechanism by which they act. In view of the finding that SNAP-25 is essential for neurite outgrowth by a variety of different neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo (27Osen-Sand A. Catsicas M. Staple J.K. Jones K.A. Ayala G. Knowles J. Grenningloh G. Catsicas S. Nature. 1993; 364: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), it is likely that the ability of Brn-3a to induce SNAP-25 expression plays a role in its ability to induce neurite outgrowth. However, it is likely that this dramatic effect of Brn-3a on the phenotype of ND7 cells involves more than its ability to induce SNAP-25 and that other target genes encoding proteins involved in neurite process formation are also likely to be activated by Brn-3a. We previously found, however, that the growth-associated protein GAP-43 shows no change in its expression in the Brn-3a or Brn-3b overexpressing ND7 cells, in agreement with our finding that its promoter is unaffected by co-transfection with Brn-3a (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of the neurofilament proteins in neuronal process formation and particularly in specifying axonal calibre (for review see Ref. 28Liem R.K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the simultaneous appearance of neurofilament and Brn-3a expression during early post-mitotic neuronal differentiation (15Fedtsova N.G. Turner E.E. Mech. Dev. 1996; 53: 291-304Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we have investigated the expression of the neurofilament heavy, medium, and light chain genes in our ND7 cells overexpressing different Brn-3 transcription factors and have also studied the effect of the Brn-3 factors on the promoters of these genes in co-transfection experiments carried out in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. BHK-21 cells (29Macpherson I. Stoker M. Virology. 1962; 16: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and ND7 cells (21Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S.

The ND7-derived cell lines overexpressing Brn-3a, Brn-3b, or Brn-3c were constructed as described previously (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell.

Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in L15 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with G418 to a final concentration of 800 μg/ml to maintain expression of the transgene. Treatment with dexamethasone at a final concentration of 1 μm was used to induced expression of the murine mammary tumor virus promoter. The neurofilament reporter gene constructs containing various regions of the NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L promoter linked to the readily assayable chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene have been described previously (31Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schwartz M.L. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Schwartz M.L. Katagi C. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13444-13450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the transient transfections, the Brn-3a and Brn-3b expression vectors contain full-length cDNA or cDNAs encoding various regions of the molecule cloned under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter in the vector pJ4 (30Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The mutant forms of Brn-3a and Brn-3b containing an altered amino acid at position 22 in the homeodomain were constructed as described previously using the pALTER-1 vector (Promega) and were then subcloned into the pJ4 vector for use in transient transfection experiments (33Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of DNA was carried out according to the method of Gorman (34Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Routinely 1 × 106 BHK-21 cells (29Macpherson I. Stoker M.

In all cases cells were harvested 72 h later. The amount of DNA taken up by these cells in each case was measured by slot blotting the extract and hybridization with a probe derived from the ampicillin resistance gene in the plasmid vector (35Abken H. Reifenrath B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This value was then used to equalize the values obtained in the CAT 1The abbreviation used is: CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. assay as a control for differences in uptake of plasmid DNA in each sample. In parallel experiments, we also included an internal control plasmid in which the cytomegalovirus promoter drives β-galactosidase expression allowing equalization of the samples on the basis of β-galactosidase activity prior to assay of CAT activity. Assays of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity were carried out according to the method of Gorman (34Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) using samples that had been equalized for protein content as determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from stably transfected cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). The expression of the neurofilament RNAs was then quantitated using a reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay. Initially all samples were amplified using primers for the constitutively expressed mRNA encoding the L6 ribosomal protein. Subsequently the neurofilament mRNAs were amplified using specific primers for each mRNA. Primers were as follows: NFL 5′-CCGTACTTTTCGACCTCCTA-3′ and 5′-TCTCTTGTGTGCGGATAGAC-3′; NFM 5′-ACACCATCCAGCAGTTGGAA-3′ and 5′-TGTGTTGGACCTTGAGCTTG-3′; NFH 5′-CCCAAGAGGAGATAACTGAG-3′ and 5′-TCAATGTCCAGGGCCATCTT-3′; L6 5′-ATCGCTCCTCAAACTTGACC-3′ and 5′-AACTACAACCACCTCATGCC-3′. All amplifications were carried out using a number of cycles and amount of mRNA that had been determined in preliminary experiments to be in the range of the assay where the amount of product formed was linearly related to the amount of input RNA. Protein was isolated from cells by freeze-thaw extraction in protein buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.45 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA contains 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and submitted to analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose filter by Western blotting, and the neurofilament proteins were detected by probing with the mouse monoclonal antibodies NM-08-304, NM-08-307, and NM-08-306 (Genosys). To ensure equal loading of protein samples, gels were stripped and reprobed using a control antibody, in this case pGp9.5. The ND7-derived cell lines overexpressing individual forms of Brn-3 were constructed (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1382-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by stably transfecting ND7 cells with expression vectors containing each form of Brn-3 under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible murine mammary tumor virus promoter in the vector pJ5 (30Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Both by RNA analysis (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1382-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and DNA mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide containing a binding site for the Brn-3 factors (data not shown), all the cell lines showed some overexpression of the appropriate form of Brn-3 in the absence of dexamethasone with enhanced expression being inducible upon addition of 1 μmdexamethasone. Although expression is therefore somewhat leaky and induced severalfold by hormone, it is possible to use these cells to examine the effects of overexpressing different forms of Brn-3 by studying these effects both in the absence or presence of dexamethasone and comparing the results to similarly treated control cells. We therefore prepared mRNA and protein from the various ND7-derived cell lines proliferating in full serum-containing medium either in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. In each case mRNA and protein was prepared from three independent cell lines of each type which had previously been shown to overexpress Brn-3a, Brn-3b, or Brn-3c (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,26Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1382-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Initially, the expression of each of the neurofilament proteins was quantitated using a Western blotting assay. As shown in Fig. 1, each of the neurofilament proteins showed a somewhat enhanced level in the Brn-3 overexpressing cells in the absence of steroid compared with control cells stably transfected with the pJ5 vector alone. Moreover, upon steroid induction of exogenous Brn-3a gene expression, the levels of each of the neurofilament proteins increased in the Brn-3a cell lines but not in the control cells. This resulted in overexpression in the Brn-3a cell lines of 3.7-fold for NF-H (p < 0.01) 2.2-fold for NF-M (p < 0.05), and 3-fold for NF-L (p < 0.01) relative to control cells. Hence, the expression of all three neurofilament proteins is enhanced in the Brn-3a expressing cells. In contrast no increase in expression of any of the neurofilament proteins was observed in the Brn-3b expressing cells, whereas only small (less than 2-fold) increases were observed in the Brn-3c expressing cells. Having established that Brn-3a can enhance neurofilament protein levels, we wished to determine whether this was paralleled by increased neurofilament mRNA levels as would be expected if Brn-3a directly activates the neurofilament gene promoters. The relative expression of each of the neurofilament mRNAs was therefore quantified in the cells using a reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay. In these experiments (Fig. 2) the neurofilament heavy chain mRNA was overexpressed approximately 2-fold in the Brn-3a overexpressing cells compared with control cells stably transfected with the pJ5 vector alone (p < 0.01). Upon steroid induction this overexpression of the neurofilament heavy chain gene rose to approximately 6-fold over that observed in similarly treated control cells (p < 0.01). Similar overexpression of the neurofilament light chain of approximately 2-fold before steroid treatment (p < 0.01) and of approximately 5-fold after steroid induction (p < 0.01) was also observed in the Brn-3a overexpressing cells, whereas the neurofilament medium chain mRNA showed only marginal overexpression in the Brn-3a cells before steroid treatment but was overexpressed approximately 3-fold (p < 0.01) after steroid treatment (Fig. 2). In contrast no significant overexpression of any of the neurofilament genes was observed in the Brn-3b or Brn-3c overexpressing cells either before or after steroid treatment. These findings indicate therefore that the overexpression of Brn-3a in the ND7 cells can induce the overexpression of all three of the neurofilament genes at both the mRNA and protein levels. Thus prior to dexamethasone treatment when some overexpression of Brn-3a is observed in the ND7 cells (25Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), there is also some overexpression of the different neurofilament genes. Moreover, when enhanced expression of Brn-3a is induced by steroid treatment, this results in significant overexpression of all three neurofilament genes above the level observed in comparably treated control cells with the neurofilament heavy chain showing the greatest effect at both the mRNA and protein levels, followed by the light chain and then the medium chain. In previous experiments we have shown that the ability of Brn-3a to induce target genes in co-transfection experiments is dependent upon two activation domains, one of which is located at the N terminus of the molecule (17Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Liem R.K.H. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

The relative importance of these different activation domains varies with the target promoter tested (17Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T.

Individual cysteine residues were incorporated into bsyn, a soluble form of the protein lacking the membrane-spanning N-terminal domain, in two main areas: the heptad repeat region and the hydrophobic region which begins at residue Val-124. The tendencies of these cysteine residues to form disulfide bonds with the corresponding cysteine in thebsyn dimer were tested using disulfide exchange by glutathione and air oxidation catalyzed by Cu2+. Within the heptad repeat region, only cysteines at residues 59 and 60, which occupy the b and c positions of the heptad repeat, showed significant tendencies to form disulfides, a result inconsistent with a coiled-coil model for bsyn. Mixed disulfide formation most readily occurred with the S60C + L65C and A61C + L65C pairs. Cysteines at positions 124, 128, 132, and 139 showed strong tendencies to form disulfides with their mates in the dimer, suggesting a parallel α-helical interaction between the subunits in this region. Deletion of residues N-terminal to either Glu-34 or Asp-53 had no apparent effect on dimerization as determined by sedimentation equilibrium, while deletion of all residues N-terminal to Lys-67 produced a monomeric form. These results imply that residues 53–66 but not 24–52 are essential for bsyndimerization. Taken together the results are consistent with a model in which the two b subunits interact in more than one region, including a parallel alignment of helices containing residues 124–139.

The F1F0-ATP synthase, or ATPase, is responsible in oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation for the translocation of protons across a membrane with concomitant synthesis of ATP. The enzyme complex consists of a membrane-spanning sector (F0) that conducts protons, and a membrane-peripheral sector (F1) that uses energy from proton movement to synthesize ATP (for reviews, see Refs. 1Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Nakamoto R.K.

The mechanism by which energy coupling from F0 to F1 takes place is currently under intense investigation. In Escherichia coli, the F0 sector is composed of three different subunits of stoichiometryab2 c9–12; the twob subunits are believed to exist as a dimer. Thea and c subunits appear to be directly involved in proton movement across the membrane, while b is not. The arrangement of the F0 subunits within the membrane is uncertain; some believe that the c subunits are clustered together with a and b on the periphery (5Schneider E. Altendorf K. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 477-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y.

A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) while others propose that a and the two bsubunits are surrounded by a ring of c subunits (8Cox G.B. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Hatch L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Hatch L.P. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).b has a single transmembrane region at its N terminus; the remainder of the 156-residue protein is hydrophilic with the exception of a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at residues 124–132. Based on its sequence the protein is predicted to be largely α-helical in nature, and a heptad repeat has been discerned between residues 33 and 79, suggestive of a coiled-coil interaction in this region. Previously one of us has constructed a gene encoding the hydrophilic portion of b (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of this gene,bsol, is soluble, forms a dimer in solution, is mostly α-helical as measured by circular dichroism, and competes with the F0 sector for binding to F1. Therefore it is likely that bsol adopts a structure similar to the hydrophilic region of full-length b. Proteolysis studies have shown that the hydrophilic portion ofb is required for the binding of F1 to the membrane (11Hermolin J. Gallant J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14550-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hoppe J. Friedl P. Schairer H.U. Sebald W. von Meyenburg K. J⊘rgensen B.B.

Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of the glycine at position 131 to aspartate prevents proper assembly of the F1F0complex (14Jans D.A. Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 420-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the b subunit provides a critical link between the two sectors, but its role in energy transduction has yet to be determined. Two regions of b have been suggested to play a role in its dimerization: the heptad repeat region (residues 33–79; Ref. 10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the hydrophobic region near the C terminus (residues 124–132; Ref.15Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To investigate these regions, and to obtain information about their relative orientation, we have introduced individual cysteine mutations into the soluble hydrophilic portion of b. By estimating the relative propensities of cysteines introduced at various positions to form an intersubunit disulfide bond, one may gain insight as to the proximity of the residues. In addition, several forms ofb that have been truncated at the N terminus were analyzed by ultracentrifugation to clarify the role of the N-terminal region in dimerization. Molecular biological techniques were performed essentially as described in Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Strain JM103 of E. coli (17Messing J. Crea J. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar) was used as the host for plasmids based on pUC8. Strain MM294 was used as the host for plasmids based on pSD80. The uncF strain KM2 (18McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generously provided by Kimberly McCormick and Brian Cain, is based on strain 1100 and was used for expression of full-length bconstructs. To construct the gene encoding bsyn, four pairs of overlapping single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were made double-stranded by annealing and subsequent treatment with Klenow fragment. The oligonucleotides were inserted one at a time into the multiple cloning region of pUC8 (19Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) to produce pDM3. The sequence of the gene was verified by DNA sequencing using the Sanger method. Cysteine mutations were incorporated into pDM3 by two different methods. In some cases, degenerate oligonucleotides with the potential to encode mutations at several sites were synthesized and incorporated into the plasmid. For other mutations, mutagenic primers were used along with either the forward or reverse M13/pUC sequencing primer in polymerase chain reactions; the polymerase chain reaction products were incorporated into pDM3 using appropriate restriction enzymes. The resulting E. coli transformants were screened for expression of bsyn containing cysteine as described previously (20McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing by the Sanger method was used to verify the sequence of the entire mutagenic insert. Plasmid pSD80 (21Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) carries a tac promoter upstream of the multiple cloning site, an unc transcription terminator downstream of the HindIII site at the end of the multiple cloning region, and the lacI q gene elsewhere on the plasmid. The single MscI site of pSD80 was removed by cutting with that enzyme and ligating an XbaI linker into the site to produce plasmid pSD82, which served as the basis for pSD100. The unc sequence inserted in pSD51 (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) spans residues A-2144 through C-2940, numbered as in Ref. 22Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, beginning 43 bases upstream from uncF, which encodes b, and extending about halfway through the next gene, uncH. Polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to amplify this entire insert from pSD51 and to introduce a translation initiation region and an MscI restriction site upstream of the uncregion. The product was cloned into pSD82, using the EcoRI and HindIII site to yield plasmid pSD84. Subsequent replacement of part of the non-unc upstream sequence with a synthetic double-stranded fragment gave plasmid pSD100, which contains the following sequence beginning at the EcoRI cloning site: GAATTCTGGAGGATTTTAAAATGTCTTACTGGCCAGAGCTCGGTACCC. Within this segment are a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a start codon (both shown in bold) for a peptide beginning with amino acid sequence MSYWPELGT. Within the sequence encoding the peptide is a series of sites specific for restriction endonucleases MscI,SacI, and KpnI. The MscI site (underlined), which was used extensively in subsequent work, spans the codons for the tryptophan and proline residues. The sequence shown is linked to unc residue A-2144 located upstream from theuncF start codon. Plasmid pSD100 was originally designed for the production of plasmids encoding N-terminal deletions of b through the use of exonuclease III. In the current work, however, it was used for two different purposes. First, the MscI and HindIII sites were used for subcloning of segments of uncF to produce plasmids pKK1, pSD111, and pSD114, which have in-frame fusions between the leader sequence and the inserted uncF sequence. In the construction of plasmid pKK1, which encodes proteinb65–156, the 578-base pairPvuII-HindIII fragment of pSD59 (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted. The 322-base pair insert used for the construction of pSD111, which encodes protein b53–156, was obtained by cutting pDM3 with BglII, filling the end with Klenow fragment, then cutting with HindIII. The 373-base pair fragment used for the construction of pSD114, which encodes proteinb34–156, was obtained by cutting pDM3 withMfeI, removing overhanging bases with mung bean nuclease, then cutting with HindIII. Constructs were verified by restriction enzyme mapping and, for pSD111 and pSD114, sequencing through the site of the in-frame fusion. The protein products were shown to be recognized by b-specific monoclonal antibodies. Second, the plasmid pDM8, expressing the entire b subunit, was generated by subcloning the SnaBI-HindIII fragment of pDM3 into pSD100. Thus pDM8 carries the wild typeuncF gene sequence from the initiation codon to theSnaBI site, and the synthetic gene sequence from theSnaBI site to the termination codon. The mutations R138C and S139C were subcloned individually from their pDM3-like plasmids into pDM8 using the NgoAIV and HindIII sites of the synthetic gene; the resulting plasmids were called pDM112 and pDM113, respectively. The expression and purification ofbsyn was carried out essentially as described earlier for bsol (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of the final stage. In this step, the protein was loaded onto a column of DEAE-Sepharose instead of a column of Sephacryl S-300, and was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in 250 ml of 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA. The resulting column fractions containing bsyn were typically pooled, concentrated using an Amicon Diaflo apparatus with a YM-10 membrane, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and stored at −80 °C. Purification of mutant proteins containing cysteine was identical except that 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GRB, glutathione reaction buffer; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. was added to all buffers after the 40% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation step. Protein b34–156, which is expressed from plasmid pSD114, was purified by procedures similar to those used forbsyn, except that the protein was precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, and size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephacryl S-200 was added as a final step. Protein b53–156, which is expressed from plasmid pSD111, was purified by procedures similar to those used forbsyn, except that the protein was precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, and that this was followed by a pH precipitation at pH 5.1 before DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The precursor of protein b67–156, which was expressed from plasmid pKK1, was found in the pellet from the initial ultracentrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, stored at 4 °C overnight, and the ultracentrifugation was repeated. Analysis of the supernatant and pellet fractions by SDS-PAGE revealed the protein to have been completely solubilized, but with a slight increase in electrophoretic mobility. The protein was precipitated with 90% saturated ammonium sulfate, then purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The protein was followed by SDS-PAGE and by absorbance at 230 nm, as it lacked absorbance at 280 nm. Oxidized and reduced glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Samples of the proteins to be tested were converted to the fully oxidized form by dialysis at 4 °C for 24 h in buffer containing 0.1 m NaHCO3 and 10 μmCuCl2. The buffer was then changed by dialysis to 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (glutathione reaction buffer, GRB). Other samples, to be tested in parallel, were not oxidized with CuCl2 but were converted to the fully reduced form by dialysis into GRB containing 1 mm DTT. The protein concentrations of all samples were measured by the Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and were adjusted to a uniform level (usually in the range of 0.5–1.0 mg/ml or 32–64 μm). In cases where two proteins containing different mutations were used, the proteins were first adjusted to the same concentration, and then equal volumes were mixed. To the pre-oxidized samples were added 2 volumes of a glutathione mixture containing 13 mm GSSG and 12 mm GSH. To the pre-reduced samples were added 2 volumes of a mixture containing 13.75 mm GSSG and 11.25 mm GSH. The different ratios of GSSG:GSH allow for reduction of GSSG by the 1 mm DTT present in the pre-reduced samples; the final ratios were identical at GSSG:GSH = 1.08:1. The reactions were incubated at room temperature. At various time points (e.g. 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h), 15-μl aliquots were quenched with 10 μl of 0.1 m N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), diluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer lacking reducing agent, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. A zero time point was prepared by quenching an aliquot before the glutathione mixtures had been added. All samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The concentrations of purified or partially purified proteins were adjusted to uniformity (typically 0.5–1.0 mg/ml) with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The partially purified proteins had been purified up to and including the 40% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation stage (see Ref. 10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C in 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT overnight. As a zero time point, 5-μl aliquots were then added to 45 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 15 mm NEM and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. The dialysis bags were transferred to 1 liter of 0.1 m NaHCO3, 10 mm cysteine, 10 μm CuCl2; in some cases the cysteine was omitted. The bicarbonate buffer was always prepared immediately before use. Five-μl aliquots were taken and quenched as described above after 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 h of dialysis, then analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Results obtained by this procedure were similar to those seen with the GSH/GSSG method provided the free cysteine was present; in its absence all mutant proteins containing cysteine residues exhibited essentially complete disulfide formation after 24 h. Substitution of 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl for the 0.1 mNaHCO3 did not affect the results obtained. E. coli KM2 bearing pDM112 or pDM113 was grown in 1 liter of Luria broth at 37 °C with shaking. WhenA600 reached 0.060, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 15 μm, and growth was continued untilA600 reached 0.800. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and stored at −80 °C. The cells were resuspended in a volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride equal to 10 times their packed wet weight, then disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor, the supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-50 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mmtriethanolamine-H2SO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm as before. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and centrifuged as before. The pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. E. coli 1100 cells were treated in the same manner; the level of induction used results in expression ofb from the plasmids at a level approximately equal to the level of chromosomal b expression in 1100, as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Protein concentrations of membrane samples from 1100, KM2/pDM112, and KM2/pDM113 were measured by the method of Lowryet al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations were adjusted to 2.0 mg of total protein per ml, and then CuCl2 was added to a concentration of 10 μm. The mixture was allowed to stand in an open container at 4 °C, and periodically (1, 2, 4, and 24 h) 10-μl aliquots were taken and quenched with 10 μl of 0.1m NEM. The samples were then added to SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. A zero time point was obtained by quenching an aliquot of the diluted membranes before addition of CuCl2. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies were conducted using a Beckman XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge. All studies were carried out at 20 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Sedimentation velocity runs were at 60,000 rpm. The data were analyzed with the Beckman software using both the transport method and the second moment method; essentially identical results were obtained. Sedimentation equilibrium studies were carried out at various rotor speeds ranging from 18,000 to 48,000 rpm. Equilibrium was ascertained by the coincidence of scans taken 2 h apart. Data were fitted to a model with a single ideal species. Partial specific volumes were calculated from the inferred amino acid compositions as described by Cohn and Edsall (25Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides. Reinhold, New York1943: 157-161Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using 15% separating gels. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Blotting was carried out in carbonate blot buffer as described previously (27Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. An anti-b monoclonal antibody, 10-1A4, was a generous gift of Karlheinz Altendorf and Gabriele Deckers-Hebestreit and was labeled with 125I by the IODO-GEN method (28Fraker F.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). N-terminal analysis using dansyl chloride was carried out as described by Gray (29Gray W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out at the Biological Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Ontario) using a Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) in the positive ion mode. Theb subunit is an integral membrane protein, with a single membrane-spanning region at the N terminus. To facilitate study of this protein, the sequence encoding the entire subunit except for the N-terminal 24 amino acids has previously been subcloned into pUC8 to produce the plasmid pSD59; the polypeptide expressed has been calledbsol (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To make the introduction of mutations into bsol easier, a gene containing numerous silent mutations was designed such that useful restriction endonuclease sites were added. The gene was synthesized as eight overlapping oligonucleotides, which were assembled in the multiple cloning region of pUC8 to produce the plasmid pDM3. The encoded protein, namedbsyn, has an eight-residue leader sequence (MTMITNSH) identical to bsol, followed by the sequence of the b subunit starting at residue Tyr-24 (Fig. 1). bsyn, therefore, contains one additional residue relative tobsol, but is otherwise identical; neither protein contains any cysteine residues. bsyn is soluble, is recognized by anti-b monoclonal antibodies (not shown), and behaves similarly to bsol during purification. Single cysteine mutations were introduced into the gene product at a variety of positions; two main regions were targetted for mutagenesis (Fig. 1). First, on the basis of the heptad repeat found from residues 33 to 79 of b, it has been previously suggested that this region adopts a coiled-coil structure (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this region, residues 59–65, representing one full cycle of the heptad repeat, as well as residue Ala-68, an additional heptad dposition, have been mutated individually to cysteine (throughout this paper, all residue numbering is based on the full-length E. coli b sequence). Second, residue Ala-128 has been implicated inb dimerization interactions (15Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Each residue in the “VAILAVA” region (positions 124–132) has also been mutated to cysteine to examine this region. In addition, three residues toward the C terminus were mutated (positions 138, 139, and 146). Note that since the bsyn polypeptide exists as a dimer in solution, the introduction of a single cysteine mutation into the gene results in the presence of two cysteines in the dimer. Throughout this paper we will refer to the position of the cysteine residue in one subunit as n and the position of the cysteine in the second subunit as n′. One convenient method used to induce disulfide bond formation is incubation with excess glutathione (31Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 32Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Glutathione (GSH/GSSG) acts as a disulfide buffer and as a disulfide exchange reagent; after one cysteine residue forms a mixed disulfide with glutathione, a second nearby cysteine can displace it, forming a protein-protein disulfide bond. The second cysteine will not be able to react if it is too far away or has poor geometry for disulfide formation. Eventually an equilibrium is reached; if the disulfided form of the protein predominates at equilibrium, then one may infer that the two cysteines are close together. Equilibrium can be assumed if the same result is obtained regardless of whether the proteins started in a fully reduced or a fully oxidized state. The glutathione procedure is illustrated forbsyn polypeptides containing cysteines in positions 128, 138, 139, or 146 (Fig. 2). The proteins were incubated with a glutathione mixture (GSSG/GSH = 1.1:1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At various time points aliquots were reacted with excess NEM to modify all thiol groups present and thus prevent further disulfide exchange. Each polypeptide was reacted in duplicate, being either mostly oxidized or mostly reduced at the start of the experiment (Fig. 2 A). Comparison of the band intensities after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 2 B) revealed that equilibrium had been attained. The proteins containing the A128C and S139C mutations showed a strong tendency to dimerize, while cysteines at positions 138 and 146 did not tend to form disulfides under these conditions. These results imply that positions 128 and 128′ are close together in the quaternary structure of the dimer, as are positions 139 and 139′, suggesting a parallel interaction between the bsyn subunits in this region. In contrast, cysteine residues at positions 138 and 138′ lack either proximity or proper orientation, as do the residues at 146 and 146′. It is evident from Fig. 2 that it is possible to observe a wide range of propensities for disulfide bond formation using this procedure. Note that because equilibrium was reached, the lack of disulfide formation at positions 138 and 146 cannot be due to inaccessibility of the residues to the glutathione. A similar experiment was performed with bsyn proteins containing mutations at positions 59–65 or 68 in the heptad repeat region; results are shown for samples which began in the fully oxidized form (Fig. 3). Of these positions, the A59C (heptad b position) and S60C (heptad cposition) proteins showed the highest tendency to form disulfides; however, they did not form nearly as completely as the A128C or S139C proteins. Cysteines in the other heptad positions had poor propensities to form disulfides (Fig. 3). In a coiled-coil domain, cysteines at thed positions of the heptad repeat (residues 61 and 68) would be expected to show the highest tendency to form disulfide bonds, since such bonds at these positions perturb the residue orientation and secondary structure the least (33Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3178-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The result that the band c positions in this region ofbsyn showed the highest propensities to form disulfide bonds is inconsistent with the presence of a coiled-coil structure, in which predominantly hydrophobic residues in thea and d positions form an interface. To investigate the relationship between the subunits of thebsyn dimer, proteins containing single cysteine mutations in the region 59–65 were mixed in p"
https://openalex.org/W2050492141,"ArsC encoded by <i>Escherichia coli</i>plasmid R773 catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. The enzymatic reaction requires reduced glutathione and glutaredoxin. In this study a direct association between ArsC and glutaredoxin was demonstrated. An <i>arsC</i> gene with six histidine codons added to the 5′ end of the gene was constructed, and the resulting ArsC enyzme was shown to be functional. Interaction of the histidine-tagged ArsC and glutaredoxin was examined by Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography. The association required the presence of reduced glutathione and either the substrate arsenate or a competitive inhibitor, phosphate or sulfate. A free thiolate on glutathione was not required. A tryptophan residue was introduced into ArsC at the 11th position, immediately adjacent to the active site Cys-12. Trp-11 fluorescence was quenched upon addition of arsenate. Addition of reduced glutathione after arsenate resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence followed by a slower decay of the signal. These spectroscopic signals were specific for arsenate and reduced glutathione; neither competitive inhibitors nor non-thiol glutathione analogs produced this effect. Cys-12 thiolate was also required. Thus the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-11 provides a useful probe to investigate the mechanism of this novel reductase."
https://openalex.org/W2050318820,"The human thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) subunits α and β are transcribed from different genes and associate noncovalently to form the bioactive hTSH heterodimer. Dimerization is rate-limiting for hTSH secretion, and dissociation leads to hormone inactivation. Previous studies on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human follicle-stimulating hormone had shown that it was possible by subunit gene fusion to produce a bioactive, single chain hormone. However, neither the stability nor the clearance from the circulation of such fused glycoprotein hormones has been studied. We show here that genetic fusion of the hTSH α- and β-subunits using the carboxyl-terminal peptide of the hCG β-subunit as a linker created unimolecular hTSH whose receptor binding and bioactivity were comparable to native hTSH. Interestingly, the fused hTSH had higher thermostability and a longer plasma half-life than either native or dimeric hTSH containing the hCG β-subunit-carboxyl-terminal peptide, suggesting that dimer dissociation may contribute to glycoprotein hormone inactivation in vivo. In addition, we show for the first time that synthesis of hTSH as a single polypeptide chain could overcome certain mutagenesis-induced defects in hTSH secretion, therefore enabling functional studies of such mutants. Thus, in addition to prolongation of plasma half-life, genetic fusion of hTSH subunits should be particularly relevant for the engineering of novel analogs where desirable features are offset by decreased dimer formation or stability.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 1The abbreviations used are: TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; hTSH, human thyroid-stimulating hormone; hTSHβ, human thyroid-stimulating hormone β subunit; CG, choriogonadotropin; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; rh, recombinant human; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild type; CTP, carboxyl-terminal peptide; SC, single chain; CMV, cytomegalovirus.1The abbreviations used are: TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; hTSH, human thyroid-stimulating hormone; hTSHβ, human thyroid-stimulating hormone β subunit; CG, choriogonadotropin; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; rh, recombinant human; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild type; CTP, carboxyl-terminal peptide; SC, single chain; CMV, cytomegalovirus. belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family, which also includes the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin (CG). These hormones exist as heterodimers composed of a common α-subunit, which is noncovalently linked to a hormone-specific β-subunit (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Crystallization of hCG had revealed that both subunits have a similar overall structure with a central cystine knot motif (2Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar,3Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Therefore, the glycoprotein hormones are now considered members of the cystine knot growth factor superfamily that includes a variety of structurally related dimeric growth factors, such as nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and transforming growth factor-β (4Sun P.D. Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Grossmann M. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 476-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein hormone α-subunit is encoded in a single gene and thus identical in the amino acid sequence within a species. In contrast, the β-subunits are unique, encoded in distinct genes and responsible for biological specificity (6Fiddes J.C. Talmadge K. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1984; 40: 43-78PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Assembly of the α- and β-subunits is an early posttranslational event in glycoprotein hormone synthesis occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (8Magner J.A. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterodimerization is critical for disulfide bond formation and for hormone-specific posttranslational modifications, such as processing of the carbohydrate side chains, and thus rate-limiting for the secretion of glycoprotein hormones (9Thotakura N.R. Blithe D.L. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1443-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, dimer formation is essential for hormonal activity, since free subunits have minimal receptor binding affinity (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). In addition, dissociation of heterodimeric glycoproteins into their subunits may be a significant factor in terminating glycoprotein hormone activity in vivo (11Campbell K.L. Landefeld T.D. Midgley Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4793-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, covalent linking of the glycoprotein hormone subunits should overcome assembly-dependent deficiency in secretion and may increase hormone stability and activity. It has recently been pioneered by Boime and colleagues and subsequently shown by the group of Puett that bioactive gonadotropins could be produced as single chains (12Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M. Ben-Menahem D.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether this approach is applicable for hTSH, or whether such fusion would affect the stability or the in vivo clearance of these hormones. Such fusion should be particularly relevant to TSH, since the free TSH β-subunit, in contrast to the free CG β-subunit, is unstable in the monomeric form and degraded intracellularly unless stabilized by dimerization with the α-subunit (15Matzuk M.M. Kornmeier C.M. Whitfield G.K. Kourides I.A. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we show that it is possible by subunit gene fusion to produce a tethered form of hTSH with comparable in vitro activity to dimeric hTSH. Furthermore, fusion significantly increased the stability and prolonged the in vivo half-life of hTSH. Moreover, the expression of hTSH as a single chain could overcome selected mutagenesis-induced defects in hTSH secretion, and thus, this approach may be used to expand the spectrum of structure-function studies of glycoprotein hormone analogs. Subunit gene fusion therefore appears to be a promising strategy, not only for the generation of long lasting hTSH analogs, but particularly for the development of recombinant mutants with desirable characteristics, the utility of which may be limited by decreased stability. CHO cells stably transfected with the hTSH receptor (clone JP09) were kindly donated by Dr. G. Vassart, Belgium, and FRTL-5 cells expressing the endogenous rat TSH receptor by Dr. L. D. Kohn, Interthyr Research Foundation (Baltimore, MD). cAMP antibody was generously supplied by Dr. J. L. Vaitukaitis, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and125I-cAMP and 125I-hTSH radiolabeled to a specific activity of 40–60 μCi/μg from Hazleton (Vienna, VA). PCR reagents were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The construction of the hTSH β-subunit bearing the carboxyl-terminal extension peptide of the hCG β-subunit (hTSHβ-CTP) has been described previously (16Joshi L. Murata Y. Wondisford F.E. Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce single chain hTSH (hTSH-SC), we used overlap extension PCR (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) to fuse the amino terminus of the α-subunit cDNA (without the signal sequence) to the carboxyl-terminal end of the hTSHβ-CTP (Fig. 1). Primers P2 5′-CAC ATC AGG AGC TTG TGG GAG GAT CGG and P3 5′-ATC CTC CCA CAA GCT CCT GAT GTG CAG span both the carboxyl-terminal end of the hTSH β-subunit containing the hCGβ-CTP (hTSHβ-CTP) as well as the amino terminus of the coding sequence of the α-subunit. In addition, P1 5′-CTC GAG TCT AGA ATG ACT GCT CTC TTT CTG ATG was designed to anneal 5′ of the hTSH-CTP minigene signal peptide, and P4 5′-CGA CGT GGA TCC ATG CTG TAT TCA TTC to anneal 3′ of the hTSH β-subunit cDNA. Initially, two PCR reactions were performed: P1 and P2 were used with the hTSH-CTP as the template (PCR no. 1), and P3 and P4 using the α-subunit cDNA (PCR no. 2). In a third PCR reaction (PCR no. 3), both these overlapping products were used as combined template to generate the single chain hTSH-SC with P1 and P4. To create Glnα52–Gln78/TSHβ-SC in which both α-glycosylation recognition sequences were deleted by mutating both Asnα52 and Asnα78 to Gln, a previously described α-subunit cDNA construct (Glnα52–Gln78) (18Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Tropea J.E. Bishop L.A. Thotakura N.R. Schofield P.R. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29378-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR no. 2. Similarly, to obtain Aspα38/TSHβ-SC, the α-subunit cDNA construct Aspα38 (19Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Dias J.A. Xia H. Wong R. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) served as the template in PCR no. 2. Following subcloning of the fused wild type or mutant 2-kilobase pair hTSH-SC constructs into the pLB-CMV expression vector, the entire PCR product was sequenced in each case to rule out any undesired polymerase errors. CHO-K1 Cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and glutamine (4 mm). To obtain dimeric wild-type hTSH (hTSH-wt), cells were cotransfected in 60-mm culture dishes with the α-subunit cDNA in pcDNA I/neo and the hTSHβ minigene in the pLB-CMV vector, using a total amount of 2 μg DNA per dish and a liposome formulation (LipofectAMINE reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (20Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hTSH-SC fusion products in the pLB-CMV vector were transfected with identical amounts of total DNA. On the following day, the transfected cells were transferred to CHO serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). After an additional 48 h, the supernatants, including control medium from mock transfections using the expression plasmids without gene inserts, were harvested. The collected media were then concentrated using a Centriprep 10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and used for immunoassays, the various activity assays, and clearance studies. The hTSH constructs were quantified with a panel of different immunoassays, using a total of four different hTSH immunoassays utilizing different monoclonal antibodies, which were described in detail previously (19Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Dias J.A. Xia H. Wong R. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Szkudlinski M.W. Teh N.G. Grossmann M. Tropea J.E. Weintraub B.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Conditioned media from transiently transfected CHO cells were concentrated, fractionated on ConA-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia), reconcentrated, and denatured by boiling in 0.25% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were then resolved on 14% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight with a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the hTSH α-subunit (18Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Tropea J.E. Bishop L.A. Thotakura N.R. Schofield P.R. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29378-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were subsequently visualized by chemiluminence using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG and a luminol substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). The receptor-binding activity of the various hTSH constructs was determined by their ability to displace 125I-bTSH from solubilized porcine thyroid membrane receptor preparations (Kronus, Dana Point, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Binding was also studied in whole cells using FRTL-5 cells expressing the endogenous rat TSH receptor, as described previously (20Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells stably expressing the rhTSH receptor (JP09) were grown in 96-well culture plates in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented as above. Confluent cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, with serial dilutions of hTSH constructs or control medium from mock transfections in a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 280 mmsucrose to maintain isotonicity and 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The amount of cAMP released into the medium was determined by radioimmunoassay (20Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FRTL-5 cells were maintained as described elsewhere (20Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, prior to the cAMP assay, grown in 96-well culture plates in the absence of TSH for 6–8 days. cAMP production of hTSH constructs was determined using the protocol for JP09 cells. FRTL-5 cells were grown in 24-well plates in the presence of TSH to 30% confluence and then cultured in TSH-free medium for 4 days. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with serial dilutions of hTSH constructs or control from mock transfected cells. After 48 h, 1.0 μCi of [3H]thymidine per well (DuPont) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, [3H]thymidine uptake measured as described previously (18Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Tropea J.E. Bishop L.A. Thotakura N.R. Schofield P.R. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29378-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The clearance rate of the hTSH constructs was determined in the rat after intravenous injection of the different hTSH preparations and subsequent determination of hTSH serum levels at defined intervals from 1 to 120 min. Experimental details of this procedure have been described previously (22Constant R.B. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2720-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Szkudlinski M.W. Thotakura N.R. Tropea J.E. Grossmann M. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3325-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Truncation as well as amino acid mutation studies had previously indicated the importance of the α-carboxyl terminus for hTSH activity (20Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To maintain accessibility of this region, we fused the carboxyl terminus of the TSH β-subunit to the amino terminus of the α-subunit. We also included the CTP of the hCG β-subunit, here defined as the carboxyl-terminal 32 amino acids of the hCG β-subunit. The CTP has a high proline/serine content, which lacks significant secondary structure and was previously shown to be suitable as a flexible linker for efficient expression of single chain hFSH (13Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M.R. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10445-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In keeping with previous observations, addition of CTP to the hTSH β-subunit was predicted not to affect receptor binding or intrinsic activity of hTSH (16Joshi L. Murata Y. Wondisford F.E. Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since addition of the CTP had previously been shown to prolong the half-life of hTSH, the clearance rate of hTSH-SC was compared with both dimeric hTSH-wt as well as hTSH-CTP (see below). To demonstrate that hTSH-SC was indeed produced and secreted as a single chain, we performed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Western blotting of ConA-fractionated conditioned media from CHO cells transiently transfected with either the fusion product or individual hTSH subunits using an antibody against the α-subunit. Under reducing conditions, heterodimeric hTSH-wt dissociated into individual subunits, and the free α-subunit migrated at the expected 25 kDa. In contrast, the α-subunit antibody recognized a 55-kDa band consistent with the covalently linked hTSH fusion protein (Fig. 2). The level of secretion of hTSH-SC from transiently transfected CHO cells, as determined by four different immunoassays, was similar to hTSH-wt (Table I), if individual subunit plasmids were cotransfected at a 3 to 1 molar ratio. Such a 3 to 1 molar excess of the α-subunit plasmid led to a higher secretion of dimeric hTSH compared with transfection of both subunits at an equimolar ratio. Addition of the CTP to the hTSH β-subunit reduced secretion of dimeric hTSH, whereas fusion of the hTSH subunits with inclusion of the CTP sequence as a linker did not impair subunit folding or expression of the hormone (Table I).Table ISecretion of hTSH analogsAnalogSubunit plasmid ratioSecretionnng/ml ± S.E.hTSH-wtα:β 3:131.2 ± 1.75α:β 1:124.1 ± 1.63hTSH-CTPα:β 3:125.2 ± 2.85α:β 1:117.1 ± 1.13hTSH-SC29.6 ± 4.711Glnα52–Gln78/hTSHβ-wt0.05 ± 0.054Glnα52–Gln78/hTSHβ-SC5.1 ± 1.85Aspα38/hTSHβ-wt<0.013Aspα38/hTSHβ-SC<0.013Hormone levels were determined in conditioned media from CHO cells transiently transfected with the respective hTSH constructs.n denotes number of independent transfections, each performed in triplicate dishes.

To test the effects of subunit fusion on mutagenesis-induced defects in hTSH secretion, we studied the secretion of single chain hTSH analogs Glnα52–Gln78/TSHβ-SC lacking the two α-subunit glycosylation recognition sequences and Aspα38/hTSHβ-SC. These mutations had previously been shown to profoundly decrease or abolish the secretion of dimeric hTSH (18Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Tropea J.E. Bishop L.A. Thotakura N.R. Schofield P.R.

Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Consistent with findings that non-glycosylated glycoprotein hormone subunits are misfolded and degraded intracellularly, the free Glnα52–Gln78subunit was not detectable (<0.01% of hTSH-wt-free α-subunit) by an α-subunit-specific radioimmunoassay. In contrast, free Aspα38 subunit was secreted in levels quantitatively similar to hTSH-wt free α-subunit (19Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Dias J.A. Xia H. Wong R. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the failure of the Aspα38 subunit to dimerize with hTSH β-subunit was not related to its misfolding or degradation. Fusion of the Glnα52–Gln78 subunit to the hTSH β-subunit increased secretion, indicating that fusion of both subunits can partially overcome the requirement of α-subunit carbohydrate chains for hTSH secretion. In contrast, fusion of the Aspα38subunit did not increase the amount of hTSH produced, suggesting that this particular mutation, possibly due to its predicted location at the subunit interface in close proximity to residues forming intersubunit hydrogen bonds (2Lapthorn A.J.

Stability of the different hTSH proteins was tested initially by incubating conditioned media obtained from transient transfections at 37 °C. All three forms of hTSH, hTSH-wt, hTSH-CTP as well as hTSH-SC were stable at this temperature, and there was minimal (<5%) degradation over a period of 21 days, as judged by repeated determinations of hTSH immunoreactivity with an assay specific for heterodimeric hTSH, which does not recognize free subunits. However, incubation at 55 °C showed that the fused hTSH-SC was significantly more stable than dimeric hTSH in that less than 15% of hTSH-SC was degraded after 24 h, compared with more than 50% of dimeric hTSH, either hTSH-wt or hTSH-CTP (Fig. 3). The receptor binding of the fused hTSH-SC was similar to that of hTSH-wt and hTSH-CTP when tested in porcine thyroid membranes (Fig. 4) or in FRTL-5 cells expressing the endogenous rat TSH receptor (not shown). In addition, the ability of hTSH-SC to induce cAMP stimulation in JP09 cells (Fig. 5 a), as well as cAMP stimulation (Fig. 5 b) and growth promotion (Fig. 5 c) in FRTL-5 cells was comparable to that of hTSH-wt and to that of hTSH-CTP. This indicates that both introduction of the CTP linker as well as subunit fusion did not alter the in vitrocharacteristics of hTSH.Figure 5a and b, cAMP induction by the various hTSH constructs in JP09 cells (a) and FRTL-5 cells (b). Increasing concentrations of the various hTSH constructs were incubated with JP09 or FRTL-5 cells, and the cAMP concentration in the resulting supernatants was assayed by radioimmunoassay. c, induction of cell growth by the hTSH constructs. Increasing concentrations of hTSH were incubated with FRTL-5 cells, which were previously grown in the absence of TSH. After 48 h, [3H]thymidine was added, and after an additional 24 h, radioactivity incorporated into the DNA was measured. The radioactivity incorporated by the cells in the presence of concentrated medium from mock transfected cells was not different from base line levels. rhTSH represents recombinant hTSH from Genzyme Corp.

Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), addition of the CTP to the hTSH β-subunit significantly prolonged the plasma half-life of dimeric hTSH. 50% of the hTSH-CTP was cleared from the rat circulation after 23.2 ± 7.9 min compared with 8.7 ± 6.1 min for hTSH-wt (p = 0.01). Remarkably, fusion of the individual subunits including the CTP as a linker led to an even further significant prolongation of half-life; 50% of hTSH-SC was cleared after 51.6 ± 14.4 min (p = 0.02 compared with hTSH-CTP) (Fig. 6). The half-life of recombinant analogs can be prolonged by increasing the Stoke's radius of a protein using polyethylene glycolylation or the introduction of new carbohydrate recognition sites, by modification of protease recognition sites to increase stability, or by carbohydrate modification to avoid carbohydrate-specific clearance mechanisms (5Grossmann M. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 476-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Szkudlinski M.W. Teh N.G. Grossmann M. Tropea J.E. Weintraub B.D. Nat.

Our present study using a genetically fused, single chain hTSH highlights a novel way by which an increased in vivo half-life may be achieved. Although it had previously been shown that bioactive hCG and hFSH could be produced as a single chain (12Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M.R. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of genetic fusion on glycoprotein hormone stability and plasma clearance rate had not previously been investigated. Further, from the findings on hCG and hFSH, it was not predictable whether a fusion approach would also be feasible for hTSH. In particular, recent mutational analysis of hTSH structure-function relationships has identified common α-subunit domains that play strikingly different roles for heterodimer formation, receptor binding, and bioactivity of hTSH compared with hCG and hFSH (18Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Tropea J.E. Bishop L.A. Thotakura N.R. Schofield P.R. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29378-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Dias J.A. Xia H. Wong R. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these domains are located in close proximity to the β-seat-belt region, which is crucial for hTSH specificity, suggesting that the seatbelt may direct these common domains to function in a hormone-specific fashion (5Grossmann M. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 476-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Wong R. Dias J.A. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15532-15540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In light of previous observations (16Joshi L. Murata Y. Wondisford F.E. Szkudlinski M.W. Desai R. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3839-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), validated here, that addition of the CTP with its O-linked carbohydrate side chains prolonged hTSH half-life in vivo, the full-length CTP was used as a linker for fusing the hTSH subunits. We anticipated that the linker may synergize with the fusion to prolong the half-life of hTSHin vivo. Indeed, gene fusion significantly decreased the clearance rate of dimeric hTSH even when compared with dimeric hTSH bearing the CTP. This indicates that dissociation of hTSH into its subunits occurs in vivo and contributes to its deactivation, as individual subunits are devoid of in vivo activity and rapidly cleared from the circulation (11Campbell K.L. Landefeld T.D. Midgley Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4793-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, fusion of the subunits of hTSH increased its thermostability. It is conceivable that such enhanced stability may become particularly relevant for recombinant glycoprotein hormone analogs with genetically engineered novel features that are less stable than the wild-type hormone. In this respect, hFSH analogs have recently been described, in which site-directed mutagenesis within regions important for activity significantly decreased their stability (25Roth K.E. Dias J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7928-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic subunit fusion can overcome certain mutagenesis-induced defects in heterodimer formation. The presence of carbohydrate side chains on both subunits is essential for proper subunit folding and combination, and intracellular assembly of deglycosylated subunits is inefficient (10Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1443-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, glycosylation of the α-subunit appears necessary to overcome retention of the hTSH β-subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum (8Magner J.A. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in contrast to the free hCG β-subunit, the free hTSH β-subunit is not efficiently secreted (26Corless C.L. Matzuk M.M. Ramabhadran T.V. Krichevsky A. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our fusion experiments suggest that the glycosylated hTSH β-subunit, if fused to an α-subunit devoid of glycosylation recognition sequences, may function as a chaperone inducing α-subunit folding despite the absence of carbohydrate chains and thus partially rescue the nonglycosylated α-subunit. On the other hand, fusion was not able to induce heterodimer formation with a mutated α-subunit Aspα38 which, although dimer formation-incompetent, nevertheless appeared to be properly folded and secreted. It is interesting to consider the dimeric structure of glycoprotein hormones from an evolutionary perspective. The glycoprotein hormones were probably derived from a common ancestor gene, and in less developed organisms, a single primordial monomeric hormone with a corresponding receptor was likely sufficient for the necessary endocrine functions (27Talmadge K. Vamvakopoulos N.C. Fiddes J.C. Nature. 1984; 307: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To fulfill the requirements for an increasingly complex organism, adopting a dimeric ligand structure enabled functional diversification and increased flexibility without the need for the development of entirely new mechanisms of receptor activation, albeit perhaps at the expense of reduced protein stability. This diversification appears to have evolved by the emergence of inhibitory domains on both ligand and receptor which impose steric hindrances thus allowing only the intended ligand to interact with the common activation domain (28Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Such negative specificity determinants have not only developed in glycoprotein hormones and their receptors, but also in other members of the cystine knot growth factor superfamily, such as neurotropins (29Ibanez C.F. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and also in other G protein-coupled receptors (30Tian Y. Wu L.-H. Oxender D.L. Chung F.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20250-20257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More generally, dimer formation is necessary for the activity and specificity of many, if not all cystine knot growth factors, as well as for other bioactive molecules, such as enzymes and transcription factors. In this respect, fusion of individual protein monomers has recently been used to develop transcription factors and cytokine analogs with defined properties and increased biological activities (31Pomerantz J.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1995; 267: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P.G. Kallen K.-J. Wollmer A. Groetzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This approach poses a universal strategy to enhance both stability and bioactivity as well as to control specificity of noncovalently linked oligomers, and may also be used to engineer molecules with novel activities or specificities.

Prior studies indicated that HslVU requires ATP hydrolysis for the cleavage of peptides and proteins. We show here that ATP concentrations that activate hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin are 50–100 fold lower than those necessary for degradation of proteins (e.g. casein). Also, the nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate, can support peptide hydrolysis, but only after an initial time lag not seen with ATP. This delay decreased at higher temperatures and with higher HslU or HslV concentrations and was eliminated by preincubation of HslU and HslV together. Thus, ATP hydrolysis accelerates the association of HslU and HslV, which occurs slowly with the nonhydrolyzable analog.The addition of KCl stimulated 4–6-fold the peptidase activity with AMP-PNP present and eliminated the time lag, but KCl had no stimulatory effect with ATP. NH4+ and Cs+ had similar effects as K+, but Na+ and Li+ were ineffective. AMP-PNP by itself supported hydrolysis of casein and other polypeptides only 20% as well as ATP, but in the presence of K+, Cs+, or NH4+, AMP-PNP activated casein degradation even better than ATP, although it was not hydrolyzed. In addition, MgCl2, MnCl2, and CaCl2 allowed some peptidase and caseinase activity in the absence of any nucleotide. However, Mn2+ and Ca2+, unlike Mg2+, abolished ATP hydrolysis and prevented further activation by ATP or AMP-PNP. These findings indicate that ATP binding to a high affinity site triggers the formation of an active state capable of peptide cleavage, although ATP hydrolysis facilitates this process. Rapid degradation of proteins requires a distinct state of the enzyme, which is normally reached through ATP hydrolysis at low affinity sites. However, AMP-PNP binding together with K+can induce a form of HslVU that degrades proteins without energy consumption.

In the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in eukaryotes, ATP hydrolysis is required for both substrate conjugation to ubiquitin and for the assembly and proteolytic activity of the 26 S proteasome, which consists of a 20 S proteolytic particle and a 19 S complex containing multiple ATPases (3Hershko A.

The two best characterized enzymes of this group are the ATP-dependent proteases La (Lon) and ClpAP (Ti), which catalyze the rapid elimination of abnormal proteins and several short-lived normal regulatory proteins (1Goldberg A.L.

It consists of two distinct components: HslU, a 50-kDa protein with ATPase activity, and HslV, a 19-kDa protein that by itself has little or no peptidase activity but is activated markedly upon association with HslU. HslU is a member of the Hsp100/Clp family of ATPases that associate with the ClpP peptidase to form ATP-dependent proteases but can also function by themselves as molecular chaperones (8Wickner S.

HslV is of particular interest because it is homologous in sequence and tertiary structure to β-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome from eukaryotes, certain eubacteria, and archaebacteria (11Lupas A.

These proteases function by a novel mechanism, in which a conserved N-terminal threonine residue acts as the active site nucleophile in proteolytic activity (12Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P.

HslVU appears to play a role in the rapid degradation of incomplete polypeptides induced by puromycin treatment and certain mutant polypeptides, which are stabilized in an hslV orhslU mutant (14Missiakas D.

Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis indicates that HslU and HslV by themselves are both ring-like structures in which HslU behaves as a hexamer or heptamer (Mr 297,000 and 346,000) and HslV as two hexameric rings (Mr228,000) (16Rohrwild M.

Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Letts. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The HslVU complex appears as a cylindrical four-ring particle in which two central HslV hexameric rings are flanked at both ends by an HslU ring (16Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Müller S.A. Huang H.-C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In certain respects, this structure resembles the ClpAP protease, which also forms a four-ring structure, with two heptameric rings (ClpP) sandwiched between a hexameric ring (ClpA) at each end (18Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The HslVU protease thus has properties intermediate between those of the eukaryotic proteasome and theE. coli Clp protease. It also offers an attractive model system for studying the role of ATP hydrolysis in the mechanisms of the 26 S proteasome. Studies of the E. coli La and ClpAP proteases have indicated several distinct functions for ATP hydrolysis in protein breakdown. ATP is necessary for the stability of La and the ClpA ATPase, and it promotes the assembly of the ClpA oligomer and facilitates its association with the ClpP peptidase (19Goldberg A.L. Moerschell R.P. Chung C.H. Maurizi M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 350-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that ATP hydrolysis is also required for the assembly of the 26 S proteasome complex from the 19 S ATPase component and the 20 S proteasome particle, as well as for maintaining the stability of this large complex (4Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). In addition, ATP hydrolysis regulates proteolytic activity by activating the proteolytic site. In protease La, ATP binding allows formation of the peptidase site, and the subsequent hydrolysis of ATP temporarily inactivates it as part of an ordered reaction cycle (1Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In the ClpAP protease, ATP binding to ClpA enlarges the active site on ClpP to allow cleavage of larger peptides (21Woo K.M. Chung W.J. Ha D.B. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2088-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both La and ClpAP exhibit a protein substrate-activated ATPase activity (20Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12022-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of peptide bonds in protein substrates by La is proportional to the amount of ATP utilized; normally, two ATP molecules are consumed per peptide bond cleaved, although this stoichiometric relationship can be partially uncoupled (23Menon A.S. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 722-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins by the 26 S proteasome also requires ATP hydrolysis, whose precise role is still unclear (4Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). Finally, ATP hydrolysis has been proposed to assist the unfolding of globular protein substrates and their translocation into the proteolytic chamber. Although cleavage of short peptides by proteases La and ClpAP occurs readily in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, the requirement for ATP hydrolysis seems to be more stringent with long polypeptides that may contain higher order structures (24Katayama-Fujimura Y. Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Van Melderen L. Thi M.H.D. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In fact, ClpA and ClpX ATPases by themselves can function in a chaperone-like manner to disassemble multimeric proteins and in this way may help present them to the ClpP proteolytic component in an easily digestible form (8Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 9Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marzsalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A proteolytically inactive form of the mitochondrial homolog of La has also been shown to exhibit a chaperone-like function (26Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. Suzuki C.K. Science. 1996; 274: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the 26 S ATPase possesses such chaperone-like activity as well, since only fully unfolded proteins may enter into the 20 S proteasome chamber (12Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis also plays a critical role in the function of the HslVU protease. Cleavage of ATP by the HslU ATPase dramatically activates hydrolysis of both short peptides and proteins by the HslV peptidase, while HslV stimulates ATP hydrolysis by HslU (6Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H.

H., Shim, Y. K., Kang, M.-S., Goldberg, A. L., and Chung, C. H. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). Protein substrates (but not nondegraded proteins) also activate the ATPase activity of HslU (41Seol, J. H., Yoo, S. J., Shin, D. H., Shim, Y. K., Kang, M.-S., Goldberg, A. L., and Chung, C. H. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). Thus, the proteolytic and ATPase functions of the HslVU protease appear tightly linked. Surprisingly, in contrast to all other known ATP-dependent proteases, the activity of HslVU against small peptides (for example, Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-Amc) 1The abbreviations used are: Z, carbobenzoxy; Amc, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1.1The abbreviations used are: Z, carbobenzoxy; Amc, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1. was reported to require ATP hydrolysis, since very little activity was supported by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (6Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We undertook these studies to examine more closely the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in HslVU function. We demonstrate here conditions that can eliminate the requirement for nucleotide hydrolysis for degradation of peptides and proteins. These studies also indicate the existence of multiple functional states of HslVU that are normally achieved by ATP hydrolysis. Purified HslV and HslU were prepared as described previously (16Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Müller S.A. Huang H.-C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-Amc) was obtained from BACHEM (Switzerland), and 10 mm stocks were prepared in 100% Me2SO. Bovine β-casein and α-lactalbumin were obtained from Sigma, [14C]formaldehyde was from NEN Life Science Products, and recombinant human IGF-1 was a kind gift of Dr. W. Prouty (Lilly).14C-Labeled β-casein was prepared by reductive methylation (28Rice R.H. Means G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 831-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Reduced and methylated α-lactalbumin and IGF-1 were prepared as described before (35Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Bis-Tris propane-HCl (pH 7.5). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Assays were performed at 37 °C in mixtures containing various amounts of HslV and HslU, 0.1 mm Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-Amc, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm nucleotide except where noted. For single time point assays, the reaction volume was 0.1 ml, and at the indicated times the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.9 ml of 1% SDS, followed by measurement of the fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Continuous measurement of the Amc released during peptide hydrolysis was performed in a final volume of 0.75 ml. For casein degradation assays, the reaction buffer was the same as described above. Except where noted, assays were performed at 37 °C for 1 h, typically in a 0.1-ml final volume, containing 7–10 μg of14C-labeled β-casein (∼20,000 cpm/μg) and various amounts of HslV and HslU. The reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 10%), and the activity was measured as the percentage of total radioactive casein converted into acid-soluble products. For degradation assays using α-lactalbumin and IGF-1 as substrates, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) was replaced by 25 mm Bis-Tris propane-HCl (pH 7.5), in a reaction volume of 25 μl. The activity was monitored by the amount of newly generated α-amino groups that reacted with fluorescamine, as described previously (35Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Usually, 10 times more enzyme was used in measuring protein breakdown than for assays of peptide hydrolysis. Phosphate production under conditions used for casein hydrolysis was measured by the nonradioactive malachite-molybdate method as described before (29Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) and confirmed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The HslVU protease has been shown to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptide Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-Amc and a number of polypeptide substrates in the presence of ATP (6Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C.

H., Shim, Y. K., Kang, M.-S., Goldberg, A. L., and Chung, C. H. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). To determine the ATP concentrations required for these activities, purified HslV and HslU were combined and incubated with this fluorogenic tripeptide or14C-labeled casein and different concentrations of ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, theKact for ATP was 3–4 μm for peptide hydrolysis but 200–300 μm for14C-labeled casein degradation. Hydrolysis of two other polypeptides, α-lactalbumin and IGF-1, showed similarKact for ATP as casein hydrolysis (data not shown). Interestingly, prior studies indicated that theKm for ATP hydrolysis by HslVU was ∼300 μm (7Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.-S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which resembles the Kactvalues for protein degradation, but was 100-fold higher than that for peptide hydrolysis. Since the concentration of ATP needed to activate peptide hydrolysis was much lower than that for protein degradation, there seem to be two distinct active states of HslVU; ATP at a high affinity site can activate cleavage of small peptides, while its occupancy of a distinct, low affinity site is essential for hydrolysis of proteins. We undertook a systematic study on the ability of various nucleotides to stimulate peptidase activity by HslVU. As reported previously (6Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), little or no peptide cleavage occurred in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ADP, AMP, CTP, GTP, UTP, or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PCP. However, in contrast to prior reports, we found that the nonhydrolyzable analogs AMP-PNP and AMP-CPP supported significant peptide hydrolysis (Table I, control). (No meaningful results could be obtained with ATPγS because the commercially available ATPγS was contaminated with appreciable amounts of ATP.)Table IKCl stimulates the hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-Amc in the presence of AMP-PNP and AMP-CPPAddition (1 mm)Peptidase activityNo KCl50 mm KCl%None8.05.5ATP10075AMP-PNP37141AMP-CPP40158AMP-PCP5.85.1ADP4.93.4AMP8.35.2CTP2.35.1GTP1.61.7UTP3.43.6Reaction mixtures contained 1.5 μg/ml HslV and 4.3 μg/ml HslU. For incubations with ATP, AMP-PNP, and AMP-CPP, assays were performed for various periods up to 40 min. For incubations with the remaining nucleotides, activity was assayed at 40 min. The rate of peptide hydrolysis using ATP without KCl was expressed as 100%. Open table in a new tab Reaction mixtures contained 1.5 μg/ml HslV and 4.3 μg/ml HslU. For incubations with ATP, AMP-PNP, and AMP-CPP, assays were performed for various periods up to 40 min. For incubations with the remaining nucleotides, activity was assayed at 40 min. The rate of peptide hydrolysis using ATP without KCl was expressed as 100%. One major difference was found between the peptidase activity seen with ATP and that with the nonhydrolyzable analogs; ATP addition immediately activated peptide hydrolysis, while AMP-PNP (and AMP-CPP) allowed peptide cleavage only after an initial delay (Fig. 2). In previous studies with these nucleotides (6Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.-S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), peptidase activity had been determined only at a single time point (usually 10 or 15 min), which was during or just after this time lag. Therefore, it was concluded that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs could not support significant peptide hydrolysis. For example, in a typical experiment (Fig. 2), 10 min after nucleotide addition peptide cleavage with AMP-PNP was about 14% of that with ATP, but after the lag period, the rate of peptide cleavage in the presence of AMP-PNP was linear and approximately 40% of the initial rate seen with ATP (0.22 nmol/min and 0.60 nmol/min, respectively). These findings indicate that HslVU activation occurs much more rapidly with ATP present than with the nonhydrolyzable analogs. Because HslU oligomerization requires nucleotide binding (16Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Müller S.A. Huang H.-C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Shin D.H. Yoo S.J. Shim Y.K. Seol J.H. Kang M.-S. Chung C.H. FEBS Letts. 1996; 398: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), one component of enzyme activation may be HslU self-assembly, although ADP can also support this process, but it does not allow peptide hydrolysis. In addition, since both HslU and HslV must be present for rapid peptide hydrolysis, ATP may facilitate the association between HslU and HslV. If so, conditions that favor complex formation should decrease the lag time seen with AMP-PNP. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the lag time preceding peptide hydrolysis decreased with increasing amounts of HslU. Thus, the slow step in peptide hydrolysis with AMP-PNP may be HslU self-assembly. However, the lag time also decreased with increasing amounts of HslV when HslU concentration was held constant (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the slow activation with AMP-PNP appears at least in part attributable to the time required for the association between HslU and HslV. In addition, the magnitude of the lag time with AMP-PNP depended on the temperature. Lowering the temperature from 37 to 30 or 20 °C extended the lag time 2–3-fold (Fig. 3 C). To test if self-assembly of HslU oligomers and formation of the HslVU complex may contribute to this delay preceding enzyme activation in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs, these components were preincubated with AMP-PNP before substrate addition. Preincubation of HslU with AMP-PNP for 5 min at 37 °C reduced partially the time lag (from ∼5 to ∼2 min), and preincubation of HslU and HslV together with AMP-PNP completely eliminated it (Fig. 3 D). As expected, preincubation of HslV with the nucleotide did not affect the lag. In the presence of ATP, the extent of the stimulation of the HslV peptidase and proteinase activity depends on the concentration of HslU (7Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.-S.

K., Kang, M.-S., Goldberg, A. L., and Chung, C. H. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar).1 For protein degradation, the maximal activity was obtained when the molar ratio of HslU rings to HslV rings reached 1:1 (a mass ratio of 3:1) (41Seol, J. H., Yoo, S. J., Shin, D. H., Shim, Y. K., Kang, M.-S., Goldberg, A. L., and Chung, C. H. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that a similar ratio of HslU to HslV also gave the maximal peptidase activity with ATP. In the presence of AMP-PNP, the level of peptidase activity after the lag also depended on the amount of HslU. At all HslU concentrations tested, the rate of peptide hydrolysis with AMP-PNP (after the lag) was less than with ATP, but the difference between the activity with ATP and AMP-PNP diminished with increasing HslU (Fig. 4). Perhaps the simplest explanation for these findings is that HslU self-assembly and association with HslV are less efficient with AMP-PNP than with ATP. Therefore, in the presence of AMP-PNP, higher concentrations of HslU are needed to achieve the same level of activity as with ATP. The results shown above suggest that ATP binding is sufficient to support complex formation between HslU and HslV leading to peptide hydrolysis, but this process is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis. In an effort to optimize the conditions for peptide hydrolysis by HslVU, we examined the effect of various salts in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of NaCl (50 mm) slightly reduced the peptidase activity with both ATP and AMP-PNP. KCl (50 mm) also inhibited by about 20% the ATP-supported peptidase activity. However, to our surprise, KCl stimulated 4–5-fold peptide hydrolysis with AMP-PNP present, such that this activity was similar to or greater than that with ATP. The addition of KCl also eliminated the time lag preceding peptide cleavage with AMP-PNP alone. When the ATP analog was not present, KCl did not stimulate peptide hydrolysis by HslV or by HslVU. The maximal stimulation was reached at 100–200 mm KCl, which resembles the intracellular concentrations of KCl in E. coli (32Epstein W. Schultz S.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The concentration of KCl for half-maximal peptidase activity was approximately 20 mm (Fig. 6 A). A similar stimulation was seen when KCl was replaced by potassium acetate (data not shown); thus, only the cation seems critical.Figure 6A, effect of different co"

Transport of macromolecules across biological membranes is currently a topic of considerable research interest. A great deal is known about protein and ribonucleoprotein transport across the nuclear, mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Gorlich D. Mattaj I.

Evidence has also accumulated for transport of small RNAs from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, but, until recently, little was known about the mechanism of this process for lack of suitable in vitro systems. In yeast, a single nuclear-encoded tRNA species, tRNA1Lys, is mitochondrially imported (3Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S.

Import of a large number of tRNAs is necessitated by the apparent lack of tRNA genes in the mitochondrial DNA of these organisms. To date, 9 different nuclear-coded tRNA species, including tRNATyr(GUA), tRNALys(UUU), and tRNAThr(CGU), are known to be abundant in mitochondria, tRNALeu(CAG) and tRNAArg(UCG) are present at low concentrations, while tRNAGln(CUG) is undetectable in the organelle. The development of in vitro RNA import systems in yeast (3Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Leishmania (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has allowed the import mechanism to be explored. Using the latter system, we showed that small synthetic transcripts (antisense RNA from the 5′-untranslated region of the β-tubulin gene) structurally homologous to tRNA are efficiently imported (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The antisense transcript contains the sequence AUGGCAGAG in a putative hairpin-loop which is homologous or identical to a part of the D stem-loop of a number of imported tRNAs (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that the D stem-loop plays an important part in importin vivo (12Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). We previously observed that totalLeishmania tRNA enters isolated mitochondria to become labeled with UTP at the 3′ termini by terminal uridylyl transferase in the matrix (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This reaction is specifically inhibited by β-tubulin antisense transcripts, indicating the use of a common pathway by the two RNAs (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used cloned tRNA species to directly examine the import process. Import is ATP-dependent, sequence-specific and saturable by RNA, indicating a receptor-mediated process. The presence of one or more high-affinity RNA-binding sites on the mitochondrial surface was subsequently demonstrated (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the identity of the receptor remains unknown. A 15-kDa heat-stable protein which specifically binds to β-tubulin antisense RNA (the tubulin antisense-binding protein, or TAB) 1The abbreviations used are: TAB, tubulin antisense-binding protein; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. was previously detected in crude extracts of Leishmania promastigotes (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A similar or identical protein is also present on the mitochondrial surface (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study we report the purification of TAB protein and immunochemical experiments to investigate the role of TAB in mitochondrial tRNA import. Leishmania strain UR6, atropica-like strain, was cultured on solid blood agar (16Das S. Adhya S. J. Biosci. 1990; 15: 239-248Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or in medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Mitochondria were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation following the method of Harris et al. (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (100–200 μg of protein) were treated with trypsin (10 μg/ml) for 20 min on ice, trypsin was inactivated with 90 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min, and the vesicles were washed twice with STE-B (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) before use. Mitochondrial proteins were solubilized with 0.3–0.4% Triton X-100 in STE-B. The soluble lysate was spectrophotometrically assayed for succinate dehydrogenase by the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as described previously (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Kynurenine hydroxylase was assayed by the method of Hayaishi (18Hayaishi O. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 807-809Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reactions (1 ml) containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm NADPH, 10 mm KCl and mitochondrial extract were initiated by addition of l-kynurenine to 0.1 mm. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm relative to a control lacking kynurenine was measured over a period of 15 min. Conversion of 0.1 μmol of kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine with simultaneous oxidation of NADPH results in a decrease in optical density of 0.108 at 340 nm (based on the extinction coefficients of 3290, 2200, and 6220 for kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and NADPH, respectively). Clone pSG3B contains sequences between +25 and −53 of the Leishmania β-tubulin gene in vector pSPT19 (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The homologous tRNATyr(GUA) gene was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification (19Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scarf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar) ofLeishmania strain UR6 genomic DNA (0.5 μg in a 25-μl volume) using the primers O-34: GGGGTACCTTCTGTAGCTCAATTGGT corresponding to the 5′-terminal 20 nucleotides of mature tRNATyr(GUA) of Leishmania tarentolae (8Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) plusKpnI linker, and O-35: GGAATTCTCCTTCCGGCCGGAATCG complementary to the 3′-terminal 18 nucleotide plus EcoRI linker. The gel-purified polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and inserted into the polylinker of pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) to yield pSKB-1. The gene for tRNAGln(CUG) was similarly cloned as recombinant pSKB-2 using polymerase chain reaction primers O-36: CCGGTACCGCTCCTATAGTGTAGCGGTT and O-37: GGAATTCACTCCTACCTGGACTCGAAC corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences of L. tarentolae tRNAGln(CUG) (8Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSKB-1(Δ-1), containing nucleotides 1–36 of the tRNATyr(GUA) gene, was obtained by digesting pSKB-1 with BamHI, limited exonuclease III treatment followed by S1 nuclease and T4 DNA polymerase, insertion of a BamHI linker adapter, and recircularization with T4 DNA ligase. The sequences of both strands of each clone were determined by dideoxy chain termination. pSG3B(poly(A)), the template for synthesis of poly(A)-tailed antisense RNA, was derived from pSG3B by addition of the (dA:dT)30 sequence from pSP64(poly(A)) (Promega). Standard procedures were followed for recombinant DNA manipulations (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Run-off transcripts from EcoRI-linearized (orBamHI-linearized in case of pSKB-1(Δ-1)) plasmids were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP, as described previously (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Commercial yeast tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim) and gel-purified Leishmania tRNA were used where indicated. 32P-Labeled RNA was incubated with isolated mitochondria and import was monitored by protection from RNase (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions (20 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 6.7 mmcreatine phosphate, 60 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase,32P-labeled RNA, and 10 μl (80 μg of protein) of mitochondria in storage buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation for 45 min at 25 °C, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 2000 units/ml RNase T1 were added and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. STE-B buffer (500 μl) was added, mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation, resupended in 20 μl of STE-B, digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for 5 min at 25 °C, then SDS was added to 0.5% and incubation continued for 10 min more. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA was resolved by 8 m urea-6% PAGE. Binding of RNA to the mitochondrial surface was assayed in 10- or 20-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP (as indicated), 6.7 mm creatine phosphate, 60 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 m KCl, 32P-labeled RNA and mitochondria as indicated. After incubation at 25 °C for the specified times, vesicles were washed twice with STE-B (1 ml each), deproteinized, and bound RNA analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) were transferred to nitrocellulose, renatured in situ, and probed with 32P-labeled RNA as described (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Promastigotes of Leishmaniastrain UR6 were lysed with Triton X-100, and dialyzed S-100 extracts were prepared as described previously (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that two successive extractions were carried out with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer and the extracts pooled before dialysis. The extract was heated at 55 °C for 7 min, cooled on ice, denatured proteins removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant immediately subjected to RNA affinity chromatography. To prepare the affinity column, poly(A)-tailed pSG3B RNA (50–100 μg) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA was slowly passed through a 1-ml oligo(dT)-cellulose column under gravity, the flow-through was collected and passed a second time through the column. The matrix, containing immobilized RNA, was washed twice with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and equilibriated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol (Buffer DB) containing 0.1m NaCl. Subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. The heat-treated S-100 (about 1 mg of protein in buffer DB containing 0.1 m NaCl) was loaded on the RNA affinity column (1 ml) and passed twice at 0.25 ml/min. The column was washed successively with (i) 3 ml of DB containing 0.1 m NaCl, (ii) 5 ml of DB containing 0.25 m NaCl and 100 μg/ml heparin, (iii) 5 ml of DB containing 0.25 m NaCl only, and (iv) 3 ml of DB containing 1 m NaCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at each step and 1 μl was assayed for TAB activity by gel retardation of32P-labeled β-tubulin antisense RNA (2 fmol), as described (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In some cases, the 1 m NaCl eluate was diluted to 0.25 m in NaCl with DB and rechromatographed on the affinity column. Fractions of the 1 m NaCl eluate containing TAB activity were pooled, dialyzed against DB containing 5% glycerol for 2 h with 2 changes, concentrated about 10-fold by dialysis against dry Sephadex, and stored at −70 °C. Fractions were analyzed by silver staining (22Johnstone A. Thorpe R. Immunochemistry in Practice.Second Edition. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1987Google Scholar) of proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. For peptide sequencing, affinity-purified TAB was run on SDS-PAGE and the 15-kDa subunit electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Automated amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence analysis were performed at the UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility, Los Angeles, CA. Antibody against the gel-purified 15-kDa subunit was raised in rabbits by 3 injections of about 100 μg each at 10-day intervals. Antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgG was purified from serum by protein A-agarose chromatography (22Johnstone A. Thorpe R. Immunochemistry in Practice.Second Edition. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1987Google Scholar). Protein A (Sigma) was labeled with Na125I in the presence of sodium metabisulfite (22Johnstone A. Thorpe R. Immunochemistry in Practice.Second Edition. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1987Google Scholar). Western blots on polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with 10 μg/ml IgG or 1:100 dilution of antiserum in blocking buffer for 18 h at 4 °C, washed 3 times with TBS, then treated with 105-106 cpm/ml 125I-labeled protein A for 1 h. After 3 washes with TBS the blots were autoradiographed. Promastigotes were washed with PBS, suspended at about 106 organisms/ml in PBS, and applied to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After immobilization for 30 min at room temperature, the coverslips were washed with 3–4 times with PBS. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min, washed with PBS, then blocking solution (PBS containing 10% goat serum) was added for 30 min. The blocked coverslips were incubated with antiserum (1:100 dilution in blocking solution) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed 3–4 times with PBS, then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. After a further 3–4 washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on PBS containing 10% glycerol and 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Stained cells were examined at magnification × 1000 under ultraviolet illumination using either FITC or rhodamine filter in a Leitz Diaplan microscope. Isolated mitochondria were blocked with buffer STE-B containing 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (or 10% goat serum for immunofluorescence) for 30 min on ice, then incubated with 20 μg/ml IgG for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed twice with cold STE-B by low-speed centrifugation. For immunodecoration, IgG-treated mitochondria were incubated with 5 × 106 cpm/ml 125I-labeled protein A for 30 min, washed again, and counted in a γ-counter. For fluorescence microscopy, the mitochondria were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-IgG (1:100) for 1 h on ice, washed, and applied on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 30 min. Adhered mitochondria were washed and examined as for whole cells. Antibody inhibition experiments were performed with the IgG-treated mitochondria which had been resuspended in mitochondrial storage buffer (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) at 8 mg/ml protein. To study the import of specific tRNAs in vitro, the gene for LeishmaniatRNATyr(GUA), which is known to be imported (8Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was cloned into a transcription vector and T7 RNA polymerase runoffs were employed in import assays. The sequence of the RNA includes an 11-nucleotide intron (positions 38–48) and is identical to the corresponding tRNA species from L. tarentolae (8Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except for a U to C base change at position 42. Two differences (A to U at position 41 and U to C at position 42) from T. brucei tRNATyr (7Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19208-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also observed. When the 32P-labeled tRNATyr(GUA) transcript was incubated with isolated mitochondria in the presence of ATP, import of the RNA was observed by protection from added RNase (Fig. 1, lane 2). As a positive control, antisense RNA was imported with comparable efficiency (Fig. 1,lane 1). Import of tRNATyr transcript was reduced by 95% in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1, lane 3). Disruption of the vesicles with Triton X-100 after incubation rendered the RNA totally nuclease-sensitive (Fig. 1, lane 4), as expected. Import of labeled tRNATyr was inhibited more than 90% by excess Leishmania tRNA, but yeast tRNA competed inefficiently (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8), implying recognition of specific import signals on cognate tRNAs. In L. tarentolae, tRNAGln(CUG) is predominantly cytosolic, implying that mitochondrial import of this molecule is inefficient or absent (8Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When a cloned tRNAGln(CUG) transcript was tested in vitro, its uptake was observed to be significantly less efficient (by a factor of 4) than that of tRNATyr (Fig. 1, lanes 10 and 11). Moreover, titration experiments revealed that this low level of uptake was maintained between 1.25 and 5 nm RNA, whereas that of tRNATyr increased within this range. 2S. Adhya, T. Ghosh, A. Das, and S. Mahapatra, unpublished data. The observed qualitative and quantitative similarities of import of tRNATyr (Fig. 1) and antisense RNA (11Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) implicate a common transport mechanism for these two RNAs. The import process may be subdivided into two steps: binding of RNA to mitochondrial surface receptors, followed by transfer through import channels (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When tRNATyr transcript was incubated briefly with mitochondria, it became specifically associated with the organelle (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2), apparently with the outer surface, as judged by the RNase sensitivity of the complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 3; the small amount of resistant RNA may be due to low-level import within 15 min of incubation). In contrast to the import reaction, complex formation at 15 min was not dependent on ATP, but ATP stimulated binding about 2-fold (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Moreover, binding of tRNATyr transcript was not significantly inhibited by a 100–200-fold excess of heterologous tRNA (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), as expected for a specific, high-affinity interaction. In the presence of ATP, the initial rate of complex formation was stimulated but the final yield at 60 min was not appreciably altered (Fig. 2 C). Similar rate effects of ATP were observed previously with antisense RNA (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To identify the mitochondrial protein(s) to which tRNA binds, Western blots of mitochondrial proteins were probed with32P-labeled tRNATyr(GUA) transcript. This experiment showed the presence of two major tRNA-binding polypeptides of 22 and 15 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Mild trypsinization of mitochondria resulted in disappearance of both bands (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Under these proteolytic conditions, inner mitochondrial membrane markers such as succinate dehydrogenase were not significantly affected (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that both of these RNA-binding proteins are localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The heat-stable 15-kDa TAB in promastigote extracts binds to β-tubulin antisense RNA as well as tRNA (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); the same or similar factor is also present on the mitochondrial surface (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For further studies, TAB was purified from postribosomal supernatants of detergent extracts by a two-step protocol. After heat treatment to remove bulk protein, the extract was passed through an affinity matrix consisting of antisense RNA immobilized on oligo(dT)-cellulose via a synthetic poly(A) tail (Fig. 3 A). TAB was retained by this column, and after several washes to remove nonspecifically adsorbed protein, eluted with 1 m NaCl (Fig. 3 B). SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated the presence of the 15-kDa TAB in the 1m NaCl fraction at greater than 95% purity (Fig. 3 C). The RNA binding property of this species was confirmed by 1) rebinding to the matrix2 and 2) Northwestern blot analysis using 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe (Fig. 3 D). Purified TAB was subjected to Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. RNA binding activity eluted at a position corresponding to a native molecular mass of 30 kDa.2 Thus, in solution, TAB exists primarily as a dimer of the 15-kDa subunit. The purified 15-kDa subunit contains 20% acidic, 17% basic, and 15% hydrophobic amino acid residues, with the N-terminal sequence ADTRSYYNGG. The absence of an N-terminal methionine indicates that it is a processed protein. Binding of solubilized TAB with RNA was monitored by the gel retardation assay (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reaction was optimized with respect to various parameters. Binding occurs rapidly (within 5 min) at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1–10 nm RNA and is not affected by monovalent cations (1 m), heparin (5 mg/ml), or synthetic polynucleotides (100 μg/ml). ATP (1 mm) or EDTA (1 mm) had no effect on the mobility or yield of the complex.2 When antisense RNA was titrated with affinity-purified TAB, stepwise formation of 3 discrete complexes of decreasing mobility were observed (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were previously obtained with various deletion derivatives of this RNA, tRNA as well as small ribosomal RNAs, using cruder preparations of TAB (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The maximum number of complexes formed is 3, irrespective of the length and conformation of the RNA; furthermore, the lack of partially occupied intermediate states indicates strong cooperativity of TAB-TAB interactions on the RNA. The results are consistent with a binding stoichiometry (RNA-TAB) of 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3, depending on factor concentration. Assuming that TAB binds as a dimer, up to 6 molecules of the 15-kDa subunit are potentially capable of aggregating on a single binding site on the RNA. An important question is whether the binding site of TAB on tRNA coincides with the import signal. The precise RNA structural features directing import are not yet known, but one determinant resides in the D stem-loop region (12Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, a “half-tRNA” molecule containing nucleotides 1–36 of tRNATyr (including the D stem-loop and flanking anticodon and acceptor stem sequences) was tested for TAB binding in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4 B, specific, mutifactor binding was observed; the pattern is consistent with an initial interaction of lower affinity with the D stem-loop (hence the presence of unreacted RNA), followed by cooperative binding of more TAB molecules to the preformed complex. Polyclonal antibody against the 15-kDa subunit reacted with a single species on Western blots of S-100 extracts (Fig. 5); no signal was obtained with normal serum or IgG.2Immunofluorescent staining of promastigotes with this antibody revealed a cytoplasmic location of TAB (Fig. 5 A), with the following notable features: 1) exclusion of nucleus and flagellum (exclusion is not evident in the ethidium bromide-stained nuclei but was observed in the absence of the DNA stain); 2) concentration of FITC fluorescence in many cells in the region anterior to the nucleus, coinciding with the position of the single kinetoplast-mitochondrion, marked by the ethidium bromide fluorescence of the compact kinetoplast DNA discs. This typically anterior position of TAB suggested its association with mitochondria, but other cytoplasmic locations could not be excluded. Therefore, the content of TAB in equal amounts of various subcellular fractions obtained during isolation of mitochondria was monitored by the Western blot assay. Briefly, the method consists of hypotonic lysis of cells in the absence of detergents, separation of the particulate and soluble fractions, digestion of nuclear DNA, and Percoll gradient centrifugation (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, the lower Percoll band of mitochondria was clearly enriched for TAB, as expected of its mitochondrial location. Heavy exposure of this gel showed faint bands in the various particulate fractions, but the signals obtained were always low compared with those obtained with Triton-solubilized S-100 extracts (Fig. 5, C and E), possibly due to the presence of interfering cellular components or an inadequacy of the fractionation procedure. Native mitochondria complexed with anti-TAB but not normal IgG, could be immunodecorated with 125I-labeled protein A (Fig. 5 D) or with FITC-conjugated second antibody (Fig. 5 B). Limited trypsinization of mitochondria resulted in release and/or degradation of TAB (Fig. 5 E). Under these conditions of trypsin treatment, the outer membrane marker kynurenine hydroxylase was completely sensitive, but the inner membrane marker succinate dehydrogenase was relatively resistant (Fig. 5 F). The accessibility of TAB in native mitochondria to antibody and protease indicates its association with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria were preincubated with normal or immune IgG, washed free of excess IgG, and assayed for RNA import. Anti-TAB IgG inhibited import of tRNATyr transcript by more than 98% but normal IgG had no significant effect (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1–3). Identical results were obtained for import of antisense transcripts (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–3). We further examined whether this inhibitory effect was at the level of receptor binding or transfer of RNA through the import channels. Anti-TAB IgG, but not normal IgG, inhibited binding of both tRNATyr transcript (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4–6) and antisense RNA (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–6) to the mitochondrial surface by more than 90%. The specific abrogation of import as well as mitochondrial surface binding of RNA by monospecific antibody indicates a role of TAB as the major, if not the sole, import receptor or carrier. The in vitro system described in this and previous reports (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), is relatively inefficient, with only about 10% of the bound RNA being imported. This could be due to a number of reasons,e.g. the method of isolation of mitochondria, which includes exposure to hypotonic conditions and shear forces; rapid hydrolysis of ATP by mitochondrial ATPase; structure and/or sequence features of the RNA; absence of stimulatory factors; and inadequacies of the assay method such as rupture of the vesicles during post-import washes or insufficient inactivation of RNase. Nevertheless, the present system is capable of importing isolated homologous tRNA in an ATP-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 1) and shows discrimination between tRNATyr and tRNAGln(CUG), as observed in vivo (8Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These characteristics make it suitable for detailed studies of the import mechanism. Immunochemical experiments presented here (Figs. 5 and 6) identify, for the first time, a role of the 15-kDa TAB protein as a receptor or carrier for mitochondrial RNA import. TAB is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, as judged by its accessibility to RNA, trypsin, and antibody (Figs. 2 and 5). However, it remains to be seen whether TAB is anchored to the membrane directly, via a hydrophobic stretch of amino acid residues, or indirectly, through interaction with some other outer membrane protein. The absence of an N-terminal methionine indicates that TAB is derived by proteolytic processing of a larger precursor. Removal of a transit sequence is one possibility. A BLASTP search of the Swiss Prot data base revealed 70% identity of the N-terminal decapeptide of TAB with the mitochondrial membrane protein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum (23Leblanc S.B. Wilson C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); the significance of this homology is unclear at present. The structure of the recognition site of TAB on the RNA, and the mode of binding, are of relevance to the import function of the protein: if TAB is an import receptor, the binding site and import signal should coincide. We have previously shown a preference of TAB for oligopurine motifs on antisense RNA (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similar motifs are present in the D stem-loops of importable tRNAs, leading to the hypothesis that this region constitutes part or the whole of the import signal (13Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This was recently demonstrated in vivo by D stem-loop exchange between an imported and a non-imported tRNA (12Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that TAB binds to half-tRNA (Fig. 4) is therefore in keeping with its role as receptor or carrier. In solution, and under factor excess conditions, up to 3 molecules of TAB bind cooperatively to each RNA molecule (Fig. 4). It is difficult to correlate this mode of binding to that which occurs on the mitochondrial surface. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that Scatchard analysis of RNA binding to membrane-bound TAB revealed multiple binding affinities (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting cooperativity. Under RNA excess conditions, the bound RNA concentration is about 4 nm, while the total receptor concentration (including low and high affinity sites) is 5.1 nm (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This corresponds to an RNA:receptor ratio of 0.8:1. It is possible that oligomerization of RNA-bound TAB on the mitochondrial surface occurs prior to import, a situation analogous to the dimerization of certain cell-surface receptors induced by bivalent ligands or antibody. At least one other mitochondrial surface-bound tRNA-binding protein of 22 kDa was detected on Northwestern blots (Fig. 2). Antisense RNA does not detectably bind to this protein under the same conditions (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RNA motifs recognized by the 15- and 22-kDa proteins are different. The role, if any, of this protein in RNA import remains obscure. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that, whereas the 22-kDa band appears to be the major tRNA-binding species on blots (Fig. 2), anti-TAB antibody inhibits binding of tRNA to the surface of intact mitochondria by more than 90% (Fig. 6), although there is no cross-reaction between the antibody and the 22-kDa species (Fig. 5). One explanation of this discrepancy is that transfer of tRNA from TAB to the 22-kDa protein occurs prior to import. Further studies of the 22-kDa factor are warranted by these observations. Two models have been proposed to explain the import of a highly negatively charged RNA molecule through the double mitochondrial membrane. The co-import model (24Nagley P. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 67-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) supposes RNA, complexed with a soluble carrier protein, to pass through protein import channels utilizing an import signal on the carrier. Alternatively, RNA would be directly transferred through recognition by specific membrane-bound receptors. In yeast, mature tRNA1Lysapparently has to be aminoacylated before it can be imported (25Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutant tRNATyr precursors which cannot be aminoacylated have been observed in Trypanosoma bruceimitochondria (26Schneider A. Martin J. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The import of unspliced tRNATyr in vitro (Fig. 1) confirms that splicing is not a prerequisite for import. tRNA import in yeast requires a cytosolic carrier (3Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), presumably the cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, whereas theLeishmania system has no such requirement, and cytosolic fractions have no effect.2 Instead, one or more membrane-bound RNA-binding proteins mediate import. The involvement of the protein import receptor MOM19 in yeast tRNA import was implied by mutant analysis (27Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), lending support to the co-import model. In view of the known requirement of unfolding of the polypeptide chain during translocation (Ref. 2Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar and references therein), this model, invoking non-covalent RNA-protein complexes, has serious mechanistic difficulties. Our experiments (14Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) on the salt and polyanion sensitivities of the RNA-mitochondrion complexes argue against a similar mechanism in Leishmania. All in all, it appears thatLeishmania mitochondria use a specialized high-affinity membrane-bound receptor system for direct import of large numbers of tRNAs to maintain mitochondrial viability.

https://openalex.org/W1993375985,"The cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1) gene is regulated by several trans-acting factors including the 4 S polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-binding protein, which has recently been identified as glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) (Raha, A., Wagner, C., Macdonald, R. G., and Bresnick, E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5750-5756). The role of GNMT as a 4 S PAH-binding protein in mediating the induction of cytochrome P-4501A1 has been investigated further. GNMT cDNA, which was cloned into a pMAMneo vector containing the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and the neomycin resistance gene, was stably transfected into D422 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Several positive clones were selected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and assayed for the expression of recombinant protein. Western blot analysis indicated the expression of significant levels of the 4 S protein in the stably transfected CHO cells (CHO-GNMT). Cytosolic preparations from the CHO-GNMT showed high benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) binding but no 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) binding activity when compared with clones transfected with the pMAMneo vector alone (CHO-neo) or the parental CHO cells. Challanging the CHO-GNMT cells with 4 microM B[a]P resulted in elevated levels of CYP1A1 mRNA. Equally effective in inducing CYP1A1 mRNA were benzo[e]pyrene and 3-methylcholanthrene. On the other hand, TCDD did not induce CYP1A1 gene expression in these cells. B[a]P-treated CHO-GNMT, expressing the 4 S protein, also showed CYP1A1 protein by Western blotting and exhibited ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity; neither the CHO-neo or parental CHO cells were positive for any of these measures. No Ah receptor message or protein was detectable in the parental CHO, CHO-neo, or CHO-GNMT cells. Furthermore, no XRE binding activity was observed in TCDD-treated cytosolic preparations or nuclear extracts from CHO-GNMT cells that were treated with TCDD. These studies unequivocally establish that GNMT is a PAH-binding protein that can mediate the induction of CYP1A1 by PAHs such as B[a]P through an Ah receptor-independent pathway."

Boswell H.S. Cooper S. Grabstein K.H. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1990; 79: 906-911Crossref Google Scholar). The involvement of IL-9 in lymphomagenesis has been suggested by in vivo studies (8Renauld J.C. van der Lugt N. Vink A. van Roon M. Godfraind C. Warnier G. Merz H. Feller A. Berns A. Van Snick J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1327-1332PubMed Google Scholar) in which a higher susceptibility to T cell lymphoma was observed in transgenic mice expressing IL-9 constitutively and by in vitro experiments (9Renauld J.C.

The functions of IL-9 are mediated by the IL-9 receptor (IL-9R), which consists of a ligand-specific α chain and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) γ chain. IL-2R γ chain, normally referred to as the common γ chain (γc chain), is shared by receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (10Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N.

Some of the signaling pathways elicited by these cytokines are quite similar, which probably explains in part the functional redundancy of these cytokines.IL-9R α chain (IL-9Rα) is IL-9-specific and is responsible for IL-9 binding. The cDNAs encoding mouse and human IL-9Rα have been cloned (14Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E.N. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IL-9Rα belongs to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily and has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase motif in its cytoplasmic region. Several homologous sequences, such as the BOX1 consensus sequence and a serine-rich region, which were demonstrated to be important for IL-2Rβ function (16Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are also present in the cytoplasmic region of human IL-9Rα (hIL-9Rα). Recently, it has been shown that several biochemical events including tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases, activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, and expression of nuclear proto-oncogenes are involved in IL-9-mediated signal transduction (17Yin T. Yang L. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol.

In the present study, a series of deletions and point mutations were made in the cytoplasmic region of hIL-9Rα. These mutants were transfected into a mouse IL-9-dependent T cell line, TS1, to investigate the functions of different domains of hIL-9Rα in IL-9-induced cell proliferation and activation of JAK/STAT and primary response genes.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated the importance of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation and signal transduction. We identified two regions, a membrane-proximal region containing BOX1 consensus sequence and the adjacent downstream region containing a STAT3 binding site, as required for IL-9-mediated signal transduction. In our study, the membrane-proximal region including 47 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα (D3) was shown to support IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases even though the response of this mutant to IL-9 was greatly reduced compared with wild type hIL-9Rα. This observation is different from a recent report by Demoulin et al. (29Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Lestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in which a mouse IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, transfected with truncated hIL-9Rα plasmid encoding 115 amino acids of the cytoplasmic region containing the BOX1 motif no longer responds to hIL-9. The difference between the two studies could be due to the difference in the cell types used in each of these experiments. The function of the membrane-proximal region in hIL-9Rα is most likely to be mediated by the BOX1 motif, which is also found in the membrane-proximal region of many cytokine receptors and has been demonstrated to be important for JAK1/JAK2 activation and cell growth in several cytokine receptor systems (30Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa H. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 31Narazaki M.

In our study, truncation or internal deletion of the BOX1 motif in the membrane-proximal region of hIL-9Rα totally abolished hIL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, suggesting the BOX1 consensus sequence in hIL-9Rα plays a preeminent role in IL-9-induced activation of JAK kinases and cell growth. Since mutation of the conserved Pro-X-Pro motif in the BOX1 consensus sequence inactivated the receptor and JAK1 activation in certain receptor systems (30Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H.

To our surprise, these mutations did not totally abolish IL-9-mediated cell growth, but decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. Although activation of JAK3 has been demonstrated to be mainly associated with IL-2R γ chain (37Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 38Miyazaki T. Kawahara A.

Recently, a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2Rβ was shown to be critical for JAK3 activation (35Kirken K.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Howard O.M. Kawamura M. O'Shea J.J. Farrar W.L. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that JAK3 may bind to receptor subunits other than IL-2R γ chain for its activation. In this study, we also investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 by IL-9 in various transfectants. It appears that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases, which is consistent with our earlier observation that JAK kinases are responsible for IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins (18Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).In agreement with the study by Demoulin et al. (29Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Lestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), our data also indicated that the BOX1 downstream region in hIL-9Rα plays an important role in IL-9-mediated cell growth. Deletion of this region not only greatly reduced hIL-9-stimulated cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and IRS-2 but also abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. A STAT3 binding site (YLPQ) was found within this region. YXXQ has been shown to be important for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in gp130 family receptors (28Stahl N. Farruggella T. Boulton T. Zhong Z. Darnell J. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), and the important role of the tyrosine residue within YLPQ motif in hIL-9Rα has recently been reported (29Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Lestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Since the tyrosine residue within this motif was shown to play a key role in IL-9-mediated cell growth and activation of STAT1α, STAT3, and STAT5, STAT factors were suggested to be involved in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation. However, in our study, a point mutation in this STAT3 binding site from YLPQ to YLPA did not significantly affect IL-9-induced cell proliferation but greatly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, suggesting that STAT3 may not be the major signaling molecule in IL-9-induced cell growth in TS1 cells. In the gp130 system, a recent report suggested that STAT3 may be involved in cell differentiation and growth arrest mediated by IL-6 (39Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Finally, we also investigated primary response gene expression in hIL-9R-transfected cells. The importance of primary response genes as potentially critical targets for cytokine-induced proliferation has been extensively studied (40Horie M. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 42Lui J. Clegg C.H. Shoyab M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar). Although our previous study has shown that IL-9 could induce activation of junB and c-myc in a human growth factor-dependent cell line (19Kang L.Y. Yang Y.-C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the correlation between the activation of these two genes and IL-9-mediated cell proliferation has never been demonstrated. Our present study indicated that activation of c-myc upon stimulation with IL-9 depends on the presence of both the membrane-proximal and the BOX1 downstream regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα, suggesting that IL-9-induced expression of c-myc may require JAK kinases and signals associated with the BOX1 downstream region. This is different from IL-2Rβ, in which the serine-rich region is important for the activation of c-myc(27Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the functional study, c-mycis not likely to play an important role in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation in TS1 cells, since the induction of c-myc by IL-9 was greatly impaired in STAT3 m and BOXm transfectants that can proliferate in response to hIL-9. Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 by IL-9 were also decreased in both STAT3 m and BOXm transfectants, suggesting that STAT3 may be involved in IL-9-mediated activation of c-myc. hIL-9-inducedjunB activation appears to be attributed to both regions of hIL-9Rα and correlates with IL-9-induced cell proliferation. Although STAT3 was recently shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the junB promoter through an IL-6 response element (43Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar, 44Coffer P. Lutticken C. van Puijenbroek A. Klop-de Jonge M. Horn F. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar), the induction of junB by IL-9 was not significantly decreased in STAT3 m transfectants, implicating that additional transcription factors may be induced by IL-9 in the activation of junB.In conclusion, two important regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα have been demonstrated to play important roles in IL-9-induced cell growth and signal transduction. A membrane-proximal region between amino acids 295 and 338 containing the BOX1 motif is absolutely essential for IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and a BOX1 downstream sequence between amino acids 338 and 422 including a YLPQ motif is critical for IL-9-induced cell growth, activation of STAT3, and up-regulation of c-myc and junB gene expression. Since both of these two regions are important for optimal cellular proliferation induced by IL-9, we suggest that the reconstitution of a fully functional hIL-9R requires the cooperation or cross-talk between different signaling transducers associated with hIL-9R cytoplasmic domain, even though activation of distinctive signaling molecules may be mediated by individual cytoplasmic regions of hIL-9R.

Blood. 1989; 74: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro biological functions of IL-9 include its ability to stimulate proliferation of activated T cells, to enhance production of immunoglobulin in B cells, and to promote proliferation and differentiation of mast cells and hematopoietic progenitors (3Uyttenhove C.

Boswell H.S. Cooper S. Grabstein K.H. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1990; 79: 906-911Crossref Google Scholar). The involvement of IL-9 in lymphomagenesis has been suggested by in vivo studies (8Renauld J.C. van der Lugt N. Vink A. van Roon M. Godfraind C. Warnier G. Merz H. Feller A. Berns A. Van Snick J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1327-1332PubMed Google Scholar) in which a higher susceptibility to T cell lymphoma was observed in transgenic mice expressing IL-9 constitutively and by in vitro experiments (9Renauld J.C. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which IL-9 has been shown to protect mouse lymphoma cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. The functions of IL-9 are mediated by the IL-9 receptor (IL-9R), which consists of a ligand-specific α chain and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) γ chain. IL-2R γ chain, normally referred to as the common γ chain (γc chain), is shared by receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (10Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N.

Some of the signaling pathways elicited by these cytokines are quite similar, which probably explains in part the functional redundancy of these cytokines. IL-9R α chain (IL-9Rα) is IL-9-specific and is responsible for IL-9 binding. The cDNAs encoding mouse and human IL-9Rα have been cloned (14Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E.N. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5690-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Chang M.-S. Engel G. Benedict C. Basu R. McNinch J. Blood. 1994; 83: 3199-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-9Rα belongs to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily and has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase motif in its cytoplasmic region. Several homologous sequences, such as the BOX1 consensus sequence and a serine-rich region, which were demonstrated to be important for IL-2Rβ function (16Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are also present in the cytoplasmic region of human IL-9Rα (hIL-9Rα). Recently, it has been shown that several biochemical events including tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases, activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, and expression of nuclear proto-oncogenes are involved in IL-9-mediated signal transduction (17Yin T. Yang L. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol.

In the present study, a series of deletions and point mutations were made in the cytoplasmic region of hIL-9Rα. These mutants were transfected into a mouse IL-9-dependent T cell line, TS1, to investigate the functions of different domains of hIL-9Rα in IL-9-induced cell proliferation and activation of JAK/STAT and primary response genes. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated the importance of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation and signal transduction. We identified two regions, a membrane-proximal region containing BOX1 consensus sequence and the adjacent downstream region containing a STAT3 binding site, as required for IL-9-mediated signal transduction. In our study, the membrane-proximal region including 47 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα (D3) was shown to support IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases even though the response of this mutant to IL-9 was greatly reduced compared with wild type hIL-9Rα. This observation is different from a recent report by Demoulin et al. (29Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Lestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in which a mouse IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, transfected with truncated hIL-9Rα plasmid encoding 115 amino acids of the cytoplasmic region containing the BOX1 motif no longer responds to hIL-9. The difference between the two studies could be due to the difference in the cell types used in each of these experiments. The function of the membrane-proximal region in hIL-9Rα is most likely to be mediated by the BOX1 motif, which is also found in the membrane-proximal region of many cytokine receptors and has been demonstrated to be important for JAK1/JAK2 activation and cell growth in several cytokine receptor systems (30Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa H. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 31Narazaki M.

In our study, truncation or internal deletion of the BOX1 motif in the membrane-proximal region of hIL-9Rα totally abolished hIL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, suggesting the BOX1 consensus sequence in hIL-9Rα plays a preeminent role in IL-9-induced activation of JAK kinases and cell growth. Since mutation of the conserved Pro-X-Pro motif in the BOX1 consensus sequence inactivated the receptor and JAK1 activation in certain receptor systems (30Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H.

To our surprise, these mutations did not totally abolish IL-9-mediated cell growth, but decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. Although activation of JAK3 has been demonstrated to be mainly associated with IL-2R γ chain (37Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 38Miyazaki T. Kawahara A.

Recently, a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2Rβ was shown to be critical for JAK3 activation (35Kirken K.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Howard O.M. Kawamura M. O'Shea J.J. Farrar W.L. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that JAK3 may bind to receptor subunits other than IL-2R γ chain for its activation. In this study, we also investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 by IL-9 in various transfectants. It appears that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases, which is consistent with our earlier observation that JAK kinases are responsible for IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins (18Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol.

Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), our data also indicated that the BOX1 downstream region in hIL-9Rα plays an important role in IL-9-mediated cell growth. Deletion of this region not only greatly reduced hIL-9-stimulated cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and IRS-2 but also abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. A STAT3 binding site (YLPQ) was found within this region. YXXQ has been shown to be important for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in gp130 family receptors (28Stahl N. Farruggella T. Boulton T. Zhong Z. Darnell J. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), and the important role of the tyrosine residue within YLPQ motif in hIL-9Rα has recently been reported (29Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Lestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Since the tyrosine residue within this motif was shown to play a key role in IL-9-mediated cell growth and activation of STAT1α, STAT3, and STAT5, STAT factors were suggested to be involved in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation. However, in our study, a point mutation in this STAT3 binding site from YLPQ to YLPA did not significantly affect IL-9-induced cell proliferation but greatly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, suggesting that STAT3 may not be the major signaling molecule in IL-9-induced cell growth in TS1 cells. In the gp130 system, a recent report suggested that STAT3 may be involved in cell differentiation and growth arrest mediated by IL-6 (39Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Finally, we also investigated primary response gene expression in hIL-9R-transfected cells. The importance of primary response genes as potentially critical targets for cytokine-induced proliferation has been extensively studied (40Horie M. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol.

Although our previous study has shown that IL-9 could induce activation of junB and c-myc in a human growth factor-dependent cell line (19Kang L.Y. Yang Y.-C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the correlation between the activation of these two genes and IL-9-mediated cell proliferation has never been demonstrated.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Finally, we also investigated primary response gene expression in hIL-9R-transfected cells. The importance of primary response genes as potentially critical targets for cytokine-induced proliferation has been extensively studied (40Horie M. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 42Lui J. Clegg C.H. Shoyab M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar). Although our previous study has shown that IL-9 could induce activation of junB and c-myc in a human growth factor-dependent cell line (19Kang L.Y. Yang Y.-C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the correlation between the activation of these two genes and IL-9-mediated cell proliferation has never been demonstrated. Our present study indicated that activation of c-myc upon stimulation with IL-9 depends on the presence of both the membrane-proximal and the BOX1 downstream regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα, suggesting that IL-9-induced expression of c-myc may require JAK kinases and signals associated with the BOX1 downstream region. This is different from IL-2Rβ, in which the serine-rich region is important for the activation of c-myc(27Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the functional study, c-mycis not likely to play an important role in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation in TS1 cells, since the induction of c-myc by IL-9 was greatly impaired in STAT3 m and BOXm transfectants that can proliferate in response to hIL-9. Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 by IL-9 were also decreased in both STAT3 m and BOXm transfectants, suggesting that STAT3 may be involved in IL-9-mediated activation of c-myc. hIL-9-inducedjunB activation appears to be attributed to both regions of hIL-9Rα and correlates with IL-9-induced cell proliferation. Although STAT3 was recently shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the junB promoter through an IL-6 response element (43Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar, 44Coffer P. Lutticken C. van Puijenbroek A. Klop-de Jonge M. Horn F. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar), the induction of junB by IL-9 was not significantly decreased in STAT3 m transfectants, implicating that additional transcription factors may be induced by IL-9 in the activation of junB. In conclusion, two important regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Rα have been demonstrated to play important roles in IL-9-induced cell growth and signal transduction. A membrane-proximal region between amino acids 295 and 338 containing the BOX1 motif is absolutely essential for IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and a BOX1 downstream sequence between amino acids 338 and 422 including a YLPQ motif is critical for IL-9-induced cell growth, activation of STAT3, and up-regulation of c-myc and junB gene expression. Since both of these two regions are important for optimal cellular proliferation induced by IL-9, we suggest that the reconstitution of a fully functional hIL-9R requires the cooperation or cross-talk between different signaling transducers associated with hIL-9R cytoplasmic domain, even though activation of distinctive signaling molecules may be mediated by individual cytoplasmic regions of hIL-9R.

We generated two different chimeric TGF-β superfamily receptors, i.e. TβR-I/BMPR-IB, containing the extracellular domain of TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) and the intracellular domain of bone morphogenetic protein type IB receptor (BMPR-IB), and TβR-II/ActR-IIB, containing the extracellular domain of TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) and the intracellular domain of activin type IIB receptor (ActR-IIB). In the presence of TGF-β1, TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II/ActR-IIB formed heteromeric complexes with wild-type TβR-II and TβR-I, respectively, upon stable transfection in mink lung epithelial cell lines. We show that TβR-II/ActR-IIB restored the responsiveness upon transfection in mutant cell lines lacking functional TβR-II with respect to TGF-β-mediated activation of a transcriptional signal, extracellular matrix formation, growth inhibition, and Smad phosphorylation. Moreover, TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II/ActR-IIB formed a functional complex in response to TGF-β and induced phosphorylation of Smad1. However, complex formation is not enough for signal propagation, which is shown by the inability of TβR-I/BMPR-IB to restore responsiveness to TGF-β in cell lines deficient in functional TβR-I. The fact that the TGF-β1-induced complex between TβR-II/ActR-IIB and TβR-I stimulated endogenous Smad2 phosphorylation, a TGF-β-like response, is in agreement with the current model for receptor activation in which the type I receptor determines signal specificity.

Signaling occurs via ligand-induced complex formation of two related serine/threonine kinase receptors, i.e. type I and type II receptors (reviewed in Refs. 2Mathews L.S. Endocr.

Multiple type I and type II receptors have been identified and matched with their corresponding ligands in the TGF-β superfamily. The overall structures of type I and type II receptors are similar and consist of relatively short cysteine-rich extracellular domains, single transmembrane domains, and intracellular parts that consist almost entirely of serine/threonine kinase domains. Phylogenetic analysis of the serine/threonine kinase receptor family reveals that the type I and type II receptors form two distinct subfamilies. Type II receptors, but not type I receptors, have carboxyl-terminal extensions of variable lengths that are rich in serine and threonine residues; whereas type I receptors, but not type II receptors, have a GS domain in the intracellular juxtamembrane region, which is rich in glycine and serine residues. Biochemical as well as genetic approaches have indicated that both type I and type II receptors are essential for signaling. Mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells lacking functional TβR-I (termed R mutants) or TβR-II (termed DR mutants) fail to respond to TGF-β (8Laiho M. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their responsiveness to TGF-β is restored upon ectopic expression of TβR-I in R mutant and TβR-II in DR mutant cells, but not by other type I or type II receptors (9Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cárcamo J.

Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In contrast, BMPs show weak binding to type II as well as to type I receptors individually, and high affinity binding is found when both receptors are present (16Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T.

However, similar to the case for TGF-β and activin, a BMP-induced transcriptional activation signal requires cotransfection of both type I and type II receptors, and signal transduction is not observed when one receptor type is singly transfected into Mv1Lu cells (16Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T. Cox G.N. Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 17Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis inDrosophila also indicates that both type I and type II receptors are essential for signaling by decapentaplegic, a BMP-like factor (19Ruberte E. Marty T. Nellen D. Affolter M. Basler K. Cell. 1995; 80: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recent studies have led to the formulation of a common model for signal transduction via serine/threonine kinase receptors (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) and activin type II receptors (ActR-IIs) are constitutively active kinases (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 21Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. J. Biol.

The type I receptor is recruited into the complex upon ligand binding to the type II receptor; the type I receptor is thereafter phosphorylated by the type II receptor, predominantly on serine and threonine residues in the GS domain (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 24Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The importance of TβR-I phosphorylation in signaling was shown by the impairment of TGF-β signaling when multiple serine and threonine residues in the GS domain of TβR-I were mutated (25Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar,26Franzén P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and by an activation-defective TβR-II mutant that fails to recognize TβR-I as a substrate (28Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The notion that type I receptors act downstream of type II receptors is supported by the ability of type I receptors to determine distinct signaling responses (29Cárcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F.

Members of the Smad family of proteins have been shown to play a key role in the intracellular signaling pathways of TGF-β superfamily members. After activation by serine/threonine kinase receptors, Smads proteins become phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus, where they may play a role in the transcriptional regulation (31Lechleider R.J. de Caestecker M.P.

In the present study, we investigated the functional properties of chimeric receptors in which the intracellular domains of type I or type II receptors for TGF-β were replaced with the corresponding domains of BMPR-IB and ActR-IIB, respectively. Our data indicate that the intracellular domain of TβR-II can be replaced by the intracellular domain of ActR-IIB, which is a receptor for activin as well as for BMP (44Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), with retained ability to activate TβR-I and to induce TGF-β-like responses. In contrast, TβR-I/BMPR-IB was unable to induce any signal in complex with TβR-II, although it was shown to be functional in complex with TβR-II/ActR-IIB in both a transcriptional activation assay and in a Smad phosphorylation assay. This indicates that complex formation is necessary but not sufficient for signal transduction. Moreover, the ligand-induced phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2, but not of endogenous Smad5, by TβR-II/ActR-IIB in complex with TβR-I confirmed the notion that the signal specificity is controlled by the type I receptor. COS-1 cells and Mv1Lu cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Mv1Lu cells that lack functionally active TβR-I (R 4–2 mutant cells) or TβR-II (DR 26 mutant cells) (8Laiho M.

For the TβR-I/BMPR-IB chimera, in the first PCR step primer pairs 5a (sense; 5′-GCTCCCGGGGGCGACGGCGTT-3′) and 5b (antisense; 5′-CTTGTGGTGTATAGGACCAAGGCCAGGTGATGA-3′) were used with TβR-I as template, and primer pairs 6a (sense; 5′-GGCCTTGGTCCTATACACCACAAGGCCTTGCT-3′) and 6b (antisense; 5′-CCGAGCTCTGAGACTGCTCGATC-3′) with BMPR-IB as template. Primers 5b and 6a are complementary to each other (underlined sequences). In the second PCR step, the two PCR products were used as template along with the terminal primers 5a and 6b; the chimeric type I receptor PCR product was subcloned, and the DNA was sequenced. Subsequently, aEcoRI-XmaI fragment of TβR-I/pSV7d encoding the N-terminal part of TβR-I, a XmaI-SacI fragment of chimeric type I PCR recombinant, and aSacI-BamHI fragment of BMPR-IB encoding the C-terminal part of BMPR-IB were ligated together by subsequent subcloning steps in pMEP4 (Invitrogen). For the TβR-II/ActR-IIB chimera, in the first PCR step primer pairs 21 (sense; 5′-GCGGAATTCGGGTCTGCCATGGGTCGGGGG-3′) and 22 (antisense; 5′-AGGTTTCCGATGGCGGTAGCAGTAGAAGATGATG-3′) were used with TβR-II as template, and primer pairs 23 (sense; 5′-CTACTGCTACCGCCATCGGAAACCTCCCTACGGC-3′) and 24 (antisense; 5′-CCGAGAGACGAGCTCCCACAG-3′) were used with ActR-IIB as template. Primers 22 and 23 are complementary to each other (underlined sequences), and primer 21 contains an extra 5′-EcoRI restriction site. In the second PCR step, the two PCR products were used as template along with the terminal primers 21 and 24; the chimeric type II receptor PCR product was subcloned, and the DNA was sequenced. Subsequently, the EcoRI-SacI PCR fragment of TβR-II/ActR-IIB encoding the N-terminal part was ligated together with the C-terminal part of ActR-IIB by subsequent subcloning into pMEP4. Wild-type mouse BMPR-IB, human TβR-II, mouse ActR-IIB, and human TβR-I were subcloned in pMEP4 using convenient restriction enzyme cutting sites. Receptor expression thereby came under the transcriptional control of the ZnCl2-inducible human metallothionein promoter. R 4–2 and DR 26 mutant cells were stably transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using the MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's protocol. Selection of transfectants was performed in the presence of 100 units/ml hygromycin (Sigma). We obtained cell pool cultures with similar levels of receptor expression upon ZnCl2treatment. TGF-β1 was iodinated by the chloramine T method (45Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Sampath); samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–15% gradient gels and visualized using a Fuji-X BioImager. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were washed once, and medium was changed to DMEM with 3% FBS and 100 μmZnCl2, and cells were then incubated with different concentrations of TGF-β1 for 22–24 h; during the last 2 h, cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Corp.). Thereafter, the cells were fixed in 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 20 min, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by water and 70% ethanol, and finally solubilized in 0.1m NaOH. 3H radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation β-counter using Ecoscint (National Diagnostics). Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 18–24 h, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS, with or without 100 μm ZnCl2. After 15 h, the medium was changed to methionine-free MCDB medium (SVA, Sweden) with different concentrations of TGF-β1 and incubation prolonged for 6 h; during the last 2 h, cells were incubated with 25 μCi/ml 35S-labeling mixture “ProMix” (Amersham Corp.). For extracellular matrix isolation, the cells were removed by washing on ice; once in phosphate-buffered saline, three times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; two times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Extracellular matrix proteins were scraped off and extracted into SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Secreted proteins and extracellular matrix proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Corp.) and quantification using a Fuji-X BioImager. PAI-1 was identified as a 45-kDa protein in the extracellular matrix fraction (49Laiho M. Rönnstrand L. Heino J. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were transiently transfected with p3TP-Lux (28Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described above. The following day, cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline to remove calcium phosphate precipitates. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS for 16–20 h. Thereafter, the receptor expression was induced by treatment of the cells with 100 μm ZnCl2 in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS for 5 h, after which TGF-β1 was added. Luciferase activity in cell lysate was measured after 22–24 h using the luciferase assay system (Promega Biotec), according to the manufacturer's protocol using an LKB Luminometer (LKB-Bromma). TGF-β1-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 and Smad5 was analyzed using R 4–2 mutant cells stably transfected with TβR-I or TβR-I/BMPR-IB and DR 26 mutant cells stably transfected with TβR-II or TβR-II/ActR-IIB. Cells were labeled for 3 h in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 0.7 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TGF-β1, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum against Smad2 (SED) (37Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2896-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or Smad5 (SSN) (gift from Dr. K. Tamaki). The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In addition, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected, as described above, with TβR-I/BMPR-IB, TβR-II/ActR-IIB, and Smad1 or Smad2 expression constructs (37Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T.

Cells were then treated in the same way as the stable transfectants and immunoprecipitated with antiserum against Smad1 (QWL) (gift from Dr. A. Nakao) or Smad2 (SED). The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Two chimeric receptors were constructed, i.e. TβR-I/BMPR-IB, containing the extracellular domain of TβR-I and intracellular domain of BMPR-IB, and TβR-II/ActR-IIB, containing the extracellular domain of TβR-II and the intracellular domain of ActR-IIB (Fig. 1). To investigate the125I-TGF-β1 binding properties of the chimeric receptors, we used Mv1Lu cell lines that lack functional TβR-I (R 4–2 mutant cells) or TβR-II (DR 26 mutant cells) as host cells for transfection. TβR-I/BMPR-IB was stably transfected into R 4–2 mutant cells, along with TβR-I and BMPR-IB as positive and negative controls, respectively. TβR-II/ActR-IIB was stably transfected in DR 26 mutant cells, along with TβR-II and ActR-IIB as positive and negative controls, respectively. All receptor expression constructs were placed under the transcriptional control of the metallothionein promoter, which can be induced by ZnCl2. Expression of type I receptors in stable transfectants was analyzed by metabolic labeling using specific antibodies, directed against the intracellular domains of the receptors. For all transfectants, proteins with expected molecular weights were observed upon the addition of 100 μm ZnCl2 (Fig. 2 A). As observed before, due to the leaky character of the metallothionein promoter, the receptors were also expressed, but at lower levels, in the absence of ZnCl2 treatment. We observed no co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous type II receptors with anti-type I antibodies, suggesting that there was no ligand-independent type I-type II complex formed as a result of overexpression (Fig. 2 A). Expression of type II receptors could not be analyzed by metabolic labeling due to the weak affinity of the antiserum. Affinity cross-linking with 125I-TGF-β1 of TβR-I/BMPR-IB cells revealed that TβR-I/BMPR-IB bound125I-TGF-β1 with similar efficiency as TβR-I. Immunoprecipitation with anti-BMPR-IB antisera not only brought down the TβR-I/BMPR-IB, but also TβR-II, illustrating that TβR-II formed a complex with TβR-I/BMPR-IB (Fig. 2 B). We were not able to detect neither TβR-II nor TβR-I/BMPR-IB with TβR-II antiserum. The reason for this is unclear, since TβR-I/BMPR-IB is most likely able to bind TGF-β only in the presence of TβR-II. As expected, in TβR-I-transfected cells cross-linked TβR complexes could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using antisera against TβR-I or TβR-II, albeit with less efficiency of complex precipitation with TβR-II antiserum. In nontransfected R 4–2 mutant cells, no type I receptor cross-linked complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-TβR-I or anti-BMPR-IB antisera (Ref. 10Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar and data not shown). Although we have reported that BMPR-IB can bind TGF-β1 when overexpressed in COS-1 cells (12ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), the expression levels in transfected Mv1Lu cells were too low for this interaction to occur (data not shown). Affinity cross-linking with 125I-TGF-β1 of cells transfected with TβR-II/ActR-IIB or TβR-II revealed that TβR-II/ActR-IIB bound 125I-TGF-β1 equally efficient as TβR-II upon induction of their expression with ZnCl2treatment. TβR-II/ActR-IIB, like TβR-II, rescued the binding to endogenously expressed TβR-I (Fig. 2 C). In TβR-II/ActR-IIB cells, cross-linked complexes of TβR-II/ActR-IIB and TβR-I were immunoprecipitated with antisera against either ActR-IIB or TβR-I, indicating that both receptors are part of a common TGF-β-induced receptor complex (Fig. 2 C). In the nontransfected DR mutant cells, no type II cross-linked complex could be immunoprecipitated with antisera against TβR-II or ActR-IIB (data not shown). As expected, no binding of TGF-β1 to cells stably transfected with ActR-IIB was observed (data not shown). Affinity cross-linking with 125I-BMP-7/OP-1 of cells transfected with BMPR-IB or ActR-IIB revealed that both receptors were expressed and able to bind ligand upon ZnCl2 treatment (Fig. 2 D). The signaling activity of the chimeric receptors was investigated using the p3TP-Lux transcriptional activation assay, which scores positive after stimulation with TGF-β (9Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) and, albeit less efficiently, after BMP or activin stimulation. Previously, we have shown that ActR-IIs and BMPR-IB can form a BMP-7/OP-1-induced heteromeric complex, which can mediate a p3TP-Lux signal (16Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T. Cox G.N. Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). No transcriptional response could be observed after TGF-β1 stimulation when the reporter plasmid was transfected alone into COS-1 cells (Fig. 3 A). However, when we co-transfected TβR-I/BMPR-IB together with TβR-II/ActR-IIB and p3TP-Lux into COS-1 cells, we observed a TGF-β-dependent signal (Fig. 3 A). To elucidate the ability of the complex between TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II/ActR-IIB to induce Smad phosphorylation, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II/ActR-IIB together with Smad1 or Smad2. TGF-β1 induced the phosphorylation of Smad1, but not of Smad2 (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II/ActR-IIB are functionally intact and can form a TGF-β-mediated complex, which signals a BMP-like response. We then investigated whether TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II/ActR-IIB could substitute for TβR-I and TβR-II, respectively, using TGF-β-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) production as an assay. Wild-type Mv1Lu cells responded to TGF-β1 by producing a 45-kDa PAI-1 protein, whereas the R 4–2 mutant and DR 26 mutant cell lines did not produce PAI-1 after stimulation by TGF-β1 (data not shown). Sometimes the PAI-1 protein appeared as two discrete bands of 45 and 43 kDa, of which the latter is likely to be a proteolytic breakdown product of the 45-kDa protein. Stably transfected TβR-I/BMPR-IB R 4–2 mutant cells did not produce the PAI-1 protein upon induction of receptor expression by ZnCl2 and TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 4 A). TGF-β1 stimulation of the R 4–2 mutant cells transfected with TβR-I, but not BMPR-IB, led to a 2.5-fold increase, determined by densitometric scanning, in the production of PAI-1 in response to ZnCl2 treatment, as reported before (10Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 12ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, TβR-II/ActR-IIB restored the TGF-β-mediated PAI-1 response in DR 26 mutant cells to a similar extent as TβR-II, i.e. 5- and 6-fold increases, respectively (Fig. 4 B). ActR-IIB, which cannot bind TGF-β1, was unable to complement the defect in DR 26 mutant cells (Fig. 4 B). In ActR-IIB-transfected cells treated with ZnCl2, a weak 45-kDa protein was observed. However, the production of this protein was not induced upon TGF-β1 stimulation. In addition, we measured the ability of both chimeras to mediate growth-inhibitory responses upon stimulation with TGF-β1. Similar to the p3TP-Lux and PAI-1 assays, TβR-II/ActR-IIB was able to replace TβR-II, but TβR-I/BMPR-IB was not able to replace TβR-I, with respect to the antiproliferative response upon TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 5). In a few experiments, we observed that the degree of growth inhibition was less with TβR-II/ActR-IIB compared with TβR-II. Different Smads have been shown to act downstream of BMP and TGF-β receptors (34Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 37Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2896-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, we used differential activation of Smad2 or Smad5 to distinguish TGF-β versus BMP receptor-mediated signaling, respectively. Using the stably transfected cell lines, the effect of ligand-induced complex formation between TβR-II and TβR-I/BMPR-IB, or between TβR-II/ActR-IIB and TβR-I, on endogenous Smad2 or Smad5 phosphorylation was analyzed (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of Smad2, but not Smad5, was induced by the activated complex between TβR-II/ActR-IIB and TβR-I, whereas ligand-induced complex formation between TβR-I/BMPR-IB and TβR-II induced no Smad2 or Smad5 phosphorylation. BMP-7/OP-1 was found to induce the phosphorylation of Smad5 in Mv1Lu cells; phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad5 were found to co-migrate on SDS-PAGE.2 Smad5 antibody also brought down a phosphoprotein larger than Smad5, the identity of which is unknown. Thus, our results indicate that complex formation between the intracellular domains of ActR-IIB and TβR-I leads to the transduction of TGF-β-like signals, whereas complex formation between the intracellular domains of TβR-II and BMPR-IB does not lead to any measurable signaling event (Fig. 7). TGF-β superfamily members exert their cellular effects through formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Previous reports have shown that the type II receptor has a constitutively active kinase domain (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar), and that phosphorylation and activation of the type I receptor is sufficient and necessary for downstream signaling activities (25Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 26Franzén P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we have characterized the properties of two chimeric receptors in which the intracellular domains of different type I or type II receptors within the TGF-β superfamily were exchanged. The purpose was to investigate whether the intracellular domains of TGF-β type I and type II receptors could be replaced by the corresponding domains of BMPR-IB and ActR-IIB, respectively. The presented data show that the intracellular domain of ActR-IIB can functionally substitute for the intracellular domain of TβR-II with respect to the induction of a transcriptional activation signal, stimulation of PAI-1 production, growth inhibition, and Smad2 activation. In contrast, a complex between the intracellular domains of BMPR-IB and TβR-II induced no observable signal (Fig. 7). TβR-II/ActR-IIB can complement the lack of TβR-II in DR 26 mutant cells. The intracellular domain of ActR-IIB shares 33.3% sequence identity with TβR-II and is thus apparently sufficiently similar to phosphorylate and transactivate TβR-I in a similar way as TβR-II. Previously, we and others have shown that the intracellular domain of TβR-I cannot replace the intracellular domains of TβR-II in this respect (39Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzén P. Morén A.

Yamada R. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), who reported the signaling activities of chimeric human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor/ActR-II and human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor/BMPR-II. The failure of TβR-I/BMPR-IB to signal in combination with TβR-II is unlikely to be due to a perturbation of the conformation of TβR-II extracellular domain or BMPR-IB intracellular domain, since TβR-I/BMPR-IB bound TGF-β and formed a heteromeric complex with TβR-II and since TβR-I/BMPR-IB together with TβR-II/ActR-IIB transduced a TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activation signal and induced Smad1 phosphorylation, a BMP-like signal. It is possible that the inability of TβR-I/BMPR-IB to mediate a growth-inhibitory response may be in an inherent property of the receptor, since Mv1Lu cells, which express TβR-II, TβR-I, ActR-II, and BMPR-IB among other receptors, are at least 100-fold more sensitive to TGF-β1 than BMP-7/OP-1 with respect to growth inhibition. On the other hand, TGF-β-induced complex formation between TβR-II and TβR-I/BMPR-IB did not lead to Smad2 or Smad5 phosphorylation, suggesting that this is an inactive complex. Phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 was stimulated by TGF-β-induced complex formation between TβR-I and TβR-II/ActR-IIB, indicating that type I receptor is the determinant for signal specificity. Our future studies will be aimed at elucidating which minimal specific regions/residues in the intracellular domain of TβR-I need to be substituted for analogous regions/residues in the intracellular domain of BMPR-IB to allow for a TβR-I/BMPR-IB chimera to transduce signals when activated by TβR-II.

https://openalex.org/W2068063638,"In rat epididymal adipocytes, practically all of the major glucose transporter isoform GLUT4 is constitutively sequestered in intracellular membranes and moves to the plasma membrane in response to insulin, whereas about half of GLUT1, the minor isoform, is constitutively functional at the plasma membrane and thus less affected by insulin. Transfection studies using cells whose glucose transport is normally not regulated by insulin have suggested that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4 is responsible for its constitutive intracellular sequestration. To test if this was also the case in a classical insulin target cell, we introduced synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4 and GLUT1 (GLUT4C and GLUT1C, respectively) into rat adipocytes and studied their effects on the glucose transport activity and the steady state GLUT4 and GLUT1 distribution between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes in host cells. GLUT4C introduced into basal adipocytes caused a large (up to 4.5-fold) and dose-dependent increase in the plasma membrane GLUT4, with a proportional reduction in microsomal GLUT4, without affecting GLUT1 distribution. GLUT4C incorporation also caused a large (up to 3-fold) dose-dependent stimulation of 3-O-methyld-glucose (3OMG) flux in host cells. GLUT4C caused little if any GLUT4 or GLUT1 redistribution and changes in 3OMG flux in insulin-stimulated adipocytes. GLUT1C, on the other hand, did not affect GLUT1 or GLUT4 targeting and 3OMG flux in host cells. These findings not only underscore the importance of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4 in its constitutive intracellular sequestration in a classical insulin target cell but also suggest the existence of a regulatory protein in adipocytes that interacts with GLUT4 at its cytoplasmic domain, thus participating in the constitutive intracellular sequestration of GLUT4.

Glucose uptake by animal cells is catalyzed by a family of integral membrane proteins (the facilitative glucose transporters or GLUTs) and further subjected to tissue-specific hormonal and metabolic regulation (1Pessin J.E. Bell G.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). By far the most important and best known GLUT regulation is that of GLUT4 by insulin in muscle and fat cells (2Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Rat epididymal adipocytes represent the best studied cell system for this GLUT4 regulation. They express GLUT4 as the major GLUT isoform, with a small amount (less than 10%) of GLUT1. Very little of the GLUT4 is constitutively (in the absence of insulin) functional in these cells; more than 95% of GLUT4 is sequestered in an intracellular pool and moves to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (4Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the constitutive distribution of GLUT1; as much as 40% of GLUT1 is already at the plasma membrane, and insulin changes this distribution relatively less (2Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It should be noted here that the constitutive sequestration specific to GLUT4 is a necessary prerequisite to its massive insulin-induced recruitment to the plasma membrane and may be considered as part of GLUT4 regulation by insulin. The molecular mechanism by which GLUT4 in adipocytes is constitutively sequestered in intracellular membranes is unknown and currently is the subject of an intensive investigation (for review see Refs. 3James D.E.

All members of the GLUT family have a large (amounting to approximately 30% of the protein mass) cytoplasmic domain that shows a significant amino acid sequence divergence (1Pessin J.E. Bell G.I.

More recently, similar transfection studies have been carried out using insulin-sensitive cultured cells including 3T3-L1 adipocytes (15Verhey K.J. Yeh J.-I. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Marsh B.J. Alm R.A. McIntosh S.R. James D.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and have shown that the GLUT4 C-terminal amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain confers the isoform-specific subcellular targeting of GLUT1 and GLUT4 chimeras. In the present study, we studied the possible role of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4 and GLUT1 in the isoform-specific constitutive targeting in rat epididymal adipocytes, a classical insulin target cell. We introduced the synthetic peptides corresponding to the GLUT4 and GLUT1 C-terminal sequences (GLUT4C and GLUT1C, respectively) into adipocytes via polyethylene glycol-induced cell-cell fusion using peptide-preloaded rabbit erythrocyte ghosts and studied the effects of these peptides on glucose transport and native GLUT4 and GLUT1 targeting in host cells. Our fusion protocol by itself did not disturb basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 or GLUT1 targeting in host cells. We show that GLUT4C peptide introduced in excess in basal adipocytes produces a large, insulin-like recruitment of GLUT4, but not GLUT1, with an equally large stimulation of 3OMG 1The abbreviations used are: 3OMG, 3-O-methyl d-glucose; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PM, plasma membrane; LDM, low density microsome.1The abbreviations used are: 3OMG, 3-O-methyl d-glucose; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PM, plasma membrane; LDM, low density microsome. exchange flux in host cells. The GLUT4C incorporation, however, did not increase the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 recruitment and 3OMG flux any further. We also show that the effect is specific to GLUT4C; GLUT1C peptide incorporation did not cause any effect on GLUT1 and GLUT4 targeting or 3OMG uptake. These findings not only provide, for the first time, an evidence for the importance of the GLUT4 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain in constitutive GLUT4 targeting in rat adipocytes but also predict the presence of a protein in adipocytes that interacts with GLUT4 at its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and mediates either GLUT4 endocytosis at the plasma membrane or GLUT4 retention in its intracellular storage compartment. Collagenase (Type I) was obtained from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Insulin (porcine crystalline) and 3OMG were from Sigma. 3-O-[methyl-14C]-d-Glucose was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). Silicone oil (specific gravity, 0.963; viscosity, 50 centistokes) was purchased from Thomas Scientific (Philadelphia, PA). Protein A-horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). All other reagents were from sources stated below and were of reagent grade. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of GLUT4 (18Bell G.I. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Lin D. Fukumoto H. Seino S.

Peptides were purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography on Vydac C8 columns and characterized by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization). Purities of the peptides were 98% or better. Rabbit erythrocyte ghosts were prepared by following the procedure described for the preparation of human erythrocyte ghosts (19Jung C.Y. Carlson L.M. Balzer C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rabbit blood was collected from the ear vein using sodium heparin as an anticoagulant, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove the buffy coat, and washed twice with buffer (155 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Essentially hemoglobin-free leaky ghosts were obtained by three cycles of hemolysis and washing, each in 115 isotonic sodium phosphate buffer (110 mm) for 20 min at room temperature and packed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) to approximately 70% (v/v) ghosts. Leaky ghosts were then loaded with peptides and resealed using a 10-fold dilution of balanced salt solution (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3.75 mm CaCl2, and 2.5 mmMgCl2 buffered with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) as the resealing buffer. Typically, 3 ml of packed ghosts were mixed with 3 ml of resealing buffer containing 6 mg of GLUT4C or GLUT1C peptides to give a final peptide concentration of approximately 200 μm after mixing and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Peptide-loaded resealed ghosts were washed once with 10 volumes of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 30 mm HEPES prior to fusion with adipocytes. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–220 g sacrificed by cervical dislocation as described (20Martz A. Mookerjee B.K. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13606-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of peptides into intact adipocytes was achieved by fusing peptide-loaded resealed rabbit erythrocyte ghosts with intact adipocytes using polyethylene glycol (PEG 8,000; molecular weight, 1000–8000) (21Jo I. Hah J.S. Rampal A.L. Chakrabarti R. Paterson A.R.P. Craik J.D. Cass C.E. Zobel C.R. Jung C.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Typically, adipocytes were washed twice with KRH buffer without bovine serum albumin. 1 ml of adipocytes (40–45% cytocrit) were mixed with a specified amount (ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 ml) of resealed ghosts (70–75% cytocrit) preloaded with peptides in KRH buffer. An aliquot of 50% PEG 8,000 suspension was added from above and mixed gently for 3 min. The final concentration of PEG 8,000 was 10% after mixing. The mixture was washed using 10 volumes of KRH buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mmd-glucose, and after gentle mixing, adipocytes were recovered by flotation. This washing procedure was repeated twice more. Adipocytes were stabilized at 37 °C for 60 min prior to functional studies. When specified, adipocytes were treated with insulin for the last 20 min of this stabilization period. Peptide incorporation was adjusted by varying the amounts of preloaded ghosts used for fusion with a fixed amount of adipocytes and quantitated by immunoblots. Plasma membrane (PM) and low density microsomal (LDM) fractions of adipocytes as well as adipocyte cytosol were prepared by subcellular fractionation following procedures previously described (22Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for immunoblots has been also described elsewhere (23Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H.Z. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-GLUT4 and anti-GLUT1 sera were raised against the synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal amino acid sequences, KPSTELEYLGPDEND and TPEELFHPLGADSQV, respectively, and used with protein A-horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody. Immunoblot intensities were quantitated by densitometry using an analytical scanning system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Incorporation of GLUT4C and GLUT1C peptides into adipocytes after fusion were also quantitated by immunoblotting cytosol using the same antisera mentioned above and expressed in mol based on calibration curves constructed from immunoblots of varying amounts of GLUT4C or GLUT1C peptide. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214256) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equilibrium exchange influx of 3OMG was measured by the oil flotation method (25Whitesell R.R. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5276-5283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [14C]3OMG as a tracer as described previously (22Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes prior to and after peptide incorporation were first equilibrated with 5 mm3OMG at 37 °C for 30 min. This chemical equilibration time also allowed cell stabilization and overlapped with the 20 min of insulin (10−7m) treatment where specified. A 30–60-s tracer equilibration time course was constructed by measuring tracer uptake at six time points and analyzed to calculatet½, the time required for one-half of complete tracer equilibration, as described (22Jhun B.H. Hah J.S. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22260-22265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We introduced synthetic peptides corresponding to the GLUT4 and GLUT1 C-terminal sequences into rat adipocytes via PEG-induced cell-cell fusion using peptide-loaded rat erythrocyte ghosts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fusion procedure used here is similar to that that we previously used for the reconstitution of purified human erythrocyte GLUT1 into adipocytes (21Jo I. Hah J.S. Rampal A.L. Chakrabarti R. Paterson A.R.P. Craik J.D. Cass C.E. Zobel C.R. Jung C.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) except that peptide-loaded rabbit erythrocyte ghosts were used in lieu of liposomes. The use of liposomes (or proteoliposomes, whose diameters are 0.5 μm or less) with a large surface area to volume ratio is quite effective in reconstituting integral membrane proteins into host cell plasma membranes but is not suitable for introducing a large amount of a soluble protein into host cell cytosol. The use of erythrocyte ghosts, whose volume to surface area ratio is 10 times as large as that of liposomes, allows one to introduce a large quantity of soluble peptides or proteins upon fusion with only a minimal increase in host cell plasma membrane. Although the mean diameter of rat adipocytes is almost 10 times as large as that of rabbit erythrocyte ghosts, more than 90% of the adipocyte intracellular space is filled with fat (25Whitesell R.R. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5276-5283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. Y. Jung, unpublished data. Therefore the ratio of plasma membrane to the intracellular aqueous space for adipocytes and ghosts are roughly equal. Fusion of every peptide-loaded ghost with an adipocyte would therefore result in injection of a volume of ghost content equal to roughly 1% of adipocyte cytosolic aqueous space accompanied by an incorporation of erythrocyte membrane equivalent to 1% of host cell plasma membrane area. For each fusion experiment, the amounts of incorporated GLUTC peptides and native GLUT4/1 were assessed separately by immunoblots using particle-free cytosolic fractions and cytosol-free total membrane fractions, respectively, of host cells. As much as 1.1 nmol of GLUT4C or GLUT1C peptide and approximately 20 pmol of native GLUT4 were detected in 5 × 106 adipocytes (approximately 1 ml of 40–45% packed adipocytes) after fusion by our protocol (not illustrated). This would correspond to an approximately 50 times molar excess of GLUT4C peptide to native GLUT4 in adipocytes or approximately 25 μm GLUT4C in adipocyte cytosol (1 ml of packed adipocytes contains approximately 40 μl of cytosolic aqueous space). These data together with measured peptide concentrations in loaded ghosts also indicate fusion of up to 10 ghosts per adipocyte in these experiments. Examination with light microscopy (data not illustrated), on the other hand, revealed that our fusion protocol resulted in surface adhesion of one ghost or less for each adipocyte. Rabbit erythrocytes express only a negligible amount of GLUT1 (less than 10% in cell surface density as estimated based on immunoblot and relative cell sizes) compared with basal adipocytes with no GLUT4, 3J. S. Hah and C. Y. Jung, unpublished data. thus the fusion of 10 rabbit erythrocyte ghosts may induce an approximately 10% increase in adipocyte surface area with a less than 1% increase in GLUT1 content. If the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4 plays a critical role in constitutive GLUT4 targeting in adipocytes as recent transfection experiments suggest (Refs. 9Asano T. Taketa K. Tsukuda K.

That this is indeed the case illustrated in Figs. 1, 2, 3, where GLUT4C peptide introduced in approximately 45-fold molar excess in adipocyte cytosol caused a more than 3-fold increase in the plasma membrane level of GLUT4 in host cells, with a concomitant reduction in intracellular GLUT4 content. In these experiments, the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 and GLUT1 were measured by immunoblotting essentially cytosol-free PM and LDM. GLUT1 distribution was not affected significantly in these experiments (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4), indicating that GLUT4C peptide selectively affects GLUT4 targeting. The effect was dose-dependent, increasing almost linearly with increasing amounts of GLUT4C peptide incorporation (Fig. 4). GLUT1C peptide, when similarly introduced in adipocytes, on the other hand, showed no effect or a negligible effect on either constitutive or insulin-responsive subcellular distribution of GLUT1 (Figs. 1, 2, 3) and GLUT4 (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) in host cells, demonstrating that the effect is specific to GLUT4C peptide.Figure 2Immunoblots of GLUT4 and GLUT1 in PM and LDM isolated from adipocytes incorporated with increasing amounts of GLUT4C and GLUT1C peptides. Experiments were similar to those shown in Fig. 1 except that 0.4 (C1), 0.8 (C2), or 1.6 (C3) ml of peptide-loaded packed ghosts (approximately 200 μm peptide) were used per ml of packed adipocytes in the fusion protocol.

An increasing amount of peptide was incorporated by fusing an increasing amount (from 0.4 to 1.6 ml, approximately 70% packed) of peptide-loaded ghosts with each ml of 40–45% packed adipocytes as in experiments illustrated in Fig. 2. Peptide incorporated into adipocytes was measured for each fusion experiment by semiquantitative immunoblotting analysis and expressed in nmol/ml 40–45% packed adipocytes (on abscissa) as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Blot intensities for PM GLUT4 were expressed relative to those measured for adipocytes fused with ghosts containing no peptide (on ordinate). Each data point represents a single determination. Data for GLUT4C (solid circles) and GLUT1C (solid squares) peptide incorporation are shown.Lines were drawn by eye. It is readily calculated from these data that GLUT4C peptide of approximately 13-fold molar excess to native GLUT4 is required to increase the steady state PM GLUT4 by 2-fold (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Also run in parallel with these experiments are control experiments using adipocytes that were subjected to the fusion protocol in the absence of peptides (Figs. 1, 2, 3). These control adipocytes showed a constitutive PM to LDM distribution ratio of 0.096 ± 0.015 for GLUT4 and 0.91 ± 0.12 for GLUT1 (average ± S.D.;n = 3) (data not illustrated) and responded to insulin (10−7 M, 30 min at 37 °C) by showing an increase in PM GLUT4 level by 4–5-fold with a concomitant reduction in LDM GLUT4 level (Figs. 1 and 3). These results demonstrate that the fusion protocol by itself did not greatly affect the constitutive and insulin-responsive targeting patterns of both isoforms in host adipocytes. One advantage of the use of the fusion protocol over chemical and electrical permeabilization protocols for peptide incorporation into cells is that the host cells retain their plasma membrane diffusion barrier after fusion allowing one to study transporter function directly after peptide incorporation. The time courses of 3OMG tracer equilibrium exchange measured on adipocytes after peptide incorporation (Fig. 5) demonstrated that GLUT4C peptide also caused a dose-dependent stimulation of glucose transport in host cells. GLUT1C peptide similarly introduced into adipocytes did not affect 3OMG exchange flux in host cells (not illustrated). Also illustrated (Fig. 5) are the time course of 3OMG exchange by those adipocytes that were subjected to the fusion protocol in the absence of peptides. These adipocytes showed a half-equilibration time (t½) for 3OMG exchange of 46.6 s in the basal state and 9.7 s in the presence of insulin (10−7m, 30 min). Adipocytes prior to the fusion protocol, on the other hand, showed t½ values for 3OMG equilibration of 78 and 8 s, basal and after insulin, respectively (data not illustrated). Thus, adipocytes fully retained their ability to respond to insulin after fusion, although basal flux was significantly increased, most likely due to the additional mechanical agitation inherent in this protocol. We have demonstrated in the present study that when the synthetic peptide with the GLUT4 C-terminal 43-amino acid sequence is introduced into rat epididymal adipocyte cytosol, it causes a large redistribution of native GLUT4 from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane in host cells. This GLUT4C peptide effect is dose-dependent with respect to the concentration of GLUT4C peptide in cytosol, increasing the plasma membrane GLUT4 level by more than 4-fold. The effect is selective, affecting only GLUT4 distribution and not GLUT1 distribution. Furthermore, the GLUT4 redistribution accompanies an equally large and dose-dependent stimulation of glucose transport function as assessed by 3OMG exchange. The effect is not an experimental artifact because it is specific to the GLUT4 sequence; a similar incorporation of the peptide corresponding to the GLUT1 C-terminal 42-amino acid sequence was without effect. These findings strongly suggest that the GLUT4 cytoplasmic domain is indeed important in constitutive GLUT4 targeting in rat adipocytes, a classical insulin target cell. GLUT4 in rat adipocytes is known to recycle constantly between the plasma membrane and an intracellular pool with two characteristic first order rate constants, one for endocytosis and the other for exocytosis (23Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H.Z. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus changes in either or both of these processes can cause changes in the steady state GLUT4 distribution between these two pools. Insulin was shown to recruit GLUT4 to the plasma membrane by reducing the endocytosis as well as enhancing the exocytosis (23Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H.Z. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas okadaic acid, which also induces GLUT4 recruitment, does so by enhancing the exocytosis only (26Rampal A.L. Jhun B.H. Kim S.S. Liu H. Manka M. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3938-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such a kinetic characterization is not available at this time for the GLUT4C peptide-induced GLUT4 redistribution described here, although preliminary data indicate (not illustrated) that the peptide effects develop rather quickly, apparently completing within 30 min of exposure to peptide. It is thus possible that the endocytosis, the exocytosis, or both are affected by peptide incorporation. It is not known at the molecular level how the GLUT4C peptide in adipocyte cytosol induces native GLUT4 redistribution from the storage pool to the plasma membrane. Our findings nevertheless offer useful insights into understanding how GLUT4 targeting is regulated at the molecular level in this classical insulin target cell. A straightforward interpretation (Fig. 6) of the findings is that there is a protein or proteins that interacts with GLUT4 at its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and that this interaction is a key step in the regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis and/or exocytosis. GLUT4C peptide, which would be expected to also bind to this protein, may then competitively inhibit this interaction by a dominant negative effect (Fig. 6). The fact that this effect required a large molar excess of the peptide with respect to native GLUT4 in host cells (Fig. 4) is consistent with this interpretation. The putative protein may be an “adapter” whose interaction with GLUT4 is required for GLUT4 endocytosis or an enzyme that primes GLUT4 for endocytosis by covalent modification. Alternatively, the protein may a “retention molecule” or an associated enzyme that keeps GLUT4 in the intracellular storage compartment from entering exocytic budding sites or the externalization pathway. In either model, a molar excess of GLUT4C peptide would cause GLUT4 redistribution from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane by effectively competing with native GLUT4 for the putative regulatory protein. The molecular identity of the GLUT4 regulatory protein or proteins postulated above is yet to be determined. The identification of this protein may be approached, at least initially, based on its specific interaction with GLUT4C peptide. It is quite possible that other segments of the GLUT4 cytoplasmic domain, namely the N terminus and the central loop, may enhance or otherwise participate in this interaction. We are currently examining the possible effects of the N terminus and the central loop using the protocol of peptide introduction via PEG-induced cell-cell fusion using rabbit erythrocyte ghosts as described here. A number of cellular proteins have been known to interact with GLUT proteins (GLUT-binding proteins or GTBPs). These include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (27Lachaal M. Berenski C.J.

Activation of transcription is usually the result of the direct interaction between GR and the GRE, whereas GR-mediated transcription repression is either the result of the indirect action of GR, mediated by a response element as a result of protein·protein interaction or by an occlusion mechanism in which GR displaces a general or regulatory transcription factor. A specific mutation of rat GR, K461A, has previously been described to transform the indirect protein·protein interaction-dependent transrepressive effect of GR into an activating function (Starr, D. B., Matsui, W., Thomas, J. R., and Yamamoto, K. R. (1996) Genes Dev. 10, 1271–1283). In HOS D4 and COS7 cells, this mutation was shown to transform the transrepressive effect of wild-type GR, acting on reporter constructs containing the composite GRE from the proliferin gene (plfG) or the negative tethering GRE from the collagenase A promoter (colA), into an activating function. In contrast, the K461A mutation had no effect on the transrepressive effect of GR on the human osteocalcin gene in which repression apparently occurs through the binding of GR to a negative GRE that overlaps the TATA box. The transrepressive function, typically 40% of the basal level in the absence of hormone, required only the isolated DNA-binding domain of wild type or mutant GR and was independent of the nature of transactivation domain. Thus, mutation of rat GR at position 461 differentiates between transrepressive functions of GR dependent on GR·DNA interaction (repression by occlusion) and GR·protein interaction (active repression). The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) can both activate and repress transcription of target genes by interaction with specific genomic response elements, glucocorticoid response elements (GREs).

Thus, mutation of rat GR at position 461 differentiates between transrepressive functions of GR dependent on GR·DNA interaction (repression by occlusion) and GR·protein interaction (active repression). Negative regulation of gene transcription by glucocorticoids and other ligands for nuclear receptor proteins appears to be carried out either by mechanisms involving interference with the DNA binding of upstream or general transcription factors or, alternatively, by repression mechanisms independent of DNA binding. In the first case, transcription repression involves a competition between transcriptionally active and inactive proteins for common or overlapping DNA-binding sites. Thus, transcription repression is achieved when the inactive factor displaces the more active one. For the latter mode, transcriptional repression is achieved by an as yet unidentified mechanism that is postulated to involve a physical interaction between the two proteins in a DNA-independent manner and, presumably, the formation of a transcriptionally inactive complex. The signal transduction pathway of glucocorticoid hormones provides a number of well described examples for which possible mechanisms involved in negative gene regulation have been postulated. Signal transduction is mediated by an intracellular receptor protein, that, like many other members of the steroid receptor superfamily, functions as a ligand-activated nuclear transcriptional regulator (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

The classical mode of gene regulation by glucocorticoids, which accounts for most cases of positive gene regulation, is known to be mediated by interaction of the ligand-activated GR 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; nGRE, negative glucocorticoid response element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; dexamethasone, 9α-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17,21-trihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione; TBP, TATA-binding protein; wt, wild type; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; nGRE, negative glucocorticoid response element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; dexamethasone, 9α-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17,21-trihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione; TBP, TATA-binding protein; wt, wild type; bp, base pair(s). with positive control elements (glucocorticoid response elements; GREs) which are present in single or multiple copies upstream of or within target genes (3Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Although not completely understood, the mechanism by which GR activates transcription in response to glucocorticoids is fairly simple in comparison to the variety of mechanisms employed by nuclear receptor proteins for the negative modulation of gene transcription (4Birnberg N.C.

Despite recent advances, it has not been possible to formulate a simple, all inclusive model accounting for negative gene regulation mediated by GR (7Saatcioglu F. Claret F.X. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 347-359PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karin M. Yang-Yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Deng T. Saatcioglu F. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: S43-S44Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although several physiologically relevant models have been suggested for the small number of genes studied mechanistically in a detailed manner. It has become apparent that simple DNA binding by the receptor may not be sufficient or, in some cases, even required for ligand-dependent repression for the majority of examples described for glucocorticoid-mediated transcription repression, which are related to their anti-inflammatory effects (9Caldenhoven E. Lidén J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Auphan N.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the best characterized examples of this mode of repression is the interaction between the transcriptional activator AP1 and the activated GR. Under certain conditions, interference between the GR and the AP1 signal transduction pathways appears to occur on composite response elements that have the potential to bind both the receptor and the AP1 complex, whereas in other cases, the repression mechanism requires only an AP1·DNA interaction (18König H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). An example of the first case is seen within the promoter region of the proliferin gene. A 25-bp composite GRE, termed plfG, is responsible for mediating the negative GR effect. GR binds to plfG in the absence of AP1, but regulates transcription only in the presence of AP1, activating if AP1 consists of c-Jun homodimers, and repressing if AP1 is comprised of c-Jun·c-Fos heterodimers (19Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 20Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). An example of the alternative AP1-dependent mechanism is the glucocorticoid-dependent repression of the collagenase gene. This effect requires AP1 binding to its specific recognition element in the upstream promoter region of the collagenase gene, whereas direct GR·DNA contact does not seem to be a prerequisite for efficient ligand-dependent repression of the activated gene expression level. Although the GR does not bind to the AP1 site, a functional GR DBD is required for repression of AP1 activity. A direct protein·protein interaction between GR and AP1 has been demonstrated (18König H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). There are some cases, however, where DNA binding by GR is both necessary and sufficient for transcription repression. For example, at the pro-opiomelanocortin gene, repression occurs without assistance or interference from other sequence-specific transcription factors (12Drouin J. Sun Y.L. Chamberland M. Gauthier Y. De Lean A. Nemer M. Schmidt T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar,13Riegel A.T. Lu Y. Remenick J. Wolford R.G. Berard D.S. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1973-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the interaction between GR and the GRE indicated that three moieties of the receptor molecule form a unique complex with the pro-opiomelanocortin GRE, in contrast to a positive regulated GRE which interacts with the receptor protein as a homodimer (14Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examples of repression due to transcriptional interference with other regulatory proteins at a response element have been postulated in several cases including the bovine prolactin and the c-fosgenes (15Cairns C. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Karagianni N. Tsawdaroglou N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2327-2334PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). A final example of a gene negatively regulated by glucocorticoids through an interference mechanism is the human bone-specific gene osteocalcin (22Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Buecker J.L. Kriz R. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 23Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A.

Rev. 1989; 69: 990-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The overlap of a competitive nGRE with the basal TATA box element suggested that the hormone-activated GR can function as a negative regulator on osteocalcin gene activity by competing with a specific TFIID-induced complex at the DNA binding level and that this binding is mutually exclusive (25Meyer, T., Gustafsson, J.-Å., and Carlstedt-Duke, J. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. , 16, in press.Google Scholar, 26Strömstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). GR action is strongly determined by its context within the unique architecture and requirements of each gene promoter (27Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Lefstin J.A. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2842-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by the above described examples of glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional regulation, GREs can be classified into at least three independent subclasses: simple GREs capable of interacting with the hormone-induced receptor without the assistance of other sequence-specific regulators, resulting in transactivation or, in more specialized cases, repression; composite GREs having the ability to interact with the receptor protein and additional factors resulting in either transactivation or transrepression; and cases in which direct GR·DNA interaction is not required for GR-mediated gene regulation, called tethering GREs (18König H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,21Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Starr et al. (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) defined a single amino acid change (K461A) within the rat GR capable of distinguishing between simple GREs and composite and tethering GREs. The receptor, containing a mutation within the DBD at position 461 (human GR 442), provides a powerful tool for comparing and defining mechanisms involved in transmission of negative regulation by GR. To further characterize the mechanism proposed for the repression of the human osteocalcin gene by glucocorticoids, we compared the action of this specific mutated receptor, chimeric proteins containing the GR DBD as well as the isolated GR DBD on both the osteocalcin promoter and the two well defined AP1-dependent systems described above, colA and plfG. In this report we present evidence that the mechanism involved in the negative transcriptional effect mediated by glucocorticoids on the human osteocalcin promoter is strictly dependent on binding of GR to a composite functional GRE (competitive nGRE). DNA binding and cotransfection experiments suggest that the hormone activated GR and the specific GR mutant K461A repress osteocalcin gene activity in a similar fashion, primarily mediated by competitive binding to a dual binding site that disrupts an alternative protein·DNA contact. The plasmid pOSCAT containing the promoter region of the target gene was cut withSacI and XhoI to obtain a fragment spanning nucleotides −344/+31 of the osteocalcin promoter (23Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The fragment was ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of pGL2 Enh (Promega) to drive the firefly luciferase gene (pOS-344Luc). The constructs colA-Luc and plfG3-Luc are as described previously (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The rat GR expression vector 6RGR, 6RGR-K461A, 6RGR(407–525), and 6RGR-K461A(407–525) are as described elsewhere (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for 407–556-VP16 and 407–556(K461A)-VP16 were constructed as follows. The HindIII-XbaI fragment from pG1-X556-VP16 (kindly provided by J. A. Lefstin) was cloned into the HindIII-SpeI sites of KS + GR(407–523) (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was cut with KpnI andPvuII, and the fragment containing the GR sequence was cloned into the KpnI-EcoRV sites of pS6R (30Miner J.N. Diamond M.I. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 525-530PubMed Google Scholar), yielding 6R-407–556-VP16. The 6R-407–556(K461A)-VP16 construct was made by ligating the KpnI-BstBI fragment from KS + GR-K461A(407–523) into the KpnI-BstBI sites of 6R-407–525-VP16. These plasmids were verified by sequencing the relevant parts of the resulting constructs. HOS D4 osteosarcoma cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Eagle's medium buffered with bicarbonate and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above. Cells were seeded in 6-cm plates 24 h before a transfection experiment and transfected at 50–60% confluence using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. The precipitate contained 5 μg of supercoiled luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and varying amounts (0–2 μg) of different expression plasmids. The overall amount of DNA was kept constant by the addition of parent expression vector. After 12–14-h exposure to the calcium phosphate precipitate, medium was refreshed and cells treated for 24 h with 20 nmdexamethasone. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested for luciferase assay by scraping the cells into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, cenrtrifuging for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, and resuspending in 50 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Luciferase activity was monitored according to the GenGlow luciferase assay kit (Bio Orbit) using an Anthos Lucy 1 luminometer. The results are expressed as light units measured. All experiments were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions. Extracts from COS7 cells, transiently transfected with 15 μg of GR expression vector/15-cm cell culture plate, were prepared by homogenizing the cell pellets with a Dounce homogenizer in 500 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, and centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was aliqoted and stored at −70 °C. GR binding activity was monitored by an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay. A 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the GRE sequence and TATA box of the human osteocalcin promoter (−41/−9) or mutated versions of this DNA stretch were used as specific probe (wt: AGCCCAGAGGGTATAAACAGTGCTGGAGG, mutant: AGCCCAGAGGGTgTAAACAGTGCTGGAGG). The recombinant GR was incubated for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Competing oligonucleotides were incubated with the binding reactions for 10 min prior to addition of the 32P-labeled probe. After adding the specific DNA probe the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. GR can antagonize the function of c-Jun and c-Fos, which are both components of the phorbol ester-activated transcription factor AP1 (8Karin M. Yang-Yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Deng T. Saatcioglu F. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: S43-S44Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We employed two well defined examples for repression of AP1-activated gene activity by GR to further characterize the mechanism of glucocorticoid mediated repression of the human osteocalcin gene in comparison. In all three examples of gene promoter regions used in this study, the negative modulation of target gene activity seems to be mediated by interference of hormone activated GR protein with positive acting sequence-specific transcription factors. The experimental basis for this comparative study was based on a recently published GR mutant having the ability to activate genes independent of the class of GRE used (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this mutant, an amino acid change from Lys to Ala at position 461 within the DBD of the rat GR resulted in a phenotype characterized by hormone-dependent transactivation at simple GREs as well as at composite and tethering GREs. As reference systems in the present study, we used either a promoter construct containing three copies of a 25-bp DNA sequence (composite GRE) from the proliferin promoter (plfG) (19Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) known to mediate a negative GR effect or an nGRE (tethering GRE) from the the collagenase promoter here denoted as colA (31Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wt GR, which represses transcription from these two reporters, the GR mutant K461A activates transcription (25Meyer, T., Gustafsson, J.-Å., and Carlstedt-Duke, J. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. , 16, in press.Google Scholar, 26Strömstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We were interested in studying the effect of this constitutively positive acting receptor variant on the osteocalcin promoter-controlled transcription rate where the interdigitation of a GR binding site and the TATA box suggest that repression of osteocalcin gene expression is mediated by interference of the GR with the basal transcription machinery. To this end, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing a fragment of the human osteocalcin promoter spanning nucleotides −344/+31 driving the firefly luciferase gene. This reporter construct was introduced into the human osteosarcoma cell line HOS D4 or, alternatively, into COS7 cells. The endogenous GR in these cell lines are expressed at very low levels and are hardly detectable by ligand binding or immunochemical assays (32Alksnis M. Barkhem T. Strömstedt P.-E. Ahola H. Kutoh E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Nilsson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10078-10085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, the cotransfection of HOS D4 cells with either wt GR or the mutated receptor (K461A) together with the above described osteocalcin reporter construct resulted, after induction with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, in a clear repression of the luciferase activity to 50% (Fig. 1 A). To exclude the influence of possible cell-specific effects on GR function, we repeated the experiments in the non-bone cell line COS7 and found again that the receptor variant K461A behaved in a similar fashion as the wt GR. Both hormone-activated GR variants had the capacity to repress basal osteocalcin gene activity (Fig. 1 B). The original characterization of the K461A mutant and its transformation from transrepression to transactivation of composite and tethering GREs was carried out in F9 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells and CV-1 cells (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To exclude cell-specific differences in the function of the K461A mutant, the function of the composite plfG GRE and the tethering colA GRE was tested in COS7 cells. In contrast to the results obtained with the osteocalcin gene, the expression of the K461A GR mutant activated the gene activity in both reference promoters in COS7 cells (Fig. 2). In the presence of dexamethasone, wt GR repressed luciferase activity to 60% from a plfG GRE, whereas the K461A mutant induced luciferase activity about 25-fold (Fig. 2 A). The effect on the tethering colA element was similar but to a much lesser degree (Fig. 2 B) with dexamethasonedependent repression of luciferase activity to about 60% with wt GR and dexamethasone-dependent stimulation of luciferase activity to about 160% with the K461A mutant. We have previously shown that GR binds specifically to the negative response element thought to be responsible for the transrepressive effect on the human osteocalcin promoter (25Meyer, T., Gustafsson, J.-Å., and Carlstedt-Duke, J. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. , 16, in press.Google Scholar, 26Strömstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The K461A mutant binds to the −41/−9 fragment of the human osteocalcin promoter, containing the nGRE, in a manner similar to that of wt GR (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4). The GR-specific band with wt GR is competed for specifically by an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a standard GRE sequence (tyrosine aminotransferase GRE; TAT) (Fig. 3 A,lanes 5 and 6). The use of a vitamin D-responsive element did not affect GR binding (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). Mutation of the nGRE sequence diminishes the GR-specific complex (Fig. 3 A, lane 10). Competitive DNA binding was estimated by titrating increasing amounts of the unlabeled probe into the binding reactions containing either wt GR or the K461A mutant. Measurement of the relative binding of the radiolabeled probe showed that there was no major difference in DNA-binding affinity between wt GR and the K461A mutant (Fig. 3 B). To further support the hypothesis that competitive GR binding is responsible for repression of the osteocalcin gene, we compared the effect of a GR chimera, containing the GR DBD K461A fused to the activation domain of the viral transcriptional activator VP16, on osteocalcin, pflG and colA controlled reporter gene activity. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of the GR-VP16 chimera containing the mutant K461A DBD increased the luciferase activity measured in the case of both reference promoters used in this study (Fig. 4, B and C). However, the repression mediated by this constitutively active chimeric transcription factor on osteocalcin gene transcription was still comparable to the repressive effect mediated by the wt GR-VP16 protein (Fig. 4 A). The magnitude of transactivation/transrepression with the GR K461A-VP16 chimera (Fig. 4 A) was identical to the dexamethasone-dependent activity of the full-length GR variants on osteocalcin promoter activity (Fig. 1). Thus, the repression of the osteocalcin promoter by GR is dependent on the DNA binding function and is independent of the transactivation domain associated. Finally, the function of the isolated DBD of the two GR variants was tested with regard to their transrepressive effect. Expression of the isolated DBD of either wt GR or the mutant K461A repressed the osteocalcin promoter to an equal degree, with virtually identical activity to the full-length variants (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the isolated wt DBD had no effect on the plfG reporter activity (Fig. 5 B). The isolated DBD of the K461A GR mutant demonstrated a weak stimulatory activity on the plfG element (Fig. 5 B). However, this was considerably reduced compared with the dexamethasone-dependent activity of the full-length K461A mutant (Fig. 2 A). The repression of gene transcription is of particular interest since the mechanism underlying these repressive effects are less well understood than those governing activation. It has previously been shown that administration of glucocorticoids leads to a transcriptional repression of several target genes. These transrepressive effects of glucocorticoids are related to their clinically important anti-inflammatory effects (e.g. repression of collagenase A) or relevant side effects of pharmacological usage of glucocorticoids such as steroid-dependent osteoporosis (e.g.repression of osteocalcin) (23Morrison N.A.

In contrast to the unifying model proposed for gene activation by GR, a simple unique model has not been formulated to account for receptor-dependent gene repression. In the present study we further characterized the mechanism underlying the negative glucocorticoid-dependent regulation of the human osteocalcin gene in comparison with two well described reference systems for repression committed by GR on phorbol ester-activated gene transcription, the mouse proliferin gene, and the collagenase A gene. We took advantage of a recently described rat GR variant, GR K461A, that is able to distinguish between at least three functional subclasses of glucocorticoid responsive elements: simple GREs binding the activated GR molecule in a homodimeric fashion,composite GREs in which the exertion of receptor action requires the binding of additional sequence specific transcription factors to a common binding site, and tethering GREs in which GR mediates the transcriptional rate of target genes by interfering with stimulatory transcriptional activators already bound to DNA (Fig. 6) (27Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The K461A mutation results in a reduced transactivating activity on simple GREs that corresponds to a reduced binding affinity for the GRE sequence (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On tethering or composite GREs, the K461A mutation results in a switch from glucocorticoid-dependent transrepression, in the presence of both c-Jun and c-Fos, to transactivation. Identical results were obtained in this study, using COS7 cells or HOS D4 osteosarcoma cells. Thus, the effect of the K461A mutation on AP1-dependent GR transrepression is not cell-specific. However, the magnitude of AP1-dependent GR-dependent transactivation of the colA element induced by the K461A mutation was considerably decreased as compared with that obtained previously with either F9 or CV-1 cells. The magnitude of induction induced by K461A on the plfG element was considerably larger and of the same order of magnitude seen previously in F9 and CV-1 cells. The osteocalcin gene is an osteoblast-specific gene expressed in late stages of differentiation (34Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of osteocalcin remains unclear, osteocalcin production is related to bone density and increased osteoblast activity (35Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Exposure to glucocorticoids results in the reduction of osteocalcin mRNA to about 50%. Analysis of the promoter region of the human osteocalcin gene identified one specific binding site for GR which completely overlapped the TATA box (26Strömstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Transient expression of reporter genes driven by constructs containing the minimal osteocalcin promoter resulted in a glucocorticoid-dependent reduction in reporter gene activity to 50% or less (23Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 25Meyer, T., Gustafsson, J.-Å., and Carlstedt-Duke, J. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. , 16, in press.Google Scholar). Mutations of the promoter that eliminated GR binding obliterated the glucocorticoid-dependent repression of reporter gene activity. GR homodimer and TBP bind competitively for overlapping DNA elements in vitro (25Meyer, T., Gustafsson, J.-Å., and Carlstedt-Duke, J. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. , 16, in press.Google Scholar). Based on these results we proposed a mechanism for glucocorticoid-dependent repression of the osteocalcin gene in which binding of GR to a negative GRE (competitive nGRE, Fig. 6) reduces the availability of the promoter for the basal transcriptional complex. Glucocorticoid-dependent transrepression of target genes by competitive binding of GR and transcriptional activators to overlapping DNA elements has been proposed for the regulation of the type 1 vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor gene as well as for the prolactin gene (15Cairns C. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K.R.

In contrast to the switch of AP1-dependent GR transrepression to transactivation by the K461A mutation, no effect at all was seen on the GR-dependent transrepression of the osteocalcin promoter. Both wt GR and the K461A mutant induced repression of the osteocalcin promoter to about 40% of basal activity. Both GR variants bound equally well to the osteocalcin nGRE (Fig. 3 B). This is in contrast to the decreased binding and function on a simple positive GRE and transactivation with the mutant as described previously (29Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These results confirm the dependence of osteocalcin repression by glucocorticoids on GR·DNA interaction rather than by protein·protein interaction. Detailed molecular studies have demonstrated the functional requirement of the GR DBD in the modulation of gene expression by GR. The DBD has been shown to be necessary for both the transactivation and the transrepression functions of the receptor (20Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 28Lefstin J.A. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2842-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The isolated DBD, either wt or the K461A mutant, were sufficient to induce transrepression of the osteocalcin promoter, which further strengthens the hypothesis of a direct competition in binding to overlapping DNA sequences between GR and TBP. In contrast, the isolated DBD was virtually inactive on the plfG element, even with the K461A mutation. Fusion of the DBD K461A to a heterologous transactivation domain from VP16 restored the function of the protein on the AP1-dependent elements, plfG and colA, resulting in constitutive transactivation with the K461A mutation. In contrast, the transrepression of the osteocalcin promoter remained unchanged, indicating that the glucocorticoid-dependent repression of the osteocalcin promoter is independent of the transactivation domain associated. In conclusion, mutation of a single amino acid located at the DNA-binding surface of rat GR, K461A, results in a receptor variant that can differentiate between two different mechanisms of glucocorticoid-dependent transrepression. The mutation switches AP1-dependent transrepression, involving protein·protein interaction, to transactivation, whereas DNA-dependent transrepression is unaffected. In the crystal structure of the rat GR DBD bound to a simple positive GRE (37Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 38Härd T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B.A. Dahlman K. Freedman L.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Yamamoto K.R. Gustafsson J.-Å. Kaptein R. Science. 1990; 249: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), the lysine side chain at position 461 makes a specific base contact with the DNA sequence. Loss of this contact following the mutation K461A would be expected to result in decreased affinity for the GRE and thereby decreased transactivation, which is what was previously reported for this mutation. However, the exact contacts between GR and the osteocalcin nGRE have not been demonstrated. The K461A mutation does not result in any loss in transrepression function, which would indicate that this residue does not play as active a role in binding to the osteocalcin nGRE as it does in binding to a classical positive GRE. Another explanation may be that Lys-461 plays an active role in DNA sequence-dependent conformational change of GR required for transactivation. In the osteocalcin nGRE, GR appears to exert its role by competing away TBP from the promoter, thereby reducing the transcriptional rate of the gene. Thus no further change or subsequent step in GR action would be required for the regulation of this gene.

https://openalex.org/W2002336981,"The level of inwardly rectifying K+ channel 1 (IRK1) mRNA decreased upon denervation and increased during muscle differentiation in mouse skeletal muscle. To identify the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of IRK1 mRNA expression, we examined its expression using the well differentiated C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cell line as a model system. Since nerve-induced muscle activity results in contraction, it was questioned whether the changes in IRK1 expression might be relevant to the increased intracellular calcium that functions as a cytoplasmic messenger in excitation-contraction coupling. Indeed, activation of either L-type calcium channels or ryanodine receptors increased the level of IRK1 mRNA. More directly, ionomycin activated the IRK1 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners, which was abolished by treatment with EGTA. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also abolished the stimulating effect of ionomycin. Meanwhile, activation of protein kinase C by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) markedly decreased the level of IRK1 mRNA, which required ongoing protein synthesis. Actinomycin D experiments revealed that ionomycin increased the half-life of IRK1 mRNA from 0.86 to 1.97 h, but TPA decreased it to 0.38 h. However, neither ionomycin nor TPA appreciably altered the rate of IRK1 gene transcription. Based on these observations, we conclude that intracellular calcium and protein kinase C are oppositely involved in the muscle activity-dependent regulation of IRK1 gene expression and that both act at the level of mRNA stability."

Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow kinetic studies of the Ugi interaction withEscherichia coli Ung indicate that complex formation is accomplished through a two-step binding reaction (12Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the initial step, the association between free Ugi and Ung is characterized by a rapid pre-equilibrium reaction with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.3 μm; the second step, the formation of an irreversible complex, is characterized by the rate constant k = 195 s−1. Thus, Ung·Ugi complex formation initiates with a “docking” interaction that facilitates optimal alignment between the two proteins. If correct alignment between Ung and Ugi does not occur, a reversible association will transpire. If, however, proper alignment is achieved, then a “locked” complex quickly follows. The secondary and tertiary structures of free Ugi were recently determined by solution state multi-dimensional NMR techniques and found to include two α-helices and five anti-parallel β-strands as illustrated in Fig. 1 (13Balasubramanian S.

The five contiguous β-strands are connected by short loop regions to form an anti-parallel β-sheet. Analysis of the electrostatic potential of Ugi revealed several striking features (14Beger R.D.

Seven of the 18 acidic amino acid residues (Glu-20, Asp-48, Glu-49, Asp-52, Glu-53, Asp-74, and Glu-78) come together to form a region of high negative potential on one face of the protein. Each of the residues that form this electrostatic region or “knob” are located immediately adjacent to or terminate a β-strand. Two other acidic amino acid residues (Asp-40 and Asp-61) are also in juxtaposition to the end of β-strands; Glu-78 and Glu-64 reside in the loop regions (14Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E.

The remaining seven negatively charged residues are located in the α1-helix (Asp-6, Glu-9, and Glu-11) and α2-helix (Glu-27, Glu-28, Glu-30, and Glu-31). Both the α1- and α2-helix elements project away from the β-sheet and are located on potentially flexible arms of the polypeptide (14Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W.

Furthermore, the α2-helix is longitudinally segmented into a hydrophobic face and a negatively charged face where the four glutamic acid residues protrude. Several lines of evidence suggest that some of the negatively charged amino acid residues of Ugi may act as a DNA mimic and mediate the interaction with Ung. First, UV-catalyzed cross-linking of oligonucleotide (dT)20 to the DNA-binding site of Ung blocked Ugi from forming a Ung·Ugi complex (15Bennett S.E. Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol.

Third, the negative electrostatic knob of Ugi exhibits an electrostatic potential of >6.6 kcal, which is similar to that generated by the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA (14Beger R.D.

Fourth, the recent x-ray structure of human uracil-DNA glycosylase complexed with a 10-bp oligonucleotide containing a target G·U mispair reveals the DNA complexed at the same site as Ugi (18Slupphaug G.

Fifth, charge neutralization by carbodiimide-mediated adduction of Ugi carboxylic acid residues caused a decrease in inhibitor protein activity (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, chemical adduction of specific glutamic acid residues (Glu-28 and Glu-31) of Ugi located in the α2-helix correlated with the formation of an unstable Ung·Ugi complex (19Sanderson R.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that after the Ung/Ugi association, the transition to the locked configuration may involve a conformational change in either one or both proteins.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) proposed that the locking reaction is caused predominantly by a change in Ugi structure. This position is supported by a comparison of the crystal structures of free human and HSV-1 uracil-DNA glycosylase with the structures of each enzyme in complex with Ugi (16Mol C.D. Arvai A.S.

In both cases, the tertiary structure of the enzyme shows only minor structural changes. In contrast, a comparison of the heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectra of free and bound [15N]Ugi indicates that many residues of Ugi undergo conformational change upon binding to Ung (14Beger R.D.

A more complete understanding of the docking and locking reactions may well be gained by determining the solution state structure of Ugi in complex with Ung. In the present report we (i) conduct site-directed mutagenesis of seven acidic residues of Ugi; (ii) purify each mutant Ugi protein to apparent homogeneity; (iii) characterize each mutant Ugi with regard to specific activity and Ung·Ugi complex stability and reversibility; (iv) determine the structural similarity between wild type Ugi and the Ugi mutant proteins using NMR methods; (v) compare the free and complexed Ugi solution structures; and (vi) model the interactions in the wild type and mutant Ung·Ugi complexes. Restriction endonucleases (EcoRI,EcoRV, HindIII, PstI, SacI, and XmnI), T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside andScaI were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. andAcyI came from Promega. [3H]Leucine and [35S]methionine were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; [3H]dUTP was from Amersham Corp., and [13C]glucose and [15N]ammonium chloride were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. E. coli JM105 was provided by W. Ream (Oregon State University), and E. coli CJ236 was obtained from T. A. Kunkel (NIEHS). Epicurian coli XL2-Blue ultracompetent cells, phagemid pBluescript II SK(−), and VCS-M13 helper phage were supplied by Stratagene. Plasmid pKK223-3 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; pZWtacl (22Wang Z. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W. Gene ( Amst .). 1991; 99: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and pSB1051 (12Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were constructed as described previously. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA Synthesizer by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology (Oregon State University). The first step in the site-directed mutagenesis procedure involved subcloning of the ugi gene into a pBluescript-based phagemid to produce single-stranded DNA. The pZWtac1EcoRI-HindIII restriction fragment (726 bp) containing the ugi gene (Fig. 2) was inserted into the corresponding EcoRI andHindIII sites of pBluescript II SK(−) using T4 DNA ligase. The resulting phagemid (pAL) was transformed into E. coliJM105, plated on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside, after which pAL DNA was purified from white colonies. E. coli CJ236 (dut,ung) was then transformed with phagemid pAL and grown at 37 °C in 1.0 liter of 2 × YT medium supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Upon reaching a cell density of 108 cells/ml (1A600 nm = 8 × 108 cells/ml), uridine was added to a final concentration of 0.25 μg/ml; VCS-M13 helper phage was added at a multiplicity of infection equal to 1.0, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Kanamycin (26 μg/ml final concentration) was added to select for infected E. coli cells and growth continued for an additional 5.5 h. The culture was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a GSA (Sorvall) rotor, and the supernatant fraction was processed to precipitate pAL phage with the addition of 0.25 volume of a 15% PEG-8000 and 2.5 m NaCl solution. Phage DNA was isolated from the supernatant fraction following extractions with phenol and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitation with ethanol (23Kunkle T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; l54: 367-382Crossref Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 9500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a SA600 (Sorvall) rotor, air dried, and resuspended in 500 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). This single-stranded uracil-substituted DNA that contained the antisense ugi gene sequence was termed pALU(ss) DNA. The second step involved in vitro primer extension of various oligonucleotides containing site-directed mutations in theugi structural gene. Deblocked/deprotected oligonucleotides were purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and phosphorylated at the 5′ end using ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (23Kunkle T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; l54: 367-382Crossref Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Defined DNA primer/templates were constructed by annealing various oligonucleotides (20 pmol) to pALU(ss) DNA at a 3:1 (primer:template) ratio in a 100-μl volume as described (24Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 1: 79-94Google Scholar, 25Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Primer extension reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 500 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 6 units of T4 DNA polymerase, 200 units of T4 DNA ligase, and 1.8 pmol of the heteroduplex pALU DNA primer/template. Following incubation for 5 min at 25 °C and then 2 h at 37 °C, a sample (10 μl) terminated with the addition of 1.5 μl of 0.1 m EDTA was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the extent of primer extension. Transformation of E. coli JM105 CCMB80 competent cells was performed with 10 μl of the primer extension reaction mixture (26Hanahan D. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 63-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Transformed bacterial colonies were grown on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and isolated colonies were subsequently grown to saturation in 2 ml of 2 × YT medium supplemented with ampicillin. Plasmid DNA (pSugi) was isolated using the Wizard Miniprep DNA purification technique (Promega). Isolated plasmids (pSugi) were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after three independent restriction endonuclease digestions as follows: (i)HindIII, (ii) HindIII plus EcoRI, and (iii) the appropriate novel restriction endonuclease for the site introduced into the pSugi DNA by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2). The third step of the procedure involved subcloning the ugigenes containing site-directed mutations from pSugi to the pKK223-3 derived overexpression vector pZWtac1, replacing the wild typeugi gene. Both pSugi and pZWtac1 DNA (1 μg) were separately digested with excess HindIII andEcoRI, and the products were resolved by 0.8% agarose (low melting point) gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to theugi gene containing DNA fragment (726 bp) from pSugi and the 4.6-kb fragment from pZWtac1 were excised, DNA extracted, and purified using glass milk (27Bennett, S. E. (1995) Characterization of Escherichia coli Uracil-DNA Glycosylase-Inhibtor Protein Interaction. Ph.D. thesis, Oregon State University.Google Scholar). Samples containing the 726-bp and 4.6-kbEcoRI/HindIII DNA fragments were mixed, and the complementary ends were joined using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 25 μg/ml BSA, 0.75 pmol of the 726-bp fragment, and 0.25 pmol of the 4.6-kb DNA fragment. Following incubation for ∼16 h at 16 °C, the ligation mixture was used to transform either E. coli JM105 or XL2-Blue competent cells (26Hanahan D. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 63-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Transformed colonies were isolated after growth on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight in 2 ml of 2 × YT medium containing ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was then isolated using the Wizard Miniprep procedure and analyzed using restriction endonuclease digestion for HindIII, HindIII plus EcoRI, and the appropriate introduced restriction sites (Fig. 2) as described above. In the resulting plasmids (pKugi), the mutant ugi gene was expressed under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducibletac promoter. Double-stranded pKugi DNA containing site-directed mutations were used as templates for nucleotide sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method originally described by Sanger et al. (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Either primer FP/PKK that was complementary to the ugi sense strand at position −143 to −122 or primer IRPUGI that hybridized to the antisense strand at position +379 to +401 was used to initiate DNA polymerase-mediated synthesis. DNA sequencing was conducted using an Applied Biosystems model 373A sequencer by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology (Oregon State University). Purification of fraction V [leucine-3H]Ung (13.5 cpm/pmol) was carried out similarly to that described by Bennett et al. (15Bennett S.E. Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21870-21879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonradioactive Ung (fraction V) was purified from E. coliJM105/pSB1051 grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fraction IV [35S]methionine-labeled Ugi (40 cpm/pmol) and [13C,15N]Ugi were purified as described by Sanderson and Mosbaugh (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) from E. coliJM105/pZWtac1 cultures (1–1.5 liters) grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml thiamine, and either 4.2 nmol of [35S]methionine or 0.2% [13C]glucose and 0.17% [15N]ammonium chloride, respectively. Nonradioactive Ugi and the various site-directed mutants of Ugi were purified following the same procedure, except that bacterial growth occurred in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Wild type Ugi or various site-directed mutants of Ugi protein were mixed with [3H]Ung in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (w/v) glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 4 °C for 20 min. Following complex formation, each sample was applied to a DE52 cellulose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl, washed with equilibration buffer, and step-eluted, as described previously (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and samples were analyzed for 3H radioactivity. The [3H]Ung·Ugi complex was detected by 18% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fractions containing complex were pooled and concentrated using a Centriplus-10 (Amicon) concentrator. Uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor activity was measured under previously described conditions (10Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When appropriate, Ugi was diluted with IDB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl). One unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor inactivates 1 unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase in the standard reaction. Uracil-DNA glycosylase activity was similarly measured except that Ugi was omitted (10Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase is defined as the amount that releases 1 nmol of uracil/h under standard reaction conditions. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficients ε280 nm = 4.2 × 104 liter/mol cm (Ung) and ε280 nm = 1.2 × 104 liter/mol cm (Ugi). The concentration of [3H]Ung·Ugi complex was determined from the specific radioactivity of [3H]Ung (10Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and modified by Bennett et al. (12Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nondenaturing polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C essentially as described by Sanderson and Mosbaugh (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with resolving gels containing 18% acrylamide and 0.39%N,N′-methylenebis (acrylamide). The gel was immediately stained using the rapid stain procedure described by Reisner (30Reisner A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and modified by Sanderson and Mosbaugh (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing polyacrylamide tube gel electrophoresis was conducted using the same components in the resolving gel (9 × 0.6 cm diameter) and stacking gel (1 cm) as described above. Following electrophoresis the resolving gel was either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or sliced horizontally into 3.1-mm sections, placed into scintillation vials, dehydrated overnight, and solubilized in 500 μl of H2O2 at 55 °C for 24–36 h as described by Sanderson and Mosbaugh (19Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After complete solubilization, 5 ml of Formula 989 fluor was added and3H and 35S radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectrometry. All of the wild type and mutant Ugi protein samples were concentrated to 7–18 mg/ml and dialyzed against NMR buffer containing 25 mm deuterated Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 100 mm NaCl, at pH 7.0. NOESY experiments were carried out using a 150-ms mixing time at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. The spectral width in each dimension was 7500 Hz. The final pulse in the NOESY experiment was replaced with a watergate gradient pulse sequence and also a gradient pulse before each equilibration delay. The watergate sequence used a 1-ms z-direction gradient followed by a 2.2-ms selective shaped pulse for water and a 180° pulse followed by another 2.2-ms selective shaped pulse and another 1-ms z-direction gradient. A weak z-direction gradient was applied in the first half of t1 and its negative applied in the second half of t1. Each NOESY experiment had 512 increments in t1 with an acquisition time of 137 ms. Each NOESY spectrum was transferred into 1024 × 4096 points and weighted using shifted Gaussians along each dimension. Samples of [13C,15N]Ugi were complexed with unlabeled Ung as described previously (14Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16840-16847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All of the NMR spectra were obtained with the sample at 30 °C using a Varian Unityplus 400 spectrometer equipped with a Nalorac ID400 probe (31Kessler H. Seip S. Croasman W.R. Carlson R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2020226198,"Abstract We have identified two distinct cDNAs encoding the α-subunit of pig heart succinyl-CoA synthetase. The derived amino acid sequence of one of these, PHα57, is highly similar to the α-subunit of the rat liver precursor enzyme. The second cDNA, PHα108, was identical throughout its sequence with PHα57 except for a stretch of 108 nucleotides which replaced a 57 nucleotide sequence in PHα57. Coexpression of either α-subunit cDNA with a common pig heart β-subunit cDNA produced isozymes with GTP-specific enzyme activity. The enzyme produced by the combination of PHα57 and the β-subunit cDNA resembled the “native” enzyme purified from pig heart tissue. In contrast, the expressed enzyme from the combination with PHα108 was clearly distinguishable from the native enzyme by, for example, hydroxyapatite chromatography. Moreover, it was now apparent that this isoform had been observed in previous preparations of the native enzyme, but always in very low amounts and, thus, disregarded. We have shown further that the two mRNA transcripts arise from a single gene and are generated by mutually exclusive splicing. The production of the PHα108 message involves the use of a non-canonical splice site pair, AT-AA. Finally, we provide evidence for tissue specific regulation in the splicing of the PHα108 message."
https://openalex.org/W2038553628,"Human growth hormone (hGH) stimulates somatogenic and lactogenic actions through the GH and prolactin (PRL) receptors, respectively. In contrast, non-primate GHs stimulate only somatotropic action. Phe44, of the human GH sequence is present in all hormones stimulating lactogenic action and absent in all hormones stimulating only somatotropic action. We speculate that the presence of Phe44 is a feature necessary for specifying lactogenic activity. In this report, the role of Phe44 was investigated by its deletion or substitution with alanine or leucine. Deletion of Phe44 or substitution with leucine did not significantly change the structure of hGH as determined by circular dichroism, absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopies. In contrast, substitution of alanine perturbed the structure. Deletion of Phe44 reduced binding affinity for the lactogenic receptor, resulting in a reduced activation. Substitution with either alanine or leucine partially restored lactogenic receptor binding affinity, which correlated with the hormones' activity in the Nb2 rat lymphoma cells. All the recombinant hGHs had similar somatotropic activities in FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hGH receptor. These data indicate that the hydrophobic side chain of Phe44 is required for lactogenic receptor binding and activation but is unnecessary for somatotropic action.

Growth hormones (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; hGH, human growth hormone; PRL, prolactin; hPRL, human prolactin.1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; hGH, human growth hormone; PRL, prolactin; hPRL, human prolactin.are members of the GH/prolactin (PRL) family which promote a diverse group of biochemical and physiological processes (1Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through the GH receptor (2Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The GH receptor is a member of a subclass of the hematopoietic receptor superfamily which includes the receptors for cytokines; PRL; interlukins 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7; and erythropoietin (3Kossiakoff A.A. Somers W. Ultsch M. Andow K. Muller Y.A. De Vos A.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic receptors each have a single transmembrane sequence with structural similarities in their extracellular domains. Generally, receptors in this superfamily are activated by ligand-induced homo- or heterodimerization resulting in activation of the JAK family of kinases (2Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). GH activates its receptor by homodimerization of two receptor molecules; each receptor binds distinct sites on the hormone (5Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Primate GHs are unique to the GH family because they bind and activate PRL receptors as well as the GH receptors. PRLs are not somatotropic (6Sinha Y.N. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) while non-primate GHs are not lactogenic. Human GH (hGH) is a well characterized molecule to study structure-function relationships because of the availability of multiple crystal structures (7de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A.

The three-dimensional structures of hGH bound to the hGH receptor in a 1:2 complex (7de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) or the hPRL receptor in a 1:1 complex (8Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) have been reported. Association with either receptor at site 1 buries similar surfaces of hGH while the overall three-dimensional structures of hGH extracted from these complexes can be nearly superimposed (8Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), suggesting that association with either receptor does not induce large changes in conformation. Alanine scanning of hGH residues that contact either the hGH or hPRL receptor has identified two overlapping sets of residues critical for providing the free energy necessary to facilitate binding. These data sets have been used to engineer variants of hPRL (11Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and human placental lactogen (14Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10982-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to bind the hGH receptor at site 1 with affinities close to that of wild-type hGH. These studies have stressed the energetically important contributions necessary for binding either receptor at site 1. Yet, other residues that are not energetically important may be structurally important in site 1 binding to either somatotropic or lactogenic receptors. Phe44 of hGH is one residue which may be of structural importance in site 1 binding to somatotropic or lactogenic receptors. Phe44 is located in the middle of mini-helix 1 and is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with leucine 157 and tyrosines 160 and 164 of the amino terminus of helix 4. This mini-helix is buried at the site 1 receptor interface upon binding to either receptor with a significant 2.5 Å movement toward the amino terminus of helix 4 when hGH is bound to the lactogenic receptor rather than the somatotropic receptor (3Kossiakoff A.A. Somers W. Ultsch M. Andow K. Muller Y.A. De Vos A.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons of the PRLs and GHs found Phe44 to be present in all lactogenic hormones but absent in all non-primate GHs, suggesting that Phe44 may be required for lactogenic action even though it does not contact either receptor. To examine the requirement of Phe44 for lactogenic and somatotropic actions in hGH, we have deleted it. We hypothesize this deletion will mimic non-primate GHs, characterized by somatotropic activity without lactogenic activity. The deletion of Phe44may affect the actions of hGH by altering the relative helical positions of the residues of mini-helix 1 that contact the receptor or by removal of a necessary hydrophobic side chain. Therefore, the positional effects were studied by replacement of Phe44with alanine or the more hydrophobic leucine. An f1origin of replication was inserted at a unique ClaI site in pT7-7 (kindly provided by S. Tabor, Harvard Medial School, Boston, MA). The negative strand pT7-7 phagemid was used for cloning, production of single-stranded DNA, and expression of hGH. Escherichia colistrains DH5α, RZ1032 (dut−, ung−), and BL21(DE3) were used for cloning, uridine-substituted single-stranded DNA production, and protein expression, respectively. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from a human pituitary (Cooperative Human Tissue Network) and cDNA was prepared. A polymerase chain reaction amplified the coding sequence for mature hGH using the following 5′ and 3′ primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CCCCGAATTCGAAGGAGATATACATATG TTCCCGACTATCCCGCTTTCCAGGCCTTTTGACAACC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CCCCAAGCTTGGCTAGAAGCCACAGCTGCC-3′. The 5′ primer was designed to introduce a methionine codon (underlined) at the start of the mature sequence, change the first seven codons to those preferred by bacteria, and add a uniqueNdeI (italics) site encompassing the initiation codon. The 3′ primer introduced a unique HindIII (italics) site following the termination codon (underlined). Amplification products were purified, digested with NdeI and HindIII and the 587-base pair fragment ligated into the pT7-7f(−) phagemid. Products were transformed into DH5α cells, selected by resistance, screened by restriction digests, and confirmed by DNA sequencing (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis was performed by the Kunkel method (16Maciejewski P.M. Peterson F.C. Anderson P.J. Brooks C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27661-27665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to delete Phe44 (ΔPhe44) or replace Phe44 with alanine (F44A) or leucine (F44L). Selection for positive mutants was facilitated by removal of an adjacentPstI site through a primer-introduced translationally silent mutation. Clones were evaluated by restriction digest withPstI. The complete hGH DNA sequence in clones uncut byPstI was determined to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. Purified phagemids containing wild-type, ΔPhe44, F44A, or F44L hGH DNAs were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and transfected clones selected by antibiotic resistance and confirmed by restriction studies. One-liter cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.3 and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Incubation was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell in 50 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm dithiotheritol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of 4.5 murea, 50 mm Tris, and the pH was adjusted to values between 11.0 and 11.5. Inclusion bodies were solubilized for 2 h at room temperature. Solubilized inclusion bodies were clarified by centrifugation and air-oxidized with stirring at 4 °C for 1–2 days. Oxidized protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (four times, 4 liters each). Just prior to purification the pH was adjusted to 9.0 and hGH was purified using DE52 anion exchange resin (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The protein was eluted using a 0–750 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0. Eluted protein was dialyzed into 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate (six times, 4 liters each) and lyophilized. Proteins were evaluated for size and purity by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under either nonreducing or reducing conditions. Protein concentrations were calculated using ε277 nm of a 0.1% solution = 0.82 cm−1 (18Mulkerrin M.G. Cunningham B.C. Cleland J.L. Protein Folding: In Vivo and In Vitro. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 240-253Google Scholar). Absorption, fluorescence, and far-UV circular dichroism spectra were collected at 20 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 150 mmNaCl. Nb2 rat lymphoma cells (19Tanaka T. Shiu R.P. Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Friesen H.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) were maintained and manipulated as described previously (16Maciejewski P.M. Peterson F.C. Anderson P.J. Brooks C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27661-27665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recombinant hGHs stock concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid/copper sulfate assay (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18586) Google Scholar). Stocks were diluted in assay media and added to triplicate wells (96-well plate, Costar, Cambridge, MA) each containing 20,000 Nb2 cells in a final volume of 100 μl with various hGH concentrations. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for 48 h. Proliferation was assessed by a vital dye method with the addition of 10 μl of Alamar Blue (Accumed International, West Lake, OH) per well and continued incubation for 4 h. The oxidation/reduction of Alamar Blue was then evaluated at 570 and 600 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). Absorbances at 570 and 600 nm were used to calculate the percent reduction of the dye that is correlated with cell number (r 2 > 0.99). The percent reduction was then used to calculate an ED50 by a four-parameter fit method (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). FDC-P1 cells containing the hGH receptor were a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 units of interleukin 3/ml, and 10% fetal calf serum (22Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Log phase cells were collected and washed three times with RPMI 1640. Washed cells were resuspended in media devoid of interleukin 3 and returned to the incubator for 24 h prior to the assay. Recombinant hGH stock concentrations were determined as above. Stocks were diluted with interleukin 3-free medium to the desired concentration and added to triplicate wells with 15,000 FDC-P1 cells in a total volume of 100 μl with various hGH concentrations. Plates were gently vortexed and then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for 48 h. Proliferation was assessed as described above. The percent reduction of Alamar Blue was used to calculate an ED50 by a four-parameter fit method (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). hGH was iodinated with Iodogen (Pierce) and carrier-free [125I]iodine to a specific activity of 21 μCi/μg. Binding reactions contained membranes from 2 × 106 cells in 700 μl of Fisher's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, approximately 1.9 ng of125I-hGH and various concentration of recombinant hGHs. Incubations were run for approximately 20 h at room temperature. Membranes were collected by centrifugation and associated125I-hGH measured. Data from competition studies were used to calculate relative affinities by the method of Scatchard (23Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar). Phagemids contained the mature DNA sequence for wild-type hGH with the addition of an initiation methionine. Dideoxy sequencing of the complete wild-type and mutant inserts confirmed the wild-type code (24Martial J.A. Hallewell R.A. Baxter J.D. Goodman H.M. Science. 1979; 205: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and the desired mutations. Wild-type and mutant hGHs were expressed and purified with yields of approximately 40 mg/liter of fermentation. The proteins co-migrated with National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NIH) hGH on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and were observed to be greater than 95% homologous (Fig. 1). Co-migration of recombinant proteins with NIH hGH on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels suggested that all proteins were folded to produce correct structures. A small portion of several preparations formed dimers that were evident on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The circular dichroism spectra of wild-type and mutant hGHs were very similar in shape (Fig. 2). ΔPhe44 and F44L hGHs had molar ellipticity values at 222 nm of 93 and 100% when compared with wild-type hGH, suggesting insignificant differences resulting from these mutations. In contrast, substitution of alanine at position 44 induced a 50% reduction of the 222-nm signal. Absorbance spectra (Fig. 3) of the wild-type and ΔPhe44 hGHs overlay each other. Replacement of Phe44 with leucine or alanine increased absorption at 277 nm (see raw data inset in Fig. 3). When the data are normalized for absorption at 277 nm, F44L and F44A have an increased absorption in the 250–260-nm region. The shape and maxima of the fluorescence spectra (excitation 285 nm) (Fig. 4) for the wild-type, ΔPhe44, and F44L hGHs were similar. In contrast, F44A hGH had a reduced quantum yield (Fig. 4, inset). In the FDC-P1 somatotropic assay (Fig. 5, Table I) the wild-type, ΔPhe44, F44L, and F44A hGHs had ED50 values that varied over a range of 2.9-fold between 187 and 531 pm. The assays had an average coefficient of variation of 5.6%. Wild-type and F44L hGH appeared to be indistinguishable from each other, while ΔPhe44 and F44A hGH had similar activities. When the dose-response curves for these assays are compared, the maximal cellular growth responses were similar. A pituitary isolate of hGH (NIH) had an ED50 of 78 pm. The F44A hGH was the least potent preparation with an increased ED50 of 531 pm.Table IED50 and relative Kd values for lactogenic and somatotropic receptorsHormoneED50 values for biological actionRelative binding affinitiesSomatotrotropicLactogenicRelative loss of biological activity1-bCalculated by dividing the ratios to wild type of lactogenic by somatotropic activity.SomatotropicLactogenicRelative loss of binding affinity1-cCalculated by dividing the ratios to wild-type of lactogenic by somatotropic binding.Mean ± S.D.Ratio1-aCalculated by dividing the wild-type value.Mean ± S.D.Ratio1-aCalculated by dividing the wild-type value.RelativeKdRatio1-aCalculated by dividing the wild-type value.RelativeKdRatio1-aCalculated by dividing the wild-type value.pmpmnmnmWild type187 ± 111.08.0 ± 0.341.01.00.611.00.431.01.0ΔF44464 ± 262.51746 ± 90218871.52.55412650F44A531 ± 322.9546 ± 2469241.52.5388835F44L226 ± 131.2158 ± 8.020171.11.84.29.85.41-a Calculated by dividing the wild-type value.1-b Calculated by dividing the ratios to wild type of lactogenic by somatotropic activity.1-c Calculated by dividing the ratios to wild-type of lactogenic by somatotropic binding. Open table in a new tab The lactogenic activity of the recombinant hGHs was assessed in the Nb2 biological assay (Fig. 6, Table I) where the average coefficient of variation was 5.0%. Wild-type hGH had an ED50 of 8.0 pm, compared with a 5.5 pm ED50 for hGH isolated from the pituitary (NIH). Elimination of Phe44 severely reduced the biological activity of hGH increasing the ED50 218-fold to 1,746 pm. Replacement of Phe44 with alanine increased the ED50 to 546 pm, while replacement with the more hydrophobic leucine gave an ED50 of 158 pm. Addition of sufficient hormone showed a equivalent maximal response for each mutant when compared with wild-type hGH. The relative abilities of wild-type and mutant hGHs to bind the lactogenic (Nb2 cells containing the short form of the receptor) or somatotropic (FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hGH receptor) receptors were measured. The affinity of wild-type hGH was 0.43 nm and 0.61 nm for lactogenic and somatotropic receptors, respectively (Table I). Deletion of Phe44 reduced the relative binding to the lactogenic receptor by 126-fold, while reducing the affinity for the somatotropic receptor by only 2.5-fold. As in bioassays, replacement of Phe44 with alanine or the more hydrophobic leucine increased the abilities of these mutants to bind the lactogenic receptor. These mutations had minimal effects in the somatotropic receptor assays. When the loss of lactogenic action relative to somatotropic action for receptor binding affinity and activity (Table I) were correlated for each hormone, the correlation between binding and activity was high (r 2 = 0.765), suggesting an association between binding and activity. Deletion of Phe44 in methionyl-hGH reduced lactogenic activity and receptor binding affinity but retained somatotropic activity and receptor binding affinity when compared with the wild-type hGH (Table I). Replacement of Phe44 with alanine or leucine provides increased binding to the lactogenic receptor and lactogenic action with increasing bulk and hydrophobic character at position 44. These studies demonstrate that Phe44 is a necessary structural feature for lactogenic action, even though Phe44does not contact the either receptor when bound at site 1. Deletion of Phe44 eliminates the protein backbone in this position and rotates the adjacent portions of mini-helix 1 approximately 100° relative to each other. Replacement of Phe44 with alanine or leucine retains the periodic relationships of residues within mini-helix 1 while providing side chains with differing degrees of hydrophobic character. These replacements produced hormones with high somatotropic activity but lactogenic activities intermediate between ΔPhe44 and the wild-type hGH. These mutants demonstrate a correlation between increasing hydrophobic character at position 44 and the ability to induce lactogenic action. These results suggest the important structural feature at position 44 is the presence of a large hydrophobic residue and not the relative orientation of residues in mini-helix 1. Phe44 contributes to a hydrophobic pocket composed of leucine 157 and tyrosines 160 and 164 located at the amino terminus of helix 4 (25Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). hGH assumes two slightly different conformations of this hydrophobic cluster when bound to either the somatotropic or lactogenic receptor (Fig. 7). Mini-helix 1 is more closely packed in the hydrophobic cluster when bound to the lactogenic receptor. We speculate that elimination of Phe44 disrupts the hydrophobic packing prohibiting the lactogenic conformation which manifests as a reduction of lactogenic receptor binding affinity. The reduced receptor binding affinity is reflected by an increased ED50 for biological activity. Cunningham and Wells (13Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of residues 32–46, inclusive of Mini-helix 1, reduced the affinity for the lactogenic receptor by 6.1-fold. This modest change in affinity suggests that these residues are not crucial for lactogenic receptor binding. In contrast, our data indicate that the elimination of Phe44decreases the affinity for the lactogenic receptor by 126-fold (Table I). While elimination of mini-helix 1 obviates the need for hydrophobic packing of mini-helix 1; the presence of mini-helix 1 requires appropriate hydrophobic packing. Phe44 appears to be critical for packing hGH in a conformation compatible with lactogenic receptor binding. Comparison of the somatotropic bioassay data indicates that all mutant hGHs have similar biological activities. This is interesting considering the significant changes observed in the circular dichroism, absorbance and fluorescence spectra for F44A hGH from that of the other proteins. Changes in fluorescence and UV absorption spectra suggest increased hydration of the aromatic residues but do not indicate a significant perturbation of the overall structure. In contrast, the circular dichroism spectrum of F44A hGH suggests a 50% loss in helical content. However, the biological assay data indicates that the overall structure is either intact or is able to be recovered during receptor binding as demonstrated by the minimal 2.9-fold increase in the somatotropic ED50 produced by alanine substitution. The significant decrease observed in the 222 nm molar ellipticity of F44A hGH is consistent with the reduction reported when wild-type bGH is reduced (26Holzman T.F. Brems D.N. Dougherty Jr., J.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6907-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, detection of free sulfhydryl groups using Ellman's reagent (27Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 85: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21374) Google Scholar) indicated that less than 5.0% of all disulfide bridges were broken in the F44A mutant, a value similar to that observed with wild-type hGH. At this time, no plausible explanation can be offered for the altered spectroscopic properties of F44A hGH. In conclusion, deletion of Phe44 from mini-helix 1 was spectroscopically indistinguishable from wild-type hGH. This deletion essentially eliminated lactogenic action, while minimally affecting somatotropic action. Further, the ability of the deletion mutant to stimulate lactogenic action could be recovered by introduction of increasingly hydrophobic residues. Mini-helix 1 of hGH is irrelevant to lactogenic or somatotropic receptor binding at site 1, but the interaction with the first receptor functions to position mini helix 1 (containing Phe44) to induce subtle changes in the protein scaffolding of the hormone. We speculate these receptor-induced structural changes display the dimeric complex in an orientation that allows binding by a second homologous receptor."

We report here our evidence that thymidine transport across cytoplasmic membranes in temperature-sensitive dnaA mutants is greatly decreased at a permissive temperature for growth of the mutants. Complementation analysis with a plasmid containing the wild type dnaA gene and P1 phage-mediated transduction confirmed that mutations in thednaA gene were responsible for the phenotype. A low level of nucleoside transport in the dnaA mutant was specific for thymidine; transport activities for other nucleosides were much the same as those in wild type cells. Membrane vesicles prepared from thednaA mutant showed much the same activity of thymidine transport as did those from the wild type cells. No significant difference in the activity of thymidine kinase, which is known to facilitate thymidine transport, was seen between the mutant and the wild type cells. An increase in the pool of dTTP, a negative regulator for thymidine kinase, was observed in the dnaA mutant. Based on these observations, we suggest that inhibition of thymidine transport in dnaA mutants is caused by increases in the dTTP pool.

Initiation of DNA replication is considered to be regulated by alteration in the activity of DnaA protein through adenine nucleotide binding, membrane binding, and other factors (3Sekimizu K.

In addition, DnaA protein may regulate cellular processes so that they are coupled with DNA replication (13Mizushima T. Tomura A. Shinpuku T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5544-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA protein negatively regulates expression of various genes, including the dnaA gene, through specific binding to DnaA boxes located at the 5′-upstream regulatory region or coding region of these genes (12Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We recently reported an activity of DnaA protein on DNA topology in vitro through its nonspecific binding to DNA (14Mizushima T. Katayama T. Sekimizu K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11512-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and alteration in DNA supercoiling in dnaA mutants (15Mizushima T. Tanino J. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This alteration in DNA supercoiling may profoundly affect cell physiology (13Mizushima T. Tomura A. Shinpuku T. Miki T.

Therefore, studies on functions of DnaA protein other than that as initiator of chromosomal DNA replication seem warranted if one is to understand the molecular basis for the cooperation of DNA replication with other processes. Thymidine transport systems are ubiquitously present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Pulse-labeling experimentation with radiolabeled thymidine has been accepted widely as a method of determining the level of DNA synthesis in cells. Little attention, however, has been directed to whether the transport activity of this nucleoside can be altered experimentally. Genetic and biochemical studies using E. coli identified two different transport systems for nucleosides, termed the NupC and the NupG systems (16Komatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Mygind B. Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Munch-Petersen A.

Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleoside transport activity plus DNA synthesis seem to be needed for related activity to occur. We report here the influence of the dnaA mutation in thymidine transport in E. coli; thymidine transport across the cytoplasmic membranes in the dnaA mutants was inhibited drastically, which in turn suggests a role for DnaA protein in the regulation of nucleoside transport. A putative mechanism for the inhibition of thymidine transport in dnaA mutants is discussed. All strains of E. coli used in the present experiments are listed in Table I.

The suspension was spread on LB agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 12 h. Colonies were counted, and viable cell numbers were determined. Exponentially growingE. coli cells in LB medium were harvested periodically by centrifugation and were suspended in 300 μl of 0.9% NaCl. Toluene (10 μl) was added to the suspension, which was then mixed vigorously. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (24Kubista M. Akerman B. Norden B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4545-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) solution was then added to the suspension to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Fluorescence by λ-excitation (346 nm) and λ-emission (452 nm) was measured. Exponentially growing E. coli cells in LB medium were treated with nalidixic acid (200 μg/ml, final concentration) at 37 °C for 10 min. Radiolabeled nucleosides were added to the culture, and incubation was run at 37 °C for 20 s. Transport reaction of radiolabeled nucleosides into cells was terminated by adding unlabeled nucleosides at a final concentration of 50 mm. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore), radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter, and the amount of nucleoside transported into cells was calculated (19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of membrane vesicles from thednaA46 mutant and wild type cells and examination of their activities for nucleosides transport were done as described by Munch-Petersen et al. (19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, exponentially growing cells in LB medium were harvested when the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.8. Vesicles were prepared according to Kaback (25Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar), omitting the final sucrose gradient centrifugation. Protein determination of the membrane vesicles was done as described (26Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.1m MgSO4, 0.15 mm phenazine methosulfate, 30 mm ascorbate, and 4 μmradiolabeled nucleoside. The transport reaction was initiated by addition of membrane vesicles to the mixtures; the reaction was performed at 20 °C for 4 min and was terminated by adding 50 mm unlabeled nucleoside. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore), and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of nucleosides transported into membrane vesicles was calculated (19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of thymidine kinase in crude extracts from the dnaA46 mutant and wild type cells was measured, as described elsewhere (27Saito H. Tomioka H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1863-1870PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were collected by centrifugation when the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.8. The precipitates were washed with buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, then were suspended in the same buffer. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for the assay. Protein in the extracts was determined according to Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm[14C]thymidine (53 mCi/mmol). Crude extracts were incubated in the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by boiling the samples. Aliquots (10 μl) were spotted on DEAE-cellulose paper (Whatman DE81), which was washed with 1 mm ammonium formate and 100% ethanol. The radioactivity remaining was measured in a liquid scintillation counter, and the amount of dTMP was calculated, as described (27Saito H. Tomioka H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1863-1870PubMed Google Scholar). The dTTP pools in the dnaA46 mutant and wild type strain were determined as described (29Lindberg U. Skoog L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) but with some modifications. Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation when the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.8. The precipitates were subjected to extraction with 0.3n HClO4, and pH values of the extracts were adjusted to 5 by KOH solution containing 0.1 m EDTA, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. The amounts of dTTP in the supernatants were determined, as described (29Lindberg U. Skoog L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 0.5 μm[α-32P]dATP, 1.5 ng of the large fragment of DNA polymerase I (Takara), 600 ng of poly(dA-dT) (Sigma) pretreated with DNase I, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 5 mmMgCl2. The reaction of DNA synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by chilling on ice followed by adding 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were passed through glass fiber filters. The amount of radioactivity on the filter was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of dTTP was determined as described (29Lindberg U. Skoog L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The pools of other nucleotides in the dnaA46 mutant and wild type cells were determined as described (30Neuhard J. Thomassen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells in TG medium (31Echols H. Garen A. Garen S. Torriani A. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) containing 640 μmKH2PO4 and [32P]orthophosphate (3–4 μCi/mmol) at 37 °C were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore), when the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.4. The filters were subjected to extraction with 0.3 nHClO4, and pH values of the extracts were adjusted to 5 by KOH solution containing 0.1 m EDTA, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Unlabeled dNTP and NTP (50 nm) were added to the supernatant as standard samples and were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates followed by soaking in 100% methanol for 5 min. Chromatography was performed in two dimensions; first dimension, 2 m LiCl, 2 macetic acid (to start line) followed by 2.5 m LiCl, 2m acetic acid (to 15 cm); second dimension, 0.75m LiCl, 7.5% boric acid (to 2 cm) followed by 0.75m LiCl, 10% boric acid (to 15 cm). The plates were autoradiographed, and each spot was identified using authentic nucleotides (dNTP and NTP). Quantitative analysis of the separated compounds was done as described previously (30Neuhard J. Thomassen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions of a dnaA46 mutant (KS1003) growing at 37 °C was practically nil (data not shown), and this inhibition was never evident when the cells were grown at 28 °C (data not shown). Growth of KS1003 (dnaA46) at 37 °C monitored by colony formation assay was not significantly different from that of the wild type strain, KS1001 (Fig. 1 A). Generation times of the mutant and the wild type strain at 37 °C were 31 and 39 min, respectively. We also examined the rate of DNA synthesis in thednaA46 mutant. As shown in Fig. 1 B, much the same rate of synthesis of DNA was observed in the mutant as in the wild type cells. Thus, inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in the dnaA mutant cannot be explained by a decrease in the rate of synthesis of DNA; rather the inhibition of thymidine transport in the mutant may occur. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions in the wild type cells was inhibited (less than 1% of control) by pretreatment of the cells with 200 μg/ml nalidixic acid for 10 min (data not shown). Thus, when examining the activity of thymidine transport in cells, we preincubated the cells with nalidixic acid so that the effect of the DNA synthesis reaction on the transport reaction would be eliminated. The activity of thymidine transport in KS1001 growing at 37 °C was most apparent at a late stage of log phage of cell growth (Fig. 2). On the contrary, low activity of thymidine transport was observed in KS1003 growing at 37 °C, at the corresponding stage (Fig. 2). The Km value for the thymidine transport in wild type cells was 1 μm (data not shown), and the transport experiments in Fig. 2 were done in the presence of 15 μm thymidine. When cells were grown at 28 °C, no significant difference in the activity of thymidine transport was observed between KS1001 and KS1003 (data not shown). These results suggest that the inhibition of incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions of the dnaA mutants growing at 37 °C is caused by a decrease in the activity of thymidine transport in the mutant. To confirm that the dnaA mutation is responsible for the inhibition of thymidine transport in KS1003, we transformed the strain with pHB10S, a plasmid carrying the wild type dnaA gene (21Shinpuku T. Mizushima T. Guo L. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,22Mizushima T. Shinpuku T. Katayama H. Kataoka K. Guo L. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 212-215PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of thymidine transport in the transformants recovered to much the same level as that in wild type cells (Fig. 2), whereas the recovery was nil when the cells were transformed with the vector pBR322 (data not shown). Transformation of the wild type strain with pHB10S did not affect the transport activity (data not shown). We then asked whether the phenotype of the low level of thymidine transport in KS1003 would be cotransducible with the temperature-sensitive growth of this mutant in P1 phage-mediated transduction experiments. In the dnaA46 mutant, Tn10 with a tetracycline-resistant marker is located at a position close to thednaA gene. P1 phages proliferated in mutant cells, transduced into W3110 cells, and the transductants were selected on tetracycline-containing plates (21Shinpuku T. Mizushima T. Guo L. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Mizushima T. Shinpuku T. Katayama H. Kataoka K. Guo L. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 212-215PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivities of cell growth and activities of thymidine transport were examined. Of the 53 independent transductants, 7 showed a high temperature-resistant growth and a high activity of thymidine transport, whereas all of the remaining 46 showed temperature-sensitive growth and a low activity of thymidine transport. No transductant showed either a high temperature-resistant growth and a low activity of thymidine transport or a temperature-sensitive growth and a high activity of thymidine transport. Thus, both phenotypes (a temperature-sensitive growth and a low activity of thymidine transport) were cotransducible. From the results of plasmid complementation and P1 phage-mediated transduction, it seems clear that the dnaA46 mutation is responsible for the low activity of thymidine transport in the KS1003 strain. Temperature-sensitive dnaA mutants have been isolated and the mutations identified (12Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We examined the activity of thymidine transport in several other dnaA mutants. All dnaAmutants tested showed lower activity of thymidine transport than did the wild type strain (Fig. 3). The activity of thymidine transport in the dnaA204 mutant was more than half that in the wild type cells, whereas the activity in thednaA46 mutant was less than one-tenth that in the wild type cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the extent of inhibition of the transport showed an allele specificity. Plasmid complementation with pHB10S confirmed that mutations in the dnaA gene are responsible for the phenotype of all of these mutants (data not shown). Genetic and biochemical studies revealed that two transport proteins, NupC and NupG, play a major role in the nucleoside transport in E. coli (16Komatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Mygind B. Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 89: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes encoding the proteins, the nupC and nupG genes, have been identified (19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA protein regulates the expression of a number of genes through specific binding to DnaA boxes (12Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) or through other mechanisms (13Mizushima T. Tomura A. Shinpuku T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5544-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mizushima T. Katayama T. Sekimizu K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11512-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Mizushima T. Tanino J. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that inhibition of thymidine transport in dnaA mutants may relate to contribution of DnaA protein to expression of the nupC or the nupG gene would need to be ruled out. If such is indeed the case, in the presence of nupC or nupGmutation, the dnaA mutation should not affect thymidine transport. The dnaA46 mutation was then transduced into anupC or nupG mutant (ME8923 and ME8935, respectively) by P1 phage-mediated transduction, and the activity of thymidine transport in the transductants (KY1001 and KY1002, respectively) was examined. Even in the presence of the nupCor nupG mutation, the dnaA46 mutation caused inhibition of thymidine transport (Fig. 4), indicating that the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46 mutant cannot be explained by the effect of the dnaA46 mutation on expression of either the nupC or the nupG gene. As thymidine is transported through both NupC and NupG systems (16Komatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Mygind B. Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 89: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one would need to consider the possibility that these two systems are inhibited simultaneously in dnaA mutants. Because the double mutant of the nupC and nupGgenes showed low activity for thymidine transport (data not shown), we could not examine the effect of the double mutation of thenupC and nupG genes on inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA mutant. It was shown previously that the NupC system can transport adenosine, cytidine, and thymidine but not guanosine, whereas the NupG system can transport all nucleosides (16Komatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Mygind B. Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 89: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3730-3737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if the effect of the dnaA mutation on thymidine transport is caused by a decreased expression of both thenupC and nupG genes, transport of other nucleosides should also be inhibited in the dnaA mutants as in the case with thymidine. As shown in Fig. 5, transport activities for adenosine, guanosine, and cytidine in the dnaA46 mutant were much the same as those in the wild type cells, indicating that inhibition of nucleoside transport in the dnaA46 mutant is specific for thymidine. Therefore, the inhibition of thymidine transport in thednaA46 mutant cannot be explained by inhibition of both NupC and NupG systems in the mutant. The effect of the nupC or nupGmutation and nucleoside specificity on inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46 mutant suggests that alteration in the NupC and NupG systems is not involved in the inhibition. Because unknown transport systems other than the NupC and NupG systems may contribute to the inhibition of thymidine transport in thednaA mutant, we prepared membrane vesicles from thednaA46 mutant and wild type cells and examined their transport activities for nucleosides in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6, the activity for thymidine transport of membrane vesicles prepared from the dnaA46mutant grown at 37 °C was slightly higher than from the wild type cells. Inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46mutant apparently cannot be reproduced with membrane vesicles in vitro. We also observed significant transport activities for other nucleosides in membrane vesicles from the dnaA46 mutant, comparable to that from the wild type cells (data not shown). Thus, a mechanism other than alteration in transport machinery in membranes is involved in inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46mutant. Components in the cytosol, which had been removed during preparation of membrane vesicles, seem to be responsible for the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA mutant. We assumed that these unidentified components would specifically affect thymidine transport because inhibition of nucleoside transport in thednaA mutant was observed only in case of thymidine. It was reported that thymidine kinase is necessary for thymidine transport but not so for other nucleosides (32Dube D.K. Horwitz M.S.Z. Loeb L.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 99: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine and facilitates thymidine transport into cells (32Dube D.K. Horwitz M.S.Z. Loeb L.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 99: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the dnaA mutation decreases the activity of thymidine kinase. We then compared the activity of thymidine kinase in a crude extract from the dnaA46 mutant with that from the wild type cells. As shown in Fig. 7, a significant amount of thymidine kinase activity, comparable to that from the wild type cells, was observed in the crude extract from thednaA46 mutant. The activity of thymidine kinase is negatively regulated by dTTP (33Okazaki R. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 275-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we examined thymidine kinase activity in the crude extracts, the samples were diluted to more than 1,000 times before being subjected to assay (Fig. 7). Therefore, the effect on the enzyme activity of dTTP in cells would not reflect the result shown in Fig. 7. To rule out the possibility that the activity of thymidine kinase was inhibited by a higher concentration of dTTP in the dnaA mutant, the result being the inhibition of thymidine transport, we compared the dTTP pool in the dnaA46 mutant with that in wild type cells usingin vitro DNA synthesis (29Lindberg U. Skoog L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, the dTTP pool in the dnaA46mutant at 37 °C was four times higher than that in the wild type cells. At 28 °C no significant difference in the dTTP pool was observed between the dnaA46 mutant and wild type cells (Fig. 8). We also examined the pools of other nucleotides in the mutant growing at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells were continuously labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in TG medium (31Echols H. Garen A. Garen S. Torriani A. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We confirmed that transport of [3H]thymidine was indeed inhibited in the dnaA46 mutant growing at 37 °C (data not shown). Mixtures of nucleotides were prepared from cells and analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. The dTTP pool in thednaA46 mutant was three times higher than that in the wild type cell in this assay (data not shown). The pools of other nucleotides in the mutant were much the same as those in the wild type cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46 mutant is caused by increases in the dTTP pool. To test this notion we examined the effect of an increase in the dTTP pool created by a factor unrelated to DnaA function. We examined the effect of overproduction of thymidylate synthase of E. colion the dTTP pool and on thymidine transport. Introduction of pASTS1 plasmid, E. coli thymidylate synthase overexpression plasmid (23Iwakura M. Kokubu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), caused a two times higher concentration of dTTP (data not shown) and one-third lower activity of thymidine transport (Fig. 9) than seen in cells transformed with the vector pBR322. This result suggests that the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46 mutant is at least partly caused by an increase in the dTTP pool. The possibility that mechanisms other than an increase in the dTTP pool may be involved in inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46 mutant would need to be ruled out. We obtained evidence that thymidine transport in temperature-sensitive dnaA mutants was drastically inhibited. Experiments on nucleoside specificity for the inhibition of transport, genetic analysis using nupC and nupGmutants, and measurement of transport activity of thymidine in membrane vesicles all support the thesis that the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA mutants is not caused by modulation of transport machinery in membranes. There was a 3- or 4-foldincrease of the dTTP pool in the dnaA46 mutant. Based on previous observations that dTTP negatively regulates the activity of thymidine kinase (33Okazaki R. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 275-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that thymidine kinase is essential for thymidine transport across the cytoplasmic membrane (32Dube D.K. Horwitz M.S.Z. Loeb L.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 99: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we propose that the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaAmutants is caused by an increase in the dTTP pool. Studies on the effect of overexpression of thymidylate synthase on the dTTP pool and the thymidine transport supported this proposal. To monitor DNA synthesis in cells, one usually measures the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions. Some growth conditions have been reported to affect the dTTP pool in cells (30Neuhard J. Thomassen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results show that attention should be directed to alteration in the dTTP pool when pulse labeling cells with radiolabeled thymidine for examination of DNA synthesis. How the dnaA mutations increase the dTTP pool remains unknown. Because dTTP is one of the substrates of DNA synthesis, the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by the dnaA mutations seems to increase the dTTP pool. However, our data seem to rule this out. The rates of growth and of DNA synthesis of the dnaA46mutant growing at 37 °C were indistinguishable from findings in the wild type cells. It was reported that the dTTP pool in cells was not altered when DNA synthesis was inhibited in the presence of nalidixic acid (30Neuhard J. Thomassen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Actually, in our assay for the transport of thymidine, cells were pretreated with nalidixic acid. Filpula and Fuchs reported that the activity of RDP reductase 1The abbreviation used is: RDP reductase, ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. in the temperature-sensitive dnaA mutants was increased when the incubation temperature was shifted to 42 °C, a nonpermissive temperature (34Filpula D. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 107-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently found that this enzyme was overproduced in the dnaA46 mutant growing at 37 °C. 2A. Ohba, T. Mizushima, and K. Sekimizu, unpublished results. Because RDP reductase catalyzes the synthesis of dUDP and dCDP from UDP and CDP, respectively (35M⊘llgaard H. Neuhard J. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides, and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press, London1983: 149-198Google Scholar), and because dTTP is synthesized de novofrom dUDP and dCDP (35M⊘llgaard H. Neuhard J. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides, and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press, London1983: 149-198Google Scholar), the possibility that the induction of RDP reductase in the dnaA mutant at 37 °C causes increases in the dTTP pool would need attention. The following evidence suggests that this notion can indeed be ruled out. First, the decrease in pool size in the dnaA mutants is specific for dTTP. The overproduction of RDP reductase should increase pool sizes of all four deoxyribonucleotides. Second, the dnaA46 mutant carrying thethyA mutation showed dnaA46mutation-dependent inhibition of thymidine transport (data not shown). The thyA mutant cannot synthesize dTTP de novo (36Belfort M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1858-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Belfort M. Maley G.F. Pedersen-Lane J. Maley F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4914-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, if the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA mutant is indeed caused by increases in the dTTP pool resulting from a high level of RDP reductase activity, the inhibition of thymidine transport by the dnaA mutation would not be observed in the thyA mutant. Therefore, the induction of RDP reductase may not explain the inhibition of thymidine transport in the dnaA46 mutant. DnaA protein, the initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in E. coli, plays a key role in regulating DNA replication. Our observations suggest that DnaA protein is also involved in nucleoside transport. DnaA protein may have an important role in the coupling of DNA replication with nucleotide metabolism, which provides substrates of DNA synthesis. We thank Dr. Y.

Phosphoenzyme formation from Pi in the Ca2+-ATPase (reversal of hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate) was almost completely inhibited by the modification with CHD. Tight binding of F− and Mg2+ and high affinity binding of vanadate in the presence of Mg2+, either of which produces a transition state analog for phosphoenzyme formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex, were also markedly inhibited. In contrast, phosphoenzyme formation from acetyl phosphate in the forward reaction was unaffected. The enzyme was appreciably protected by tight binding of F− and Mg2+ or by high affinity binding of vanadate in the presence of Mg2+, but not by the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 alone or 150 mm Pi alone, against the CHD-induced inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation from Pi. Peptide mapping of the tryptic digests, detection of peptides containing CHD-modified arginyl residues with Girard's reagent T, sequencing, and mass spectrometry showed that Arg-198 was a single major residue protected by tight binding of F− and Mg2+ against the modification with CHD. These results indicate that modification of Arg-198 with CHD is responsible for at least a part (the portion reduced by the transition state analogs) of the CHD-induced inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation from Pi and suggest that Arg-198 is located in or close to the catalytic site in the transition state for phosphoenzyme formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex.

Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes Ca2+ transport coupled to ATP hydrolysis (2Hasselbach W.

The enzyme is activated by Ca2+ binding to the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites, and then the γ-phosphoryl group of Mg·ATP bound to the ATP binding site is transferred to Asp-351 (1Brandl C.J.

A subsequent conformational change of the EP results in Ca2+release to the lumen (9Champeil P. Guillain F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7623-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, the EP is hydrolyzed to form Pi and the dephosphoenzyme. Acetyl phosphate also serves as a substrate through EP formation (10Friedman Z. Makinose M. FEBS Lett. 1970; 11: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Pucell A. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheEP can be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ by reversal of the late step of the catalytic cycle (12Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3163-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This EP formation occurs through a magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex that is formed by random binding of Mg2+ and Pi to the enzyme (14Punzengruber C. Prager R. Kolassa N. Winkler F. Suko J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Kolassa N. Punzengruber C. Suko J. Makinose M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CHD is a chemical modification reagent that reacts specifically with the guanidino group of arginyl residues to produce a stable product, DHCH-Arg (16Patthy L. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 557-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that binding of Mg·ATP or Mg·ADP to the ATP binding site of the Ca2+-ATPase is completely inhibited by the modification with CHD and that Arg-489 and Arg-678 are involved in this inhibition (17Kimura K. Suzuki H. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28933-28941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The findings have led to the conclusion that these arginyl residues are located at the ATP binding site. We have further shown that EP formation from Pi has also been inhibited by the modification with CHD and suggested that the arginyl residue(s) involved in this inhibition is distinct from the above residues. It was previously shown (18Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5229-5235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that F− and Mg2+ bind simultaneously and tightly to the catalytic site of this enzyme to form a stable transition state analog forEP formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex. Vanadate also binds with high affinity to the enzyme in the presence of Mg2+ to form a transition state analog for thisEP formation (21Dupont Y. Bennett N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Inesi G. Lewis D. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 996-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, to identify the arginyl residue(s) involved in the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi, we have modified the SR Ca2+-ATPase with CHD and examined effects of the above transition state analogs on this modification. We have found that the enzyme has been appreciably protected by the transition state analogs against the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi. Peptide mapping of tryptic digests of the CHD-modified enzyme, sequencing, and mass spectrometry have shown that Arg-198 is a single major residue protected by tight binding of F− and Mg2+against the modification with CHD. The results indicate that modification of Arg-198 with CHD is responsible for at least a part (the portion reduced by the transition state analogs) of the inhibition of EP formation from Pi and suggest that Arg-198 is located in or close to the catalytic site in the transition state for EP formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex. SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and stored at −80 °C as described previously (23Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of phosphorylation site determined with [γ-32P]ATP according to Barrabin et al. (24Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was 4.00 ± 0.06 nmol/mg (n = 6). Pretreatment of the SR vesicles with F− and Mg2+ was performed as described previously (20Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The vesicles (2 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C for 3 h in 1 mm KF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20% (v/v) Me2SO, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, and 40 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.5), unless otherwise stated. The reaction was quenched by diluting the mixture twice with an ice-cold solution containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1m KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, and 5 mmMOPS/Tris (pH 7.0). The resulting vesicles were washed by centrifugation once with this solution. Modification was started at 37 °C by adding CHD (dissolved in 50 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0 or 8.8)) to a suspension of the SR vesicles to give a final composition as described in the figure legends. The modification was quenched at 0 °C by one of the following methods. In Method I, the mixture was applied to a centrifuge column (10-ml disposable syringe filled with coarse Sephadex G-50) preequilibrated with a solution (Solution A) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm MOPS, and 5 mm sodium borate (pH 7.0). In Method II, the mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed with Solution A and suspended in this solution. In Method III, the mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed with 50 mmsodium borate (pH 8.0) and suspended in this buffer. The SR vesicles were treated with F− and Mg2+ as described above. In the control samples, CaCl2 was added to the incubation medium to give 0.1 mm free Ca2+ under the otherwise same conditions as above (tight binding of F− and Mg2+ is prevented by 0.1 mm Ca2+(20Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The treated vesicles were washed by centrifugation four times with a solution containing 1 μm A23187, 2 mmEDTA, 10% (v/v) Me2SO, 0.1 m KCl, and 5 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0) and suspended in deionized water. Magnesium bound to the vesicles was extracted with 0.8 N HNO3, and the concentration of magnesium in the extract was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry as described previously (19Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The content of tightly bound Mg2+ was obtained by subtracting the content of magnesium in the extract from the control sample. Fluoride bound to the vesicles was extracted by incubating the vesicles at 95 °C for 5 min in 5 mmHEPES/KOH (pH 8.0). The sample was then centrifuged to remove insoluble materials, and KNO3 was added to the supernatant to give 0.1 m. The sample was adjusted to pH 3.0 with citric acid, and the concentration of F− was measured by use of a fluoride-selective electrode as described previously (19Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The content of tightly bound F− was obtained by subtracting the content of F− in the extract from the control sample. The SR vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in various concentrations of vanadate, 40% (v/v) Me2SO, 0.1 m KCl, 30 mm MOPS, 7 mm sodium borate (pH 7.0), and others as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved in 2% (w/v) SDS and 0.1n NaOH. The solution was neutralized with HCl, and the concentration of vanadate was measured by the method of Goodno (25Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The CHD-modified SR vesicles (1 mg/ml) were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin (0.2 mg/ml) at 40 °C for 4 h in 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0). After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to reversed phase HPLC that was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described previously (26Yamagata K. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance of peptides was monitored at 214 nm, and fractions of 0.3–1.4 ml each were collected. Peptides containing DHCH-Arg in the fractions were detected at 325 nm by the method of Patthy et al. (27Patthy L. Váradi A. Thész J. Kovács K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using Girard's reagent T. It was difficult to determine the content of DHCH-Arg in the CHD-modified vesicles by this method because the background level of the absorbance was too high even after solubilization of the vesicles with SDS. Sequencing of isolated peptides was performed with an Applied Biosystems 477A/120A sequencer. For mass spectrometry, the isolated peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.3% 1-thioglycerol and infused into the frit-FAB (fast atom bombardment) probe of a Jeol JMS-SX102 spectrometer at a flow rate of 6 μl/min by use of a microprocessor-controlled Pump 22 infusion syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Inc., South Natick, MA). The mobile phase composition was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% methanol, and 0.3% 1-thioglycerol in water (v/v). The accelerating voltage was 10 kV, and ions were analyzed in the positive mode as a function of their m/z ratio. Phosphorylation of the SR vesicles (0.4 mg/ml) with 1 mm32Pi was performed at 25 °C for 10 min in 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 40% (v/v) Me2SO, 30 mm MOPS, and 7 mm sodium borate (pH 7.0). The reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Phosphorylation of the vesicles (1 mg/ml) with 3 mm acetyl [32P]phosphate was performed at 25 °C in 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, and 20 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0). The reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid containing nonradioactive acetyl phosphate. The amount of EP formed was determined as described previously (19Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CHD was purchased from Aldrich. Girard's reagent T and KF were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). ATP was from Yamasa Biochemicals (Choshi, Japan). Acetyl phosphate was from Kohjin (Tokyo, Japan). TPCK-treated trypsin and Na3VO4 were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Vanadate solutions were prepared from Na3VO4according to Goodno (25Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) just before use. 32Piwas purified according to Kanazawa and Boyer (12Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3163-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl [32P]phosphate was prepared by Procedure B in the method of Stadtman (28Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 228-231Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data were analyzed by the nonlinear least squares method according to the algorithm of Marquardt (30Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) as described previously (19Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, when the SR vesicles were pretreated with neither F− nor Mg2+ and then treated with CHD, EP formation from Pi was inhibited with pseudo-first order kinetics and fell to 13% of the original level in 90 min (▿). When the vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+ and then treated with CHD, the enzyme was protected appreciably against the CHD-induced inhibition ofEP formation (tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed before the determination of EP formation) (○). The pretreatment without F− (□) or Mg2+ (▵) provided no protection. The observed first order kinetics of the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation (Fig. 1, A–C, solid lines) is consistent with the possibility that this inhibition was caused by modification of a single residue. However, it is also possible that more than one vital arginyl residue was modified at an approximately equal rate. As shown in Fig. 1 B, when the SR vesicles were treated with CHD in the presence of both vanadate and Mg2+, the enzyme was protected against the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi (bound vanadate and Mg2+ were removed before the determination of EP formation) (○). In the absence of vanadate and presence of 20 mm Mg2+(□) or in the presence of 0.5 mm vanadate and absence of Mg2+ (▵), no protection was observed. As shown in Fig. 1 C, when the SR vesicles were preincubated with Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ (4.1 nmol of EP/mg of SR vesicles was formed by this preincubation) and then treated with CHD, the enzyme was protected against the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi (○). However, this protection was somewhat less effective than the protection by the pretreatment with F−and Mg2+ or by the presence of vanadate and Mg2+ (compare Fig. 1 C with Fig. 1, Aand B). Binding of Pi to the catalytic site in the presence of 150 mm Pi and absence of Mg2+ provided no protection (▵). The SR vesicles were treated with or without CHD for various times, and then tight binding of F− and Mg2+ was determined (Fig. 2). The amounts of tightly bound F− and Mg2+ at zero time of the treatment were 14.7 and 8.4 nmol/mg, respectively, which are 3.7 and 2.1 times the content of phosphorylation site, respectively (4.0 nmol/mg, see “Experimental Procedures”). This is in agreement with our previous conclusion (20Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that the stoichiometry of tight binding of F− and Mg2+ to the maximum level of phosphorylation is 4:2:1. The tight binding was inhibited progressively during the treatment with CHD, although the inhibition was considerably slower than the CHD-induced inhibition ofEP formation from Pi. This less effective inhibition may be in part due to the fact (18Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5229-5235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the binding of F− and Mg2+ to the enzyme is virtually irreversible in the absence of Ca2+. The SR vesicles were pretreated with or without F− in the presence of Mg2+ and then treated with or without CHD for 90 min. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, vanadate binding was determined at various concentrations of vanadate in the presence and absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3 A). In the control (▵, ▴), in which the vesicles were pretreated without F− and then treated without CHD, Mg2+-dependent vanadate binding (broken line) increased with increasing concentrations of vanadate and was saturated with 10 μm vanadate. The maximum level of this binding was in substantial agreement with the content of the phosphorylation site. The Mg2+-dependent binding was almost completely inhibited by the treatment with CHD (□, ▪). When the vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+ and then treated with CHD, the enzyme was appreciably protected by this pretreatment against the CHD-induced inhibition of Mg2+-dependent vanadate binding (○, •). When the vesicles were pretreated without F− and then treated with CHD for various times, vanadate binding was inhibited with pseudo-first order kinetics at a rate of 0.028 min−1 (Fig. 3 B, line drawn through open squares). This rate of inhibition was in good agreement with the rate (0.023–0.024 min−1) of the CHD-induced inhibition ofEP formation from Pi under the same conditions (see solid lines in Fig. 1, A and B). The inhibition of vanadate binding was slowed by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ (Fig. 3 B,line drawn through open circles) to a similar extent as the inhibition of EP formation from Pi(cf. Fig. 1 A). The SR vesicles were pretreated with or without F− in the presence of Mg2+. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4 A, the pretreated vesicles were treated with or without CHD for various times. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed,EP formation from acetyl phosphate was determined. CHD caused no substantial inhibition of the EP formation when the vesicles were pretreated without F− (compare □ with ▪). The pretreatment with F− and Mg2+exerted a slight protective effect during the control incubation without CHD (compare • with ▪). In the experiments shown in Fig. 4 B, the pretreated vesicles were treated with or without CHD for 90 min and then phosphorylated with acetyl phosphate for various times. When the vesicles were pretreated without F− and treated with CHD, the rate of EP formation was essentially the same as that of EP formation in native SR vesicles (compare □ with ×). The pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ had virtually no effect on the kinetics ofEP formation in the CHD-treated vesicles (compare ○ with □). When the vesicles were pretreated without F− and treated without CHD, EP formation was appreciably faster than that in the native vesicles for unknown reasons (compare ▪ with ×). In the first series of experiments (Fig. 5, A–D), the SR vesicles were pretreated with neither F− nor Mg2+(A), with F− and without Mg2+(B), without F− and with Mg2+(C), or with F− and Mg2+(D) and then treated with CHD. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, the vesicles were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin and subjected to reversed phase HPLC. The peptide maps at 214 nm of the digests (Fig. 5,A–D, lower traces) agreed closely with each other. The absorbance at 325 nm of peptides containing DHCH-Arg in the peaks indicated by arrows were strongly reduced by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ (compareupper trace of Fig. 5 D with upper trace of Fig. 5 A) but not by the pretreatment without F− or Mg2+ (compare upper traces of Fig. 5, B and C, with upper trace of Fig. 5 A). In the second series of experiments (Fig. 5, E–G), the SR vesicles were treated with CHD in the absence of vanadate and presence of Mg2+ (E), in the presence of vanadate and absence of Mg2+ (F), or in the presence of vanadate and Mg2+ (G). After bound vanadate and Mg2+ were removed, the vesicles were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin and subjected to reversed phase HPLC. The peaks indicated by arrows were substantially reduced only when both vanadate and Mg2+ were present (compare upper trace of Fig. 5 G with upper traces of Fig. 5, E and F). In the third series of experiments (Fig. 5, H–J), the SR vesicles were preincubated in the absence of Pi and presence of 8.33 mm MgCl2 (H), in the presence of 156 mm Pi and absence of Mg2+ (I), or in the presence of 1.04 mm Pi and 8.33 mm MgCl2(J) and then treated with CHD. The vesicles were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin and subjected to reversed phase HPLC. The preincubation in the presence of Pi and Mg2+(4.1 nmol of EP per mg of SR vesicles was formed by this preincubation) induced a small but definite reduction in the peaks indicated by arrows (compare upper trace of Fig. 5 J with upper trace of Fig. 5 H). Binding of Pi to the catalytic site in the presence of 150 mm Pi and absence of Mg2+ had no effect on these peaks (compare upper trace of Fig. 5 I with upper trace of Fig. 5 H). It is clear from the chromatographic profiles that the peaks reduced by the presence of vanadate and Mg2+ (Fig. 5, E–G,arrows) and by the presence of Pi and Mg2+ (Fig. 5, H–J, arrows) corresponded to those reduced by the pretreatment with F−and Mg2+ (Fig. 5, A–D, arrows). The SR vesicles were pretreated without F− and with Mg2+ (Fig. 6 A) or with F−and Mg2+ (Fig. 6 B) and then treated with CHD. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, the vesicles were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin and subjected to the first reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 6, A andB). Fraction I and fraction II in the figures were pooled separately and subjected to the second reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 6, C--F). Fraction I in Fig. 6 A gave a single major peak at 325 nm (upper trace of Fig. 6 C, fraction I). FractionI in Fig. 6 B gave a major peak at 325 nm at the same retention time as in Fig. 6 C (upper trace of Fig. 6 D, fraction I), but this peak was much smaller than the corresponding peak in Fig. 6 C. FractionII in Fig. 6 A gave two close peaks at 325 nm (upper trace of Fig. 6 E, fraction II). These two peaks were greatly reduced (upper trace of Fig. 6 F, fraction II) when HPLC was performed with fraction II in Fig. 6 B. Peptides containing DHCH-Arg in fraction I in Fig. 6(C and D) and fraction II in Fig. 6(E and F) were further purified by the third reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 6, G–J). Fraction I in Fig. 6 C gave a major peak and a minor peak at 325 nm (upper trace of Fig. 6 G, peak Ia and peak Ib). Fraction I in Fig. 6 D also gave a major peak and a minor peak at 325 nm (upper trace of Fig. 6 H, peak Ia and peak Ib), but these peaks were much smaller than the corresponding peaks in Fig. 6 G. Fraction II in Fig. 6 E gave two major peaks at 325 nm (upper trace of Fig. 6 I, peak IIa and peak IIb). Fraction II in Fig. 6 F also gave two major peaks at 325 nm (upper trace of Fig. 6 J, peak IIa and peakIIb), but these two peaks were much smaller than the corresponding peaks in Fig. 6 I. The peptides containing DHCH-Arg isolated as above (peakIa and peak Ib in Fig. 6, G andH, and peak IIa and peak IIb in Fig. 6, I and J) were sequenced (Table I). All the isolated peptides gave the same sequence (His-190 to Lys-204) in the Ca2+-ATPase, in which a missing residue (X) corresponded to Arg-198. These results suggest that Arg-198 in the Ca2+-ATPase was modified with CHD. This is consistent with the previously reported findings (16Patthy L. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 557-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that carboxyl-terminal peptide bonds of CHD-modified arginyl residues are resistant to tryptic cleavage. The molecular masses of these peptides determined by mass spectrometry were in good agreement with the monoisotopic mass calculated from the above sequence on the assumption that X is DHCH-Arg (Table II). These findings show that Arg-198 in the Ca2+-ATPase was modified with CHD and that this modification of Arg-198 was strongly inhibited by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+. Furthermore, it is very likely that the modification of Arg-198 with CHD was specifically inhibited also by the presence of vanadate and Mg2+ (Fig. 5,E–G, arrows) or by the presence of Pi and Mg2+ (Fig. 5, H–J,arrows). The reason why peptides with the same sequence and same modification gave different retention times in HPLC remains obscure.Table ISequences of peptides containing DHCH-ArgCycle No.Residues determined at the given cyclePeptides in Fig. 6 (G andI)Peptides in Fig. 6 (H andJ)Peak IaPeak IbPeak IIaPeak IIbPeak IaPeak IbPeak IIaPeak IIb1His (22)His (27)His (13)His (50)His (19)His (7)His (128)His (24)2Thr (591)Thr (249)Thr (173)Thr (239)Thr (215)Thr (54)Thr (288)Thr (261)3Glu (373)Glu (219)Glu (245)Glu (348)Glu (201)Glu (52)Glu (712)Glu (245)4Pro (1811)Pro (678)Pro (644)Pro (880)Pro (700)Pro (112)Pro (1234)Pro (932)5Val (2485)Val (1144)Val (1173)Val (1432)Val (1409)Val (271)Val (2022)Val (1283)6Pro (1488)Pro (590)Pro (494)Pro (466)Pro (614)Pro (84)Pro (993)Pro (681)7Asp (155)Asp (59)Asp (94)Asp (82)Asp (48)Asp (8)Asp (129)Asp (113)8Pro (1152)Pro (372)Pro (329)Pro (341)Pro (382)Pro (61)Pro (701)Pro (487)9XXXXXXXX10Ala (823)Ala (362)Ala (272)Ala (257)Ala (359)Ala (59)Ala (444)Ala (437)11Val (1012)Val (409)Val (407)Val (406)Val (467)Val (91)Val (623)Val (525)12Asn (244)Asn (73)Asn (68)Asn (56)Asn (108)Asn (13)Asn (62)Asn (126)13Gln (340)Gln (125)Gln (85)Gln (72)Gln (171)Gln (16)Gln (130)Gln (165)14Asp (129)Asp (37)Asp (48)Asp (54)Asp (15)Asp (4)Asp (76)Asp (85)15Lys (320)Lys (93)Lys (99)Lys (119)Lys (90)Lys (6)Lys (184)Lys (185)16————————17————————18————————The purified peptides containing DHCH-Arg shown in Fig. 6(G–J) were sequenced.

The observed protection by tight binding of F− and Mg2+ (Fig. 1 A) or by high affinity binding of vanadate (Fig. 1 B) against the CHD-induced inhibition ofEP formation from Pi suggests that an arginyl residue(s) protected by these transition state analogs contributes toward formation of the transition state for EP formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex or, alternatively, that the protected arginyl residue(s) is located close to the essential components (bound phosphate, bound Mg2+, or other functional groups) of this transition state. This view is consistent with the findings that binding of the transition state analogs is inhibited by the modification with CHD (Figs. 2 and 3) and that the enzyme is protected by tight binding of F− and Mg2+ against the CHD-induced inhibition of high affinity vanadate binding (Fig. 3). It is also in harmony with the observed lack of protection by the enzyme-magnesium (Fig. 1 B) and enzyme-phosphate (Fig. 1 C) complexes, because the structures of these complexes should be different from the structure of the transition state for EP formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex. The reduction in two specific peaks by tight binding of F−and Mg2+ (Fig. 5 D, arrows) or by high affinity binding of vanadate (Fig. 5 G, arrows) indicates that a few specific arginyl residues are selectively protected by the transition state analogs against the modification with CHD. The data from peptide purification (Fig. 6), sequencing (Table I), and mass spectrometry (Table II) show that the only major arginyl residue protected by these analogs is Arg-198. These findings indicate that modification of Arg-198 with CHD is responsible for at least a part (the portion reduced by the transition state analogs) of the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi(Fig. 1, A and B). Dux and Martonosi (31Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10111-10115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that tryptic cleavage of the Ca2+-ATPase at Arg-198 is inhibited by high affinity binding of vanadate to the enzyme. Their findings appear to be compatible with our present observations. The lack of protection by the presence of 20 mmMg2+ alone against the CHD-induced inhibition ofEP formation from Pi (Fig. 1 B) and against the modification of Arg-198 with CHD (Fig. 5 E,arrows) indicates that Arg-198 is not located at the Mg2+ binding site in the enzyme-magnesium complex. In addition, the lack of protection by the presence of 150 mmPi alone against the CHD-induced inhibition ofEP formation from Pi (Fig. 1 C) and against the modification of Arg-198 with CHD (Fig. 5 I,arrows) indicates that Arg-198 is not located at the Pi binding site in the enzyme-phosphate complex. The slightly less effective protection by EP formation from Pi against the CHD-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi (Fig. 1 C) and against the modification of Arg-198 with CHD (Fig. 5 J,arrows) suggests that Arg-198 is located close to, but outside, the phosphorylation site. The location of Arg-198 in proximity to the phosphorylation site is consistent with the previously reported findings (32Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Collins J.H. J⊘rgensen P.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 93: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that tryptic cleavage of the Ca2+-ATPase at Arg-198 is inhibited by EP formation from Pi. No appreciable effects of the modification with CHD on the extent (Fig. 4 A) and rate (Fig. 4 B) of EP formation from acetyl phosphate indicate that phosphoryl transfer from the bound substrate to the phosphorylation site in the forward reaction is not substantially affected by the modification of Arg-198. This finding also shows definitely that Arg-198 is located outside the phosphorylation site. Chen et al. (33Chen Z. Coan C. Fielding L. Cassafer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12386-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that binding of γ,β-bidentate CrATP to the catalytic site of the Ca2+-ATPase is inhibited by Pi or vanadate in the presence of Mg2+, that the chromium moiety of the bound CrATP accepts a ligand from the enzyme to form an exchange inert coordination complex, and that the site of CrATP attachment through this stable coordinate bond is situated on the A2 (32Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Collins J.H. J⊘rgensen P.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 93: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) tryptic fragment (Ac-Met-1 to Arg-198). Their observations are consistent with our present view that Arg-198 is located in or close to the catalytic site in the transition state for EP formation from magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex. Arg-198 is conserved in sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (1Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H.

Therefore, although it is possible that Arg-198 is directly involved in the catalytic process of EP formation from Pi, it appears more likely that the observed inhibition (at least the portion reduced by the transition state analogs) is due to steric hindrance induced by CHD-modified Arg-198. The secondary structural model for the Ca2+-ATPase suggests that the enzyme is composed of 10 transmembrane α-helices (M1–M10) and a cytoplasmic globular fraction that is divided into two main domains, a small cytoplasmic loop (Ala-132–Asp-237 between M2 and M3) and a large cytoplasmic loop (Asn-330–Phe-740 between M4 and M5) (1Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The large cytoplasmic loop contains the phosphorylation site and the ATP binding site. The functional role of the small cytoplasmic loop is less clear. However, in the previous studies on the function of this region, it was shown that the conformational change of EP is blocked by site-directed mutations of Thr-181, Gly-182, Glu-183 (42Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Gly-233 (43Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by a tryptic cleavage at Lys-234 or Arg-236 (44Imamura Y. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Yamasaki K. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 110: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It was also shown (45Medda P. Hasselbach W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the affinity for Pi in EP formation from Pi is reduced in the Gly-233 mutants. Accordingly, it is likely that this small cytoplasmic loop including Arg-198 also contributes in part to the catalytic site.

In contrast, the nonselective β-AR agonist SM-11044 has been shown to stimulate guinea pig ileum relaxation of KCl-induced tonus more efficiently than rat white adipocyte lipolysis (11Sugasawa T. Matsuzaki M. Morooka S. Foignant N. Blin N. Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 216: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), implying the existence in guinea pig ileum of yet another atypical receptor different from the adipocyte β3-AR. SM-11044 and BRL-35135A, a potent β3-AR agonist, display the additional property of inhibiting leukotriene B4-induced guinea pig eosinophil chemotaxis, whereas isoproterenol and BRL-37344 had no such effect (12Sugasawa T.

This inhibition was unaffected by the non-selective β-AR antagonist, propranolol, but was antagonized by alprenolol, a β1-,β2-AR antagonist/β3-AR partial agonist (12Sugasawa T. Morooka S.

These observations confirmed the existence of a functional site in guinea pig ileum and eosinophils that is different from β1-, β2-, and β3-AR. In the present study, we examined the heterogeneity of the effects of the β-AR ligands on rat colon. While this tissue indeed contains β3-AR (14Bensaid M. Kaghad M. Rodriguez M. Le Fur G. Caput D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in addition to β2-AR and a small population of β1-AR (15Ek B.A. Nahorski S.R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), our results also strongly suggest the existence of a novel functional SM-11044 or iodocyanopindolol binding site in rat colon. This site was characterized by ligand binding, photoaffinity labeling, and amino acid sequencing, revealing a binding protein designated here SM-11044, or iodocyanopindolol binding protein (SMBP), which is different from known monoamine receptors.

The relaxant action of agonists was determined by measuring relaxation of KCl (100 mm)-induced tonus evoked by cumulative addition of the agonists as described previously (11Sugasawa T. Matsuzaki M. Morooka S. Foignant N. Blin N. Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 216: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the case of testing the effect of cyanopindolol, it was added 5–10 min before the addition of agonist. White adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of male Wistar rats (190–230 g), and lipolysis was determined according to the previous report (11Sugasawa T. Matsuzaki M. Morooka S. Foignant N. Blin N. Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 216: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 30 μm ascorbic acid, 10 μm phentolamine, and 1 μm propranolol. Agonists were then applied and incubated for 90 min. In the case of testing the effect of cyanopindolol, it was added 5 min before the addition of agonist. Agonist concentration ratios were determined from the EC50 values of the concentration-response curves of agonists with or without cyanopindolol, according to the method of Arunlakshana and Schild (16Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar). Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the pA2 value and slope of the line, after confirming that the regression was linear and the slope was not significantly different from unity (Cochran-Cox test, p> 0.05). The EC50 values were calculated using the computer program, InPlot™. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between two data sets was examined by Student's t test or Cochran-Cox test, depending on the homogeneity of the variances. Duncan's multiple range test was used for multiple data sets. A probability level of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Membranes from the colon smooth muscle were prepared from male Wistar rats (300–360 g) as essentially described by Ek and Nahorski (15Ek B.A. Nahorski S.R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The colon segment was washed in ice-cold Tris/saline (10 mm Tris/HCl, 154 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) and cut open longitudinally, and the mucosa was removed by scrubbing with a glass slide on an ice-cold plastic plate. The smooth muscle preparations were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer for 1 min. The homogenate was filtered through a gauze and centrifuged (1,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged (50,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in Tris/saline and kept at −80 °C until used. Saturation binding studies were performed in a final volume of 200 μl of Tris/saline containing 50 μg of membrane proteins and different concentrations (0.05–25 nm) of [125I]ICYP, supplemented with 10 μm serotonin (5-HT), 10 μmphentolamine, 20 μm propranolol, and 1.1 mmascorbic acid (pH 7.4), to block possible 5-HT receptors, ARs, and oxidation of catecholamines, respectively. The [125I]ICYP was used after removing methyl alcohol by compressed air to avoid the influence of the solvent. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a shaking water bath incubator and terminated by addition of 4 ml of ice-cold Tris/saline followed by rapid filtration under vacuum on a Whatman GF/B filter presoaked in Tris/saline containing 0.1% polyethyleneimine (pH 7.4). The filters were washed three times with 4 ml of ice-cold Tris/saline, transferred to plastic tubes, and counted in a γ-counter. Competition assays were performed against 1 nm[125I]ICYP. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm SM-11044. The inhibition constant, Ki, of a ligand was calculated using the equation described by Cheng and Prusoff (17Cheng Y.C. Prusof W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12321) Google Scholar). The Hill coefficient was calculated by linear regression using saturation experiment data. The pseudo-Hill coefficient and IC50 were determined by the computer program, InPlot™ (GraphPad Software). Photoaffinity labeling was performed in a final volume of 1 ml of Tris/saline containing rat colon membranes (0.5 mg of membrane protein) or adipocytes (1 × 106 cells), 1.5 nm[125I]ICYP-diazirine, supplemented with 10 μm 5-HT, 10 μm phentolamine, 20 μm propranolol, and 1.1 mm ascorbic acid (pH 7.4). Photoaffinity labeling of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with mouse β3-AR (8Nahmias C. Blin N. Elalouf J.-M. Mattei M.G. Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was performed using intact cells (1 × 106 cells) in the absence of 5-HT, phentolamine, propranolol, and ascorbic acid. Incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of competitor at 37 °C for 45 min in the dark in a shaking water bath incubator and terminated by addition of 10 ml of ice-cold Tris/saline followed by a rapid centrifugation (150,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The membranes were irradiated with an UV lamp for 5 min with cooling by circulating water (18Guillaume J.-L. Petitjean F. Haasemann M. Bianchi C. Eshdat Y. Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The labeled membranes were diluted with 10 ml of ice-cold Tris/saline, centrifuged (150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in Tris/saline and kept at −80 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions essentially as described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar), using 12% polyacrylamide gels (2.6% C). The photoaffinity labeled membranes or cells were incubated in SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 1% 2β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8)) for at least 1 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed on X-OMAT™ AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Preparative SDS-PAGE was performed with a large size (160 mm width × 200 mm height × 3 mm thickness) of 12% separating and 4% stacking polyacrylamide gels (40% T, 2.6% C) under reducing conditions essentially according to the methods of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were packed in a plastic bag and autoradiographed for 3 days at 4 °C on X-OMAT™ AR film (Kodak). The photoaffinity labeled proteins were extracted by passive extraction, as follows. The radioactive 34-kDa band was cut out and crushed to small pieces of less than 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 by squeezing using 10-ml disposable plastic syringe (Terumo, Japan). The gels were immersed in 2 × volume of 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% SDS (extraction buffer) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with rotating. The extract was recovered using a SPIN-XII (0.45-μm pore size, Costar) at 1500 × g for 30 min. The remaining gel pieces were again immersed in 2 × volume of extraction buffer, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with rotating, and the extract was recovered as described above. The two extracts were combined and concentrated to a maximum of 0.5 ml using Centriprep 10 and Centricon 10 (Amicon) and kept at −20 °C. Photoaffinity labeled membranes in the presence of 10 μm 5-HT, 10 μm phentolamine, and 20 μm propranolol were solubilized in isoelectric focusing sample buffer (8 m urea, 0.3% SDS, 5.6% Triton X-100, 2.8% 2β-mercaptoethanol, 1.1% Bio-Lyte 5/8 ampholyte, and 0.6% Bio-Lyte 8/10 ampholyte (Bio-Rad)), and 30 μg of membrane proteins were submitted to isoelectric focusing electrophoresis in a 5–10 pI range of 4% polyacrylamide tube gels containing 2.0% Bio-Lyte 5/8 ampholyte, 1.0% Bio-Lyte 8/10 ampholyte, 8 m urea, and 2% Triton X-100. The second dimension was conducted on SDS-PAGE of 9% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and submitted to autoradiography as described above. Photoaffinity labeled membranes in the presence of 10 μm 5-HT, 10 μm phentolamine, and 20 μm propranolol were treated withN-glycopeptidase F or endoglycosidase (Endo Hf), using kits according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, the membranes were solubilized in 0.5% SDS and 1% 2β-mercaptoethanol, and 40 μg of membrane proteins were incubated with 5000 units of N-glycopeptidase F in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40 or with 2000 units of Endo Hf for 1 or 3 h at 37 °C. The digested samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE of 12% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and submitted to autoradiography as described above. Photoaffinity labeled membranes in the presence of 10 μm 5-HT, 10 μm phentolamine, and 20 μm propranolol were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 in Tris/saline at 4 °C for 16 h. The solubilized material was collected after centrifugation (200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C) and diluted to 0.1% Triton X-100 by Tris/saline. One milliliter gel bed volume of WGA-Sepharose 6MB (Sigma) was washed and equilibrated with 30 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris/saline (buffer A), and 1 ml of solubilized material containing 200 μg membrane proteins was loaded at room temperature. The unretained fraction was recycled three times. After washing with 10 ml of buffer A, the bound material was eluted with 5 ml of 300 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (Merck) in buffer A. The fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE of 12% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and submitted to autoradiography as described above. The photoaffinity labeled proteins extracted from the preparative SDS-PAGE were washed twice by distilled water using Centricon 10 and lyophilized. Chemical cleavage was performed at 5 mg protein/ml of 10% cyanogen bromide, 70% formic acid (CNBr/formic acid) for 24 h at room temperature or 70% formic acid for 72 h at 37 °C in the dark. The cleaved products were diluted with 500 μl of distilled water and lyophilized. This washing procedure was repeated three times. The cleaved products were dissolved in SDS-reducing buffer and neutralized by addition of aliquots of 30% NaOH until changing the coloration to blue, and were separated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. The labeled bands were cut out, passively extracted, and blotted on PVDF membranes by centrifugation (ProSpin™, Applied Biosystems). The membranes were washed 3 times with 1 ml of 20% methanol to remove SDS and salts. The fragments were extracted by 200 μl of 75% hexafluoro-isopropanol. Each elution was dried to 20 μl in vacuum concentrator, dissolved in 75 μl of Me2SO, and 75 μl of starting buffer (15% acetonitrile, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer A) and loaded on a C4 reverse phase column (Aquapore Butyl BU-300, 2.1 mm inner diameter, 10 mm length, Applied Biosystems). Separation was carried out by a 120-min gradient elution at 40 °C with 50% acetonitrile, 50% isopropyl alcohol containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min using a Waters 625 LC System. The gradient started from 30 to 98% buffer B. The elution of fragments was monitored by the absorbance at 210 and 275 nm, and the elution of radioiodinated products was monitored by γ-counting of the fractions. The photoaffinity labeled membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE of 12% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and submitted to autoradiography as described above. The radioactive band at 34 kDa was excised, immersed in distilled water, and minced to small pieces (2 mm width × 2 mm height). The isolated gel pieces corresponding to 800 μg of membrane proteins was digested in 500 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% SDS and 50 μg of trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4, type IX from porcine pancreas, Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C according to the method of Kawasaki et al. (20Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After digestion, the supernatant was recovered and filtered using a SPIN-X filter (0.45 mm pore size, Costar). The gel pieces were crushed through a nylon mesh (200 mesh) by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. A 2-fold volume of 100 mm Tris/HCl containing 0.1% SDS was added to the crushed gels, and a second extraction was performed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with rotating. After incubation, the supernatants were recovered by SPIN-X filter. The two extracts were combined, vacuum concentrated, and submitted to Tricine/SDS-PAGE. Tryptic and chemically cleaved fragments were separated on a Tricine gel system under reducing conditions (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10499) Google Scholar) using 18% polyacrylamide separating gel containing 10.7% glycerol. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid and destained in 10% acetic acid. The gels were then dried and submitted to autoradiography as described above. Amino acid sequence determination was performed by Edman degradation (22Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar) with an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Samples were applied to precycled filters, coated with Polybrene (Biobrene, Applied Biosystems) to reduce peptide-wash-out and to improve initial yields. Under blockade of α-, β1-, and β2-ARs (in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine and 1 μm propranolol), a number of β-AR agonists relaxed KCl-induced tonus in rat colon smooth muscle segment, with a rank order of potencies of BRL-37344 > SM-11044 ≫ isoproterenol ≫ norepinephrine = epinephrine (Table I). The intrinsic activity value of SM-11044 was significantly higher than that of isoproterenol (Duncan's multiple range test, p < 0.05), indicating different modes of action. In rat white adipocytes, the same agonists stimulated lipolysis with a rank order of potencies of BRL-37344 ≫ SM-11044 = isoproterenol > norepinephrine > epinephrine (Table I). The linear regression line for isoproterenol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and BRL-37344 reveals a significant correlation (r = 0.97, p < 0.05) between agonist-induced rat colon relaxation and adipocyte lipolysis (Fig. 1), suggesting that both effects predominantly involve β3-AR stimulation. In contrast to these four ligands, SM-11044 stimulated colon relaxation more efficiently than adipocyte lipolysis (Fig. 1). Indeed, the correlation coefficient ceased to be significant when linear regression was analyzed with all agonists including SM-11044 (r = 0.87,p > 0.05). These data suggest that SM-11044 acts on β3-AR and an additional functional site that mediates relaxation in rat colon.Table IAgonist efficacy in rat colon and rat white adipocytes in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine and 1 μm propranololAgonistRat colonRat white adipocytespD2IAnpD2IAn(−)-Isoproterenol6.64 ± 0.221.00 ± 0.06355.86 ± 0.071.00 ± 0.0375(−)-Norepinephrine5.85 ± 0.270.85 ± 0.16845.40 ± 0.101.02 ± 0.0585(−)-Epinephrine5.92 ± 0.060.86 ± 0.13765.16 ± 0.060.91 ± 0.0365BRL-373447.50 ± 0.181.00 ± 0.12687.25 ± 0.090.72 ± 0.0331-bStatistical significance between IA values,p < 0.01 versus isoproterenol (Duncan's multiple range test).5SM-110447.29 ± 0.211.48 ± 0.1661-aStatistical significance between IA values,p < 0.05.75.96 ± 0.110.86 ± 0.05451-a Statistical significance between IA values,p < 0.05.1-b Statistical significance between IA values,p < 0.01 versus isoproterenol (Duncan's multiple range test). Open table in a new tab Antagonism of cyanopindolol for SM-11044 and for isoproterenol was compared in both preparations. Cyanopindolol itself, up to the concentration of 10 μm, had no effect on the degree of tonus induced by KCl in rat colon and did not stimulate lipolysis in rat white adipocytes. Cyanopindolol antagonized agonist-induced rat colon relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner, withpA2 values for SM-11044 of 8.31 (slope = 0.78) and for isoproterenol of 7.65 (slope = 1.03) (Table II). Cyanopindolol also antagonized agonist-induced rat white adipocyte lipolysis in a concentration-dependent manner, withpA2 values for SM-11044 of 7.32 (slope = 0.96) and for isoproterenol of 7.44 (slope = 1.08) (Table II). The similar pA2 values for isoproterenol in colon (7.65), SM-11044 in adipocytes (7.32), and isoproterenol in adipocytes (7.44), with the slopes close to unity, reveal competitive antagonism of cyanopindolol for both agonists binding to β3-AR. Slopes of Schild regression lines were not significantly different from unity. Only the slope for SM-11044 in rat colon (0.78) seemed to be lower than unity with high pA2 value (8.31), suggesting that SM-11044 and cyanopindolol compete not only for binding to β3-AR but also for binding to an additional functional site on rat colon.Table IIpA2 values for cyanopindolol in rat colon and rat white adipocytes in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine and 1 μm propranololAgonistRat colonRat white adipocytespA2SlopenpA2Slopen(−)-Isoproterenol7.65 ± 0.481.03 ± 0.0857.44 ± 0.611.08 ± 0.104SM-110448.31 ± 0.880.78 ± 0.1157.32 ± 1.510.96 ± 0.214 Open table in a new tab To identify this site, binding studies in rat colon smooth muscle membranes were performed using [125I]ICYP as the radioligand and SM-11044 for nonspecific binding determination, under blockade of serotonin receptors, α- and β-ARs (in the presence of 10 μm5-HT, 10 μm phentolamine, and 20 μmpropranolol). The time course of specific binding of [125I]ICYP (1 nm) to rat colon membranes was illustrated in Fig. 2. Specific binding achieved equilibrium levels at 30 min (82.7 ± 1.9%,n = 2) and was reversed by addition of SM-11044. The results of a saturation experiment with increasing amounts of [125I]ICYP, carried out at equilibrium (30 min incubation), are illustrated in Fig. 3. Scatchard plot analysis revealed a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 11.0 ± 0.95 nm and a maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of 716.7 ± 21.12 fmol/mg protein (r = −0.978, p < 0.001). Hill plot analysis of the saturation curve yielded a coefficient of 0.99 ± 0.03 (r = 0.998, p < 0.0001), indicating the absence of cooperativity.Figure 3Total, nonspecific, and specific binding of [125I]ICYP to rat colon membranes, in the presence of 10 μm 5-HT, 10 μm phentolamine, and 20 μm propranolol. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm SM-11044. Data represent the mean of two experiments performed in duplicate. The insetshows Scatchard's plot of the specific binding (r = −0.978, p < 0.001). The Kd was 11.0 ± 0.95 nm, and the Bmaxwas 716.7 ± 21.12 fmol/mg protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In competition binding studies, specific binding was not displaced by isoproterenol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, nor 5-HT, up to the concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 4 A, Table I). The competition binding by isomers of SM-11044 was stereo-selective, SM-14011 (the racemic threo-isomer, Ki 2.0 μm) being 15 times more effective than SM-14010 (the racemic erythro-isomer, Ki 29.3 μm) (Fig. 4 B, Table III). The β1-AR antagonist, CGP-20712A, and the β3-AR agonist, BRL-37344, did not displace the specific binding up to the concentration of 100 μm; the β2-AR antagonist, ICI-118551, was effective with a relatively highKi (28.5 μm) (Table III). Cyanopindolol was the most effective competitor with aKi of 0.11 μm, and pindolol had no effect up to the concentration of 100 μm. Carazolol, a ligand structurally related to cyanopindolol, was less effective, despite being more lipophilic (Table III).
