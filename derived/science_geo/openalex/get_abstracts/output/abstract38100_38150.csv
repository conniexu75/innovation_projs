These cells can proliferate and differentiate with approximately unit efficiency into myelomonocytic cells, B cells, or T cells. Thirty of these cells are sufficient to save 50 percent of lethally irradiated mice, and to reconstitute all blood cell types in the survivors."

https://openalex.org/W2079816467,"We have used transgenic mice that carry an activated c-neu oncogene driven by a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to assess the stepwise progression of carcinogenesis in mammary epithelium. Unlike the stochastic occurrence of solitary mammary tumors in transgenic mice bearing the MMTV/c-myc or the MMTV/v-Ha-ras oncogenes, transgenic mice uniformly expressing the MMTV/c-neu gene develop mammary adenocarcinomas that involve the entire epithelium in each gland. Because these tumors arise synchronously and are polyclonal in origin, expression of the activated c-neu oncogene appears to be sufficient to induce malignant transformation in this tissue in a single step. In contrast, expression of the c-neu transgene in the parotid gland or epididymis leads to benign, bilateral epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia which does not progress to full malignant transformation during the observation period. These results indicate that the combination of activated oncogene and tissue context are major determinants of malignant progression and that expression of the activated form of c-neu in the mammary epithelium has particularly deleterious consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1997105428,"Bombardment of three mutants of the chloroplast atpB gene of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with high-velocity tungsten microprojectiles that were coated with cloned chloroplast DNA carrying the wild-type gene permanently restored the photosynthetic capacity of the algae. In most transformants of one of the mutants, a fragment with a 2.5-kilobase deletion was restored to normal size by a homologous replacement event; in about 25 percent of the transformants the restored restriction fragment was 50 to 100 base pairs smaller or larger than that of wild type. About one-fourth of the transformants of this mutant contained unintegrated donor plasmid when first examined. This plasmid persisted in four different transformants after 65 cell generations of continuous liquid culture but was lost from all transformants maintained on plates of selective medium. The restored wild-type atpB gene remains in all transformants as an integral part of the chloroplast genome and is expressed and inherited normally."
https://openalex.org/W2007755249,"The mec-3 gene is essential for proper differentiation of the set of six touch receptor neurons in C. elegans. In mutants lacking mec-3 activity, the touch receptors express none of their unique differentiated features and appear to be transformed into other types of neurons. We cloned the mec-3 gene by transposon tagging and showed that a mec-3 mutant can be rescued by germ line transformation using a 5.6 kb genomic DNA fragment. In a strain in which transforming mec-3 DNA is present in about 50 copies per haploid genome, additional cells express a mec-3-dependent phenotype. The putative coding sequence of mec-3 contains a homeobox, suggesting that the mec-3 protein specifies the expression of touch cell differentiation by binding to DNA and regulating transcription of genes that encode the differentiated features of these cells."

https://openalex.org/W2085380563,"We have initiated a biochemical analysis of factors that regulate the expression of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) homeotic gene during embryogenesis. Transcriptionally active extracts have been prepared from Drosophila embryos at successive stages of development that recreate in vitro the temporal profile of Ubx gene expression during embryogenesis. Multiple sequence-specific transcription factors have been detected that bind to essential cis control elements located upstream and downstream of the Ubx mRNA cap site. The activity of some of these transcription factors varies during embryogenesis, and some are detected in embryonic extracts but not in Drosophila tissue culture cells. One factor, which binds to multiple GAGA DNA sequence motifs in the Ubx promoter, has been purified and shown to activate transcription from this promoter in a binding site-dependent manner. This in vitro analysis should help in understanding how Ubx expression is regulated and provide insight into the processes determining cellular fates during development."
https://openalex.org/W1968213454,"We have investigated the biochemical mechanism by which Interleukin-1 (IL-1) serves as a comitogen with agents that directly activate the antigen receptor in T lymphocytes. We have studied the human T cell line Jurkat, which can be stimulated to produce Interleukin-2 by treatment with antibodies that bind to the CD3-antigen receptor complex and hence represents a model system for T cell activation. Using highly purified, recombinant human IL-1, we show that IL-1 stimulates rapid diacylglycerol and phosphorylcholine production from phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the absence of phosphatidylinositol turnover in Jurkat cells. This effect is also observed in peripheral blood T cells and a murine T cell line. The EC50 for IL-1 was 28 fM, and PC hydrolysis was detectable within 5 sec at 37°C. The murine cell line had typical high-affinity IL-1 receptors (kd = 7 × 10−11 M). However, we were unable to detect IL-1 binding to Jurkat cells. This reaction occurs via a novel mechanism and may explain the comitogenic activity of IL-1 in T lymphocyte activation as well as many of the pleiotropic biologic effects of this cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1995129870,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA or cyclin) is a nuclear protein recently identified as a cofactor of DNA polymerase delta. When exponentially growing Balb/c3T3 cells are exposed to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to PCNA, both DNA synthesis and mitosis are completely suppressed. A corresponding sense oligodeoxynucleotide has no inhibitory effects. These experiments indicate that PCNA (cyclin) is important in cellular DNA synthesis and in cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2011784314,"In situ hybridization with complementary DNA probes for nerve growth factor (NGF) was used to identify cells containing NGF messenger RNA in rat and mouse brain. The most intense labeling occurred in hippocampus, where hybridizing neurons were found in the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer. The neuronal identity of NGF mRNA-containing cells was further assessed by a loss of NGF-hybridizing mRNA in hippocampal areas where neurons had been destroyed by kainic acid or colchicine. RNA blot analysis also revealed a considerable decrease in the level of NGF mRNA in rat dentate gyrus after a lesion was produced by colchicine. This lesion also caused a decrease in the level of Thy-1 mRNA and an increase in the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA. Neuronal death was thus associated with the disappearance of NGF mRNA. These results suggest a synthesis of NGF by neurons in the brain and imply that, in hippocampus, NGF influences NGF-sensitive neurons through neuron-to-neuron interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1574501720,"We have previously shown that the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase contains nine polypeptides of molecular weight 17,000-100,000 which form a single, macromolecular complex that can be immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies which recognize the native enzyme (Arai, H., Berne, M., Terres, G., Terres, H., Puopolo, K., and Forgac, M. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 6632-6638). In the present paper, we have calculated from quantitative amino acid analysis that these polypeptides are present in the native complex in a stoichiometry of three copies each of the 73,000- and 58,000-dalton subunits, six copies of the 17,000-dalton subunit, and one copy each of the 100,000-, 40,000-, 38,000-, 34,000-, 33,000-, and 19,000-dalton subunits. To determine the disposition of the (H+)-ATPase subunits with respect to the membrane, we have carried out labeling studies using the membrane impermeant reagents Na125I/lactoperoxidase and 125I-sulfo-succinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate and the hydrophobic reagent 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine [( 125I]TID). Polypeptides exposed to the cytoplasmic surface were identified by labeling with impermeant reagents in intact vesicles from which clathrin had been dissociated followed by immunoprecipitation of the native enzyme. Polypeptides exposed to the luminal surface were identified by increased labeling by these reagents following detergent solubilization under nondenaturing conditions. Labeling by [125I]TID was used to indicate which polypeptides are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Results of these experiments indicate that the principal polypeptides labeled from the cytoplasmic surface are those of molecular weight 73,000 and 58,000, although some cytoplasmic labeling of the 100,000, 40,000, 38,000 and 34,000/33,000 polypeptides was also observed. The polypeptides which show the greatest increase in labeling following detergent solubilization are those of molecular weight 100,000, 19,000, and 17,000, with some increase observed for the 40,000, 38,000, and 34,000/33,000 polypeptides. [125I]TID labeled the 17,000-dalton subunit most heavily, with significant labeling of the 100,000- and 40,000-dalton subunits also observed. In addition, we find that the 73,000-dalton polypeptide can be dissociated from the complex with 0.5 M KI in the absence of detergent, indicating a peripheral association of this subunit with the membrane. We have combined these results to construct a structural model of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W2044343226,"Through site-specific mutagenesis, three of the ten amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) were individually changed to tyrosines. None of these changes had significant effect on the rate of export, the rate of folding, or the antigenicity of the mutant HAs. However, one of these mutations, substituting tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid 543, changed HA from a protein that was endocytosed at a very low rate to a protein that readily entered coated pits, was internalized, and apparently recycled to the cell surface. Replacement of cysteine 543 with phenylalanine or serine did not increase the rate of internalization of HA. Phosphorylation of the mutant HA bearing a tyrosine at position 543 was not detected. These results indicate a specific and local role for the tyrosine introduced into the cytoplasmic domain of HA that is necessary for interaction of the protein with coated pits."
https://openalex.org/W2010285743,"Screening for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies was performed on sera from 39,898 blood donors at eight blood centers in geographically distinct areas of the United States. Ten donors (0.025 percent) showed evidence of HTLV-I seropositivity by enzyme immunoassays; this was confirmed by protein immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation. Seroprevalence rates ranged from 0 to 0.10 percent at the locations sampled, with HTLV-I antibodies found predominantly in donors from the southeastern and southwestern United States. Matched case-control interviews and laboratory studies were performed on five seropositive women and two seropositive men who participated in an identity-linked collection of sera from a subset of 33,893 donors at six of the eight blood centers. Four of the women and both men are black; one woman is Caucasian. Four of the seven seropositive individuals admitted to prior intravenous drug abuse or sexual contact with an intravenous drug user. Sexual contact with native inhabitants of an HTLV-I endemic area was the only identified risk factor for one male. The distribution of HTLV-I antibodies in this U.S. blood donor sample corroborates the previously reported epidemiology of this agent and suggests that additional donor screening measures, including the testing of donated blood for HTLV-I markers, may be necessary to prevent the spread of HTLV-I to transfusion recipients."
https://openalex.org/W1509615239,"The enzymes of the DNA synthesizing machinery constitute a group of gene products that are generally expressed co-ordinately at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. We have investigated how growth factors regulate the steady-state mRNA levels of two of these genes, the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen)/cyclin and the thymidine kinase genes. To detect the PCNA/cyclin mRNA, we isolated a cDNA clone from a human library. Two different cell lines were used for these studies: BALB/c3T3 cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to growth factors, and ts13 cells, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of the cell cycle, which arrests in G1 at the restrictive temperature. The steady-state levels of the RNAs for these two genes under different growth conditions were also compared with the levels of histone H3 RNA which are good indicators of the fraction of cells in S phase. Both PCNA/cyclin and thymidine kinase genes share two fundamental characteristics, i.e. they are not inducible in a G1-specific ts mutant of the cell cycle at the restrictive temperature and their expression is inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that unlike early growth-regulated genes, they require the previous expression of other growth-regulated genes. However, the two genes also show differences, the most notable being that PCNA/cyclin is inducible by epidermal growth factor alone, while thymidine kinase is not."

https://openalex.org/W1488959490,"Proteoglycans are constituents of the cell surface that may play important roles in the regulation of cell behavior. Here we report that the 250-kDa receptor subunit that binds the multifunctional protein, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), contains chains of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate and thus is a proteoglycan. Digestion of TGF-beta 1-receptor complexes with glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-specific degradative enzymes yield core proteins of 115-140 kDa. Cell monolayers that had been predigested with GAG-specific degradative enzymes were capable of binding high levels of TGF-beta 1, but the size of the binding components was shifted from the high molecular weight species to the lower molecular weight core proteins, indicating that GAG chains are not necessary for TGF-beta 1 binding to the cell. The presence of GAG chains on the receptor subunit indicates that it has the potential for interaction with the extracellular matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2105041086,"We have developed a strategy to distinguish between the methylation patterns of homologous chromosomes in tissues, and to follow these patterns in human pedigrees. This genetic approach uncovered evidence of variation in the methylation of allelic sites on homologous chromosomes. This variation was tissue-specific and reproducible after transmission through the germ line, demonstrating that homologous chromosomes have distinct blueprints for the tissue-specific regulation of methylation. Furthermore, this approach can be used to study the relationship between parental imprinting and methylation in native mammalian loci."
https://openalex.org/W2002569913,"Alpha particles are energetic short-range ions whose higher linear energy transfer produces extreme cytotoxicity. An alpha-particle-emitting radioimmunoconjugate consisting of a bismuth-212-labeled monoclonal immunoglobulin M specific for the murine T cell/neuroectodermal surface antigen Thy 1.2 was prepared. Analysis in vitro showed that the radioimmunoconjugate was selectively cytotoxic to a Thy 1.2+ EL-4 murine tumor cell line. Approximately three bismuth-212-labeled immunoconjugates per target cell reduced the uptake of [3H]thymidine by the EL-4 target cells to background levels. Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with EL-4 cells were cured of their ascites after intraperitoneal injection of 150 microcuries of the antigen-specific radioimmunoconjugate, suggesting a possible role for such conjugates in intracavitary cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1491148927,"The auxin-regulated expression of two poly(A)+ mRNAs in soybean hypocotyl was demonstrated by cloning of the cDNAs and Northern blot hybridization analyses (Walker, J.C., and Key, J.L. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 7185-7189). The corresponding genes, designated Aux28 and Aux22, have been isolated, and the cDNAs and genes have been sequenced. The Aux28 and Aux22 genes are present at one to two copies per haploid genome, contain four and two introns, and encode hydrophilic proteins of 26.8 and 21.5 kDa, respectively. Although the cDNAs were isolated independently and do not cross-hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions, the protein coding sequences of the two cDNAs have several colinear regions of high homology at the nucleic acid (77-80%) and the amino acid (80-100%) levels; together these regions constitute approximately a third of the protein coding sequences of the cDNAs. These data, together with genomic Southern blot hybridization analysis and hybrid-select translations of mRNAs homologous to the cDNAs, show that these genes belong to two related multigene families. We have identified two sequences, TGATAAAAG and GGCAGCATGCA, that occur at similar distances upstream of the transcription start site in each gene, and the spacing between these two elements is essentially identical in the two genes. The possible significance of these sequences is under evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W1579203563,"Phenylephrine is known to stimulate translocation of protein kinase C in rat pinealocytes (Sugden, D., Vanecek, J., Klein, D.C., Thomas, T.P., and Anderson, W. B. (1985) Nature 314, 359-361). In the present study, the receptor mediating this effect was found to belong to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subclass. Activation of this receptor is also known to produce a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i by increasing net influx (Sugden, A. L., Sugden, D., and Klein, D. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11608-11612), which points to the possible importance of Ca2+ influx in the subcellular redistribution (activation) of protein kinase C in intact cells. This possibility was investigated by reducing extracellular Ca2+ ((Ca2+]o) with EGTA or by inhibiting Ca2+ influx with inorganic Ca2+ blockers. These treatments reduced alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated translocation of protein kinase C. This suggested that elevation of Ca2+ influx alone triggers activation of protein kinase C. In support of this, it was found that treatments which elevate Ca2+ influx, including increased extracellular K+ and addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, cause redistribution of protein kinase C. The effect of K+ was blocked by nifedipine and that of A23187 by EGTA, indicating that effects of these agents are Ca2+-dependent. The possible role of phospholipase C activation in these effects was examined by measuring the formation of [3H]diacylglycerol by cells labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid. Although [3H]diacylglycerol formation was easily detected in the presence or absence of an effective concentration of an inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase, none of the agents which cause rapid translocation of protein kinase C were found to cause a rapid increase in the generation of [3H]diacylglycerol. These findings establish that an increase in Ca2+ influx is sufficient to trigger translocation of protein kinase C. In addition, we found that a very close correlation exists between translocation of protein kinase C by phenylephrine, K+, and A23187 and their ability to potentiate beta-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP and cGMP accumulation. This provides strong support to the proposal that translocation of protein kinase C is required for potentiation of beta-adrenergic stimulation of pinealocyte cAMP and cGMP accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2067421499,"The structural similarity between Drosophila and vertebrate homeobox genes begs the question of whether the vertebrate gene products affect cell fate and pattern formation. To study the function of the Xenopus homeobox protein, Xhox-1A, we microinjected fertilized Xenopus eggs with an excess of synthetic Xhox-RNA and assayed for effects on development. The predominant phenotype is a disturbance in somite formation. When embryos are injected with Xhox-1A mRNA, but not with control mRNAs, morphogenesis of somites occurs chaotically and individual segments are lost. Histological staining, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry indicate that the disorganized somitic tissue has differentiated into muscle cells. Overall, these results suggest that correct regulation of the Xhox-1A gene may be important for the normal development of the segmented somite pattern in early embryos. Moreover, the inferred role of Xhox-1A in somite formation indicates that there may be molecular parallels between mechanisms of segmentation in flies and vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1593737978,"Abstract It has been proposed the acquisition of efficient energy-transducing mitochondria after birth is mediated by an ATP-dependent mechanism that causes the rapid maturation of mitochondria without requiring either transcription or translation (Pollak, J. K., and Sutton, R. (1980) Trends Biochem. Sci. 5, 23-27). Investigation of developmental changes in rat liver mitochondria during the first 6 postnatal h showed fetal mitochondria had low State 4, State 3, and uncoupled rates of respiration, inefficient coupling between respiration and phosphorylation, and low membrane potentials and proton electrochemical gradients under State 4 conditions. In contrast, hepatic mitochondria from 1-h-old neonates showed increased respiratory control and ADP/O ratios and adult proton electrochemical gradient and membrane potential values. In parallel with these changes, mitochondria became enriched in adenine nucleotides and underwent a 50% reduction in matrix volume. During the first postnatal hour, an increase in mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, and F1-ATPase activities takes place in the neonatal liver concurrent with a preferential postnatal increase in the in vivo rates of protein synthesis for mitochondrial proteins. In particular, the amount of F1-ATPase increased from 109 +/- 9 to 206 +/- 5 ng/microgram of mitochondrial protein in the first hour of postnatal life. Inhibitors of cytosolic protein synthesis present during the first 2 h of life blocked the postnatal increase in respiratory control and ADP/O ratios, succinic dehydrogenase activity, and F1-ATPase content; but they had no effect on the increase in adenine nucleotide concentrations and mitochondrial volume contraction. This indicates the acquisition of an efficient coupling between respiration and phosphorylation is dependent on de novo protein synthesis and cannot be brought about by the postnatal increase in adenine nucleotides. The increase of State 4 and uncoupled rates of respiration during the first 2 postnatal h was resistant to protein synthesis inhibitors. We suggest the postnatal increase in these parameters is due to the reduction of mitochondrial volume occurring during time, which, in turn, may be triggered by the concurrent enrichment in adenine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2151982166,"We describe the effect of activated Factor XIII (Factor XIIIa, plasma transglutaminase) on the incorporation of plasma fibronectin into extracellular matrix by cultured human fibroblasts. In the absence of added Factor XIIIa, fibronectin binds to cultured fibroblast cell layers and is assembled into disulfide-bonded multimers of the extracellular matrix. When Factor XIIIa was included in the binding medium of skin fibroblasts, accumulation of 125I-fibronectin in the deoxycholate-insoluble matrix was increased. Fibronectin accumulating in the cell layer was cross-linked into nonreducible high molecular weight aggregates. The 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin inhibited the binding and cross-linking of 125I-fibronectin to cell layers, whereas fibrinogen had little effect. When 125I-fibronectin was incubated with isolated matrices or with cell layers pretreated with cytochalasin B, it did not bind and could not be cross-linked by Factor XIIIa into the matrix. HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells bound exogenous fibronectin following treatment with dexamethasone; Factor XIIIa cross-linked the bound fibronectin and caused its efficient transfer to the deoxycholate-insoluble matrix. These results indicate that exogenous fibronectin is susceptible to Factor XIIIa-catalyzed cross-linking at cellular sites of matrix assembly. Thus, Factor XIIIa-mediated fibronectin cross-linking complements disulfide-bonded multimer formation in the stabilization of assembling fibronectin molecules and thus enhances the formation of extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1992379745,"The homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is expressed in specific parts of Drosophila embryos: in a single metamer in the visceral mesoderm and forming a complex pattern limited to a broad domain in the ectoderm and in the somatic mesoderm. Here we use a linked β-galactosidase gene to identify cis-acting regulatory sequences. In the visceral mesoderm, correct expression of Ubx depends on localized upstream sequences. In the ectoderm, all galactosidase-positive transformants show the same characteristic pattern. The repeated elements of this basal pattern appear to be a sub-pattern of engrailed (en) expression; they depend on en function as well as on sequences in the Ubx RNA leader. We use a mutant (Haltere-mimic) to show that sequences that normally restrict segmental expression of Ubx in the ectoderm are located downstream from the RNA leader."
https://openalex.org/W1517298045,"A vanadate- and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase was purified about 500-fold from chromaffin granule membranes. The purified preparation contained a single major polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of about 115 kDa, which was copurified with the ATPase activity. Immunological studies revealed that this polypeptide has no relation to subunit I (115 kDa) of the H+-ATPase from chromaffin granules. The ATPase activity of the enzyme is inhibited about 50% by 100 microM N-ethylmaleimide or 5 microM vanadate. The enzyme is not sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, ouabain, SCH28080, and omeprazole, which distinguishes it from Na+/K+-ATPase and the gastric K+/H+-ATPase. ATP and 2-deoxy ATP are equally effective substrates for the enzyme. However, the enzyme exhibited only 10% activity with GTP as a substrate. UV illumination of the purified enzyme in the presence of [alpha-32P]ATP exclusively labeled the 115 kDa protein. This labeling was increased by Mg2+ and strongly inhibited by Ca2+ ions. Similarly, the ATPase activity was dependent on Mg2+ and inhibited by the presence of Ca2+ ions. The ATPase activity of the enzyme was largely insensitive to monovalent anions and cations, except for F-, which inhibited the vanadate-sensitive ATPase. Incubation of the enzyme in the presence of [14C]N-ethylmaleimide labeled the 115-kDa polypeptide, and this labeling could be prevented by the addition of ATP during the incubation. A reciprocal experiment showed that preincubation with N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the labeling of the 115-kDa polypeptide by [alpha-32P]ATP by UV illumination. This suggests a close proximity between the ATP-binding site and an essential sulfhydryl group. A possible connection between the isolated ATPase and organelle movement is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1540583765,"Each regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase has two tandem cAMP-binding sites, A and B, at the carboxyl terminus. Based on sequence homologies with the cAMP-binding domain of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein, a model has been constructed for each cAMP-binding domain. Two of the conserved features of each cAMP-binding site are an arginine and a glutamic acid which interact with the negatively charged phosphate and with the 2′-OH on the ribose ring, respectively. In the type I regulatory subunit, this arginine in cAMP binding site A is Arg-209. Recombinant DNA techniques have been used to change this arginine to a lysine. The resulting protein binds cAMP with a high affinity and associates with the catalytic subunit to form holoenzyme. The mutant holoenzyme also is activated by cAMP. However, the mutant R-subunit binds only 1 mol of cAMP/R-monomer. Photoaffinity labeling confirmed that the mutant R-subunit has only one functional cAMP-binding site. In contrast to the native R-subunit which is labeled at Trp-260 and Tyr-371 by 8-N3cAMP, the mutant R-subunit is convalently modified at a single site, Tyr-371, which correlates with a functional cAMP-binding site B. The lack of functional cAMP-binding site A also was confirmed by activating the mutant holoenzyme with analogs of cAMP which have a high specificity for either site A or site B. 8-NH2-methyl cAMP which preferentially binds to site B was similar to cAMP in its ability to activate both mutant and wild type holoenzyme whereas N6-monobutyryl cAMP, a site A-specific analog, was a very poor activator of the mutant holoenzyme. The results support the conclusions that 1) Arg-209 is essential for cAMP binding to site A and 2) cAMP binding to domain A is not essential for dissociation of the mutant holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1553231394,"Abstract Stimulation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells with ionophore A23187, carbachol, or high K+ medium, agents which increase intracellular Ca2+, results in the phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (Nose, P., Griffith, L. C., and Schulman, H. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 101, 1182-1190). We have identified three major protein kinases in PC12 cells and investigated their roles in the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase and other cytosolic proteins. A set of PC12 proteins were phosphorylated in response to both elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and to protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) activators. In addition, distinct sets of proteins responded to either one or the other stimulus. The three major regulatory kinases, the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and protein kinase C all phosphorylate tyrosine hydroxylase in vitro. Neither the agents which increase Ca2+ nor the agents which directly activate kinase C (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol) increase cAMP or activate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, thereby excluding this pathway as a mediator of these stimuli. The role of protein kinase C was assessed by long term treatment of PC12 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which causes its desensitization. In cells pretreated in this manner, agents which increase Ca2+ influx continue to stimulate tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation maximally, while protein kinase C activators are completely ineffective. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated by the three protein kinases in vitro with phosphopeptide maps generated from tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated in vivo indicates that phosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase most closely mirrors the in vivo phosphorylation pattern. These results indicate that the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase mediates phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by hormonal and electrical stimuli which elevate intracellular Ca2+ in PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524493245,"The participation of gonadal steroid hormones in the regulation of the expression of the somatostatin gene in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex was studied by using a quantitative densitometric hybridization assay which allows the direct measurement of specific somatostatin mRNA levels. The levels of somatostatin mRNA in hypothalamus were found to be significantly decreased following gonadectomy in both male and female rats (67% in males and 75% in females). Moreover, with in situ hybridization histochemistry somatostatin mRNA was similarly reduced following gonadectomy in the dorsal portion of the periventricular region and in the ventromedial nucleus. Estradiol dibenzoate treatment reversed the decrease in somatostatin mRNA in females within 24 h and testosterone treatment reversed the decrease in castrated males. In contrast, there was no significant change in cerebral cortex somatostatin mRNA levels after gonadectomy. These results suggest that sex steroids are involved in the regulation of the somatostatin gene in the hypothalamus, possibly at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1588199696,"Skin fibroblasts from two affected members of a family with an autosomal dominant form of mild-moderate osteogenesis imperfecta produced two populations of type I collagen molecules. One population was normal and the other population contained alpha 2(I) chains which had a basic charge shift localized to a peptide from the carboxyl-terminal end of the triple-helical domain. The alpha chains in the abnormal molecules had increased post-translational modification along the entire triple-helical domain but the thermal stability was normal. We isolated a 28-kb BamHI fragment from the normal and mutant COL1A2 alleles from an affected family member. DNA sequence determination demonstrated that a single nucleotide change resulted in an arginine for glycine substitution at triple-helical position 1012, the last triple-helical glycine. These data demonstrate the stringent requirement for maintenance of the Gly-X-Y triplet sequence in type I collagen and suggest that point mutations which disrupt Gly-X-Y in alpha 2(I) produce milder clinical effects than similar mutations in alpha 1(I)."
https://openalex.org/W1889010749,"Oxidative modification of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase renders the enzyme susceptible to proteolytic degradation by a specific protease purified from the bacterium; native enzyme is not a substrate for the protease. A model oxidizing system consisting of ascorbate, iron, and oxygen was used to generate a series of glutamine synthetases of increasing oxidative modification. We assessed the effect of oxidative modification on the surface hydrophobicity of the glutamine synthetases, utilizing hydrophobic chromatography on a phenyl matrix. Initial exposure to the oxidizing system caused inactivation of the enzyme and generated a protein that was more hydrophilic than the native form; it was not a substrate for the protease. Continued exposure to the oxidizing system yielded a protein with additional oxidative modification. This form was distinctly more hydrophobic than the native form and it was very susceptible to proteolytic attack by the purified protease. Thus, oxidative modification modulates the surface hydrophobicity of glutamine synthetase, and this modulation can control susceptibility to proteolysis.— Cervera, J.; Levine, R. L. Modulation of the hydrophobicity of glutamine synthetase by mixed function oxidation. FASEB J. 2: 2591-2595; 1988."
https://openalex.org/W2088563557,"Pertussis toxin is produced by the causative agent of whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, and is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase capable of covalently modifying and thereby inactivating many eukaryotic G proteins involved in cellular metabolism. The toxin is a principal determinant of virulence in whooping cough and is a primary candidate for an acellular pertussis vaccine, yet it is unclear whether the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is required for both pathogenic and immunoprotective activities. A B. pertussis strain that produced an assembled pertussis holotoxin with only 1 percent of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the native toxin was constructed and was found to be deficient in pathogenic activities associated with B. pertussis including induction of leukocytosis, potentiation of anaphylaxis, and stimulation of histamine sensitivity. Moreover, this mutant strain failed to function as an adjuvant and was less effective in protecting mice from intracerebral challenge infection. These data suggest that the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is necessary for both pathogenicity and optimum immunoprotection. These findings bear directly on the design of a nontoxic pertussis vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1482470973,"The energy transfer protein, green fluorescent protein, from the hydromedusan jellyfish Aequorea victoria has been crystallized in two morphologies suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis. Hexagonal plates have been obtained in the P6122 or P6522 space group with a = b = 77.5, c = 370 A, and no more than three molecules per asymmetric unit. Monoclinic parallel-epipeds have been obtained in the C2 space group with a = 93.3, b = 66.5, c = 45.5 A, beta = 108 degrees, and one molecule per asymmetric unit. The monoclinic form is better suited for use in a structure determination, and a data set was collected from the native crystal. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements of large single crystals are possible due to the unique, covalently bound chromophore present in this molecule. Fluorescence emission spectra of Aequorea green fluorescent protein in solution and from either the hexagonal or monoclinic single crystal show similar profiles suggesting that the conformations of protein in solution and in the crystal are similar. Multifrequency phase fluorimetric data obtained from a single crystal were best fit by a single fluorescence lifetime very close to that exhibited by the protein in solution. The complementary structural data obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction crystallography will aid in the elucidation of this novel protein's structure-function relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1623676777,"A covalent, catalytic intermediate of cytosolic liver acetyl coenzyme A: arylamine N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) from rapid acetylator rabbits (III/J) was isolated and chemically characterized. The active site was further studied using two covalent inhibitors, [2-3H]iodoacetic acid and bromoacetanilide. Inhibition experiments with [2-3H]iodoacetic acid at pH 6.9 showed that the incorporation of 0.7 mol of [2-3H]iodoacetic acid/mol of N-acetyltransferase led to rapid, irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Preincubation of the enzyme with acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) completely protected against inactivation by [2-3H]iodoacetic acid. After incubating the N-acetyltransferase with [2-3H]acetyl-CoA in the absence of an acceptor amine, an acetyl-cysteinyl-enzyme intermediate was isolated and characterized. Preincubation of N-acetyltransferase with iodoacetic acid prevented the incorporation of the [2-3H]acetyl group into the enzyme. The product analog, bromoacetanilide, caused a rapid irreversible loss of N-acetyltransferase activity. The reaction was pseudo first-order and saturated at high bromoacetanilide concentrations (KI = 0.67 mM; k3 = 1 min-1). Preincubation of the enzyme with acetyl-CoA prevented inactivation by the inhibitor. The acceptor amine 4-ethylaniline did not prevent inhibition. Incorporation of the inhibitor was directly proportional to the loss of activity showing a 1:1 stoichiometry of enzyme to inhibitor. The target amino acid was identified as cysteine by amino acid analysis of inhibitor-treated enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1580220829,"A cDNA clone encoding the full coding region of chicken liver arylamine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) was isolated from lambda gt10 cDNA library by screening with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide deduced from the amino acid sequence reported in the preceding paper. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined, from which the amino acid sequence of N-acetyltransferase was deduced. It consisted of 1,302 nucleotides including a 861-nucleotide region coding for 287 amino acids with a molecular weight of 32,914. Two methods were applied to confirm that the cDNA encoded arylamine N-acetyltransferase. First, mRNA was synthesized in vitro by Bluescript and subsequently translated in vitro. The molecular mass of the translation product was 34 kDa consistent with that of the enzyme purified from the chicken liver. The translated protein was immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody to N-acetyltransferase. Second, the cDNA was inserted into an expression vector pcDL1 and introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The supernatant of the homogenate of transfected cells showed a high level of N-acetyltransferase activity with a substrate specificity comparable to that of the liver enzyme. Northern blot analysis revealed three mRNAs corresponding to 4.7, 2.0, and 1.4 kilobases. The levels of N-acetyltransferase mRNAs were relatively high in the liver and distributed in various tissues. Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of only one gene in the chicken haploid genome."

https://openalex.org/W51794564,"The capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K1 is a linear polymer of N-acetylneuraminic acid in alpha-2,8 linkage. Certain substrains of E. coli K1 (designated OAc+) modify the polysaccharide by O-acetylation of the sialic acids. We demonstrate here an acetyl-coenzyme A: polysialosyl O-acetyltransferase activity that is found only in E. coli K1 OAc+ substrains. When form variation between the O-acetyl-positive and -negative states occurred in strain D698:K1, the fluctuations were accompanied by appropriate changes in the expression of enzyme activity. Thus, expression of this enzyme can account for the OAc+ phenotype and for the form variation between OAc+ and OAc-. The enzyme was solubilized in nonionic detergent and freed of endogenous acceptor activity by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and its general properties were determined. Analysis of the reaction product showed a highly preferential acetylation reaction that was confined to polysialosyl units of greater than 14 residues. Acetyl groups were shown to be transferred to both the 7- and the 9-positions of the sialic acid residues. The partially purified enzyme was stable even after prolonged incubation at 57 degrees C. In contrast, any further purification resulted in loss of activity, even at 4 degrees C. Treatment of the stable enzyme with a polysialic acid-specific endoneuraminidase caused a similar loss of enzyme stability. This effect of the endoneuraminidase could be protected against by the addition of exogenous polysialic acid. This indicates that the partially purified enzyme contains traces of endogenous polysialic acid substrate that are required for the stability of the enzyme. Finally, the enzyme can O-acetylate the polysialic acid chains on the eucaryotic protein neural cell adhesion molecule, suggesting that enzymatic recognition of the substrate requires only the polysialic acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1729982995,"A casein kinase activity, which copurifies with the H+-ATPase activity during isolation of plasma membranes Saccharomyces cerevisiae and during centrifugation of the solubilized membrane extract through a sucrose gradient, is separated from the Mr = 100,000 ATPase catalytic polypeptide by subsequent DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The purified casein kinase activity exhibits a low Km of 12 microM MgATP, is maximally stimulated by 6 mM free Mg2+, and is 50% inhibited by 300 microM Zn2+, by 7.5 micrograms of heparin/ml, and by 300 microM orthovanadate. It phosphorylates only seryl residues. The purified casein kinase contains two polypeptides of Mr = 45,000 and 39,000 which yield antibodies which do not cross-react to each other. The two polypeptides seem to originate from a precursor of Mr = 85,000 which is detected by both antibodies in partly purified fractions. In the absence of casein, a zinc and heparin-sensitive phosphorylation of the ATPase polypeptide is observed in partly purified ATPase fractions, and a peptide of similar mobility is phosphorylated, among others, in isolated plasma membranes. The purified ATPase activity is markedly inhibited by incubation in the presence of acid phosphatase. In agreement with a recent report that the purified active ATPase molecule is largely phosphorylated (Yanagita, Y., Abdel-Ghany, M., Raden, D., Nelson, N., and Racker, E. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 894, 925-929) this data suggests that dephosphorylation leads to deactivation of ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1540994424,"The large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) and the beta subunit of chloroplast ATP synthase (atpB) are encoded by divergently transcribed genes on the plastid genome. We have identified DNA binding factors specific for sequences located in the intergenic region between these two genes. Soluble plastid extracts from pea or whole cell extracts from maize protected a maize chloroplast DNA probe containing the 160-base pair region between the 5' ends of rbcL and atpB genes from exonuclease III digestion between positions -16 and -101 relative to the rbcL gene transcription start site. Competition assay with partial sequences from this intergenic region demonstrated that specific sequence(s) are required for the protection. The borders of the binding domain are conserved among the homologous regions of maize, tobacco, spinach, and pea chloroplast genomes. Gel filtration chromatography revealed a molecular weight of about 115,000 for the active complex involved in DNA binding. Using the exonuclease III protection assay, we have also shown that purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase protects from +25 to -20 of the rbcL gene and from +21 to -23 of the atpB gene relative to their respective transcription start sites. These regions are analogous to open complexes found when E. coli RNA polymerase interacts with the prokaryotic promoters and are consistent with the ability of E. coli RNA polymerase to initiate transcription correctly on linear templates containing these chloroplast promoters. Possible role(s) for the chloroplast DNA binding factor in chloroplast gene expression and its regulation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004609456,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (subtype M3) is characterized by malignant promyelocytes exhibiting an abundance of abnormally large or aberrant primary granules. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of these azurophilic granules, as assessed by cytochemical staining, is unusually intense. In addition, M3 is universally associated with a chromosomal translocation, t(15;17)(q22;q11.2). In this report, the MPO gene was localized to human chromosome 17 (q12-q21), the region of the breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the t(15;17), by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ chromosomal hybridization. By means of MPO complementary DNA clones for in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, the effect of this specific translocation on the MPO gene was examined. In all cases of M3 examined, MPO is translocated to chromosome 15. Genomic blot analyses indicate rearrangement of MPO in leukemia cells of two of four cases examined. These findings suggest that MPO may be pivotal in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1551414429,"Conditioned medium from Reuber H-35 or Fao hepatoma cells contains autocrine factors that both stimulate DNA synthesis and activate acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase in serum-deprived Fao cells. The factor(s), which appears within 4 h of serum-free culture, also increases the cell number and the mitotic index. The effects of the conditioned medium are insulinomimetic, both with respect to stimulation of DNA synthesis and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. However, no induction of tyrosine aminotransferase activity or stimulation of aminoisobutyric acid uptake is seen in response to the conditioned medium. Insulin over a 4-h period does not increase the concentration of DNA synthesis stimulating activity that is observed in the medium. This activity is dialyzable and is resistant to acid treatment or to heating to 60-100 degrees C and to trypsin digestion; it is not extracted with chloroform/methanol nor adsorbed by charcoal or by a C18 reverse-phase column. Fractionation of the conditioned medium derived from Reuber H-35 hepatoma cells by gel filtration chromatography reveals two low molecular weight (less than 1000) compounds that both stimulate DNA synthesis in Fao hepatoma cells. The larger compound (peak I) also stimulates the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The stimulatory effects of the peak I compound are destroyed by nitrous acid deamination, periodate oxidation, and methanolysis. Biosynthetic labeling studies indicate the probable presence of glucosamine, galactose, and perhaps phosphate in the peak I-activating material. No significant incorporation of either myoinositol or mannose into the active material has been observed. These data, taken together, are consistent with a glycan structure for this autocrine factor, which bears strong resemblance to similar insulinomimetic factors generated in BC3H1 myocytes and H-35 hepatoma cells in response to insulin and on digestion of membranes with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Further characterization of this factor may provide insight into different pathways of insulin action and could provide a strategy to check autocrine-stimulated tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1562314257,"Glutamic acid 49 of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli is an essential residue since 19 mutant proteins substituted at position 49 were found previously to be inactive. Our present findings that five mutants of the alpha subunit, substituted with Asp, Lys, Ala, Phe, or Gly at position 49, bind a substrate analog normally are further evidence that glutamic acid 49 is a catalytic base. Ligands of the alpha subunit also have similar effects on site-site interactions between the beta subunit and the wild type or mutant alpha subunits. These effects include inhibition of the activity of the beta subunit, reduction of the dissociation constant for D-tryptophan, and increase of the equilibrium concentration of a quinonoid intermediate formed with L-tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1483910381,"A human cDNA containing the complete coding sequence for a human tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2, form 2) was introduced into the genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) downstream to the polyhedrin promoter. Infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells (SF9) with recombinant virus resulted in the expression of human tyrosine hydroxylase in these invertebrate cells. Characterization of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in infected SF9 cells demonstrated both substrate and cofactor kinetics that were characteristic of those previously reported for the native human enzyme. Both 3-iodotyrosine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine competitively inhibited the recombinantly produced tyrosine hydroxylase with Ki values of 1.2 and 16 microM, respectively, similar to those previously reported for the rat and human enzymes. Western blot analysis of extracts of SF9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus containing human tyrosine hydroxylase cDNA revealed a major immunoreactive band with an apparent Mr of 60 kDa, identical to the size of the immunoreactive protein from rat adrenal and caudate nucleus. The use of the baculovirus expression system to produce abundant quantities of each of the multiple forms of active human tyrosine hydroxylase in eukaryotic cells should facilitate structural analysis and help clarify the physiological significance of each of the isoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1524798625,"The activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and reductase were assayed in exponentially growing LM fibroblasts and Friend murine erythroleukemia cells isolated at various stages of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation. The activities of these enzymes were similar in all phases of the cell cycle, regardless of whether the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of serum. These observations were confirmed in murine erythroleukemia cells synchronized by recultivation of pure populations of G1 cells. The incorporation of [14C]acetate or 3H2O into sterols decreased by 30-50% in later stages of the cell cycle, whereas the incorporation of [14C]acetate into ubiquinone increased as the cells progressed toward mitosis. Similar changes in the labeling of sterols compared to ubiquinone and dolichol were observed when [3H]mevalonate was used, suggesting that cell cycle-dependent alterations may occur in the flux of farnesyl pyrophosphate into the various branches of the isoprenoid pathway. Synchronized murine erythroleukemia cells incorporated [3H]mevalonate into protein-bound isoprenyl groups at all stages of the cell cycle, and there were no substantial changes in the electrophoretic profiles of these labeled polypeptides. The finding that the activities of the enzymes regulating mevalonate synthesis did not vary substantially during the cell cycle implies that changes in the endogenous mevalonate pool probably do not play a limiting role in regulating cell cycle traverse when cells are undergoing exponential growth. Although small cell cycle-dependent changes may occur in the relative activity of various post-mevalonate branches of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, there is no evidence that synthesis of any major isoprenoid end product is confined exclusively to a specific phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1549122535,"Five monoclonal antibodies against arylamine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) from the chicken liver were established by immunizing a mouse with a partially purified enzyme preparation. None of the antibodies cross-reacted with arylamine N-acetyltransferase from the livers of cow, rabbit, and rat, nor with arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase from the chicken pineal gland, indicating a high specificity of the antibodies. By using the antibodies, two immunoaffinity purification procedures were elaborated: A partially purified enzyme preparation was incubated with the monoclonal antibody, and the resulting enzyme-IgG complex was separated by a protein A-Sepharose column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of 34 kDa in addition to the heavy and light chains of IgG. Secondly, an immunoaffinity column was prepared by immobilizing a monoclonal antibody to Sepharose 4B. After a partially purified enzyme preparation was absorbed on the column, N-acetyltransferase activity was eluted with 1 M NaCl and 1 M urea. The eluted sample contained a single 34-kDa protein. The purified enzyme preferred arylamines to arylalkylamines as substrates, indicating that it was arylamine N-acetyltransferase. The purified protein was subjected to digestion by lysylendopeptidase and separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Partial amino acid sequences of three peptides were determined by a gas-phase sequence analyzer."
https://openalex.org/W1535704303,"Mutant alleles for the alpha subunit of H+-translocating ATPase (FoF1) were cloned from Escherichia coli strains isolated in this laboratory. Determination of their DNA sequence revealed four nonsense mutations (KF3 and KF9, Gln-20----end; KF24, Trp-111----end; KF2, Trp-231----end; KF70, Gln-252----end) and one missense mutation (KF45, Pro-143----Ser). The membranes of all the mutants except strain KF9 (KF3) had 50-70% of ATPase activities of the wild-type. Unlike the F1-ATPase of the wild-type, those of the mutants were insensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and were easier to solubilize from membranes. As membranes of strain KF24 had F1-ATPase activity, these results suggest that at least a part of the F1-binding sites could be formed without a region between residues 111 and the carboxyl terminus of the alpha subunit. However, normal interactions between Fo and F1 require regions between residues 252 and 271 (carboxyl terminus) and in the vicinity of Pro-143. Membranes of strain KF45 were capable of forming a low ATP-driven H+ gradient, whereas other membranes were not. The possibility that the region between residues 252 and 271 is involved in H+ translocation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1521555848,"Liver plasma membranes contain a morphologically distinct protein complex which serves as a substrate for the plasma membrane-associated transglutaminase. The complex, which appears as a two-dimensional sheet, is insoluble in sodium dodecyl sulfate and reducing agents and has been named SITS for sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble transglutaminase substrate (Tyrrell, D. J., Sale, W. S., and Slife, C. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1946-1951). Polyclonal antibodies raised against SITS were used to probe for soluble constituents of the matrix. Immunoblots showed that proteins of 230, 35, and 32 kDa reacted with the anti-SITS antiserum when the soluble fraction from a liver homogenate was examined. The 230-kDa protein was identified as fibronectin after observing cross-reactivity of anti-SITS antiserum with authentic fibronectin and cross-reactivity of anti-fibronectin antiserum with the 230-kDa cytosolic protein and purified SITS. Preincubating anti-SITS antiserum with purified fibronectin decreased immunostaining of the 230-kDa cytosolic protein and authentic fibronectin. Immunoblots of the plasma membrane fraction using anti-SITS and anti-fibronectin antisera showed that both antisera reacted with proteins at the top of the stacking gel (SITS) and of 230 kDa. In addition, the anti-SITS antiserum reacted with proteins of 85, 35, and 32 kDa. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the anti-SITS and anti-fibronectin antisera both react with isolated SITS and with the same filamentous structures associated with intact plasma membranes. These studies show that fibronectin is a component of the plasma membrane matrix, SITS. This finding is consistent with the proposed role of this matrix which is to mediate cell-cell adhesion between hepatocytes in the tissue."
