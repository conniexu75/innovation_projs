https://openalex.org/W2082721225,"Recent brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have implicated insula and anterior cingulate cortices in the empathic response to another's pain. However, virtually nothing is known about the impact of the voluntary generation of compassion on this network. To investigate these questions we assessed brain activity using fMRI while novice and expert meditation practitioners generated a loving-kindness-compassion meditation state. To probe affective reactivity, we presented emotional and neutral sounds during the meditation and comparison periods. Our main hypothesis was that the concern for others cultivated during this form of meditation enhances affective processing, in particular in response to sounds of distress, and that this response to emotional sounds is modulated by the degree of meditation training. The presentation of the emotional sounds was associated with increased pupil diameter and activation of limbic regions (insula and cingulate cortices) during meditation (versus rest). During meditation, activation in insula was greater during presentation of negative sounds than positive or neutral sounds in expert than it was in novice meditators. The strength of activation in insula was also associated with self-reported intensity of the meditation for both groups. These results support the role of the limbic circuitry in emotion sharing. The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala, right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to all sounds, suggesting, greater detection of the emotional sounds, and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation. Together these data indicate that the mental expertise to cultivate positive emotion alters the activation of circuitries previously linked to empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1980153635,"Cannabinoid receptors play key roles in brain function, and cannabinoid effects in brain physiology and drug-related behavior are thought to be mediated by receptors present in neurons. Neuron-astrocyte communication relies on the expression by astrocytes of neurotransmitter receptors. Yet, the expression of cannabinoid receptors by astrocytes in situ and their involvement in the neuron-astrocyte communication remain largely unknown. We show that hippocampal astrocytes express CB1 receptors that upon activation lead to phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores. These receptors are activated by endocannabinoids released by neurons, increasing astrocyte Ca2+ levels, which stimulate glutamate release that activates NMDA receptors in pyramidal neurons. These results demonstrate the existence of endocannabinoid-mediated neuron-astrocyte communication, revealing that astrocytes are targets of cannabinoids and might therefore participate in the physiology of cannabinoid-related addiction. They also reveal the existence of an endocannabinoid-glutamate signaling pathway where astrocytes serve as a bridge for nonsynaptic interneuronal communication."
https://openalex.org/W2168976498,"Homeostatic synaptic scaling adjusts a neuron's excitatory synaptic strengths up or down to compensate for perturbations in activity. Little is known about the molecular pathway(s) involved, nor is it clear which aspect of “activity”—local synaptic signaling, postsynaptic firing, or large-scale changes in network activity—is required to induce synaptic scaling. Here, we selectively block either postsynaptic firing in individual neurons or a fraction of presynaptic inputs, while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. We find that synaptic scaling is rapidly induced by block of postsynaptic firing, but not by local synaptic blockade, and is mediated through a drop in somatic calcium influx, reduced activation of CaMKIV, and an increase in transcription. Cortical neurons thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, a mechanism with the computational advantage of efficiently normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific mechanisms of information storage.

Storage of memories and the activity-dependent refinement of neuronal circuitry are thought to require two distinct forms of synaptic plasticity; synapse-specific mechanisms that selectively alter the strength of particular connections (Malenka and Bear, 2004Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. LTP and LTD: An embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) and homeostatic mechanisms such as synaptic scaling that regulate the overall strength of a neuron's synaptic inputs (Abbott and Nelson, 2000Abbott L.F.

Synaptic scaling has now been well documented at a variety of central synapses (Burrone and Murthy, 2003Burrone J. Murthy V.N. Synaptic gain control and homeostasis.Curr. Opin.

There is good consensus that a major expression locus of synaptic scaling is changes in the synaptic accumulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Grunwald et al., 2004Grunwald M.E. Mellem J.E.

In contrast, much less is known about how synaptic scaling is induced. Several signaling molecules have been suggested to mediate or modulate synaptic scaling (Goddard et al., 2007Goddard C.A.

Adaptation to synaptic inactivity in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), but there is as yet no complete molecular pathway linking altered activity to homeostatic regulation of AMPAR accumulation. It also remains unclear which aspect of activity is sensed by neurons or networks during synaptic scaling: it has variously been proposed that neurons sense their own firing rate and globally scale synaptic weights up or down to compensate (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar); that local changes in synaptic signaling induce local homeostatic changes in synaptic transmission at individual synapses (Sutton et al., 2006Sutton M.A. Ito H.T. Cressy P. Kempf C. Woo J.C. Schuman E.M. Miniature neurotransmission stabilizes synaptic function via tonic suppression of local dendritic protein synthesis.Cell. 2006; 125: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar); or that synaptic scaling requires widespread changes in network activity, perhaps through activity-dependent release of a soluble factor by neurons or glia (Rutherford et al., 1998Rutherford L.C.

BDNF has opposite effects on the quantal amplitude of pyramidal neuron and interneuron excitatory synapses.Neuron. 1998; 21: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we acutely blocked either a subset of presynaptic inputs or postsynaptic firing in individual neurons, while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength over several hours. We find that cortical neurons homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, through a pathway that involves changes in spike-mediated somatic calcium influx, CaMKIV signaling, and transcription. A major expression locus of synaptic scaling is postsynaptic changes in AMPAR accumulation. Previously, we showed that in cortical neurons, 1 to 2 days of TTX treatment increases endogenous GluR1 and GluR2 proportionally, and we used fluorescently tagged GluR2 to monitor the changes in synaptic strength induced by prolonged bath application of TTX (Wierenga et al., 2005Wierenga C.J. Ibata K. Turrigiano G.G. Postsynaptic expression of homeostatic plasticity at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2895-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Here, we used time-lapse imaging to follow changes in GluR2 accumulation over the first few hours of activity blockade. Recombinant GluR2 was tagged with EYFP and when expressed in cultured cortical pyramidal neurons accumulated in dendritic puncta (Figure 1A), and these puncta colocalized with the excitatory synaptic marker PSD-95 (Figure 1B; 93.5% ± 3.2% colocalization). Approximately 70% of these GluR2 puncta are also colocalized with the presynaptic marker synapsin and can recycle vesicles (Wierenga et al., 2005Wierenga C.J. Ibata K. Turrigiano G.G. Postsynaptic expression of homeostatic plasticity at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2895-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), suggesting that the majority of these GluR2 puncta represent functional synaptic sites. GluR2 was tagged on the N terminal, so that when receptors are inserted into the plasma membrane the EYFP tag is on the extracellular surface. EYFP is highly pH sensitive (pKa of 7.0; Shaner et al., 2005Shaner N.C. Steinbach P.A. Tsien R.Y. A guide to choosing fluorescent proteins.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar), so tagged receptors localized in acidic intracellular compartments will have no appreciable fluorescence but when inserted into the plasma membrane (pH 7.4) will show strong fluorescence. Punctate GluR2-EYFP fluorescence was rapidly and reversibly quenched to 10% of control by low-pH medium (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1F), indicating that at least 90% is from surface receptors, and changes in this signal can be used as a noninvasive probe for changes in synaptic AMPAR accumulation. Repeated imaging of the same puncta revealed that the majority of GluR2 puncta (75%) were stable over 4 hr (Figure 1E, puncta 1, 2, 3; Figure 1G, Stable). The remaining puncta appeared de novo (Figure 1E, white arrow), disappeared during the imaging period, or were highly motile (Figure 1E, star). The fraction of puncta gained and lost were closely matched (Figure 1G, compare New to Lost), so that overall puncta number did not change significantly. Synaptic scaling has been thought of as a process that operates over days (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that 4 hr of bath-applied TTX was sufficient to significantly increased GluR2 puncta intensity. Comparing all puncta (transient, stable, and new puncta; Figure 1H, All) with the effects only on stable puncta (Figure 1H, Stable) revealed that for both measures, control puncta intensity was stable over 4 hr, whereas puncta intensity significantly increased during TTX treatment. TTX had no effect on the proportion of stable and transient puncta (Figure 1G). Newly appeared puncta were weaker than average and similar in intensity for control and TTX (Figure 1H, New), suggesting that new puncta are not yet subject to the process that homeostatically regulates AMPAR number at more mature puncta. Below, we confined our analysis to puncta that persisted throughout the imaging experiment. To examine the time course of TTX-induced AMPAR accumulation, we imaged neurons at 1 hr intervals for 4 hr (Figure 2A, top panel). There was no significant change in fluorescence under control conditions (Figure 2A, ctrl; 237 puncta from 10 neurons). In contrast, TTX induced a gradual increase in punctate GluR2 fluorescence, which was significant within 1 hr (Figure 2A, TTX; 164 puncta from 6 neurons). Synaptic scaling is bidirectional (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar); increasing activity with the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline significantly reduced synaptic AMPAR fluorescence (Figure 2A, bicucu; 153 puncta from 8 neurons). To verify that endogenous receptor levels are also rapidly affected by activity blockade, we used antibodies directed against an extracellular epitope of GluR2 under nonpermeant conditions to measure surface synaptic AMPAR levels in control and TTX-treated sister cultures, as described previously (Wierenga et al., 2005Wierenga C.J. Ibata K. Turrigiano G.G. Postsynaptic expression of homeostatic plasticity at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2895-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Wierenga et al., 2006Wierenga C.J. Walsh M.F. Turrigiano G.G. Temporal regulation of the expression locus of homeostatic plasticity.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2127-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TTX treatment for 4 hr significantly increased GluR2 intensity at synaptic sites (as defined by colocalization with synapsin); 24 hr of TTX further increased fluorescence (Figure 2B). TTX treatment did not affect colocolization between GluR2 and synapsin (control, 73% ± 3%; TTX 4 hr, 76% ± 3%; TTX 24 hr, 74% ± 4% colocalization). Taken together, these data indicate that modulating network activity rapidly and bidirectionally affects receptor trafficking to induce compensatory changes in AMPAR accumulation at putative synaptic sites. The changes in AMPA accumulation measured above are more rapid than the changes in mEPSC amplitude we reported previously (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Since our culture conditions have changed since this first report (notably, we now plate neurons onto beds of glia), we compared the effects of 4 and 24 hr of TTX treatment on mEPSC amplitude. Surprisingly, 4–5 hr of TTX treatment was sufficient to produce a robust and significant increase in mEPSC amplitude, to approximately 130% of control values (Figures 2C–2F), in good agreement with our receptor accumulation data. Longer TTX treatment (24 hr) increased mEPSC amplitude further (Figure 2F), also in agreement with the receptor accumulation data (Figure 2B and Wierenga et al., 2005Wierenga C.J. Ibata K. Turrigiano G.G. Postsynaptic expression of homeostatic plasticity at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2895-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but the rate of change is clearly faster during the first 4 hr than during the subsequent 20. The effects on mEPSCs induced by 4 hr of TTX were identical to those induced by longer TTX treatment, in that they occurred without any significant change in mEPSC kinetics (Figure 2D) or mEPSC frequency (TTX was 120% ± 10% of control values, p = 0.46), and TTX increased the amplitude distribution multiplicatively (Figure 2E; Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Bath-applied TTX could be affecting AMPAR accumulation by blocking postsynaptic firing, by reducing presynaptic release and/or local glutamate receptor activation, or by reducing network activity. To differentiate between these possibilities, we devised a perfusion system that allowed us to perfuse a local (approximately 30 μm diameter) region of the neuron with TTX to block somatic action potentials in individual neurons (Figure 3A). Locally applying this perfusion spot to the soma blocked postsynaptic firing (Figure 3A, middle panel), while moving the pipette 30 μm away from the soma, or perfusing a region of dendrite, did not affect the ability of the neurons to fire during current injection (not shown). Synaptic input persisted during somatic perfusion with TTX (Figure 3A, left panel), and there was no difference in the integrated synaptic input before and during somatic TTX perfusion (TTX was 105% ± 6% of control, n = 5 neurons), indicating that blocking somatic spikes did not significantly reduce network activity. Our strategy was to block postsynaptic firing with somatic TTX perfusion while monitoring the intensity of dendritic AMPAR puncta that were well outside the perfusion spot (at least 100 μm from the soma along the apical-like dendrite). Blocking somatic spikes in individual pyramidal neurons induced a gradual increase in dendritic punctate AMPAR fluorescence (Figure 3B; n = 199 puncta from 6 neurons). Somatic perfusion with control medium (Figure 3B; n = 201 puncta from 11 neurons) or with DNQX/APV (Figure 3B; n = 142 puncta from 5 neurons) had no effect. The magnitude (Figure 3D) and time course (compare Figures 3B and 2A) of the change in AMPAR accumulation induced by somatic spike blockade was similar to that induced by bath-applied TTX. To determine whether locally blocking a subset of presynaptic inputs onto the dendrite is sufficient to induce a local increase in receptor fluorescence, we microperfused the apical-like dendrite with TTX and monitored AMPAR fluorescence at puncta within the perfusion spot (Figure 3C). Locally perfusing the dendrite with control medium induced no change in AMPAR fluorescence at perfused puncta (n = 99 puncta from 7 neurons), neither did perfusion with TTX (to block presynaptic spikes; n = 93 puncta from 10 neurons, p = 0.53 compared to perfusion with control medium) nor with DNQX/APV (to block postsynaptic glutamate receptors; n = 38 puncta from 4 neurons, p = 0.46). Thus, synaptic scaling cannot be induced locally in the dendrite but can be induced by a drop in postsynaptic activity. TTX perfusion along the apical-like dendrite produced a small (approximately 20%) reduction in spontaneous firing of the perfused neuron (Figure 3E; n = 5 neurons), likely because this blocks a fraction of the synaptic inputs to the neuron. If synaptic scaling is a graded function of neuronal firing rate, then this reduction in firing should produce a small increase in AMPAR fluorescence, yet monitoring fluorescence within the perfusion spot showed no significant change in fluorescence (Figure 3C; Figure 3F, Dend In). To analyze this more thoroughly, we compared the fluorescence at dendritic puncta inside and outside the dendritic perfusion spot. Four hours of dendritic TTX perfusion produced a small but significant increase (approximately 14%) in AMPAR fluorescence at puncta outside the perfusion spot (Figure 3F, Dend Out). These data indicate that a graded drop in firing can increase dendritic AMPAR accumulation and suggest the presence of a competitive mechanism that prevents accumulation at locally blocked synapses. Modeling studies have shown that an efficient way to design a homeostatic feedback loop is to use an integrator of intracellular calcium and adjust neuronal properties to keep this integrated calcium signal close to some “calcium set point” (LeMasson et al., 1993LeMasson G. Marder E. Abbott L.F. Activity-dependent regulation of conductances in model neurons.Science. 1993; 259: 1915-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 1998Liu Z. Golowasch J.

Prinz A.A. Modeling stability in neuron and network function: the role of activity in homeostasis.Bioessays. 2002; 24: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Somatic spikes trigger somatic calcium transients that are blocked by local perfusion of TTX at the soma (Figure 4A, top panel), raising the possibility that blocking somatic spikes scales up synaptic strengths by reducing somatic calcium influx. To test this, we perfused the soma with NiCl2, a broad-spectrum competitive blocker of calcium channels that completely abolished the somatic calcium transients (Figure 4A, bottom panel). We confirmed that perfusion with NiCl2 did not affect the ability of the neurons to fire action potentials (data not shown). Somatic perfusion with NiCl2 induced a slow accumulation of AMPAR at dendritic puncta, similar in magnitude (Figure 4B) and time course (see Figure S1 available online) to that induced by somatic TTX perfusion. Perfusing the soma with the L type calcium channel blocker nifedipine produced a smaller but significant increase in AMPAR accumulation, while the N and P/Q type calcium channel blockers ω-Conotoxin GVIA and MVIIC had no effect (Figure 4B). Consistent with a partial effect of nifedipine on AMPAR accumulation, 24 hr of bath-applied nifedipine increased mEPSCs to values intermediate between control and TTX-treated cultures (nifedipine was 126% ± 11% of control, p < 0.025, n = 9; TTX was 154% ± 17% of control, p < 0.01, n = 10). Thus, a drop in somatic calcium influx, operating through a mixture of L type and other (possibly T or R type) calcium channels, generates a signal that leads to a gradual and cumulative increase in surface AMPAR at synaptic sites. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are important mediators of many forms of calcium-dependent plasticity (Lisman et al., 2002Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H.

The CaMK inhibitor KN93 can induce homeostatic changes in synaptic function (Thiagarajan et al., 2005Thiagarajan T.C. Lindskog M. Tsien R.W.

Unlike CaMKII, CaMKIV has a predominantly somatic/nuclear localization (Nakamura et al., 1995Nakamura Y. Okuno S. Sato F. Fujisawa H.

In keeping with published reports (Bito et al., 1996Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

A phospho-CaMKIV antibody (p-196, which detects the fully activated kinase) revealed strong levels of activated kinase in the nuclear compartment (Figure 4C), which was significantly reduced by 4 hr of TTX treatment (Figures 4C and 4D); baseline firing thus maintains a pool of CaMKIV in the activated state. To directly test for a role of reduced CaMKIV signaling in the induction of synaptic scaling, we transfected neurons with a dominant-negative form of CaMKIV (dnCaMKIV, the kinase-dead mutation K75E; Chatila et al., 1996Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. A unique phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV/GR.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transfection with dnCaMKIV for 24 hr increased mEPSC amplitude to a similar extent as 24 hr of TTX (Figure 4E); further, the effects of dnCaMKIV and TTX occluded each other (Figure 4E, TTX + dnCaMKIV). Transfection with dnCaMKII (also kinase dead, K42M; Hanson et al., 1994Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Dual role of calmodulin in autophosphorylation of multifunctional CaM kinase may underlie decoding of calcium signals.Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) had no effect on mEPSC amplitude (Figure 4E, dnCaMKII). Unlike CaMKII, CaMKIV must be phosphorylated by CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK) for full activation (Soderling, 1999Soderling T.R. The Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase cascade.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a second means of inhibiting CaMKIV, we used the selective CaMKK inhibitor Sto-609 (Tokumitsu et al., 2002Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. STO-609, a specific inhibitor of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Like dnCaMKIV, Sto-609 (bath applied for 4 hr) significantly increased mEPSC amplitude (Figure 4E) and synaptic accumulation of endogenous AMPAR (Figure S4). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that a drop in postsynaptic firing scales up mEPSC amplitude through a drop in somatic calcium influx and a subsequent reduction in CaMKIV signaling. CaMKIV is a known transcriptional regulator (Soderling, 1999Soderling T.R. The Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase cascade.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and some forms of synaptic plasticity require gene expression for their induction or maintenance (West et al., 2002West A.E. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Regulation of transcription factors by neuronal activity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether synaptic scaling is transcription dependent. To determine whether changes in somatic calcium trigger synaptic scaling through a transcription-dependent pathway, we bath applied TTX along with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD). Time-lapse imaging of synaptic GluR2-EYFP revealed that ActD completely blocked the increase in receptor accumulation normally induced by 4 hr of TTX (Figure S3); ActD also blocked the increase in endogenous AMPAR accumulation (Figure S4) and the increase in mEPSC amplitude induced by 4–5 hr of Sto-609 (Figure 4E, Sto-609 + ActD), as well as the increase in mEPSC amplitude induced by 24 hr of bath-applied TTX (Figure 4E, TTX + ActD). ActD had no significant effect on baseline transmission (Figure 4E, ActD), mEPSC frequency (ActD was 111.9% ± 21.3% of control), or on passive cellular properties such as input resistance (ActD was 97.0% ± 1.8% of control) and resting potential (ActD was 95.5% ± 12.5% of control). Scaling up of synaptic strengths thus depends upon transcription. ActD did not prevent the TTX-induced reduction in nuclear phospho-CaMKIV (Figure 4D), indicating that a drop in CaMKIV activation prec"

However, postingestive effects can influence food preferences independently of palatability, although the neurobiological bases of such mechanisms remain poorly understood. Of central interest is whether the same brain reward circuitry that is responsive to palatable rewards also encodes metabolic value independently of taste signaling. Here we show that trpm5−/− mice, which lack the cellular machinery required for sweet taste transduction, can develop a robust preference for sucrose solutions based solely on caloric content. Sucrose intake induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum of these sweet-blind mice, a pattern usually associated with receipt of palatable rewards. Furthermore, single neurons in this same ventral striatal region showed increased sensitivity to caloric intake even in the absence of gustatory inputs. Our findings suggest that calorie-rich nutrients can directly influence brain reward circuits that control food intake independently of palatability or functional taste transduction.

Our findings suggest that calorie-rich nutrients can directly influence brain reward circuits that control food intake independently of palatability or functional taste transduction. It is commonly accepted that highly palatable foods, through their action on brain gustatory-reward systems, can override internal homeostatic mechanisms and eventually lead to overeating and obesity (Berthoud, 2004Berthoud H.R.

Hedonic hot spots in the brain.Neuroscientist. 2006; 12: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, little attention has been paid to a second pathway through which nutritive compounds can exert reinforcing influences on an organism, namely the postingestive controls on food intake (Sclafani, 2001Sclafani A. Post-ingestive positive controls of ingestive behavior.Appetite. 2001; 36: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Sclafani and Ackroff, 2004Sclafani A. Ackroff K. The relationship between food reward and satiation revisited.Physiol. Behav. 2004; 82: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In fact, independent of the orosensory pleasure derived from eating calorie-dense foods, postingestive actions of nutrients have been shown to act as positive reinforcers on feeding behavior (Sclafani, 2001Sclafani A. Post-ingestive positive controls of ingestive behavior.Appetite. 2001; 36: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the neural mechanisms controlling these purely metabolic-based behavioral adaptations remain largely unknown. The role of brain dopamine systems in mediating food reward, and in encoding stimulus palatability, is well established. Dopamine antagonists attenuate the hedonic value of sweet-tasting nutrients; animals pretreated with either D1- or D2-type dopamine receptor antagonists show attenuated responses toward high concentrations of sucrose (Bailey et al., 1986Bailey C.S. Hsiao S. King J.E. Hedonic reactivity to sucrose in rats: modification by pimozide.Physiol. Behav. 1986; 38: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Geary and Smith, 1985Geary N.

The effects of pimozide on the consumption of a palatable saccharin-glucose solution in the rat.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1981; 15: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Conversely, tasting palatable foods elevates dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the ventral striatum (Hernandez and Hoebel, 1988Hernandez L. Hoebel B.G. Food reward and cocaine increase extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens as measured by microdialysis.Life Sci. 1988; 42: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), a brain region largely implicated in food reinforcement (Kelley et al., 2005Kelley A.E. Schiltz C.A. Landry C.F. Neural systems recruited by drug- and food-related cues: studies of gene activation in corticolimbic regions.Physiol. Behav. 2005; 86: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In particular, NAcc dopamine levels increase in proportion to stimulus concentration even when no calories are absorbed (Hajnal et al., 2004Hajnal A. Smith G.P. Norgren R. Oral sucrose stimulation increases accumbens dopamine in the rat.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 286: R31-R37Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In humans, striatal dopamine release directly correlates with the perceived hedonic value of food stimuli (Small et al., 2003Small D.M. Jones-Gotman M. Dagher A. Feeding-induced dopamine release in dorsal striatum correlates with meal pleasantness ratings in healthy human volunteers.Neuroimage. 2003; 19: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Importantly, the palatability-induced dopamine release in the NAcc seems to effectively modulate brain reward processing: excitatory neurons in this region explicitly encode for hedonic value, including the relative salience of sucrose reinforcers as assessed by contrast paradigms (Taha and Fields, 2005Taha S.A. Fields H.L. Encoding of palatability and appetitive behaviors by distinct neuronal populations in the nucleus accumbens.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, such neural sensitivity to oral rewards is independent of familiarity or learning (Roitman et al., 2005Roitman M.F. Wheeler R.A. Carelli R.M. Nucleus accumbens neurons are innately tuned for rewarding and aversive taste stimuli, encode their predictors, and are linked to motor output.Neuron. 2005; 45: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A central question that remains to be addressed is whether in the absence of taste receptor activation the brain dopamine-reward system is also sensitive to the metabolic value of nutrients. This would imply that physiological events starting in the gastro-intestinal tract have direct access to the central reward circuits controlling motivated consummatory behaviors, providing a neural substrate for postingestive controls on food intake. To investigate this hypothesis we performed behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological experiments in mice lacking a functional transient receptor potential channel M5 (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang Y. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Mueller K.L. Cook B.W.D. Zucker C.S. Ryba N.J. Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways.Cell. 2003; 112: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) (trpm5−/− mice). The TRPM5 ion channel is expressed in taste receptor cells (Perez et al., 2002Perez C.A. Huang L. Rong M. Kozak J.A. Preuss A.K. Zhang H. Max M. Margolskee R.F. A transient receptor potential channel expressed in taste receptor cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and is required for sweet, bitter, and amino acid taste signaling (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang Y. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Mueller K.L. Cook B.W.D. Zucker C.S. Ryba N.J. Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways.Cell. 2003; 112: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). We first reasoned that sweet-blind knockout (KO) animals would develop a preference for spouts associated with the presentation of sucrose solutions when allowed to detect the solutions' rewarding postingestive effects. We then inquired whether such a behavioral pattern is associated with dopamine release in the ventral striatum of KO mice. Finally, we investigated whether populations of neurons in the same region of the ventral striatum, and in the anatomically associated orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), were modulated by metabolic changes independently of palatability. We first confirmed that KO animals are insensitive to the orosensory rewarding properties of sucrose. In brief-access tests (Glendinning et al., 2002Glendinning J.I. Gresack J. Spector A.C. A high-throughput screening procedure for identifying mice with aberrant taste and oromotor function.Chem. Senses. 2002; 27: 461-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), water-deprived KO animals (n = 5) and their wild-type (WT) counterparts (n = 5) were presented with water, 0.4 M sucrose, or 0.8 M sucrose across successive 5-s trials, and standardized lick ratios defined as number of licks for sucrose solution/number of licks for water were calculated. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of genotype (p < 0.0003), but not of tastant (p > 0.95), on lick ratios. While WT animals displayed a strong attraction to both 0.4 M and 0.8 M sucrose, with lick ratios significantly larger than the indifference ratio of 1.0 (3.16 ± 0.38 and 3.22 ± 0.39, respectively, independent one-sample t tests, both p < 0.005), in KO animals these ratios approximately equaled 1.0 (0.98 ± 0.13 and 0.95 ± 0.16, respectively, both p > 0.75, Figure 1A; a complete statistical summary is included in Table S1, available online, and information on deprivation schedules/basal number of licks is included in Table S2). Using two-bottle preference tests, we also measured preference ratios for 0.8 M sucrose against water in nondeprived animals. Whereas WT mice (n = 5) displayed an increased attraction for sucrose, as expressed by a preference ratio significantly larger than the indifference ratio of 50% (87% ± 8%, independent one-sample t test, p < 0.02), KO animals (n = 8) displayed preferences similar to 50%, with a nonsignificant bias toward water (39% ± 6%, p > 0.15). Results were unaltered when mice were food and water deprived (ratios 91% ± 1% for WT, p < 0.0001; 44% ± 3% for KO, p > 0.18; Figure 1B). Once the insensitivity of KO mice to the orosensory reward value of sucrose was established, we inquired whether a preference for sippers associated with caloric sucrose solutions could develop in water- and food-deprived KO mice when they are allowed to form an association between a particular sipper in the test chamber and the postingestive effects produced by drinking from that sipper. This was accomplished in sweet-taste-naive animals by first determining the initial side-preferences using a series of preliminary two-bottle tests where both sippers contained water. The hungry and thirsty mice (n = 9 for KO and n = 5 for WT) were then exposed to a procedure, henceforth called the “conditioning protocol,” where alternated access to either water or 0.8 M sucrose was given for 6 consecutive days. Conditioning sessions consisted of 30 min daily of free access to either water (assigned to the same side of initial bias) or 0.8 M sucrose (assigned to the opposite side) while access to the other sipper was blocked. Significant main effects on acceptance (i.e., total consumption measured in number of licks) were found for genotype (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.007) and taste stimulus (p < 0.003). However, no significant genotype × stimulus interaction was observed (p > 0.29; see Figure S1A available online), since during conditioning sessions both WT and KO animals consumed more sucrose than water (KO: 189 ± 35 licks for water and 440 ± 125 for sucrose, Figure 1C; WT: 407 ± 76 licks for water and 920 ± 107 for sucrose, Figure 1D; lick counts for each conditioning day are included in Table S2). These conditioning sessions were then followed by two-bottle tests identical to those run to determine initial side biases. During test sessions, both WT and KO animals reversed their initial side-preference biases by drinking significantly more water from the sipper that, during conditioning sessions, had been associated with 0.8 M sucrose. In fact, the preference ratio for KO mice was 80% ± 5% (p < 0.0006, independent one-sample t test against 50%), and for WT mice, 81% ± 6% (p < 0.02, Figure 1E). Noticeably, in this two-bottle test no significant difference was observed between WT and KO preference ratios (unpaired two-sample t test, p > 0.94; Figure 1E). We ascribe these results to the ability of KO animals to detect the postingestive reinforcing properties of sucrose. Conversely, we hypothesized that the effect described above should vanish when sucrose is replaced by sucralose, a noncaloric but highly palatable sucrose-derived sweetener. When the conditioning protocol was run on a group of naive animals (n = 5 KO and n = 6 WT) using 30 mM sucralose instead of sucrose, we observed significant main effects of genotype (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.002) and taste stimulus (p < 0.0003) on acceptance. However, unlike for the sucrose case, here we found a significant genotype × stimulus interaction (p < 0.0003; see Figure S1B). This prompted us to perform separate within-genotype paired t tests: whereas WT animals consumed significantly more sucralose than water during the conditioning sessions (1901 ± 505 and 226 ± 166 licks for sucralose and water, respectively, p < 0.002, Figure 1G), KO animals consumed approximately the same amount of both (204 ± 34 and 233 ± 49 licks for sucralose and water, respectively, p > 0.3, Figure 1F). The equivalent tests performed for the sucrose case show that, unlike for sucralose, both WT and KO animals consumed significantly more sucrose than water (p < 0.05 for both, Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, during the two-bottle test sessions, conducted after conditioning to sucralose, neither WT nor KO animals showed a preference for the sipper associated with the delivery of sucralose (p > 0.4 for both WT and KO mice, Figure 1H). We conclude that sipper-associated preferences in trpm5−/− mice depend exclusively on the compound's postabsorptive metabolic value. Finally, we eliminate the possibility that KO mice might have acquired a preference for caloric sucrose via detection of nonsweet sensory cues possibly present in the solution by performing a control experiment where mice licked from a single central spout during conditioning sessions. Such design denies animals the occasion to associate caloric load with a particular drinking sipper. We did not find any increases in sucrose intake in KO mice during either postconditioning brief-access or two-bottle tests (see Figures S2 and S3). To verify whether KO mice would display increases in blood glucose levels after sucrose intake comparable to those observed in WT mice, an additional group of 22-hr food- and water-deprived animals (five KO, five WT animals) was exposed to one-bottle sucrose sessions and subsequently sampled for blood glucose levels at regular intervals. We found comparable glucose level increases between genotypes (Figure 2), implying that sweet-blind KO mice do not display any major alterations in metabolic function during carbohydrate intake. We then inquired whether the mesolimbic dopamine system, known to be responsive to the receipt of palatable rewards, is associated with the behavioral patterns described above. We specifically inquired whether caloric intake per se, independently of palatability, was sufficient to increase extracellular dopamine levels in reward-processing regions. Naive KO (n = 5) and WT (n = 4) animals were implanted with microdialysis probes in NAcc, and dialysate samples were collected from 22-hr food- and water-deprived animals 60 min previous to and during 30-min, one-bottle free access to sucralose (day 1) or sucrose (day 2) solutions (see Figure S4A for intake data). Samples continued to be collected for an additional 30 min after completion of the licking task. By performing three-way ANOVA analyses (genotype × tastant × sampling time), we found a significant interaction between genotype and tastant (p < 0.02) on the measured relative (percent from baseline) increases in extracellular dopamine levels. We thus performed separate two-way ANOVAs (genotype × sampling time) for each tastant, and significant main effects of genotype were found on dopamine release during sucralose (p < 0.0003, Figure 3A), but not sucrose (p > 0.9, Figure 3B), sessions. Unpaired two-sample t tests performed subsequent to averaging over sampling time confirmed that sucralose, but not sucrose, intake produced significantly higher increases in dopamine levels in WT animals compared with KO animals (sucralose: 95.5% ± 5.6% for KO and 134.6% ± 4.1% for WT, p < 0.0003; sucrose: 129.4% ± 11.1% for KO and 127.9% ± 17.6% for WT, p > 0.9). Furthermore, paired t tests conducted separately for each genotype revealed that sucrose intake, compared with sucralose intake, produced significantly higher levels of dopamine release in KO (mean percent change 129.4% ± 11.0% for sucrose and 95.5% ± 5.5% for sucralose, p < 0.03, Figure 3C), but not WT, animals (134.6% ± 4.1% and 127.9% ± 17.5%, respectively, p > 0.7 Figure 3D). Furthermore, these response patterns were maintained when the analysis was restricted to the 30 min licking periods (KO: 102.66 ± 7.75 for sucralose and 153.88 ± 16.23 for sucrose, paired two-sample t test, p < 0.03, Figure 3E; values expressed in percent of baseline dopamine level; WT: 134.04 ± 8.82 for sucralose and 157.37 ± 23.33 for sucrose, p > 0.3, Figure 3F). In addition, we found significant effects of sampling time during sucrose (p < 0.002), but not sucralose (p > 0.8), sessions. To further investigate tastant-specific temporal effects on transmitter release, we additionally made use of the sample values corresponding to the observed dopamine concentration (in nM units) for each time point. The related time courses are shown in Figures 3A and 3B. We performed two-way (sampling time × genotype) repeated-measures ANOVAs for each tastant separately. During sucralose sessions, as expected, we found a significant effect of genotype (p < 0.0004), but not of sampling time (p > 0.69) or interaction (p > 0.56), on dopamine levels. However, the same analyses applied to sucrose sessions revealed no effects of genotype (p > 0.11), but robust sampling time (p < 0.0001) and sampling time × genotype interaction effects (p < 0.05) on dopamine levels. Post hoc two-sample t tests then revealed significantly higher dopamine levels in WT mice compared with KO mice at 20 min sampling time (p < 0.01). It could be inferred from the above that the temporal patterns associated with accumbal dopamine release might reflect the nature of the inputs (i.e., caloric, gustatory, or both) eliciting transmitter release during feeding. Finally, it could be argued that the above pattern of dopaminergic response was due to differential effects produced by licking activity. However, we found no correlation between licking responses and average dopamine release during each 30 min sucralose or sucrose licking period (r2 = 0.098, p > 0.2, see Figure S4B). Our results demonstrate that even in the absence of taste transduction or palatability, caloric intake produces measurable tonic increases in NAcc dopamine. Thus, both palatability and postingestive factors can independently increase dopamine levels in brain reward circuits. We next inquired whether the pattern of dopamine release in KO animals described above was coupled to an effective modulation of the brain reward circuitry. We thus simultaneously recorded populations of neurons in the NAcc and associated OFC of naive KO mice (n = 4) under conditions of sucralose and sucrose intake similar to those used during the microdialysis experiments. We note that because we aimed at assessing the hypothesis that NAcc/OFC neurons are sensitive to the metabolic effects of sucrose independently of taste or palatability, only KO animals were recorded, since it is impossible to isolate taste-independent neuronal responses in WT animals by definition. Figures S5 and S6 provide details on our recording methodology. During recording day 1, food- and water-deprived KO animals were given free access for 1 hr to sucralose solutions, and on day 2, to sucrose solutions. Stimulus delivery was performed via the opening of solenoid valves upon lick detection such that in 25% of occurrences of sustained licking responses (randomly selected), water was delivered instead of sucralose (day 1) or sucrose (day 2) solution. As expected, during these 1-hr sessions, KO mice consumed significantly more sucrose than sucralose (mean number of licks 627 ± 111 for sucralose and 1647 ± 205 for sucrose, paired two-sample t test, p < 0.03, Figure 4A). However, when each 1-hr session was divided into a period of 10 and 50 min, an interesting temporal pattern was revealed. Repeated-measures two-way ANOVA (taste × time) on the intake data showed a significant effect of tastant (p < 0.03), but not time (p > 0.9), on total consumption. Interestingly, during the first 10 min, there was no significant difference in consumption between sucrose and sucralose sessions (718 ± 146 versus 424 ± 82 licks, respectively, post hoc paired two-sample t test, p > 0.05, see Figure 4B). However, as sessions progressed, animals became increasingly sensitive to the postingestive effects of each solution and consequently returned more often to the sipper during sucrose sessions compared with sucralose sessions. Thus, a significant difference in consumption was observed during the last 50 min of each session (929 ± 245 and 203 ± 57 licks for sucrose and sucralose, respectively, p < 0.05). This pattern can be observed in the minute-by-minute time courses of the licking behaviors across all recorded animals, depicted in Figure 4C. We then inquired whether any of the two simultaneously recorded areas displayed an increased sensitivity to caloric intake by comparing the neuronal responses during licking obtained from sucralose versus sucrose sessions. Because single neurons in OFC are known to respond to stimulus attributes such as viscosity (Verhagen et al., 2003Verhagen J.V. Rolls E.T. Kadohisa M. Neurons in the primate orbitofrontal cortex respond to fat texture independently of viscosity.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we only analyzed water trials that were uniformly dispersed within the sucralose and sucrose trials (see above and Experimental Procedures). A total of 128 single units were recorded during the sucralose sessions (53 neurons in NAcc and 75 in OFC) and 136 neurons during sucrose sessions (44 neurons in NAcc and 92 in OFC). No assumptions were made on whether or not a given unit was recorded during both sessions. For both the NAcc and OFC, we calculated the relative proportions of stimulus-responsive neurons during sucralose and sucrose sessions. We found that, overall, 7/128 neurons showed water sensitivity during sucralose sessions, whereas for sucrose sessions 18/136 neurons were water responsive. This difference in proportions is significant (Fisher Exact test, p < 0.04, see Figure 4D). This result demonstrates that the NAcc-OFC circuit is sensitive to caloric intake and metabolic cues even in the absence of taste signaling. However, when the same analysis was performed for each brain region separately, it was found that the difference in proportions was significant for NAcc (6/53 versus 14/44 neurons for sucralose and sucrose sessions, respectively, Fisher Exact test, p < 0.03), but not for OFC (1/75 versus 4/92 neurons, respectively, Fisher Exact test, p > 0.38, Figure 4D). As examples, Figure 4E shows a water-responsive NAcc neuron recorded during a sucrose session, whereas Figure 4F shows a neuron recorded from the same electrode during the corresponding sucralose session. Overall, we observed that whereas the dopamine-targeted NAcc showed an increased sensitivity to caloric intake, taste-independent metabolic changes were insufficient to engage the OFC in stimulus encoding. We note that these results remained essentially unchanged when the same analyses were performed across sucrose and sucralose trials instead of water trials (see Figure S7). Given the behavioral results showing that when compared with sucralose, sucrose consumption was different only 10 min after session start, we suspected that the stimulus sensitivity displayed by NAcc neurons could be accounted for mainly by stimulus response properties that developed during the last 50 min of sucrose sessions. We therefore counted, for all sucrose sessions, the number of neurons that were responsive to water during the sessions' final 50 min, but not during the initial 10 min. We found that, out of the 14 neurons that were found to be responsive to water during sucrose sessions, 8 responded to water only during the final 50 min of the session. This ratio differs significantly from the overall ratio of NAcc water-responsive cells during sucrose sessions (8/44 versus 14/44 neurons, respectively, McNemar's test for proportions with repeated observations, p < 0.05). Additionally, if the cells that responded only during the last 50 min of the sucrose session are not accounted for as water-responsive cells, the ratios between sucralose and sucrose sessions no longer differ (6/53 versus 6/44 neurons, respectively, Fisher Exact test, p > 0.7). Therefore, the effect observed in NAcc neurons was largely due to neuronal response properties that developed later (>10 min) in sucrose sessions. Figures 4G and 4H show an example of a NAcc neuron recorded during a sucrose session that did not respond to water during the initial 10 min (Figure 4G) but developed a significant response during the final 50 min (Figure 4H). The above single-cell results suggest that once a caloric load was introduced, NAcc, but not OFC, neurons changed their overall response properties. We therefore investigated the changes in the overall response patterns of NAcc and OFC neurons by performing principal component analyses (PCAs) on the perievent histograms (PEHs) defined across the licking events for each single unit. We performed PCAs separately for PEHs produced during sucralose and sucrose sessions. Individual PEHs from both NAcc and OFC neurons were projected onto the space generated by the three first principal components derived from sucralose and sucrose sessions separately (Figure 5A). While NAcc (blue) and OFC (red) PEH response patterns displayed a low degree of separation during sucralose sessions, reflecting the low sensitivity of both regions to the noncaloric sweetener sucralose, in sucrose sessions, the equivalent projection (Figure 5B) depicts a much clearer degree of separation between NAcc and OFC response patterns. This separation reflects the abovementioned finding that single neurons in NAcc, but not OFC, showed increased sensitivity during licking for water during sucrose, but not sucralose, sessions. In order to quantify the degree of separation between individual PEHs projected on 3D PCA spaces, we calculated the equivalent Mahalanobis distances between NAcc and OFC [the Mahalanobis distance is a scale-invariant multivariable metric that takes into account the degree of correlation between variables; see Mahalanobis, 1936Mahalanobis P.C. On the generalised distance in statistics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (India). 1936; 12: 49-55Google Scholar]. As predicted from the single-unit studies, distances increased significantly during sucrose sessions when compared with sucralose sessions (mean distance 119.05 ± 58.91 for sucrose and 17.07 ± 5.88 for sucralose sessions, nonparametric Wilcoxon ranking test, z = 3.92, p < 0.00009, Figure 5C). Thus, differences between NAcc and OFC PEH response properties were significantly higher during sucrose sessions when compared with sucralose sessions. The pattern above was maintained even when the analysis was restricted to PEHs obtained during licks for water only (mean distance 42.45 ± 16.79 for sucrose and 13.06 ± 5.65 for sucralose sessions, nonparametric Wilcoxon ranking test, z = 3.12, p < 0.002, Figure 5D). This finding on the water PEHs strongly supports our single-cell analyses. In addition, inspection of the first principal components for each area separately also confirms this overall pattern. Figures 5E and 5F depict, for one recorded animal, the first principal component, plotted against time, obtained from all NAcc (blue) and OFC (red) PEHs entered in the PCA.

We measured the dynamics of performance on a visual task and brain activation in the human primary visual cortex (V1) across the time course of perceptual learning. Within the first few weeks of training, brain activation in a V1 subregion corresponding to the trained visual field quadrant and task performance both increased. However, while performance levels then saturated and were maintained at a constant level, brain activation in the corresponding areas decreased to the level observed before training. These findings indicate that there are distinct temporal phases in the time course of perceptual learning, related to differential dynamics of BOLD activity in visual cortex.

A large number of studies have been devoted to examining PL in the hope of clarifying the link between improved performance of a perceptual task and the underlying plasticity (Ghose et al., 2002Ghose G.M.

So far, most neuroscientific approaches to studying PL have focused on clarifying which brain areas are involved and how the response properties of such area(s) change as a result of the development of PL. However, it remains unclear how sensory plasticity occurs in identified brain areas and how performance and activity change on a long-term basis. The purpose of the present study was to examine how brain activation changes in the visual cortex over a long time course of PL. To study these changes, we used a texture discrimination task (TDT), a standard visual PL task that is known to involve V1 (Karni and Sagi, 1991Karni A. Sagi D.

USA. 1991; 88: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, Schwartz et al., 2002Schwartz S. Maquet P. Frith C.

The functional anatomy of sleep-dependent visual skill learning.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 1666-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). By measuring brain activation during a long time course of PL, we found that the dynamics of performance and brain activation in V1 differ throughout the time course of PL, suggesting that visual plasticity in this task is comprised of two distinct phases in which there is an initial increase in both performance and BOLD activation in visual cortex, followed by a performance saturation and maintenance phase, in which the increase in BOLD activation that occurs during the first phase is no longer related to the maintenance of performance. We propose a model where local neural networks in visual cortex may be reorganized to acquire and consolidate learning, and, once this processes is completed, performance levels may be maintained without the need for further reorganization and consolidation. The TDT that we used, a standard task in studies of visual perceptual learning, is known to have location specificity (Karni and Sagi, 1991Karni A. Sagi D. Where practice makes perfect in texture discrimination: evidence for primary visual cortex plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figure 1, experiment 1 involved six behavioral training sessions and four fMRI sessions. In each training session, we presented a textured display along with a target array that was consistently displayed in the same visual field quadrant (the upper-left visual field). Subjects (n = 6) were presented with two types of stimuli. One was a letter, either the letter “T” or the letter “L,” presented at the central fixation point. The second was a target array presented in a peripheral position for a short duration. These stimuli were intended to fixate the subjects' eyes at the center of the display and to assess learning, respectively. Subjects were asked to first identify the letter and then to report the orientation of the target array (horizontal or vertical). In the interval after presentation of the target array, a mask was presented; we refer to this interval as the stimulus-to-mask-onset asynchrony, or SOA. We employed various SOAs in the training sessions to obtain a psychometric function for determining an 80% threshold SOA. Shortening of this threshold after repetitive performance was considered an indication that PL had taken place (Figure 2A).Figure 2ResultsShow full caption(A) The averaged threshold SOA (±standard errors) across all subjects in experiment 1.(B) Mean performance (±standard errors) in the trained (filled circles) and untrained (open squares) locations in experiment 1.(C and D) Mean location-specific learning indices (+ a standard error) for the fMRI response in V1 as “V1 index” (filled squares) and for performance as “performance index” (open circles with dashed lines) in experiment 1 (C) and experiment 2 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) The averaged threshold SOA (±standard errors) across all subjects in experiment 1.

(C and D) Mean location-specific learning indices (+ a standard error) for the fMRI response in V1 as “V1 index” (filled squares) and for performance as “performance index” (open circles with dashed lines) in experiment 1 (C) and experiment 2 (D). In addition to the training session, subjects took part in four separate imaging sessions, during which we acquired fMRI measurements of brain activation with a 3 Tesla MR scanner and assessed task performance during scanning (for details see Experimental Procedures). Scans were acquired before the start of training (pre-training), 10–25 hr (next day) after initial training (post-training 1; post1), 10–14 days after initial training (post-training 2; post2), and 4 weeks after initial training (post-training 3; post3) (see Figure 1). Each fMRI session involved stimulus presentation in two locations. To estimate a location-specific training effect in V1, in the fMRI sessions we presented the target arrays not only in the trained location, i.e., where subjects were presented this stimulus during the training sessions (in the upper-left visual field), but also in an untrained location (lower-right visual field). While the two location conditions were presented in random order from trial to trial, in an event-related fMRI paradigm, SOA was held constant at 100 ms, as determined from our preliminary data. Figure 2A shows the threshold SOAs observed in the behavioral training sessions. The threshold SOA reached asymptotes in 5–6 days, corresponding to the original literature (Karni and Sagi, 1991Karni A. Sagi D. Where practice makes perfect in texture discrimination: evidence for primary visual cortex plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Figure 2B indicates that, while performance improvement was observed for the trained location [per ANOVA with repeated-measurement, F(3,15) = 17.28, p < 0.001; post hoc t tests for post2 versus pre-training, p < 0.003; post3 versus pre-training, p < 0.03], no significant improvement was observed for the untrained location. Figure 2C shows location-specific performance or fMRI activation defined as f(1, j)/f(1, 0) − f(0, j)/f(0, 0), where f(i, j) represents fMRI performance or BOLD signal in location i (0 = untrained location, 1 = trained location) and in post j (post0 = pre-training session, post1, 2, 3 = post-training session), respectively (see Figure S1 available online for BOLD signal changes). Phase effects in both performance and fMRI activation were significant (ANOVA, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively) in experiment 1. Location-specific performance measured in both post2 and post3 was significantly higher than in the pre-training stage (post hoc t tests, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). To our surprise, however, location-specific fMRI activation in V1 (Figure 2C), which was boosted at post1 and post2 (post hoc t test; p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 for pre- versus post1 and pre- versus post2, respectively), decreased to the baseline level (defined as location-specific activation in V1 in the pre-training session) at post3 (p < 0.70 for pre- and post3). We identified a significant quadratic trend [F(1,5) = 8.9, p < 0.05], which provided evidence of two distinct patterns of dynamic relationships between performance enhancement and neural activation changes in V1, present at different stages during the time course of PL. For the initial few weeks after the onset of training, performance improved and activation increased in V1. After that period, V1 activation enhancement vanished, while the improved performance was maintained. Note that a consistent SOA (100 ms) was used throughout fMRI sessions to evaluate and compare brain activation and performance. A relatively short SOA, which increases the difficulty of the task, had to be used to avoid a ceiling effect at later stages, such as the post2 and post3 scanning sessions. Although the correct response ratio was low in the trained location in the post1 fMRI session (Figure 2B), it does not necessarily indicate that learning did not occur from the pre-training to post1 sessions. Figure 2A shows that the 80% threshold SOA on training day 2 was significantly lower than that on training day 1, indicating that significant learning indeed occurred between training day 1 and day 2. There was a high correlation (r = 0.82) between the degree of SOA threshold improvement from day 1 to day 2 and the degree of change in location-specific fMRI activation from the pre-training to post1 scanning sessions (see Figure S2 for correlations between threshold SOA changes and MRI signal changes). Reduction in V1 activation in experiment 1 was noted after training was terminated, that is, after post2. To test whether the termination of training led to this reduction of V1 activation in post3, we conducted a control experiment, experiment 2, in which a new group of subjects (n = 5) underwent continued training between post2 and post3 (Figure 1); all other conditions were identical to those used in experiment 1. We hypothesized that, if termination of training indeed led to reduced V1 activation at post3, we would not see reduced V1 activation at post3 in experiment 2. However, Figure 2D shows a trend that is generally the same as that observed in experiment 1, which allowed us to conclude that V1 activation reduction is not attributable to the termination of training (see Figure S3 for other behavioral data in experiment 2, and Supplemental Data Text 1 for the discussion of V1 and performance indices in experiments 1 and 2). We analyzed the reaction times for the trained and untrained locations in the fMRI experiments. Figure 3A shows reaction times recorded in response to the texture orientation task in experiment 1. The results of two-way ANOVA (for phase and location) with repeated measurement showed a significant phase effect (p < 0.01) but did not show a significant location effect. Post hoc t tests showed that there were significant differences between the pre-training and post2 scan sessions for both the trained location (p < 0.01) and untrained location (p < 0.01) and between pre-training and post3 for both the trained location (p < 0.001) and untrained location (p < 0.002). We saw the same trend for the reaction times in experiment 2 (Figure S4A). Did the activated region size in V1 in experiment 1 change over time? Figure 3B shows the activated region size in V1. The results of two-way ANOVA with repeated measurement (for phase and location) showed no significant difference for either factor (see Figure S4B for the activated size in V1 in experiment 2). We analyzed subject performance on the fixation letter task over time. Figure 3C shows the correct response ratio for the fixation letter task in experiment 1. The results of ANOVA with repeated measurement showed no significant effects for phase. The ratios were consistently high throughout training, indicating that subjects fixated very well during experiments. The correct response ratio for the fixation letter task in experiment 2 showed the same trend (Figure S4C). In a further experiment, experiment 3, we measured four subjects' reaction times (RTs) and accuracy on the letter task; “fMRI sessions” were conducted in a mock scanner so that only task performance was evaluated. All other conditions were the same as in experiment 1. The results of one-way ANOVA with repeated measurement applied separately to the RTs and accuracy data of experiment 3 did not show significant effects for either RTs or accuracy (Figure S5). These results suggest that performance on the central fixation task remained constant and that the performance benefit for the peripheral task was not due to a differential allocation of attentional resources across the different fMRI sessions. Do other brain areas—including other visual areas, such as V2 and V3, and higher cognitive areas, such as the intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus—show activation changes during the time course of learning similar to those in V1? Since ANOVA indicated no significant difference between experiments 1 and 2, we combined these data and applied ANOVA with repeated measurement (phase) to indices for each of these other brain areas. Except for V1, no significant differences were found in any of these areas (Figure 4). Furthermore, we conducted various other statistical tests to examine V1 selectivity in the development of PL (see Supplemental Data Text 2 for details). Based on the tests, we conclude that no clear results were obtained to support a trend in any area other than V1. Can the fMRI activation drop in V1 from post2 to post3 be attributed to modified attention? We observed no significant differences in either correct response ratios (Figure 2B) or RTs for orientation tasks (Figure 3A) between post2 and post3. Therefore, there was no evidence for a change in the task load. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, there was no significant change in fMRI activation throughout the time course of learning in any area other than V1. Thus, there is no clear evidence that the drop in V1 activation from post2 to post3 was due to modified attention. The present study shows different patterns of BOLD signal and performance changes in a long time course of PL. In the initial stage, both BOLD signal and performance increase. However, in the second stage that occurs after performance saturation, the BOLD signal decreases to the level seen before training. We propose a two-stage model for the development of PL, based on the present results and the close coupling of BOLD signal to synaptic activity (Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K. Pauls J.

Neurometabolic coupling in cerebral cortex reflects synaptic more than spiking activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1308-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In our model, the initial training stage produces an increase in the number or strength of synaptic connections; these synapses both enhance performance and increase the fMRI signal. Note that with 100 ms SOA, we observed neither improved performance for the trained location (Figure 2B) nor location-specific performance improvement at post1 (Figure 2C); however, trained location-specific fMRI activation was enhanced at post1, and the largest degree of performance improvement was observed on training day 2 (Figure 2A). One possible explanation is that synaptic increase/strengthening occurs gradually during the initial weeks of training and, while this increase/strengthening was sufficient to decrease the SOA threshold by training day 2 and to increase trained specific fMRI activation at post1, it was not sufficient for performance to increase before post2 with the short, fixed 100 ms. What underlying mechanism is suggested for the second stage? The findings of this study might also be explained by synaptic downscaling. After performance becomes saturated, the number and/or strength of overall synapses may be reduced or downscaled (Censor et al., 2006Censor N. Karni A. Sagi D. A link between perceptual learning, adaptation and sleep.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 4071-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Tononi and Cirelli, 2003Tononi G. Cirelli C. Sleep and synaptic homeostasis: a hypothesis.Brain Res. Bull. 2003; 62: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). However, only those synapses that are most critical to the task survive such downscaling. If the degree of BOLD activation is indicative of the degree of synaptic activity (Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K. Pauls J. Augath M. Trinath T. Oeltermann A. Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal.Nature. 2001; 412: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar, Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007Viswanathan A. Freeman R.D. Neurometabolic coupling in cerebral cortex reflects synaptic more than spiking activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1308-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the reduced BOLD activation that we observed is in accord with synaptic downscaling. Our model may reconcile a controversy regarding V1 activation associated with PL. While a number of studies have found increases in V1 activation (Furmanski et al., 2004Furmanski C.S. Schluppeck D.

Vogels R. Qian N. Orban G. Practising orientation identification improves orientation coding in V1 neurons.Nature. 2001; 412: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). By measuring brain activity during a long time course of PL, we found that there are two distinct patterns of dynamic relationships between performance enhancement and neural activity changes in V1 at different stages of the PL time course. It may be possible that this controversy seen in the literature actually reflects findings acquired at different stages in the development of PL. It should be noted that the activated region size did not expand in the trained V1 as learning proceeded in our study. The absence of such expansion in the activated region suggests that learning and reorganization were localized. Interestingly, these results are in contrast to the results of a study of motor skill learning (Karni et al., 1995Karni A. Meyer G. Jezzard P. Adams M.M. Turner R. Ungerleider L.G. Functional MRI evidence for adult motor cortex plasticity during motor skill learning.Nature. 1995; 377: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar), which indicated that an initial rapid reduction in the size of the fMRI activated region was followed by expansion. Such contrasting results may be related to differences between the modalities and tasks employed in the two studies. In the present study, we used a visual task to test plasticity in visual cortical areas, including V1, which has a highly retinotopic structure. Learning of the texture discrimination task used here is highly specific to location, which suggests that the learning involves a highly localized network (Karni and Sagi, 1991Karni A. Sagi D. Where practice makes perfect in texture discrimination: evidence for primary visual cortex plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Thus, learning and synaptic changes may occur within such a localized network. There is a possibility that not all aspects of behavioral improvement between the post1 and post2 fMRI sessions are due to learning. Our study involved the TDT with relatively long sessions of 1520 trials. Recent results acquired with this task show that the amount of practice during a session can strongly affect performance, in the way that a larger number of trials can cause fewer improvements (Censor et al., 2006Censor N. Karni A. Sagi D. A link between perceptual learning, adaptation and sleep.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 4071-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Ofen et al., 2007Ofen N. Moran A. Sagi D. Effects of trial repetition in texture discrimination.Vision Res. 2007; 47: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such an effect may be due to suppressive processes related to adaptation in the visual system (Censor et al., 2006Censor N. Karni A. Sagi D. A link between perceptual learning, adaptation and sleep.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 4071-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Ofen et al., 2007Ofen N. Moran A. Sagi D. Effects of trial repetition in texture discrimination.Vision Res. 2007; 47: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, one might suggest that because the SOA in our study was gradually changed from high to low within a training session, a lower staring point may produce lower thresholds and too much adaptation can decrease performance in the next training session. The starting SOAs in the training sessions conducted between the post1 and post2 fMRI sessions (days 2–6) were indeed shortened, and, therefore, the above possibility cannot be entirely ruled out. At the same time, 1 or 2 day intervals separated one training session from the next, and it has been reported that suppressive processes may be largely eliminated during sleep that follows training (Censor et al., 2006Censor N. Karni A. Sagi D. A link between perceptual learning, adaptation and sleep.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 4071-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Variable suppression may account for the behavioral results, but not for the fMRI results in our study, as we used a constant number of trials and a constant SOA in all fMRI sessions. Thus, performance improvement between the post1 and post2 fMRI sessions may be largely attributed to learning, if not completely so. In summary, in the present study, we measured BOLD activation and performance during a long time course of PL and have found that the shapes of the dynamics of BOLD activation and performance differ. During the initial few weeks of training, trained location-specific activation in V1 increased, as did task performance. However, after performance increase became saturated, performance enhancement was maintained, while activation increase disappeared. These results are in accord with our proposed model of plasticity, in which different patterns of synaptic activity occur at different stages. Future studies will be required to address whether the proposed two-stage model could be generalized to other types of PL in the visual system and to other sensory modalities. A total of 15 subjects (8 females and 7 males) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were employed. Six subjects (age range: 29–36 yr, 3 females and 3 males) participated in both the behavioral training and fMRI sessions of experiment 1. Five subjects (22–39 yr, 2 females) in experiment 2. Four subjects (22–28 yr, 3 females) in experiment 3. All subjects gave written informed consent for their participation in the experimental protocol approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University. With their chin and forehead fixed, each subject viewed visual displays on a screen positioned 57 cm from their eyes. All behavioral experiments were conducted in a dimly lit room. We employed a texture discrimination task that has been widely used in visual perceptual learning studies. In each TDT trial, we briefly presented a test stimulus (13 ms) that was followed by a blank screen (presentation period varied by trial) and a mask stimulus composed of randomly oriented V-shaped patterns (100 ms); the mask stimulus was presented in the interval after target array presentation (stimulus-to-mask-onset asynchrony, SOA). The test stimulus consisted of a centrally located letter, either “T” or “L,” and a peripherally positioned horizontal or vertical array of three diagonal bars (target arrays) on a background of horizontal bars. While keeping their eyes fixated on the center of the visual field, subjects were asked to respond twice for each trial: once to identify the letter and once to indicate the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the target array. The fixation letter task was intended to ensure the subjects' focus and fixation at the center of the visual field; the target array discrimination task was used as a measure of perceptual learning. Each line segment of the peripheral target array was arranged within a 19 × 19 lattice in the area of a 14° × 14° visual angle. Lines were 0.43° × 0.07° and spaced 0.7° apart. The position of each line segment was jittered slightly, by 0°–0.05°, from trial to trial. The position of the target array also varied randomly from trial to trial, but was consistently presented within a specific quadrant (see below) and within a 2.95°–5.15° visual angle from the center of the display. All line segments were gray (32 cd/m2) and presented on a black (0.5 cd/m2) background. Immediate auditory feedback was given only for the fixation letter task to facilitate subjects' fixation. No feedback was given for the orientation task in this experiment following the order to adhere to the original task procedure developed by Karni and Sagi (Karni and Sagi, 1991Karni A. Sagi D.

During the training sessions, the horizontal or vertical target array was presented only in the upper-left visual field quadrant. Each training session contained 1520 trials, presented in 40 blocks. Each block contained 38 trials with a constant SOA. Each training session started with a block with a longer SOA, for instance 250 ms, which was decremented by 20–40 ms every two to four blocks. As training proceeded, the SOA in each block was shortened, thus increasing the difficulty of the task. An initial SOA was determined daily and individually based on earlier performances. The percentage of correct responses was calculated for each SOA in order to construct a psychometric function for determining the threshold SOA, at which subjects reach 80% correct responses by interpolation. Subjects took part in training sessions once every 2 or 3 days. Experiments 1 and 3 involved six training sessions. Experiment 2 included an additional eight sessions, thus a total of 14 sessions. Scanning sessions were conducted on four separate occasions: at the pre-training, post1, post2, and post3 sessions shown in Figure 1. Stimuli were generated on a Mac G4 and presented via LCD projector (Sharp Note Vision 6). The fMRI experiments involved two location conditions for presentation of the target arrays, which were displayed in random order in either the upper-left visual field (trained condition) or lower-right visual field (untrained condition), using an event-related fMRI paradigm. In the event-related paradigm, the timing for the presentation of each condition was calculated with optseq2 software (Dale, 1999Dale A.M. Optimal experimental design for event-related fMRI.Hum. Brain Mapp. 1999; 8: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, Dale et al., 1999bDale, A.M., Greve, D.N., and Burock, M.A. (1999b). Optimal stimulus sequences for event-realted fMRI. In 5th International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain (Duesseldorf, Germany).Google Scholar) to randomize the interstimulus interval from trial to trial for maximized the statistical efficiency. We presented 128 trials for each of the two locations during each fMRI session; a single trial lasted 2 s. At the beginning of each trial, a blue or green fixation cross was presented for 500 ms, followed by a blank screen for 250 ms. The color of the fixation cross served as a cue for the location of a target array to follow. A blue fixation cross indicated that the target array would appear in the upper-left (trained) quadrant; a green cross indicated that the array would appear in the lower-right quadrant. A target texture was then presented for ∼20 ms (the temporal resolution limit of the display), followed by a mask for 100 ms; the SOA was a constant 100 ms. As in the behavioral training session, subjects were asked to respond to the fixation and orientation tasks by pressing a button on a box that they held in their hand. Immediate auditory feedback was given only for the fixation letter task, to facilitate subjects' fixation. Subjects were scanned in a 3T MR scanner (Allegra or Trio, Siemens); a head coil was used throughout the experiments. Functional MR images were acquired using gradient echo EPI sequences (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°) for measurement of BOLD contrast. Thirty-five contiguous slices (3 × 3 × 3.5 mm3) oriented parallel to the AC-PC plane were acquired to cover the entire brain. All functional data were registered to the individual anatomically reconstructed brain (Dale et al., 1999aDale A.M. Fischl B. Sereno M.I. Cortical surface-based analysis. I. Segmentation and surface reconstruction.Neuroimage. 1999; 9: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, Fischl et al., 1999Fischl B. Sereno M.I. Dale A.M. Cortical surface-based analysis. II: Inflation, flattening, and a surface-based coordinate system.Neuroimage. 1999; 9: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (4101) Google Scholar). For the anatomical reconstruction, we acquired three T1-weighted MR images (MPRAGE) (TR = 2.531 s, TE = 3.28 ms, flip angle = 7°, TI = 1100 ms, 256 slices, voxel size = 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.0 mm3, resliced during analysis to 1 mm3). This same anatomical reconstruction was used for brain parcellation to localize individual gyri and sulci (Fischl et al., 2004Fischl B. van der Kouwe A. Destrieux C. Halgren E. Segonne F. Salat D.H. Busa E. Seidman L.J. Goldstein J. Kennedy D. et al.Automatically parcellating the human cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). Four retinotopic quadrants (upper left, upper right, lower right, and lower left of the visual field) of V1, V2, and V3/VP areas were localized individually in a separate fMRI session that used a standard flickering checkerboard pattern (Engel et al., 1994Engel S.A. Rumelhart D.E. Wandell B.A. Lee A.T. Glover G.H. Chichilnisky E.J. Shadlen M.N. fMRI of human visual cortex.Nature. 1994; 369: 525Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, Fize et al., 2003Fize D.

The retinotopic organization of primate dorsal V4 and surrounding areas: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study in awake monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7395-7406PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, eccentricity was localized individually by using annulus stimuli of various sizes. In the subsequent analysis, we used regions of 3°–5° of eccentricity in V1, V2, and V3/VP. Because the retinotopy of V4 is controversial (Wandell et al., 2005Wandell B.A. Brewer A.A. Dougherty R.F. Visual field map clusters in human cortex.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), V4 was not included in our analysis. The middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, and interparietal sulcus were identified individually using the brain parcellation method (Fischl et al., 2004Fischl B. van der Kouwe A. Destrieux C. Halgren E. Segonne F. Salat D.H. Busa E. Seidman L.J. Goldstein J. Kennedy D. et al.Automatically parcellating the human cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with FS-FAST and FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) software. All functional images were motion corrected (Cox and Jesmanowicz, 1999Cox R.W. Jesmanowicz A. Real-time 3D image registration for functional MRI.Magn. Reson. Med. 1999; 42: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 5.0 mm (FWHM), and normalized individually across scans. In this normalization process, the mean intensity for the entire functional volume was computed for each scan. The global mean of the entire brain was rescaled so that the same mean was set across scans. A finite impulse response model (Burock and Dale, 2000Burock M.A. Dale A.M. Estimation and detection of event-related fMRI signals with temporally correlated noise: a statistically efficient and unbiased approach.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2000; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was employed to estimate hemodynamic response (time course) to each condition (trained or untrained locations) in each ROI, in 20 1 s interval time points. The time courses for each condition, for each ROI, were then converted into percent signal changes, by subtraction and division of the mean value of the ROI. Note that the mean value of each ROI, which is a part of the entire functional volume, was not assured to be the same across the different fMRI sessions. To compute a location-specific response index in V1, we first normalized the peak hemodynamic response (4–6 s from stimulus onset) at each session by dividing it by the peak response in the pre-training session. The normalized value of the upper-left V1, which corresponded to the untrained location, for the untrained condition, was then subtracted from the normalized value of the lower-right V1, which corresponded to the trained location, for the trained condition at each session, respectively. Response indices for V2 and V3 were computed in the same way as for V1. Response indices for the middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus were computed by subtracting the normalized value of the left hemisphere of each region in the untrained condition from the normalized value of the right hemisphere of each region during the trained condition.

Increased p16 expression with replicative senescence was associated with decreased levels of miR-24, a microRNA that was predicted to associate with the p16 mRNA coding and 3'-untranslated regions. Ectopic miR-24 overexpression reduced p16 protein but not p16 mRNA levels. Conversely, introduction of antisense (AS)-miR-24 blocked miR-24 expression and markedly enhanced p16 protein levels, p16 translation, and the production of EGFP-p16 reporter bearing the miR-24 target recognition sites.Together, our results suggest that miR-24 represses the initiation and elongation phases of p16 translation."
https://openalex.org/W2088301401,"End binding 1 (EB1) is a plus-end-tracking protein (+TIP) that localizes to microtubule plus ends where it modulates their dynamics and interactions with intracellular organelles1,2. Although the regulating activity of EB1 on microtubule dynamics has been studied in cells3,4,5,6 and purified systems7,8,9,10,11,12,13, the molecular mechanisms involved in its specific activity are still unclear. Here, we describe how EB1 regulates the dynamics and structure of microtubules assembled from pure tubulin. We found that EB1 stimulates spontaneous nucleation and growth of microtubules, and promotes both catastrophes (transitions from growth to shrinkage) and rescues (reverse events). Electron cryomicroscopy showed that EB1 induces the initial formation of tubulin sheets, which rapidly close into the common 13-protofilament-microtubule architecture. Our results suggest that EB1 favours the lateral association of free tubulin at microtubule-sheet edges, thereby stimulating nucleation, sheet growth and closure. The reduction of sheet length at microtubule growing-ends together with the elimination of stressed microtubule lattices may account for catastrophes. Conversely, occasional binding of EB1 to the microtubule lattice may induce rescues."
https://openalex.org/W2152913045,"In the cerebral cortex, GABAergic interneurons are often regarded as fast-spiking cells. We have identified a type of slow-spiking interneuron that offers distinct contributions to network activity. “Ivy” cells, named after their dense and fine axons innervating mostly basal and oblique pyramidal cell dendrites, are more numerous than the parvalbumin-expressing basket, bistratified, or axo-axonic cells. Ivy cells express nitric oxide synthase, neuropeptide Y, and high levels of GABAA receptor α1 subunit; they discharge at a low frequency with wide spikes in vivo, yet are distinctively phase-locked to behaviorally relevant network rhythms including theta, gamma, and ripple oscillations. Paired recordings in vitro showed that Ivy cells receive depressing EPSPs from pyramidal cells, which in turn receive slowly rising and decaying inhibitory input from Ivy cells. In contrast to fast-spiking interneurons operating with millisecond precision, the highly abundant Ivy cells express presynaptically acting neuromodulators and regulate the excitability of pyramidal cell dendrites through slowly rising and decaying GABAergic inputs.

In contrast to fast-spiking interneurons operating with millisecond precision, the highly abundant Ivy cells express presynaptically acting neuromodulators and regulate the excitability of pyramidal cell dendrites through slowly rising and decaying GABAergic inputs. The activity of cortical neurons is embedded in network oscillations, which constitute a function of ongoing network operations, that are associated with behavior and the state of vigilance (Steriade et al., 2001Steriade M. Timofeev I. Grenier F. Natural waking and sleep states: a view from inside neocortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1969-1985PubMed Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, theta oscillations (4–10 Hz) occur during exploration and rapid eye movement sleep (Vanderwolf, 1969Vanderwolf C.H. Hippocampal electrical activity and voluntary movement in the rat.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1969; 26: 407-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), together with gamma oscillations (30–80 Hz) (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J. Jamieson B. Wise K.D. Buzsaki G. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of the behaving rat.Neuron. 2003; 37: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), which also correlate with working memory, conceptual categorization, attention, and perception (Singer and Gray, 1995Singer W. Gray C.M. Visual feature integration and the temporal correlation hypothesis.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 555-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Sharp wave-associated ripples (100–200 Hz) occur in the hippocampus during consummatory behaviors and slow-wave sleep, and structure temporally compressed replay of waking neuronal activity (Buzsaki et al., 1983Buzsaki G. Leung L.-W. Vanderwolf C.H. Cellular bases of hippocampal EEG in the behaving rat.Brain Res. 1983; 287: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J.

Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon, Oxford1978Google Scholar). The different network states also require differential global state-dependent modulation, which is mostly provided by subcortical aminergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, and thalamic inputs. However, local slow signals may also make a contribution to regulating networks states, as can be assumed from the expression of a large number of neuropeptides by cortical neurons (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsaki G. Interneurons of the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oscillations in pyramidal cells (Soltesz and Deschenes, 1993Soltesz I. Deschenes M.

Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 97-116PubMed Google Scholar) are shaped by the differential contribution of specialized GABAergic interneuron classes (Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurko A.

In the cerebral cortex, different classes of GABAergic cell target specific subcellular domains of pyramidal cells (Ali et al., 1998Ali A.B. Deuchars J. Pawelzik H. Thomson A.M.

Klausberger T. Defined types of cortical interneurone structure space and spike timing in the hippocampus.J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). For example, basket cells innervate somata and proximal dendrites, whereas axo-axonic cells exclusively target axon-initial segments, and hippocampal bistratified cells innervate basal and oblique pyramidal cell dendrites (Somogyi et al., 1998Somogyi P. Tamas G. Lujan R. Buhl E.H. Salient features of synaptic organisation in the cerebral cortex.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Similarly, cortical neuronal diversity has been explored on the basis of firing patterns; fast-spiking cells are recognized as interneurons (Connors et al., 1982Connors B.W. Gutnick M.J. Prince D.A.

Studies on single neurons in dorsal hippocampal formation and septum in unrestrained rats. Part 1. Behavioral correlates and firing repertoires.Exp. Neurol. 1973; 42: 461-531Google Scholar). As a result, most studies using extracellular unit recordings in behaving animals (Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurko A. Mamiya A. Buzsaki G. Oscillatory coupling of hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons in the behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 274-287PubMed Google Scholar) define interneurons by their narrow spike width and exclude slow-spiking units (Nitz and McNaughton, 2004Nitz D. McNaughton B. Differential modulation of CA1 and dentate gyrus interneurons during exploration of novel environments.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (e.g., firing rate <5 Hz). Immunohistochemical studies and gene expression profiles have distinguished interneuron populations according to the expression of molecular markers such as parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SM)-, cholecystokinin (CCK)-, or calretinin (CR)-immunoreactivities (Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002Kawaguchi Y.

Correlation maps allow neuronal electrical properties to be predicted from single-cell gene expression profiles in rat neocortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 1310-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The electrophysiological and neurochemical characteristics of some interneurons have been found to correlate. For example, PV-expressing interneurons in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer (basket, bistratified, and axo-axonic cells) often display a fast-spiking pattern of firing (Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005Somogyi P. Klausberger T. Defined types of cortical interneurone structure space and spike timing in the hippocampus.J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Many studies have concentrated on these cells throughout the cortex, but they may not represent the majority of GABAergic neurons, since large populations of interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) (Allen et al., 1983Allen Y.S. Adrian T.E. Allen J.M. Tatemoto K. Crow T.J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M. Neuropeptide Y distribution in the rat brain.Science. 1983; 221: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) or the neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase isoform (nNOS) (Czeh et al., 2005Czeh B. Hajnal A. Seress L. NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons of the rat hippocampal formation: regional distribution, total number and colocalization with calcium binding proteins.Prague Med.

Patterns of expression of calcium binding proteins and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in different populations of hippocampal GABAergic neurons in mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 449: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have also been reported. NO and NPY are implicated in regulating excitability and synaptic plasticity (Arancio et al., 1996Arancio O. Kiebler M. Lee C.J. Lev-Ram V. Tsien R.Y. Kandel E.R. Hawkins R.D.

Physiol. 1987; 383: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), yet little is known about the neuronal identity of their sources. In the present study we have tested the hypothesis that NPY- and nNOS-expressing cells make contributions to network activity that are different from those made by PV-expressing interneurons. Furthermore, we have identified these cells based on their axo-dendritic distributions, their firing patterns, and the properties of their synaptic inputs and outputs, and we have quantified their abundance in relation to PV-expressing cells. We tested the abundance of nNOS- or NPY-expressing cells relative to PV-positive interneurons in the rat hippocampal CA1 area using the optical disector method and confocal laser scanning microscopy (Figure 1). In a triple immunoreaction, cells coexpressing nNOS and NPY were the most abundant population (37%), larger than the population expressing only PV (basket and axo-axonic cells, 26%) or PV and NPY (including bistratified cells; 15%) (Figure 1B and Table S1 available online). All NPY and nNOS coexpressing cells were PV immunonegative. The somata of the majority of these cells were located in stratum pyramidale and adjacent stratum radiatum, consistent with previous reports on nNOS (Czeh et al., 2005Czeh B. Hajnal A. Seress L. NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons of the rat hippocampal formation: regional distribution, total number and colocalization with calcium binding proteins.Prague Med. Rep. 2005; 106: 261-274PubMed Google Scholar, Jinno and Kosaka, 2002Jinno S. Kosaka T. Patterns of expression of calcium binding proteins and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in different populations of hippocampal GABAergic neurons in mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 449: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Further quadruple immunolabeling (Figure S1, available online, and Table S2) showed that all NPY and nNOS coexpressing cells were strongly immunopositive for the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor (GABAAR-α1) along the plasma membrane (n = 382), but less than 5% of NPY and nNOS coexpressing cells were immunopositive for CR, calbindin (CB), or SM (cells evaluated: n = 123, 148, and 137, respectively), similar to previous results on nNOS distribution (Czeh et al., 2005Czeh B. Hajnal A. Seress L. NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons of the rat hippocampal formation: regional distribution, total number and colocalization with calcium binding proteins.Prague Med. Rep. 2005; 106: 261-274PubMed Google Scholar, Jinno and Kosaka, 2002Jinno S. Kosaka T. Patterns of expression of calcium binding proteins and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in different populations of hippocampal GABAergic neurons in mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 449: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the somata of 75% of NPY and nNOS coexpressing cells in stratum pyramidale (n = 134) were also strongly immunolabeled in their somata for α-actinin-2, a cytoskeletal protein involved in cell signaling (Figure S1 and Table S2). Qualitative visual inspection revealed large populations of interneurons coexpressing NPY, nNOS, and GABAAR-α1 in other regions of the hippocampus (CA2 and CA3 areas, dentate gyrus), and in extra-hippocampal cortical regions (subiculum, somatosensory cortex, and entorhinal cortex). Overall, these results reveal the existence of a major and distinct population of nNOS-, NPY-, and GABAAR-α1-expressing interneurons. To determine the spike timing and axo-dendritic identity of NPY and nNOS coexpressing cells, we recorded interneurons in stratum pyramidale of anaesthetized rats and labeled them by the juxtacellular method for histological analysis. Four nNOS-expressing cells (P2a, T98e, T134a, and T140b) were recorded with their somata located in stratum pyramidale (Figure 2A). The soma area measured in the largest cross-section ranged from 87 to 145 μm2, with the long axis between 13 and 19 μm and the short axis between 8 and 15 μm; the somata emitted five or six primary dendrites. The smooth, radially oriented dendrites (total extent: medio-lateral, 0.21 ± 0.05 mm; rostro-caudal, 0.35 ± 0.06 mm) rarely reached the border of stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The main axons profusely branched close to their origin, providing uncommonly dense, thin branches with minuscule varicosities, and extended 0.75 ± 0.12 mm in the medio-lateral and 1.31 ± 0.11 mm in the rostro-caudal directions. This cell type is distinguished by the exceptionally dense and fine axonal arborization close to the soma in strata oriens, radiatum, or both, and due to the resemblance of the axonal pattern to the ivy plant, so abundant in the English countryside, this interneuron type was named the “Ivy” cell. The axons of Ivy cells innervated strata radiatum and oriens to varying degrees (Figure 3A).Figure 3Axonal Arborizations and Synaptic Targets of Ivy CellsShow full caption(A) Axonal distributions of Ivy cells (n = 4) and bistratified cells (n = 5) are significantly different (∗p = 0.016). Axons were sampled in defined areas (see text) of stratum oriens (str. or.), proximal stratum radiatum (str. rad. prox.), and next to stratum lacunosum-moleculare in distal stratum radiatum (str. rad. dist.) from one 70-μm-thick section containing the soma. Bars represent means, and symbols, individual measurements. The axonal sample of Ivy cells in stratum oriens was one order of magnitude higher than that of bistratified cells (1.604 ± 0.564 and 0.148 ± 0.033 mm, respectively). The Ivy cell (T134a) with the lowest amount of axon in stratum oriens had the highest amount in stratum radiatum (gray line).

Axons were sampled in defined areas (see text) of stratum oriens (str. or.), proximal stratum radiatum (str. rad. prox.), and next to stratum lacunosum-moleculare in distal stratum radiatum (str. rad. dist.) from one 70-μm-thick section containing the soma. Bars represent means, and symbols, individual measurements. The axonal sample of Ivy cells in stratum oriens was one order of magnitude higher than that of bistratified cells (1.604 ± 0.564 and 0.148 ± 0.033 mm, respectively).

Due to the overlap in layer preference of the axonal arborizations of Ivy cells and the previously reported PV-expressing bistratified cells (Buhl et al., 1994Buhl E.H. Halasy K. Somogyi P.

Neurol. 2002; 443: 346-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we compared their axons quantitatively. The two-dimensionally projected axonal length was measured for every cell in three 100 × 100 μm squares in stratum oriens and proximal and distal stratum radiatum in a 70-μm-thick section containing the soma (Figure 3A). The squares were centered radially in line with the soma. The total projected axonal length of Ivy cells in the measured areas (2140 ± 325 μm; n = 4) was significantly longer (p = 0.016) than that of bistratified cells (954 ± 68 μm; n = 5, cells reported previously) (Klausberger et al., 2004Klausberger T. Marton L.F. Baude A. Roberts J.D.B. Magill P. Somogyi P. Spike timing of dendrite-targeting bistratified cells during hippocampal network oscillations in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Ivy cells concentrated their axons next to stratum pyramidale, and thus axonal length quickly decreased as a function of distance from the soma. Conversely, the axonal fields of bistratified cells were more homogeneous across stratum radiatum, and somewhat sparser in stratum oriens (Figure 3A). The projected axonal length of Ivy cells in stratum oriens was ten times greater than that of bistratified cells (Figure 3A), a finding which suggests a massive difference in axon density between the two cell types. Random samples of axons from three Ivy cells were further evaluated by electron microscopy to identify their postsynaptic targets. In contrast to most interneuron axons, the thin axons of Ivy cells had rather insignificant boutons containing a modest number of vesicles and infrequent mitochondria. In addition, vesicles were frequently found in preterminal axons away from synaptic specializations. The areas of presynaptic boutons from Ivy cells (n = 9 for P2a; n = 13 for T134a; n = 10 for T140b) and bistratified cells (n = 9 for T79e; n = 9 for T92a; n = 10 for T96b) were measured with electron microscopy from one 70-nm-thick section containing the synaptic specialization. The bouton areas of Ivy cells (100.6 ± 53.4 × 103 nm2) were significantly smaller (p < 0.0001) than those of bistratified cells (198.5 ± 93.2 × 103 nm2). The randomly sampled synapses (n = 11 for P2a; n = 13 for T134b; n = 10 for T140b) had small synaptic junctions targeting mainly dendritic shafts (81%, Figures 3E and 3H) of pyramidal cells, including basal dendrites in stratum oriens and oblique dendritic shafts in stratum radiatum. Both basal and oblique dendrites are also innervated by PV-expressing bistratified cells. The mean diameter of pyramidal cell dendrites postsynaptic to Ivy cells was 0.49 ± 0.25 μm (n = 28), and not significantly different (p = 0.052) from the targets of bistratified cells (0.58 ± 0.13 μm, n = 27). Dendritic spines (13%) and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells (6%) were less frequent postsynaptic targets. Interneurons were not found among the synaptic targets in the random sample, and the identity of two postsynaptic targets could not be unequivocally determined. In addition to the random sample, we specifically tested potential postsynaptic targets of Ivy cell T134a in the pyramidal cell layer. Of the 20 axonal varicosities examined in serial electron microscopic sections, five could be shown to establish synaptic junctions, three with small dendritic shafts and two with somata of pyramidal cells. Because only a small fraction of the axon was within the pyramidal cell layer, somata comprise only a small proportion of the overall targets of this cell. The labeled Ivy cells were tested for the expression of various molecular cell markers involved in intercellular signaling using immunofluorescence microscopy (Table 1). All four Ivy cells were immunopositive for nNOS in their somata (Figure 2C), proximal dendrites, or axons (Figures 3C and 3D). Three tested Ivy cells were immunopositive for NPY (soma), GABAAR-α1 (somato-dendritic plasma membrane), and GAD (axon), confirming their identity as GABAergic interneurons (Figure 2C, Figure S2, and Table 1). None of the four cells expressed PV or SM, differentiating them from bistratified cells (Klausberger et al., 2004Klausberger T. Marton L.F. Baude A. Roberts J.D.B. Magill P. Somogyi P.

Furthermore, the tested cells were immunonegative for CCK, CB, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), CR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α (mGlur1α), α-actinin-2 (one cell tested), μ-opioid receptor, preprotachykinin A or B, the Kv3.1b subunit of K+ channel, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 8a (mGlur8a) in their input terminals (Table 1).Table 1Molecular Expression Profile of Ivy Cells as Tested by ImmunocytochemistryCellP2aT98eT134aT140bnNOS++++NPY+nt++GABAAR α1+nt++GAD++nt+PV----SM----CCK-nt--CB---ntVIPnt---CR-nt-ntKv3.1b-ntnt-M2 receptor--ntntPPTA-nt-ntPPTBntnt--mGluR1α-ntntntmGluR8αnt-ntntα-actinin-2-ntntntμ-opioid receptor-ntntntM2, muscarinic receptor 2; nt, not tested; PPTA, pre-protachikinin-A; PPTB, pre-protachikinin-B.

The firing of four identified Ivy cells was recorded during theta oscillations (4.2 ± 0.1 Hz), gamma oscillations (39.6 ± 1.5 Hz), and sharp wave-associated ripples (118 ± 5.7 Hz). The four Ivy cells discharged at similar frequencies (p = 0.276, Kruskal-Wallis test) during theta oscillations, non-theta/non-sharp wave periods, and sharp wave-associated ripples (0.7 ± 0.7, 1.7 ± 0.3, and 0.8 ± 1.1 Hz, respectively; Table S3), but discharge rates of single cells varied considerably within the same brain state (Figure S3). Although discharge frequencies were low, Ivy cells showed clear phase preferences during hippocampal rhythms. They fired after the trough (30.7° ± 63.1°, mean angle ± angular deviation; 0° and 360° mark the trough) of the theta cycles recorded extracellularly in stratum pyramidale (Figure 4A, Table S3), just after the maximum discharge probability of pyramidal cells (Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J.

Phase preference, discharge frequency, and probability were all significantly different from those of bistratified cells (Figure S3). Like pyramidal cells (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J.

Mechanisms of gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of the behaving rat.Neuron. 2003; 37: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), recorded Ivy cells fired in a sparse (0.7 ± 0.6 Hz) yet phase-modulated way (Rayleigh test, p < 0.01; r = 0.29 ± 0.07), which correlated with the troughs of gamma oscillations (10.6° ± 68°, Figure 4B). When Ivy cell firing during ripple oscillations was compared with their firing during neighboring non-theta/non-sharp wave episodes, it did not differ significantly in rate (Figure 4C). However, Ivy cells remained silent during the large majority of ripple episodes (>90%, Figure S3). The action potentials recorded from Ivy cells were unusually broad for interneurons; we compared them here with the spikes of eight fast-spiking bistratified cells also recorded in vivo and reported previously (Klausberger et al., 2004Klausberger T.

https://openalex.org/W2044509030,"Background Housekeeping genes are needed in every tissue as their expression is required for survival, integrity or duplication of every cell. Housekeeping genes commonly have been used as reference genes to normalize gene expression data, the underlying assumption being that they are expressed in every cell type at approximately the same level. Often, the terms “reference genes” and “housekeeping genes” are used interchangeably. In this paper, we would like to distinguish between these terms. Consensus is growing that housekeeping genes which have traditionally been used to normalize gene expression data are not good reference genes. Recently, ribosomal protein genes have been suggested as reference genes based on a meta-analysis of publicly available microarray data. Methodology/Principal Findings We have applied several statistical tools on a dataset of 70 microarrays representing 22 different tissues, to assess and visualize expression stability of ribosomal protein genes. We confirmed the housekeeping status of these genes, but further estimated expression stability across tissues in order to assess their potential as reference genes. One- and two-way ANOVA revealed that all ribosomal protein genes have significant expression variation across tissues and exhibit tissue-dependent expression behavior as a group. Via multidimensional unfolding analysis, we visualized this tissue-dependency. In addition, we explored mechanisms that may cause tissue dependent effects of individual ribosomal protein genes. Conclusions/Significance Here we provide statistical and biological evidence that ribosomal protein genes exhibit important tissue-dependent variation in mRNA expression. Though these genes are most stably expressed of all investigated genes in a meta-analysis they cannot be considered true reference genes."
https://openalex.org/W2106297617,"The bHLH transcription factor DIMMED has been associated with the differentiation of peptidergic cells in Drosophila. However, whether all Drosophila peptidergic cells express DIMM, and the extent to which all DIMM cells are peptidergic, have not been determined. To address these issues, we have mapped DIMM expression in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery in the late larval stage Drosophila. At 100 hr after egg-laying, DIMM immunosignals are largely congruent with a dimm-promoter reporter (c929-GAL4) and they present a stereotyped pattern of 306 CNS cells and 52 peripheral cells. We assigned positional values for all DIMM CNS cells with respect to reference gene expression patterns, or to patterns of secondary neuroblast lineages. We could assign provisional peptide identities to 68% of DIMM-expressing CNS cells (207/306) and to 73% of DIMM-expressing peripheral cells (38/52) using a panel of 24 markers for Drosophila neuropeptide genes. Furthermore, we found that DIMM co-expression was a prevalent feature within single neuropeptide marker expression patterns. Of the 24 CNS neuropeptide gene patterns we studied, six patterns are >90% DIMM-positive, while 16 of 22 patterns are >40% DIMM-positive. Thus most or all DIMM cells in Drosophila appear to be peptidergic, and many but not all peptidergic cells express DIMM. The co-incidence of DIMM-expression among peptidergic cells is best explained by a hypothesis that DIMM promotes a specific neurosecretory phenotype we term LEAP. LEAP denotes Large cells that display Episodic release of Amidated Peptides."

However, abundant TG2 activity was detected around the wound in a standard cultured fibroblast scratch assay. To demonstrate wounding-induced activation of TG2 in vivo, the toll-like receptor 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), was injected in mice to trigger small intestinal injury. Although no TG2 activity was detected in vehicle-treated mice, acute poly(I:C) injury resulted in rapid TG2 activation in the small intestinal mucosa. Our findings provide a new basis for understanding the role of TG2 in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005682388,"Background Climate warming is causing environmental change making both marine and terrestrial organisms, and even humans, more susceptible to emerging diseases. Coral reefs are among the most impacted ecosystems by climate stress, and immunity of corals, the most ancient of metazoans, is poorly known. Although coral mortality due to infectious diseases and temperature-related stress is on the rise, the immune effector mechanisms that contribute to the resistance of corals to such events remain elusive. In the Caribbean sea fan corals (Anthozoa, Alcyonacea: Gorgoniidae), the cell-based immune defenses are granular acidophilic amoebocytes, which are known to be involved in wound repair and histocompatibility. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate for the first time in corals that these cells are involved in the organismal response to pathogenic and temperature stress. In sea fans with both naturally occurring infections and experimental inoculations with the fungal pathogen Aspergillus sydowii, an inflammatory response, characterized by a massive increase of amoebocytes, was evident near infections. Melanosomes were detected in amoebocytes adjacent to protective melanin bands in infected sea fans; neither was present in uninfected fans. In naturally infected sea fans a concurrent increase in prophenoloxidase activity was detected in infected tissues with dense amoebocytes. Sea fans sampled in the field during the 2005 Caribbean Bleaching Event (a once-in-hundred-year climate event) responded to heat stress with a systemic increase in amoebocytes and amoebocyte densities were also increased by elevated temperature stress in lab experiments. Conclusions/Significance The observed amoebocyte responses indicate that sea fan corals use cellular defenses to combat fungal infection and temperature stress. The ability to mount an inflammatory response may be a contributing factor that allowed the survival of even infected sea fan corals during a stressful climate event."
https://openalex.org/W2118067527,"PICK1 is a calcium-sensing, PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts with GluR2 and GluR3 AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits and regulates their trafficking. Although PICK1 has been principally implicated in long-term depression (LTD), PICK1 overexpression in CA1 pyramidal neurons causes a CaMK- and PKC-dependent potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission and an increase in synaptic GluR2-lacking AMPARs, mechanisms associated with NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we directly tested whether PICK1 participates in both hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD. We show that the PICK1 potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission is NMDAR dependent and fully occludes LTP. Conversely, blockade of PICK1 PDZ interactions or lack of PICK1 prevents LTP. These observations demonstrate an important role for PICK1 in LTP. In addition, deletion of PICK1 or blockade of PICK1 PDZ binding prevented NMDAR-dependent LTD. Thus, PICK1 plays a critical role in bidirectional NMDAR-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2095571974,"During mitosis, kinetochores form persistent attachments to microtubule tips and undergo corrective detachment in response to phosphorylation by Ipl1 (Aurora B) kinase1. The Dam1 complex is required to establish and maintain bi-oriented attachment to microtubule tips in vivo, and it contains multiple sites phosphorylated by Ipl1 (Refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Moreover, a number of kinetochore-like functions can be reconstituted in vitro with pure Dam1 complex11,12,13,14. These functions are believed to derive from the ability of the complex to self-assemble into rings12,13,15,16,17. Here we show that rings are not necessary for dynamic microtubule attachment, Ipl1-dependent modulation of microtubule affinity or the ability of Dam1 to move processively with disassembling microtubule tips. Using two fluorescence-based assays, we found that the complex exhibited a high affinity for microtubules (Kd of approximately 6 nM) that was reduced by phosphorylation at Ser 20, a single Ipl1 target residue in Dam1. Moreover, individual complexes underwent one-dimensional diffusion along microtubules and detached 2.5-fold more frequently after phosphorylation by Ipl1. Particles consisting of one to four Dam1 complexes — too few to surround a microtubule — were captured and carried by disassembling tips. Thus, even a small number of binding elements could provide a dynamic, phosphoregulated microtubule attachment and thereby facilitate accurate chromosome segregation."

To discover potential underlying mechanism(s) for this we evaluated the muscle protein synthesis process in postabsorptive conditions and during feeding in twenty-nine 65–80 year old men (n = 13) and women (n = 16). We discovered that the basal concentration of phosphorylated eEF2Thr56 was ∼40% less (P<0.05) and the basal rate of MPS was ∼30% greater (P = 0.02) in women than in men; the basal concentrations of muscle phosphorylated AktThr308, p70s6kThr389, eIF4ESer209, and eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 were not different between the sexes. Feeding increased (P<0.05) AktThr308 and p70s6kThr389 phosphorylation to the same extent in men and women but increased (P<0.05) the phosphorylation of eIF4ESer209 and eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 in men only. Accordingly, feeding increased MPS in men (P<0.01) but not in women. The postabsorptive muscle mRNA concentrations for myoD and myostatin were not different between sexes; feeding doubled myoD mRNA (P<0.05) and halved that of myostatin (P<0.05) in both sexes. Thus, there is sexual dimorphism in MPS and its control in older adults; a greater basal rate of MPS, operating over most of the day may partially explain the slower loss of muscle in older women."
https://openalex.org/W2050495774,"Olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor converge axons onto a few topographically fixed glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, leading to establishment of the odor map. Here, we report that BIG-2/contactin-4, an axonal glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed in a subpopulation of mouse olfactory sensory neurons. A mosaic pattern of glomerular arrangement is observed with strongly BIG-2-positive, weakly positive, and negative axon terminals in the olfactory bulb, which is overlapping but not identical with those of Kirrel2 and ephrin-A5. There is a close correlation between the BIG-2 expression level and the odorant receptor choice in individual sensory neurons. In BIG-2-deficient mice, olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor frequently innervate multiple glomeruli at ectopic locations. These results suggest that BIG-2 is one of the axon guidance molecules crucial for the formation and maintenance of functional odor map in the olfactory bulb."

https://openalex.org/W1965208860,"Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) play a role in remodeling the extracellular matrix during brain development and have been implicated in synaptic plasticity. Here, we report that a member of the neuronal pentraxin (NP) family, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR), undergoes regulated cleavage by the MMP tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). NPR is enriched at excitatory synapses where it associates with AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) and enhances synaptogenesis. However, in response to activation of group 1 mGluRs (mGluR1/5), TACE cleaves NPR and releases the pentraxin domain from its N-terminal transmembrane domain. Cleaved NPR rapidly accumulates in endosomes where it colocalizes with AMPAR. This process is necessary for mGluR1/5-dependent LTD in hippocampal and cerebellar synapses. These observations suggest that cleaved NPR functions to “capture” AMPAR for endocytosis and reveal a bifunctional role of NPs in both synapse strengthening and weakening."

They show that the enzyme is a dimer of two identical subunits. Each monomer has three domains: a C-terminal domain, which contains the active site and is similar in structure to spermidine synthase; a central domain made up of four β-strands; and an N-terminal domain with remarkable structural similarity to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, the enzyme that forms the aminopropyl donor substrate.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking the AdoMetDC gene, which cannot make SPD or SPM, grow normally when only SPD is provided in the media (10Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in higher organisms, although not absolutely essential for life, SPM is required for normal development. Although cultured mouse cell lines with an inactivated SpmSyn gene grow at a normal rate in the complete absence of SPM (11Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Male Gy mice, which have an X chromosome deletion that includes the SpmSyn gene, do survive. However, these mice, the tissues of which contain no SPM, are viable only on a B6C3H background and have a greatly reduced size, sterility, deafness, neurological abnormalities, and a very short life span (11Mackintosh C.A.

Genomics. 1998; 48: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Deletion of both of the genes, which were originally described as encoding SpmSyns in plants, also leads to developmental defects and sensitivity to drought but is not lethal (15Imai A. Akiyama T.

Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3081-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The relative roles of SPM and thermospermine in plant development are not well understood. An alteration in the human SpmSyn gene at Xp22.1 is the cause of Snyder-Robinson syndrome (19Cason A.L. Ikeguchi Y. Skinner C. Wood T.C. Lubs H.A. Martinez F. Simensen R.J. Stevenson R.E. Pegg A.E. Schwartz C.E. Eur. J. Human Genet. 2003; 11: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This X-linked recessive condition causes mild-to-moderate mental retardation, hypotonia, cerebellar circuitry dysfunction, facial asymmetry, thin habitus, osteoporosis, and kyphoscoliosis. The mutation causes a splice variant of the SpmSyn gene that leads to the loss of exon 4 and inserts a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein containing only the first 110 amino acids. SpmSyn activity in cells derived from Snyder-Robinson patients is reduced by 85-90%. This activity may be due to a small level of correct splicing. SpmSyn and SpdSyn are members of the family of aminopropyltransferases. These enzymes all transfer aminopropyl groups from dcAdoMet to amine acceptors. Representatives from four groups of this family have been characterized according to their preferred amine acceptor. In addition to SpdSyn (which utilizes putrescine) and SpmSyn (which adds the aminopropyl group to N-10 of SPD5) (reviewed in Refs. 20Pegg A.E. Poulin R. Coward J.K. Int. J.

In this study, we describe the structure of the remaining enzyme in the mammalian polyamine biosynthetic pathway, human SpmSyn. Here we report the crystal structures of two ternary complexes of human SpmSyn, one with the bound products 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and SPM and the other one with the substrate SPD and the product MTA. Our studies show that human SpmSyn is a homodimer, with each monomer having three domains. The C-terminal domain, which contains the active site, adopts a classical AdoMet methyltransferase fold and exhibits structural similarity to known SpdSyns. Remarkably, the N-terminal domain, which forms the major part of the dimerization interface, shows a considerable structural similarity to the AdoMetDC-like fold. When expressed separately, both domains are enzymatically inactive and possess rigid tertiary structure, suggesting that human SpmSyn is a fusion protein of AdoMet methyltransferase-like and AdoMetDC-like folds. Key residues in the active site that allow catalysis and the ability to accommodate SPD as the preferred substrate were identified and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The results of site-directed mutagenesis support a common mechanism for aminopropyltransferases. Materials—[35S]dcAdoMet was synthesized enzymatically from l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (31Wiest, L., and Pegg, A. E. (1998) in Methods in Molecular Biology: Polyamine Protocols (Morgan, D. M. L., ed) Volume 79, pp. 51-58, Humana Press, Totowa, NJGoogle Scholar). Unlabeled dcAdoMet was kindly provided by Professor A. Shirahata (Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Josai University, Saitama, Japan). Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Human SpmSyn—A DNA fragment encoding human SpmSyn was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pET28a-LIC vector downstream of the polyhistidine coding region. Human SpmSyn was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21-Codon Plus(DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 15 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) supplemented with 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed by passing through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics). The lysate was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol). The protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Thrombin (Sigma) was added to combined fractions containing SpmSyn to remove the His tag. The protein was further purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography. The purification yield of SpmSyn was 2.3 mg/liter of culture. Purified SpmSyn protein was crystallized in the presence of SPD and MTA or SPM and MTA using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution (10 mg/ml) with 1 μl of the reservoir solution. The human SpmSyn·MTA·SPD complex (protein/MTA/SPD molar ratio of 1:5:10) was crystallized in 12% polyethylene glycol 20,000 and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5). The human SpmSyn·MTA·SPM complex (protein/MTA/SPM molar ratio of 1:5:5) was crystallized in 18% polyethylene glycol 3,350, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 m BisTris (pH 6.5). Crystals were soaked in the corresponding mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Ligands were not added to the cryo solution to prevent possible over-occupancy of the active site of the enzyme. Data Collection and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using a Rigaku FRE high brilliance x-ray generator with an R-AXIS IV detector. Data were processed using the HKL2000 suite (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structures of SpmSyn complexes were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (33Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar).

Assay of Aminopropyltransferase Activity—Activity was measured by following the production of [35S]MTA from [35S]dcAdoMet in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in the presence of SPD as the amine acceptor (31Wiest, L., and Pegg, A. E. (1998) in Methods in Molecular Biology: Polyamine Protocols (Morgan, D. M. L., ed) Volume 79, pp. 51-58, Humana Press, Totowa, NJGoogle Scholar). Reactions were run for 30 min with an amount of enzyme that gave a linear rate of MTA production at 37 °C, and kinetic constants were determined using triplicate estimations at each concentration point, which covered an 8-fold range above and below the Km (27Wu H.

The results of the triplicate assays agreed within ±10%. Production of SpmSyn Mutants—The human N-terminally truncated SpmSyn mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pET28a-LIC vector. All site-directed mutants of human SpmSyn described in this work were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the pQE-hSpS plasmid (36Ikeguchi Y. Mackintosh C.A. McCloskey D.E. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 885-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The entire coding sequence of each of the SpmSyn mutants was verified by DNA sequencing to ensure that no other mutations were introduced during PCR. All SpmSyn mutant proteins were purified as described above before assays. Assay of AdoMetDC Activity—AdoMetDC was assayed by measuring the release of 14CO2 from S-adenosyl-l-[carboxy-14C]methionine (37Shantz, L. S., and Pegg, A. E. (1998) in Methods in Molecular Biology: Polyamine Protocols (Morgan, D. M. L., ed) Volume 79, pp. 45-50, Humana Press, Totowa, NJGoogle Scholar) using human recombinant carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged AdoMetDC as described previously (38Brooks W.H. McCloskey D.E. Daniel K.G. Ealick S.E. Secrist III, J.A. Waud W.R. Pegg A.E. Guida W.C. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2007; 47: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Secondary and Tertiary Structure Analysis—Thermo-melting profiling of all N-terminally truncated SpmSyn proteins was performed using an Aviv Model 215CD spectrophotometer. The proteins were heated to 95 °C and scanned at a fixed wavelength. The fluorescence spectra of the SpmSyn proteins were obtained on a SpectraMax Gemini XS (Molecular Devices) in the presence of different concentrations of urea in the protein samples. Human SpmSyn Is a Dimer—To determine the three-dimensional structure of human SpmSyn, we generated a series of constructs encoding different lengths of the protein. The protein lacking the first 4 amino acids after removal of the His tag and in complex with either MTA and SPD or MTA and SPM produced crystals suitable for x-ray data collection. The structures of both ternary complexes, SpmSyn·MTA·SPD and SpmSyn·MTA·SPM, were solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.95- and 2.45-Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). The SpmSyn·MTA·SPD complex was crystallized in space group P1 with four protein, four MTA, and four SPD molecules/asymmetric unit, whereas the SpmSyn·MTA·SPM complex was crystallized in space group P32 with four protein, four MTA, and four SPM molecules/asymmetric unit.TABLE 1Crystallography data and refinement statisticsSpmSyn·MTA·SPMSpmSyn·MTA·SPDProtein Data Bank code3C6M3C6KData collectionSpace groupP32P1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)88.26, 88.26, 197.6743.39, 74.03, 143.23α, β, γ90°, 90°, 120°94.2°, 92.9°, 107.1°Resolution (highest resolution shell; Å)50.00-2.45 (2.54-2.45)50.00-1.95 (2.02-1.95)Measured reflections293,197416,665Unique reflections61,292115,647Rmerge (%)12.5 (58.7)10.7 (37.9)I/σI7.6 (2.6)6.8 (2.7)Completeness (%)97.2 (93.4)94.3 (66.9)Redundancy4.8 (4.4)3.6 (2.9)RefinementResolution (Å)35.65-2.4540.56-1.95No. reflections (test set)58,198 (3,045)109,886 (5,758)Rwork/Rfree (%)20.9/27.119.8/25.7No. atomsProtein9,95810,972Cofactor136120Water3001,164〈B〉-factors (Å2)33.323.3Protein32.722.6Cofactor21.016.2Water27.730.8r.m.s.d.Bond length (Å)0.0130.017Bond angle1.48°1.67°Ramachandran plot % residuesFavored90.890.9Additionally allowed8.98.8Generously allowed0.30.3DisallowedNoneNone Open table in a new tab Human SpmSyn, a protein with a molecular mass of 41 kDa, exists as a dimer in solution. The protein stays as a dimer even when the protein concentration is lowered to ∼2 μg/ml (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting a strong dimerization mode. In both crystal structures, the protein exists as a dimer. It dimerizes mainly through the N-terminal domains (Fig. 2, A and B). After dimerization, ∼16% of the total surface area for each subunit is buried in both SpmSyn·MTA·SPD and SpmSyn·MTA·SPM structures. Of the buried surface area, ∼6% was from the central domain, ∼13% was from the C-terminal domain, and the rest was from the N-terminal domain. The dimerization interface is very extensive and includes sets of hydrophobic interactions (65.4% of the interface interaction) and hydrogen bonding interactions (34.6%). Human SpmSyn Monomer Is a Fusion of AdoMetDC- and AdoMet Methyltransferase-like Folds—The overall structures of the monomers of each ternary complex of human SpmSyn are identical. All four molecules can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of ∼0.3 Å for all C-α atoms. Human SpmSyn consists of three domains (Fig. 2, C and D). The N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-117) includes seven β-strands and two α-helices. β-Strands 1-5 of the N-terminal domain are aligned in antiparallel fashion, whereas short β-strands 6 and 7 are aligned head to tail and extend the five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, which is packed from one side against two α-helices (α1 and α2). The N-terminal domain is connected by a long loop (amino acids 118-137) to the central β-strand domain (amino acids 138-172), consisting of four antiparallel β-strands (β8-β11) that serve as a lid for the C-terminal catalytic domain (amino acids 173-366). The C-terminal domain consists of a central, mainly parallel, seven-stranded β-sheet (β12-β18) that is sandwiched by three α-helices on each face (α3-α5 and α6-α8) and one helix (α9) inserted between β-strands 17 and 18. The order of the β-strands is 14-13-12-15-16-18-17, where all strands, except β18, are in parallel orientation; this embellishment is analogous to the canonical AdoMet methyltransferase fold (39Martin J.L. McMillan F.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Dali analysis (40Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) of the monomer of human SpmSyn did not identify any structural homologs. Analysis of the individual domains revealed that, remarkably, the N-terminal domain of human SpmSyn has significant structural homology to the AdoMetDC proenzyme from T. maritima (Protein Data Bank code 1TLU; Z-score of 10.6) (41Toms A.V.

Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C and D). All of the C-α atoms of human SpmSyn N-terminal domain can be superimposed with T. maritima AdoMetDC with an r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å and with human AdoMetDC with an r.m.s.d. of 3.0 Å. The structure formed by the central and C-terminal domains of human SpmSyn is very similar to that of human SpdSyn (Protein Data Bank code 2O07; Z-score of 22.0) (27Wu H. Min J. Ikeguchi Y. Zeng H. Dong A. Loppnau P. Pegg A.E. Plotnikov A.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8331-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the two structures can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å for all C-α atoms (Fig. 2, C and D). A multiple sequence alignment of representative members of the SpmSyn family combined with secondary structure elements of human SpmSyn is shown in Fig. 3. To address the functional role of the dimerization of SpmSyn, we generated a series of deletion mutants of human SpmSyn including the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-128) and the central and C-terminal domains (amino acids 130-366) and tested their structural properties and enzymatic activity (Fig. 4). Deletions of all or part of the N-terminal domain led to the protein existing as a monomer as determined by gel filtration analysis (data not shown) and to virtually complete loss of activity (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the concept that the dimerization is required for the activity of the enzyme. Neither the N-terminal domain alone nor the central and C-terminal domain fragment alone had any significant SpmSyn activity. The importance of the C-terminal domain is shown by the result from the truncation of the protein at position 346 (mutant C347Stop); removing the last 20 residues led to a complete loss of activity. A smaller truncation of only 9 residues (mutant Y358Stop) had a smaller effect but still reduced activity by ∼75%. It is known that rigid tertiary structure in globular proteins is characterized by cooperative transition upon unfolding of proteins by increasing temperature or denaturing chemicals (43Plotnikov A.N. Vasilenko K.S. Kirkitadze M.D. Kotova N.V. Motuz L.P. Korotkov K.V. Semisotnov G.V. Alakhov Iu B. Bioorg. Khim. 1996; 22: 489-502PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ptitsyn, O. B., and Semisotnov, G. V. (1991) in Conformations and Forces in Protein Folding (Nall, B. T., and Dill, K. A., eds) pp. 155-168, AAAS Publishing, Washington, DCGoogle Scholar). We observed cooperative transition of unfolding of both the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-128) and central and C-terminal domain (amino acids 130-366) fragments upon melting by temperature monitored by ellipticity at 220 nm, as well as urea-induced unfolding monitored by tryptophan fluorescence spectra (Fig. 4B). Thus, both of these fragments have rigid tertiary structures, supporting the idea that human SpmSyn is a fusion of two proteins. Mixing of the fragments did not greatly alter the activity from that expected for the two pieces individually. For example, adding up to 10 μg of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-128) to 2 ng of the full-length protein had no inhibitory effect, and mixing up to 100 μg of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-118 or 1-128) with the central plus C-terminal domain fragment (amino acids 130-366 or 146-366) did not restore activity. The addition of any of the fragments including the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-128) or the full-length protein to purified human AdoMetDC did not reduce the AdoMetDC activity, and the addition of AdoMetDC did not alter the SpmSyn activity of full-length SpmSyn. These results suggest there is no direct interaction between the two polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, but it is p"

To investigate the effectiveness of these drugs as anti-prion agents Syrian hamsters were inoculated intramuscularly or subcutaneously with 263K scrapie strain at a 10−4 dilution. Tetracyclines were injected intramuscularly or intraperitoneally at the dose of 10 mg/kg. A single intramuscular dose of doxycycline one hour after infection in the same site of inoculation prolonged median survival by 64%. Intraperitoneal doses of tetracyclines every two days for 40 or 44 days increased survival time by 25% (doxycycline), 32% (tetracycline); and 81% (minocycline) after intramuscular infection, and 35% (doxycycline) after subcutaneous infection. To extend the therapeutic potential of tetracyclines, we investigated the efficacy of direct infusion of tetracyclines in advanced infection. Since intracerebroventricular infusion of tetracycline solutions can cause overt acute toxicity in animals, we entrapped the drugs in liposomes. Animals were inoculated intracerebrally with a 10−4 dilution of the 263K scrapie strain. A single intracerebroventricular infusion of 25 µg/ 20 µl of doxycycline or minocycline entrapped in liposomes was administered 60 days after inoculation, when 50% of animals showed initial symptoms of the disease. Median survival increased of 8.1% with doxycycline and 10% with minocycline. These data suggest that tetracyclines might have therapeutic potential for humans."
https://openalex.org/W2017707792,"Background Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are associated with many imprinted genes. In mice methylation at a DMR upstream of the H19 gene known as the Imprint Control region (IC1) is acquired in the male germline and influences the methylation status of DMRs 100 kb away in the adjacent Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene through long-range interactions. In humans, germline-derived or post-zygotically acquired imprinting defects at IC1 are associated with aberrant activation or repression of IGF2, resulting in the congenital growth disorders Beckwith-Wiedemann (BWS) and Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes, respectively. In Wilms tumour and colorectal cancer, biallelic expression of IGF2 has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in IGF2. This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal IGF2 allele presumably with a role in repression. The effect of IGF2 DMR0 methylation changes in the aetiology of BWS or SRS is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We analysed the methylation status of the DMR0 in BWS, SRS and Wilms tumour patients by conventional bisulphite sequencing and pyrosequencing. We show here that, contrary to previous reports, the IGF2 DMR0 is actually methylated on the active paternal allele in peripheral blood and kidney. This is similar to the IC1 methylation status and is inconsistent with the proposed silencing function of the maternal IGF2 allele. Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell patients with IC1 methylation defects have similar methylation defects at the IGF2 DMR0, consistent with IC1 regulating methylation at IGF2 in cis. In Wilms tumour, however, methylation profiles of IC1 and IGF2 DMR0 are indicative of methylation changes occurring on both parental alleles rather than in cis. Conclusions/Significance These results support a model in which DMR0 and IC1 have opposite susceptibilities to global hyper and hypomethylation during tumorigenesis independent of the parent of origin imprint. In contrast, during embryogenesis DMR0 is methylated or demethylated according to the germline methylation imprint at the IC1, indicating different mechanisms of imprinting loss in neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028321917,"Background We describe new cranial and post-cranial marsupial fossils from the early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna in Australia and refer them to Djarthia murgonensis, which was previously known only from fragmentary dental remains. Methodology/Principal Findings The new material indicates that Djarthia is a member of Australidelphia, a pan-Gondwanan clade comprising all extant Australian marsupials together with the South American microbiotheres. Djarthia is therefore the oldest known crown-group marsupial anywhere in the world that is represented by dental, cranial and post-cranial remains, and the oldest known Australian marsupial by 30 million years. It is also the most plesiomorphic known australidelphian, and phylogenetic analyses place it outside all other Australian marsupials. Conclusions/Significance As the most plesiomorphic and oldest unequivocal australidelphian, Djarthia may approximate the ancestral morphotype of the Australian marsupial radiation and suggests that the South American microbiotheres may be the result of back-dispersal from eastern Gondwana, which is the reverse of prevailing hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2054324909,"Background Although interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) are promising alternatives to the tuberculin skin test, interpretation of repeated testing results is hampered by lack of evidence on optimal cut-offs for conversions and reversions. A logical start is to determine the within-person variability of T-cell responses during serial testing. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a pilot study in India, to evaluate the short-term reproducibility of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube assay (QFT) among 14 healthcare workers (HCWs) who underwent 4 serial QFT tests on day 0, 3, 9 and 12. QFT ELISA was repeated twice on the same sets of specimens. We assessed two types of reproducibility: 1) test-retest reproducibility (between-test variability), and 2) within-person reproducibility over time. Test-retest reproducibility: with dichotomous test results, extremely high concordance was noticed between two tests performed on the same sets of specimens: of the 56 samples, the test and re-test results agreed for all but 2 individuals (κ = 0.94). Discordance was noted in subjects who had IFN-γ values around the cut-off point, with both increases and decreases noted. With continuous IFN-γ results, re-test results tended to produce higher estimates of IFN-γ than the original test. Within-person reproducibility: when continuous IFN-γ data were analyzed, the within-person reproducibility was moderate to high. While persons with negative QFT results generally stayed negative, positive results tended to vary over time. Our data showed that increases of more than 16% in the IFN-γ levels are statistically improbable in the short-term. Conclusions Conservatively assuming that long-term variability might be at least twice higher than short-term, we hypothesize that a QFT conversion requires two conditions to be met: 1) change from negative to positive result, and 2) at least 30% increase in the baseline IFN-γ response. Larger studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings, and determine the conversion thresholds for IGRAs."
https://openalex.org/W2101272190,"TRPM6 and TRPM7 are bifunctional proteins expressing a TRP channel fused to an atypical alpha-kinase domain. While the gating properties of TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels have been studied in detail, little is known about the mechanisms regulating kinase activity. Recently, we found that TRPM7 associates with its substrate myosin II via a kinase-dependent mechanism suggesting a role for autophosphorylation in substrate recognition. Here, we demonstrate that the cytosolic C-terminus of TRPM7 undergoes massive autophosphorylation (32+/-4 mol/mol), which strongly increases the rate of substrate phosphorylation. Phosphomapping by mass spectrometry indicates that the majority of autophosphorylation sites (37 out of 46) map to a Ser/Thr-rich region immediately N-terminal of the catalytic domain. Deletion of this region prevents substrate phosphorylation without affecting intrinsic catalytic activity suggesting that the Ser/Thr-rich domain contributes to substrate recognition. Surprisingly, the TRPM6-kinase is regulated by an analogous mechanism despite a lack of sequence conservation with the TRPM7 Ser/Thr-rich domain. In conclusion, our findings support a model where massive autophosphorylation outside the catalytic domain of TRPM6 and TRPM7 may facilitate kinase-substrate interactions leading to enhanced phosphorylation of those substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2054201119,"Neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. NPCs are considered valuable for the cell therapy of injuries in the central nervous system (CNS). However, when NPCs are transplanted into the adult mammalian spinal cord, they mostly differentiate into glial lineage. The same results have been observed for endogenous NPCs during spinal cord injury. However, little is known about the mechanism of such fate decision of NPCs.In the present study, we have found that myelin protein and Nogo-66 promoted the differentiation of NPCs into glial lineage. NgR and mTOR-Stat3 pathway were involved in this process. Releasing NgR from cell membranes or blocking mTOR-STAT3 could rescue the enhanced glial differentiation by Nogo-66.These results revealed a novel function of Nogo-66 in the fate decision of NPCs. This discovery could have profound impact on the understanding of CNS development and could improve the therapy of CNS injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2002525399,"The molecular heterogeneity of acute leukemias and other tumors constitutes a major obstacle towards understanding disease pathogenesis and developing new targeted-therapies. Aberrant gene regulation is a hallmark of cancer and plays a central role in determining tumor phenotype. We predicted that integration of different genome-wide epigenetic regulatory marks along with gene expression levels would provide greater power in capturing biological differences between leukemia subtypes. Gene expression, cytosine methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation were measured using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays in primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) specimens. We found that DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation distinguished these leukemias of distinct cell lineage, as expected, but that an integrative analysis combining the information from each platform revealed hundreds of additional differentially expressed genes that were missed by gene expression arrays alone. This integrated analysis also enhanced the detection and statistical significance of biological pathways dysregulated in AML and ALL. Integrative epigenomic studies are thus feasible using clinical samples and provide superior detection of aberrant transcriptional programming than single-platform microarray studies."
https://openalex.org/W2077254319,"Cortical pyramidal neurons alter their responses to input signals depending on behavioral state. We investigated whether changes in somatic inhibition contribute to these alterations. In layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, repetitive firing from a depolarized membrane potential, which typically occurs during arousal, produced long-lasting depression of somatic inhibition. In contrast, slow membrane oscillations with firing in the depolarized phase, which typically occurs during slow-wave sleep, produced long-lasting potentiation. The depression is mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels and GABA(A) receptor endocytosis, whereas potentiation is mediated by R-type Ca2+ channels and receptor exocytosis. It is likely that the direction of modification is mainly dependent on the ratio of R- and L-type Ca2+ channel activation. Furthermore, somatic inhibition was stronger in slices prepared from rats during slow-wave sleep than arousal. This bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition may alter pyramidal neuron responsiveness in accordance with behavioral state."
https://openalex.org/W1983497516,"Olfactory neurons project their axons to spatially invariant glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, forming an ordered pattern of innervation comprising the olfactory sensory map. A mirror symmetry exists within this map, such that neurons expressing a given receptor typically project to one glomerulus on the medial face and one glomerulus on the lateral face of the bulb. The mechanisms underlying an olfactory neuron's choice to project medially versus laterally remain largely unknown, however. Here we demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is required for sensory innervation of the lateral olfactory bulb. Mutations that eliminate IGF signaling cause axons destined for targets in the lateral bulb to shift to ectopic sites on the ventral-medial surface. Using primary cultures of olfactory and cerebellar neurons, we further show that IGF is a chemoattractant for axon growth cones. Together these observations reveal a role of IGF signaling in sensory map formation and axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2036060855,"Sensory substitution devices for the blind translate inaccessible visual information into a format that intact sensory pathways can process. We here tested image-to-sound conversion-based localization of visual stimuli (LEDs and objects) in 13 blindfolded participants.Subjects were assigned to different roles as a function of two variables: visual deprivation (blindfolded continuously (Bc) for 24 hours per day for 21 days; blindfolded for the tests only (Bt)) and system use (system not used (Sn); system used for tests only (St); system used continuously for 21 days (Sc)). The effect of learning-by-doing was assessed by comparing the performance of eight subjects (BtSt) who only used the mobile substitution device for the tests, to that of three subjects who, in addition, practiced with it for four hours daily in their normal life (BtSc and BcSc); two subjects who did not use the device at all (BtSn and BcSn) allowed assessment of its use in the tasks we employed. The impact of long-term sensory deprivation was investigated by blindfolding three of those participants throughout the three week-long experiment (BcSn, BcSn/c, and BcSc); the other ten subjects were only blindfolded during the tests (BtSn, BtSc, and the eight BtSt subjects). Expectedly, the two subjects who never used the substitution device, while fast in finding the targets, had chance accuracy, whereas subjects who used the device were markedly slower, but showed much better accuracy which improved significantly across our four testing sessions. The three subjects who freely used the device daily as well as during tests were faster and more accurate than those who used it during tests only; however, long-term blindfolding did not notably influence performance.Together, the results demonstrate that the device allowed blindfolded subjects to increasingly know where something was by listening, and indicate that practice in naturalistic conditions effectively improved ""visual"" localization performance."
https://openalex.org/W2090859505,"Background Vaccination against hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is safe and effective; however, vaccine-induced antibody level wanes over time. Peak vaccine-induced anti-HBs level is directly related to antibody decay, as well as risk of infection and persistent carriage despite vaccination. We investigated the role of host genetic factors in long-term immunity against HBV infection based on peak anti-HBs level and seroconversion to anti-HBc. Methods We analyzed 715 SNP across 133 candidate genes in 662 infant vaccinees from The Gambia, assessing peak vaccine-induced anti-HBs level and core antibody (anti-HBc) status, whilst adjusting for covariates. A replication study comprised 43 SNPs in a further 393 individuals. Results In our initial screen we found variation in IFNG, MAPK8, and IL10RA to affect peak anti-HBs level (GMTratio of <0.6 or >1.5 and P≤0.001) and lesser associations in other genes. Odds of core-conversion was associated with variation in CD163. A coding change in ITGAL (R719V) with likely functional relevance showed evidence of association with increased peak anti-HBs level in both screens (1st screen: s595_22 GMTratio 1.71, P = 0.013; 2nd screen: s595_22 GMTratio 2.15, P = 0.011). Conclusion This is to our knowledge the largest study to date assessing genetic determinants of HBV vaccine-induced immunity. We report on associations with anti-HBs level, which is directly related to durability of antibody level and predictive of vaccine efficacy long-term. A coding change in ITGAL, which plays a central role in immune cell interaction, was shown to exert beneficial effects on induction of peak antibody level in response to HBV vaccination. Variation in this gene does not appear to have been studied in relation to immune responses to viral or vaccine challenges previously. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in loci other than the HLA region affect immunity induced by HBV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2020814046,"The leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) has undergone a dramatic decline over the last 25 years, and this is believed to be primarily the result of mortality associated with fisheries bycatch followed by egg and nesting female harvest. Atlantic leatherback turtles undertake long migrations across ocean basins from subtropical and tropical nesting beaches to productive frontal areas. Migration between two nesting seasons can last 2 or 3 years, a time period termed the remigration interval (RI). Recent satellite transmitter data revealed that Atlantic leatherbacks follow two major dispersion patterns after nesting season, through the North Gulf Stream area or more eastward across the North Equatorial Current. However, information on the whole RI is lacking, precluding the accurate identification of feeding areas where conservation measures may need to be applied.Using stable isotopes as dietary tracers we determined the characteristics of feeding grounds of leatherback females nesting in French Guiana. During migration, 3-year RI females differed from 2-year RI females in their isotope values, implying differences in their choice of feeding habitats (offshore vs. more coastal) and foraging latitude (North Atlantic vs. West African coasts, respectively). Egg-yolk and blood isotope values are correlated in nesting females, indicating that egg analysis is a useful tool for assessing isotope values in these turtles, including adults when not available.Our results complement previous data on turtle movements during the first year following the nesting season, integrating the diet consumed during the year before nesting. We suggest that the French Guiana leatherback population segregates into two distinct isotopic groupings, and highlight the urgent need to determine the feeding habitats of the turtle in the Atlantic in order to protect this species from incidental take by commercial fisheries. Our results also emphasize the use of eggs, a less-invasive sampling material than blood, to assess isotopic data and feeding habits for adult female leatherbacks."
https://openalex.org/W2145718470,"Adaptation or gain control allows sensory neurons to encode diverse stimuli using a limited range of output signals. Rod vision exemplifies a general challenge facing adaptational mechanisms—balancing the benefits of averaging to create a reliable signal for adaptation with the need to adapt rapidly and locally. The synapse between rod bipolar and AII amacrine cells dominates adaptation at low light levels. We find that adaptation occurs independently at each synapse and completes in <500 ms. This limited spatial and temporal integration suggests that the absorption of a single photon modulates gain. Indeed, responses to pairs of brief dim flashes showed directly that synaptic gain was depressed for 100–200 ms following transmission of a single-photon response. Presynaptic mechanisms mediated this synaptic depression. Thus, the division of light into discrete photons controls adaptation at this synapse, and gain varies with the irreducible statistical fluctuations in photon arrival."
https://openalex.org/W2023630398,"The transmembrane receptor 'ROR2' resembles members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family of signalling receptors in sequence but its' signal transduction mechanisms remain enigmatic. This problem has particular importance because mutations in ROR2 are associated with two human skeletal dysmorphology syndromes, recessive Robinow Syndrome (RS) and dominant acting Brachydactyly type B (BDB). Here we show, using a constitutive dimerisation approach, that ROR2 exhibits dimerisation-induced tyrosine kinase activity and the ROR2 C-terminal domain, which is deleted in BDB, is required for recruitment and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. Native ROR2 phosphorylation is induced by the ligand Wnt5a and is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of Src kinase activity. Eight sites of Src-mediated ROR2 phosphorylation have been identified by mass spectrometry. Activation via tyrosine phosphorylation of ROR2 receptor leads to its internalisation into Rab5 positive endosomes. These findings show that BDB mutant receptors are defective in kinase activation as a result of failure to recruit Src."
https://openalex.org/W1996957079,"Background Tool use is defined as the manipulation of an inanimate object to change the position or form of a separate object. The expansion of cognitive niches and tool-use capabilities probably stimulated each other in hominid evolution. To understand the causes of cognitive expansion in humans, we need to know the behavioral and neural basis of tool use. Although a wide range of animals exhibit tool use in nature, most studies have focused on primates and birds on behavioral or psychological levels and did not directly address questions of which neural modifications contributed to the emergence of tool use. To investigate such questions, an animal model suitable for cellular and molecular manipulations is needed. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrated for the first time that rodents can be trained to use tools. Through a step-by-step training procedure, we trained degus (Octodon degus) to use a rake-like tool with their forelimbs to retrieve otherwise out-of-reach rewards. Eventually, they mastered effective use of the tool, moving it in an elegant trajectory. After the degus were well trained, probe tests that examined whether they showed functional understanding of the tool were performed. Degus did not hesitate to use tools of different size, colors, and shapes, but were reluctant to use the tool with a raised nonfunctional blade. Thus, degus understood the functional and physical properties of the tool after extensive training. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that tool use is not a specific faculty resulting from higher intelligence, but is a specific combination of more general cognitive faculties. Studying the brains and behaviors of trained rodents can provide insights into how higher cognitive functions might be broken down into more general faculties, and also what cellular and molecular mechanisms are involved in the emergence of such cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2031702660,"Previous cytogenetic studies suggest that various rDNA chromosomal loci are not equally active in different cell types. Consistent with this variability, rDNA polymorphism is well documented in human and mouse. However, attempts to identify molecularly rDNA variant types, which are regulated individually (i.e., independent of other rDNA variants) and tissue-specifically, have not been successful. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of seven mouse rDNA variants (v-rDNA). The identification of these v-rDNAs was based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), which are conserved among individuals and mouse strains. The total copy number of the identified variants is less than 100 and the copy number of each individual variant ranges from 4 to 15. Sequence analysis of the cloned v-rDNA identified variant-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transcribed region. These SNPs were used to develop a set of variant-specific PCR assays, which permitted analysis of the v-rDNAs' expression profiles in various tissues. These profiles show that three v-rDNAs are expressed in all tissues (constitutively active), two are expressed in some tissues (selectively active), and two are not expressed (silent). These expression profiles were observed in six individuals from three mouse strains, suggesting the pattern is not randomly determined. Thus, the mouse rDNA array likely consists of genetically distinct variants, and some are regulated tissue-specifically. Our results provide the first molecular evidence for cell-type-specific regulation of a subset of rDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2063747312,"Biogenic amines are important signaling molecules in the central nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, biogenic amines take part in the regulation of various vital physiological processes such as feeding, learning/memory, locomotion, sexual behavior, and sleep/arousal. Consequently, several morphological studies have analyzed the distribution of aminergic neurons in the CNS. Previous descriptions, however, did not determine the exact spatial location of aminergic neurite arborizations within the neuropil. The release sites and pre-/postsynaptic compartments of aminergic neurons also remained largely unidentified. We here used gal4-driven marker gene expression and immunocytochemistry to map presumed serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic, and tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the Drosophila larval ventral ganglion relying on Fasciclin2-immunoreactive tracts as three-dimensional landmarks. With tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH) or tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (TDC2)-specific gal4-drivers, we also analyzed the distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in presumptive dopaminergic TH and tyraminergic/octopaminergic TDC2 neurons, respectively. Our results suggest that thoracic and abdominal 5-HT and TH neurons are exclusively interneurons whereas most TDC2 neurons are efferent. 5-HT and TH neurons are ideally positioned to integrate sensory information and to modulate neuronal transmission within the ventral ganglion, while most TDC2 neurons appear to act peripherally. In contrast to 5-HT neurons, TH and TDC2 neurons each comprise morphologically different neuron subsets with separated in- and output compartments in specific neuropil regions. The three-dimensional mapping of aminergic neurons now facilitates the identification of neuronal network contacts and co-localized signaling molecules, as exemplified for DOPA decarboxylase-synthesizing neurons that co-express crustacean cardioactive peptide and myoinhibiting peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1974662699,"Background Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) causing maternal anemia and low birth weight is among the multiple manifestations of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Infected erythrocytes (iEs) can acquire various adhesive properties that mediate the clinical severity of malaria. Recent advances on the molecular basis of virulence and immune evasion have helped identify var2csa as a PAM-specific var gene. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study presents a genome-wide microarray transcript analysis of 18 P. falciparum parasite isolates freshly collected from the placenta. The proportion of PAM over-expressed genes located in subtelomeric regions as well as that of PAM over-expressed genes predicted to be exported were higher than expected compared to the whole genome. The identification of novel parasite molecules with specificity to PAM and which are likely involved in host-pathogen interactions and placental tropism is described. One of these proteins, PFI1785w, was further characterized as the product of a two-exon PHIST gene, and was more often recognized by serum samples from P. falciparum-exposed women than from men. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that other parasite proteins, such as PFI1785w, may contribute beside VAR2CSA to the pathogenesis of PAM. These data may be very valuable for future vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2063566427,"An important problem in molecular biology is to build a complete understanding of transcriptional regulatory processes in the cell. We have developed a flexible, probabilistic framework to predict TF binding from multiple data sources that differs from the standard hypothesis testing (scanning) methods in several ways. Our probabilistic modeling framework estimates the probability of binding and, thus, naturally reflects our degree of belief in binding. Probabilistic modeling also allows for easy and systematic integration of our binding predictions into other probabilistic modeling methods, such as expression-based gene network inference. The method answers the question of whether the whole analyzed promoter has a binding site, but can also be extended to estimate the binding probability at each nucleotide position. Further, we introduce an extension to model combinatorial regulation by several TFs. Most importantly, the proposed methods can make principled probabilistic inference from multiple evidence sources, such as, multiple statistical models (motifs) of the TFs, evolutionary conservation, regulatory potential, CpG islands, nucleosome positioning, DNase hypersensitive sites, ChIP-chip binding segments and other (prior) sequence-based biological knowledge. We developed both a likelihood and a Bayesian method, where the latter is implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results on a carefully constructed test set from the mouse genome demonstrate that principled data fusion can significantly improve the performance of TF binding prediction methods. We also applied the probabilistic modeling framework to all promoters in the mouse genome and the results indicate a sparse connectivity between transcriptional regulators and their target promoters. To facilitate analysis of other sequences and additional data, we have developed an on-line web tool, ProbTF, which implements our probabilistic TF binding prediction method using multiple data sources. Test data set, a web tool, source codes and supplementary data are available at: http://www.probtf.org."
https://openalex.org/W2059170714,"Serpentine receptors comprise a large family of membrane receptors distributed over diverse organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and all metazoans. However, the presence of serpentine receptors in protozoan parasites is largely unknown so far. In the present study we performed a genome-wide search for proteins containing seven transmembrane domains (7-TM) in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and identified four serpentine receptor-like proteins. These proteins, denoted PfSR1, PfSR10, PfSR12 and PfSR25, show membrane topologies that resemble those exhibited by members belonging to different families of serpentine receptors. Expression of the pfsrs genes was detected by Real Time PCR in P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages, indicating that they potentially code for functional proteins. We also found corresponding homologues for the PfSRs in five other Plasmodium species, two primate and three rodent parasites. PfSR10 and 25 are the most conserved receptors among the different species, while PfSR1 and 12 are more divergent. Interestingly, we found that PfSR10 and PfSR12 possess similarity to orphan serpentine receptors of other organisms. The identification of potential parasite membrane receptors raises a new perspective for essential aspects of malaria parasite host cell infection."
https://openalex.org/W2026975387,"Background Animals have been hypothesized to benefit from pendulum mechanics during suspensory locomotion, in which the potential energy of gravity is converted into kinetic energy according to the energy-conservation principle. However, no convincing evidence has been found so far. Demonstrating that morphological evolution follows pendulum mechanics is important from a biomechanical point of view because during suspensory locomotion some morphological traits could be decoupled from gravity, thus allowing independent adaptive morphological evolution of these two traits when compared to animals that move standing on their legs; i.e., as inverted pendulums. If the evolution of body shape matches simple pendulum mechanics, animals that move suspending their bodies should evolve relatively longer legs which must confer high moving capabilities. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested this hypothesis in spiders, a group of diverse terrestrial generalist predators in which suspensory locomotion has been lost and gained a few times independently during their evolutionary history. In spiders that hang upside-down from their webs, their legs have evolved disproportionately longer relative to their body sizes when compared to spiders that move standing on their legs. In addition, we show how disproportionately longer legs allow spiders to run faster during suspensory locomotion and how these same spiders run at a slower speed on the ground (i.e., as inverted pendulums). Finally, when suspensory spiders are induced to run on the ground, there is a clear trend in which larger suspensory spiders tend to run much more slowly than similar-size spiders that normally move as inverted pendulums (i.e., wandering spiders). Conclusions/Significance Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that spiders have evolved according to the predictions of pendulum mechanics. These findings have potentially important ecological and evolutionary implications since they could partially explain the occurrence of foraging plasticity and dispersal constraints as well as the evolution of sexual size dimorphism and sociality."
https://openalex.org/W2041930521,"A universal step in the biosynthesis of membrane sterols and steroid hormones is the oxidative removal of the 14alpha-methyl group from sterol precursors by sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51). This enzyme is a primary target in treatment of fungal infections in organisms ranging from humans to plants, and development of more potent and selective CYP51 inhibitors is an important biological objective. Our continuing interest in structural aspects of substrate and inhibitor recognition in CYP51 led us to determine (to a resolution of 1.95A) the structure of CYP51 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CYP51(Mt)) co-crystallized with 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP), a small organic molecule previously identified among top type I binding hits in a library screened against CYP51(Mt). The newly determined CYP51(Mt)-DHBP structure is the most complete to date and is an improved template for three-dimensional modeling of CYP51 enzymes from fungal and prokaryotic pathogens. The structure demonstrates the induction of conformational fit of the flexible protein regions and the interactions of conserved Phe-89 essential for both fungal drug resistance and catalytic function, which were obscure in the previously characterized CYP51(Mt)-estriol complex. DHBP represents a benzophenone scaffold binding in the CYP51 active site via a type I mechanism, suggesting (i) a possible new class of CYP51 inhibitors targeting flexible regions, (ii) an alternative catalytic function for bacterial CYP51 enzymes, and (iii) a potential for hydroxybenzophenones, widely distributed in the environment, to interfere with sterol biosynthesis. Finally, we show the inhibition of M. tuberculosis growth by DHBP in a mouse macrophage model."
https://openalex.org/W2001371731,"In a previous report, we characterized a condition of gluten sensitivity in juvenile rhesus macaques that is similar in many respects to the human condition of gluten sensitivity, celiac disease. This animal model of gluten sensitivity may therefore be useful toward studying both the pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease. Here, we perform two pilot experiments to demonstrate the potential utility of this model for studying intestinal permeability toward an immunotoxic gluten peptide and pharmacological detoxification of gluten in vivo by an oral enzyme drug candidate.Intestinal permeability was investigated in age-matched gluten-sensitive and control macaques by using mass spectrometry to detect and quantify an orally dosed, isotope labeled 33-mer gluten peptide delivered across the intestinal epithelium to the plasma. The protective effect of a therapeutically promising oral protease, EP-B2, was evaluated in a gluten-sensitive macaque by administering a daily gluten challenge with or without EP-B2 supplementation. ELISA-based antibody assays and blinded clinical evaluations of this macaque and of an age-matched control were conducted to assess responses to gluten.Labeled 33-mer peptide was detected in the plasma of a gluten-sensitive macaque, both in remission and during active disease, but not in the plasma of healthy controls. Administration of EP-B2, but not vehicle, prevented clinical relapse in response to a dietary gluten challenge. Unexpectedly, a marked increase in anti-gliadin (IgG and IgA) and anti-transglutaminase (IgG) antibodies was observed during the EP-B2 treatment phase.Gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques may be an attractive resource for investigating important aspects of celiac disease, including enhanced intestinal permeability and pharmacology of oral enzyme drug candidates. Orally dosed EP-B2 exerts a protective effect against ingested gluten. Limited data suggest that enhanced permeability of short gluten peptides generated by gastrically active glutenases may trigger an elevated antibody response, but that these antibodies are not necessarily causative of clinical illness."

However, the identification of effective AON target sites remains unsatisfactory for lack of a precise method to predict their binding accessibility. This study demonstrates the importance of co-transcriptional pre-mRNA folding in determining the accessibility of AON target sites for AON induction of selective exon skipping in DMD. Because transcription and splicing occur in tandem, AONs must bind to their target sites before splicing factors. Furthermore, co-transcriptional pre-mRNA folding forms transient secondary structures, which redistributes accessible binding sites. In our analysis, to approximate transcription elongation, a “window of analysis” that included the entire targeted exon was shifted one nucleotide at a time along the pre-mRNA. Possible co-transcriptional secondary structures were predicted using the sequence in each step of transcriptional analysis. A nucleotide was considered “engaged” if it formed a complementary base pairing in all predicted secondary structures of a particular step. Correlation of frequency and localisation of engaged nucleotides in AON target sites accounted for the performance (efficacy and efficiency) of 94% of 176 previously reported AONs. Four novel insights are inferred: (1) the lowest frequencies of engaged nucleotides are associated with the most efficient AONs; (2) engaged nucleotides at 3′ or 5′ ends of the target site attenuate AON performance more than at other sites; (3) the performance of longer AONs is less attenuated by engaged nucleotides at 3′ or 5′ ends of the target site compared to shorter AONs; (4) engaged nucleotides at 3′ end of a short target site attenuates AON efficiency more than at 5′ end."
https://openalex.org/W2072679779,"Background The estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a ligand-regulated transcription factor. However, a wide variety of other extracellular signals can activate ERα in the absence of estrogen. The impact of these alternate modes of activation on gene expression profiles has not been characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that estrogen, growth factors and cAMP elicit surprisingly distinct ERα-dependent transcriptional responses in human MCF7 breast cancer cells. In response to growth factors and cAMP, ERα primarily activates and represses genes, respectively. The combined treatments with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and cAMP or growth factors regulate yet other sets of genes. In many cases, tamoxifen is perverted to an agonist, potentially mimicking what is happening in certain tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors and emphasizing the importance of the cellular signaling environment. Using a computational analysis, we predicted that a Hox protein might be involved in mediating such combinatorial effects, and then confirmed it experimentally. Although both tamoxifen and cAMP block the proliferation of MCF7 cells, their combined application stimulates it, and this can be blocked with a dominant-negative Hox mutant. Conclusions/Significance The activating signal dictates both target gene selection and regulation by ERα, and this has consequences on global gene expression patterns that may be relevant to understanding the progression of ERα-dependent carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2061067257,"Host genetic variants are known to confer resistance to Plasmodium blood stage infection and to control malaria severity both in humans and mice. This work describes the genetic mapping of a locus for resistance to liver stage parasite in the mouse. First, we show that decreased susceptibility to the liver stage of Plasmodium berghei in the BALB/c mouse strain is attributable to intra-hepatic factors and impacts on the initial phase of blood stage infection. We used QTL mapping techniques to identify a locus controlling this susceptibility phenotype (LOD score 4.2) on mouse chromosome 17 (belr1 locus). Furthermore, analysis of congenic mouse strains delimited the belr1 locus boundaries distally to the H2 region. Quantification of parasites in the liver of infected congenic mice strongly suggested that the belr1 locus represents a genetic factor controlling the expansion of P. berghei in the hepatic tissue. The mapping of belr1 locus raises the hypothesis that host gene variation is able to control the progression of Plasmodium liver stage infection and opens the possibility that the human genomic region orthologue to belr1 may contain genes that confer resistance to the human malaria liver stage."
https://openalex.org/W2065089222,"We developed transgenic (Tg) mice modeling an autosomally inherited mitochondrial disease, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, patients with which sometimes have comorbid mood disorders. The mutant animals exhibited bipolar disorder-like phenotypes, such as a distorted day-night rhythm and a robust activity change with a period of 4-5 days, and the behavioral abnormalities were improved by lithium. In this study, we tested the effect of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) on the behavioral abnormalities of the model. Electroconvulsive therapy, which has long been used in clinical practice, provides fast-acting relief to depressive patients and drug-resistant patients. We performed long-term recordings of wheel-running activity of Tg and non-Tg mice. While recording, we administrated a train of ECS to mice, six times over two weeks or three times over a week. The treatment ameliorated the distorted day-night rhythm within three times of ECS, but it had no effect on the activity change with a period of 4-5 days in the female mice. To study the mechanism of the action, we investigated whether ECS could alter the circadian phase but found no influence on the circadian clock system. The potent and fast-acting efficacy of ECS in the mutant mice supports the predictive validity of the mice as a model of bipolar disorder. This model will be useful in developing a safe and effective alternative to lithium or electroconvulsive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2157343999,"Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase IB (TopIB) relaxes supercoils by forming and resealing a covalent DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate. Here we gained new insights to the TopIB mechanism through ""chemical mutagenesis."" Meta-substituted analogs of Tyr(274) were introduced by in vitro translation in the presence of a chemically misacylated tRNA. We report that a meta-OH reduced the rate of DNA cleavage 130-fold without affecting the rate of religation. By contrast, meta-OCH(3) and NO(2) groups elicited only a 6-fold decrement in cleavage rate. We propose that the meta-OH uniquely suppresses deprotonation of the para-OH nucleophile during the cleavage step. Assembly of the vaccinia TopIB active site is triggered by protein contacts with a specific DNA sequence 5'-C(+5)C(+4)C(+3)T(+2)T(+1)p downward arrowN (where downward arrow denotes the cleavage site). A signature alpha-helix of the poxvirus TopIB ((132)GKMKYLKENETVG(144)) engages the target site in the major groove and thereby recruits catalytic residue Arg(130) to the active site. The effects of 11 missense mutations at Tyr(136) highlight the importance of van der Waals interactions with the 3'-G(+4)pG(+3)p dinucleotide of the nonscissile strand for DNA cleavage and supercoil relaxation. Asn(140) and Thr(142) donate hydrogen bonds to the pro-(S(p))-oxygen of the G(+3)pA(+2) phosphodiester of the nonscissile strand. Lys(133) and Lys(135) interact with purine nucleobases in the major groove. Whereas none of these side chains is essential per se, an N140A/T142A double mutation reduces the rate of supercoil relaxation and DNA cleavage by 120- and 30-fold, respectively, and a K133A/K135A double mutation slows relaxation and cleavage by 120- and 35-fold, respectively. These results underscore functional redundancy at the TopIB-DNA interface."
https://openalex.org/W2057857899,"Background Statistically reconstructing haplotypes from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, can lead to falsely classified haplotypes. This can be an issue when interpreting haplotype association results or when selecting subjects with certain haplotypes for subsequent functional studies. It was our aim to quantify haplotype reconstruction error and to provide tools for it. Methods and Results By numerous simulation scenarios, we systematically investigated several error measures, including discrepancy, error rate, and R2, and introduced the sensitivity and specificity to this context. We exemplified several measures in the KORA study, a large population-based study from Southern Germany. We find that the specificity is slightly reduced only for common haplotypes, while the sensitivity was decreased for some, but not all rare haplotypes. The overall error rate was generally increasing with increasing number of loci, increasing minor allele frequency of SNPs, decreasing correlation between the alleles and increasing ambiguity. Conclusions We conclude that, with the analytical approach presented here, haplotype-specific error measures can be computed to gain insight into the haplotype uncertainty. This method provides the information, if a specific risk haplotype can be expected to be reconstructed with rather no or high misclassification and thus on the magnitude of expected bias in association estimates. We also illustrate that sensitivity and specificity separate two dimensions of the haplotype reconstruction error, which completely describe the misclassification matrix and thus provide the prerequisite for methods accounting for misclassification."
https://openalex.org/W2103618609,"Allograft coronary disease is the dominant cause of increased risk of death after cardiac transplantation. While the percutaneous insertion of stents is the most efficacious revascularization strategy for allograft coronary disease there is a high incidence of stent renarrowing. We developed a novel rabbit model of sex-mismatched allograft vascular disease as well as the response to stent implantation. In situ hybridization for the Y-chromosome was employed to detect male cells in the neointima of stented allograft, and the population of recipient derived neointimal cells was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and characterized by immunohistochemistry. To demonstrate the participation of circulatory derived cells in stent neointima formation we infused ex vivo labeled peripheral blood mononuclear cells into native rabbit carotid arteries immediately after stenting. Fourteen days after stenting the neointima area was 58% greater in the stented vs. non-stented allograft segments (p = 0.02). Male cells were detected in the neointima of stented female-to-male allografts. Recipient-derived cells constituted 72.1+/-5.7% and 81.5+/-4.2% of neointimal cell population in the non-stented and stented segments, respectively and the corresponding proliferation rates were only 2.7+/-0.5% and 2.3+/-0.2%. Some of the recipient-derived neointimal cells were of endothelial lineage. The ex vivo tagged cells constituted 9.0+/-0.4% of the cells per high power field in the stent neointima 14 days after stenting. These experiments provide important quantitative data regarding the degree to which host-derived blood-borne cells contribute to neointima formation in allograft vasculopathy and the early response to stent implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2024368230,Background Microarrays are widely used for estimation of expression of thousands of genes in a biological sample. The resolution ability of this method is limited by the background noise. Low expressed genes are detected with insufficient reliability and expression of many genes is never detected at all. Methodology/Principal Findings We have applied the principles of stochastic resonance to detect expression of genes from microarray signals below the background noise level. We report the periodic pattern detected in genes called “Absent” by traditional analysis. The pattern is consistent with expression of the conventionally detected genes and specific to the tissue of origin. This effect is corroborated by the analysis of oscillating gene expression in mouse (M.musculus) and yeast (S. cerevisae). Conclusion/Significance Most genes usually considered silent are in fact expressed at a very low level. Stochastic resonance can be applied to detect changes in expression pattern of low-expressed genes as well as for the validation of the probe performance in microarrays.
