https://openalex.org/W2561412020,"Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2744355055,"Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein. Critical illness is often associated with altered, predominately decreased, serum albumin levels. This hypoalbuminaemia is usually corrected by administration of exogenous albumin. This study aimed to track the concentration-dependent influence of albumin on blood coagulation in vitro. Whole blood (WB) samples from 25 volunteers were prepared to contain low (19.3 ± 7.7 g/L), physiological (45.2 ± 7.8 g/L), and high (67.5 ± 18.1 g/L) levels of albumin. Haemostatic profiling was performed using a platelet function analyzer (PFA) 200, impedance aggregometry, a Cone and Platelet analyzer (CPA), calibrated automated thrombogram, and thrombelastometry (TEM). Platelet aggregation-associated ATP release was assessed via HPLC analysis. In the low albumin group, when compared to the physiological albumin group, we found: i) shortened PFA 200-derived closure times indicating increased primary haemostasis; ii) increased impedance aggregometry-derived amplitudes, slopes, ATP release, as well as CPA-derived average size indicating improved platelet aggregation; iii) increased TEM-derived maximum clot firmness and alpha angles indicating enhanced clot formation. TEM measurements indicated impaired clot formation in the high albumin group compared with the physiological albumin group. Thus, albumin exerted significant anticoagulant action. Therefore, low albumin levels, often present in cancer or critically ill patients, might contribute to the frequently occurring venous thromboembolism."
https://openalex.org/W2743986353,"Phylogenetic trees inferred using commonly-used models of sequence evolution are unrooted, but the root position matters both for interpretation and downstream applications. This issue has been long recognized; however, whether the potential for discordance between the species tree and gene trees impacts methods of rooting a phylogenetic tree has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we introduce a new method of rooting a tree based on its branch length distribution; our method, which minimizes the variance of root to tip distances, is inspired by the traditional midpoint rerooting and is justified when deviations from the strict molecular clock are random. Like midpoint rerooting, the method can be implemented in a linear time algorithm. In extensive simulations that consider discordance between gene trees and the species tree, we show that the new method is more accurate than midpoint rerooting, but its relative accuracy compared to using outgroups to root gene trees depends on the size of the dataset and levels of deviations from the strict clock. We show high levels of error for all methods of rooting estimated gene trees due to factors that include effects of gene tree discordance, deviations from the clock, and gene tree estimation error. Our simulations, however, did not reveal significant differences between two equivalent methods for species tree estimation that use rooted and unrooted input, namely, STAR and NJst. Nevertheless, our results point to limitations of existing scalable rooting methods."
https://openalex.org/W2744703237,"Self-association of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and serves as a general prototype for amyloid formation. A key endogenous inhibitor of Aβ self-association is human serum albumin (HSA), which binds ∼90% of plasma Aβ. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which HSA binds Aβ monomers and protofibrils is not fully understood. Here, using dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR and relaxation experiments complemented by morphological characterization, we mapped the HSA-Aβ interactions at atomic resolution by examining the effects of HSA on Aβ monomers and soluble high-molecular weight oligomeric protofibrils. We found that HSA binds both monomeric and protofibrillar Aβ, but the affinity of HSA for Aβ monomers is lower than for Aβ protofibrils (Kd values are submillimolar rather than micromolar) yet physiologically relevant because of the ∼0.6-0.7 mm plasma HSA concentration. In both Aβ protofibrils and monomers, HSA targets key Aβ self-recognition sites spanning the β strands found in cross-β protofibril structures, leading to a net switch from direct to tethered contacts between the monomeric Aβ and the protofibril surface. These HSA-Aβ interactions are isoform-specific, because the HSA affinity of Aβ monomers is lower for Aβ(1-42) than for Aβ(1-40). In addition, the HSA-induced perturbations of the monomer/protofibrils pseudo-equilibrium extend to the C-terminal residues in the Aβ(1-42) isoform but not in Aβ(1-40). These results provide an unprecedented view of how albumin interacts with Aβ and illustrate the potential of dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR in mapping the interactions between amyloid-inhibitory proteins and amyloidogenic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2743385546,"Background Work-related stress and burnout syndromes are unfortunately common comorbidities found in health professionals. However, burnout syndrome has only been partly and episodically assessed for community pharmacists whereas these professionals are exposed to patients’ demands and difficulties every day. Prevalence of burnout, associated comorbidities and coping strategies were assessed in pharmacy teams (pharmacists and pharmacy technicians) in French community pharmacies. Methods This online survey was performed by emails sent to all French community pharmacies over 3 months. The survey assessed the prevalence of burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory—MBI—questionnaire), anxiety, depression and strategies for coping with work-related stress. Results Of the 1,339 questionnaires received, 1,322 were completed and useable for the analysis. Burnout syndrome was detected in 56.2% of respondents and 10.5% of them presented severe burnout syndrome. Severe burnout syndrome was significantly associated with men, large urban areas and the number of hours worked. Depression and anxiety were found in 15.7% and 42.4% of respondents, respectively. These co-morbidities were significantly associated with severe burnout syndrome. Higher MBI scores were significantly associated with medical consultations and medicinal drug use. Conversely, respondents suffering from burnout syndrome declared they resorted less to non-medical strategies to manage their work-related stress (leisure, psychotherapy, holidays and time off). Conclusion This study demonstrated that community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians presented high prevalence of burnout syndrome, such as many healthcare professionals. Unfortunately, burnout syndrome was associated with several comorbidities (anxiety, depression and alcohol abuse) and the consumption of health resources. The psychological suffering of these healthcare professionals underlines the necessity to deploy a strategy to detect and manage burnout in community pharmacy."
https://openalex.org/W2744553822,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been applied to control insect pests due to its induction of RNA interference (RNAi) of a specific target gene expression. However, developing dsRNA-based insecticidal agent has been a great challenge especially against lepidopteran insect pests due to variations in RNAi efficiency. The objective of this study was to screen genes of chymotrypsins (SeCHYs) essential for the survival of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, to construct insecticidal dsRNA. In addition, an optimal oral delivery method was developed using recombinant bacteria. At least 7 SeCHY genes were predicted from S. exigua transcriptomes. Subsequent analyses indicated that SeCHY2 was widely expressed in different developmental stages and larval tissues by RT-PCR and its expression knockdown by RNAi caused high mortality along with immunosuppression. However, a large amount of dsRNA was required to efficiently kill late instars of S. exigua because of high RNase activity in their midgut lumen. To minimize dsRNA degradation, bacterial expression and formulation of dsRNA were performed in HT115 Escherichia coli using L4440 expression vector. dsRNA (300 bp) specific to SeCHY2 overexpressed in E. coli was toxic to S. exigua larvae after oral administration. To enhance dsRNA release from E. coli, bacterial cells were sonicated before oral administration. RNAi efficiency of sonicated bacteria was significantly increased, causing higher larval mortality at oral administration. Moreover, targeting young larvae possessing weak RNase activity in the midgut lumen significantly enhanced RNAi efficiency and subsequent insecticidal activity against S. exigua."
https://openalex.org/W2744234226,"Phenotypic assays using human primary cells are highly valuable tools for target discovery and validation in drug discovery. Expression knockdown (KD) of such targets in these assays allows the investigation of their role in models of disease processes. Therefore, efficient and fast modes of protein KD in phenotypic assays are required. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been shown to be a versatile and efficient means of gene inactivation in immortalized cell lines. Here we describe the use of adenoviral (AdV) CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for efficient gene inactivation in two human primary cell types, normal human lung fibroblasts and human bronchial epithelial cells. The effects of gene inactivation were studied in the TGF-β-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transition assay (FMT) and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition assay (EMT), which are SMAD3 dependent and reflect pathogenic mechanisms observed in fibrosis. Co-transduction (co-TD) of AdV Cas9 with SMAD3-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) resulted in fast and efficient genome editing judged by insertion/deletion (indel) formation, as well as significant reduction of SMAD3 protein expression and nuclear translocation. This led to phenotypic changes downstream of SMAD3 inhibition, including substantially decreased alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin 1 expression, which are markers for FMT and EMT, respectively. A direct comparison between co-TD of separate Cas9 and gRNA AdV, versus TD with a single “all-in-one” Cas9/gRNA AdV, revealed that both methods achieve similar levels of indel formation. These data demonstrate that AdV CRISPR/Cas9 is a useful and efficient tool for protein KD in human primary cell phenotypic assays. The use of AdV CRISPR/Cas9 may offer significant advantages over the current existing tools and should enhance target discovery and validation opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2744069501,"Crime is a major threat to society's well-being but lacks a statistical characterization that could lead to uncovering some of its underlying mechanisms. Evidence of nonlinear scaling of urban indicators in cities, such as wages and serious crime, has motivated the understanding of cities as complex systems-a perspective that offers insights into resources limits and sustainability, but that usually neglects details of the indicators themselves. Notably, since the nineteenth century, criminal activities have been known to occur unevenly within a city; crime concentrates in such way that most of the offenses take place in few regions of the city. Though confirmed by different studies, this concentration lacks broad analyses on its characteristics, which hinders not only the comprehension of crime dynamics but also the proposal of sounding counter-measures. Here, we developed a framework to characterize crime concentration which divides cities into regions with the same population size. We used disaggregated criminal data from 25 locations in the U.S. and the U.K., spanning from 2 to 15 years of longitudinal data. Our results confirmed that crime concentrates regardless of city and revealed that the level of concentration does not scale with city size. We found that the distribution of crime in a city can be approximated by a power-law distribution with exponent α that depends on the type of crime. In particular, our results showed that thefts tend to concentrate more than robberies, and robberies more than burglaries. Though criminal activities present regularities of concentration, we found that criminal ranks have the tendency to change continuously over time-features that support the perspective of crime as a complex system and demand analyses and evolving urban policies covering the city as a whole."

Decorin, an archetypical small leucine-rich proteoglycan, initiates a protracted autophagic program downstream of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling that requires paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG3). We have discovered that PEG3 is an upstream transcriptional regulator of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master transcription factor of lysosomal biogenesis, for decorin-evoked endothelial cell autophagy. We found a functional requirement of PEG3 for TFEB transcriptional induction and nuclear translocation in human umbilical vein endothelial and PAER2 cells. Mechanistically, inhibiting VEGFR2 or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major decorin-activated energy sensor kinase, prevented decorin-evoked TFEB induction and nuclear localization.

Following autophagic stimulation or stress responses, TFEB is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and translocates to the nucleus for lysosomal gene expression by targeting a subset of genes collectively known as the Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation (CLEAR) network (47Sardiello M. Palmieri M. di Ronza A. Medina D.L. Valenza M. Gennarino V.A. Di Malta C. Donaudy F. Embrione V. Polishchuk R.S. Banfi S. Parenti G. Cattaneo E. Ballabio A.

As decorin suppresses mTOR activity and initiates prolonged autophagic responses, we evaluated the existence of a mechanistic link between PEG3 and TFEB for endothelial cell autophagy. We found that PEG3 is required for TFEB induction and nuclear translocation in a VEGFR2- and AMPK-dependent manner for decorin-evoked autophagy. To evaluate a potential mechanistic link between PEG3 and TFEB, we conducted time course experiments in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and porcine aortic endothelial cells overexpressing VEGFR2 (PAER2). We found that PEG3 levels increased earlier and at a faster rate than TFEB induction at the same time points (Fig. 1, A and C). In HUVECs, following 9 h of decorin treatment, both PEG3 and TFEB levels were maximal and began to decline but remained high even at 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Further, the relative kinetics of Peg3 and Tfeb in PAER2 displayed a similar profile (Fig. 1C) insofar as Peg3 increased first, followed by a more gradual induction of Tfeb over time. However, unlike in HUVECs, Tfeb levels declined to baseline after reaching peak levels (at 9 h) whereas Peg3 remained elevated (Fig. 1D). We note that no differences in bioactivity were found between decorin and decorin core in this study (data not shown). As the kinetics showed that PEG3 levels preceded those of TFEB, we evaluated the functional requirement of PEG3 for TFEB induction. After verification of PEG3 depletion (Fig. 1E), we found that TFEB was no longer induced following decorin treatment at either the mRNA (Fig. 1F) or protein (Fig. 1G) levels. Intriguingly, we found that loss of PEG3 alone was sufficient for decreasing basal TFEB protein (Fig. 1G) but not mRNA. These results are similar to the effect of PEG3 loss on Beclin 1 (31Buraschi S. Neill T. Goyal A. Poluzzi C. Smythies J. Owens R.T. Schaefer L. Torres A. Iozzo R.V. Decorin causes autophagy in endothelial cells via Peg3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E2582-E2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In reciprocal experiments where TFEB was silenced (Fig. 1H), we found no significant change in PEG3 mRNA (Fig. 1I). These data suggest that TFEB is downstream of PEG3. In accordance with our previous studies (31Buraschi S. Neill T. Goyal A. Poluzzi C. Smythies J. Owens R.T. Schaefer L. Torres A. Iozzo R.V. Decorin causes autophagy in endothelial cells via Peg3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E2582-E2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we found that decorin does not evoke PEG3 expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 1, E and I). In contrast, endorepellin, a matrix-derived molecule capable of inducing endothelial cell autophagy via VEGFR2, evokes PEG3 mRNA levels (55Poluzzi C. Casulli J. Goyal A. Mercer T.J. Neill T.

Chem. 2016; 291: 19245-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, loss of TFEB did not abrogate decorin-evoked PEG3 protein levels (Fig. 1J) and had no appreciable effect on basal levels of PEG3 mRNA or protein (Fig. 1, I and J). Having established a role for PEG3 in regulating TFEB expression via loss-of-function experiments, we next ascertained the ability of PEG3 alone to drive TFEB. To this end, we transiently transfected PAER2 cells with HA-tagged human full-length PEG3 and evaluated porcine Tfeb. Following validation of increasing amounts of Peg3 via qPCR (data not shown), we found a dose-dependent increase in Tfeb mRNA that reached maximal output in as little as 300 ng (Fig. 2A) and maintained saturation for up to 1.2 μg of transfected PEG3 (Fig. 2A). Next, immunoblot analyses showed that increasing amounts of Peg3 promoted a significant increase in Tfeb starting with as little as 100 ng of Peg3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Notably, the profile obtained for Tfeb protein (Fig. 2B) paralleled that obtained for the mRNA (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these data reinforce the concept that Peg3 is necessary and sufficient for driving Tfeb expression and further substantiate the role of Peg3 in autophagic progression. We further corroborated the mRNA and protein data gained via RNAi by generating PAER2 cells stably expressing human PEG3 (denoted as PAER2PEG3) and empty vector–expressing cells (PAER2pcDNA). This expression construct lacks the 3′ UTR (which harbors the siRNA recognition sites), rendering PEG3 siRNA-resistant. As we found that PEG3 is required to maintain basal TFEB (Fig. 1G), and de novo PEG3 is sufficient to drive Tfeb mRNA and protein (cf. Fig. 2, A–C), we supertransfected the stable PEG3-expressing cells and evaluated whether siRNA-resistant PEG3 could rescue Tfeb expression. Given the close sequence homology between humans and pigs, endogenous Sus scrofa Peg3 was significantly reduced (Fig. 2D), but exogenous expression of Homo sapiens PEG3 remained unperturbed (Fig. 2E). Evaluation of Tfeb demonstrated that stable expression, analogous to transient expression, of PEG3 alone drove Tfeb (Fig. 2F). Importantly, despite transfection of a PEG3-specific siRNA, the presence of the siRNA-resistant PEG3 maintained significantly induced Tfeb mRNA (Fig. 2F). Structurally, PEG3 is composed of an N-terminal SCAN domain required for protein–protein interactions and an extended C terminus of 12 C2H2 Krüppel-like zinc fingers (interspersed with proline-rich regions) for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Fig. 2G) (23Kuroiwa Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Kagitani F. Kohda T. Li L.-L. Tada M. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Shiroishi T. Wakana S. Barton S.C. Ishino F.

Structure of the SCAN domain of human paternally expressed gene 3 protein.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e69538Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Generating HA-tagged truncation fragments (Fig. 2G) of either the SCAN domain (HA-SCAN) or the zinc fingers (HA-ZF) prevented nuclear translocation of these fragments following decorin stimulation in comparison with full-length HA-tagged PEG3 (60Torres A. Gubbiotti M.A. Iozzo R.V. Decorin-inducible Peg3 evokes beclin 1-mediated autophagy and thrombospondin 1-mediated angiostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 5055-5069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed these fragments in our PAER2PEG3 cells and assayed Tfeb expression to determine whether they acted in a dominant negative fashion. Surprisingly, HA-SCAN completely blocked PEG3-driven Tfeb expression compared with empty vector–transfected PAER2PEG3 cells (Fig. 2H). Introduction of HA-ZF resulted in significantly abrogated Tfeb levels (Fig. 2H). Interestingly, transfection of HA-ZF alone in PAER2pcDNA was sufficient to drive Tfeb mRNA, suggesting a posttranscriptional pathway, as HA-ZF does not enter the nucleus (60Torres A. Gubbiotti M.A. Iozzo R.V. Decorin-inducible Peg3 evokes beclin 1-mediated autophagy and thrombospondin 1-mediated angiostasis.J. Biol.

Collectively, these data establish that PEG3 is required for decorin-mediated TFEB induction and place PEG3 upstream of TFEB.

Here, using a trophodynamic approach and global databases of catches and life history traits of marine species, we tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic ecological impacts may have led to changes in the global parameters defining the transfers of biomass within the food web. First, we developed two indicators to assess such changes: the Time Cumulated Indicator (TCI) measuring the residence time of biomass within the food web, and the Efficiency Cumulated Indicator (ECI) quantifying the fraction of secondary production reaching the top of the trophic chain. Then, we assessed, at the large marine ecosystem scale, the worldwide change of these two indicators over the 1950–2010 time-periods. Global trends were identified and cluster analyses were used to characterize the variability of trends between ecosystems. Results showed that the most common pattern over the study period is a global decrease in TCI, while the ECI indicator tends to increase. Thus, changes in species assemblages would induce faster and apparently more efficient biomass transfers in marine food webs. Results also suggested that the main driver of change over that period had been the large increase in fishing pressure. The largest changes occurred in ecosystems where ‘fishing down the marine food web’ are most intensive."
https://openalex.org/W2744352902,"Dps is a multifunctional homododecameric protein that oxidizes Fe2+ ions accumulating them in the form of Fe2O3 within its protein cavity, interacts with DNA tightly condensing bacterial nucleoid upon starvation and performs some other functions. During the last two decades from discovery of this protein, its ferroxidase activity became rather well studied, but the mechanism of Dps interaction with DNA still remains enigmatic. The crucial role of lysine residues in the unstructured N-terminal tails led to the conventional point of view that Dps binds DNA without sequence or structural specificity. However, deletion of dps changed the profile of proteins in starved cells, SELEX screen revealed genomic regions preferentially bound in vitro and certain affinity of Dps for artificial branched molecules was detected by atomic force microscopy. Here we report a non-random distribution of Dps binding sites across the bacterial chromosome in exponentially growing cells and show their enrichment with inverted repeats prone to form secondary structures. We found that the Dps-bound regions overlap with sites occupied by other nucleoid proteins, and contain overrepresented motifs typical for their consensus sequences. Of the two types of genomic domains with extensive protein occupancy, which can be highly expressed or transcriptionally silent only those that are enriched with RNA polymerase molecules were preferentially occupied by Dps. In the dps-null mutant we, therefore, observed a differentially altered expression of several targeted genes and found suppressed transcription from the dps promoter. In most cases this can be explained by the relieved interference with Dps for nucleoid proteins exploiting sequence-specific modes of DNA binding. Thus, protecting bacterial cells from different stresses during exponential growth, Dps can modulate transcriptional integrity of the bacterial chromosome hampering RNA biosynthesis from some genes via competition with RNA polymerase or, vice versa, competing with inhibitors to activate transcription."

Lytic bacteriophages can affect the structure of the host population and may influence spread, survival and virulence of the pathogen and in consequence, infection of the plant. In this study, we aimed to acquire information on the viability of the broad host lytic bacteriophage ΦD5 on potato, as well as to apprehend the specific effect of this bacteriophage on its host D. solani type-strain in different settings, as a preliminary step to target co-adaptation of phages and host bacteria in plant environment. Viability of the ΦD5 phage in tuber extract, on tuber surface, in potting compost, in rainwater and on the leaf surface, as well as the effect of copper sulfate, were examined under laboratory conditions. Also, the interaction of ΦD5 with the target host D. solani in vitro and in compost-grown potato plants was evaluated. ΦD5 remained infectious in potato tuber extract and rain water for up to 72 h but was inactivated in solutions containing 50 mM of copper. The phage population was stable for up to 28 days on potato tuber surface and in potting compost. In both, tissue culture and compost-grown potato plants, ΦD5 reduced infection by D. solani by more than 50%. The implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2743102597,"Although the CRISPR/Cas9 has been successfully applied in zebrafish, considerable variations in efficiency have been observed for different gRNAs. The workload and cost of zebrafish mutant screening is largely dependent on the mutation rate of injected embryos; therefore, selecting more effective gRNAs is especially important for zebrafish mutant construction. Besides the sequence features, local chromatin structures may have effects on CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency, which remain largely unexplored. In the only related study in zebrafish, nucleosome organization was not found to have an effect on CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency, which is inconsistent with recent studies in vitro and in mammalian cell lines. To understand the effects of local chromatin structure on CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency in zebrafish, we first determined that CRISPR/Cas9 introduced genome editing mainly before the dome stage. Based on this observation, we reanalyzed our published nucleosome organization profiles and generated chromatin accessibility profiles in the 256-cell and dome stages using ATAC-seq technology. Our study demonstrated that chromatin accessibility showed positive correlation with CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency, but we did not observe a clear correlation between nucleosome organization and CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency. We constructed an online database for zebrafish gRNA selection based on local chromatin structure features that could prove beneficial to zebrafish homozygous mutant construction via CRISPR/Cas9."

Current treatments are ineffective and the aetiology is unclear, although excessive collagen deposition is a consistent feature. Lysyl oxidase (Lox) is a key enzyme required for crosslinking and deposition of insoluble collagen, so we investigated whether targeting Lox might be an approach to reduce abdominal adhesions. Methods Female C57Bl/6 mice were treated intraperitoneally with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (NT) to induce fibrosis, together with chemical (ß-aminoproprionitrile–BAPN) or miRNA Lox inhibitors, progesterone or dexamethasone. Fibrotic lesions on the diaphragm, and expression of fibrosis-related genes in abdominal wall peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC) were measured. Effects of BAPN and dexamethasone on collagen fibre alignment were observed by TEM. Isolated PMC were cultured with interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and progesterone to determine effects on Lox mRNA in vitro. Results NT-induced fibrosis and collagen deposition on the diaphragm was ameliorated by BAPN, Lox miRNA, or steroids. BAPN and dexamethasone disrupted collagen fibres. NT increased PMC Lox, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Bmp1 mRNA, which was inhibited by steroids. Progesterone significantly inhibited IL-1α induced Lox expression by PMC in vitro. Conclusion Our results provide proof-of-concept that targeting peritoneal Lox could be an effective approach in ameliorating fibrosis and adhesion development."

We therefore investigated the influence of CX3CR1 ablation in the model of acute myocarditis, which was induced by inoculation with 5x105 plaque forming units of CVB3 (Nancy strain) in either CX3CR1-/- or C57BL6/j (WT) mice. Seven days after infection, myocardial inflammation, remodeling, and titin expression and phosphorylation were examined by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and Pro-Q diamond stain. Cardiac function was assessed by tip catheter. Compared to WT CVB3 mice, CX3CR1-/- CVB3 mice exhibited enhanced left ventricular expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which was associated with an increase of immune cell infiltration/presence. This shift towards a pro-inflammatory immune response further resulted in increased cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which was reflected by an impaired cardiac function in CX3CR1-/- CVB3 compared to WT CVB3 mice. These findings demonstrate a cardioprotective role of CX3CR1 in CVB3-infected mice and indicate the relevance of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 system in CVB3-induced myocarditis."
https://openalex.org/W2743948565,"Verbal memory is typically studied using immediate recall (IR) and delayed recall (DR) scores, although DR is dependent on IR capability. Separating these components may be useful for deciphering the genetic variation in age-related memory abilities. This study was conducted to (a) construct individual trajectories in IR and independent aspects of delayed recall, or residualized-DR (rDR), across older adulthood; and (b) identify genetic markers that contribute to four estimated phenotypes: IR and rDR levels and changes after age 60. A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of adults aged 50 and older. Mixed effects regression models were constructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (1996-2012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) were conducted in the genotypic subsample (N = 7,486) using ~1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One SNP (rs2075650) in TOMM40 associated with rDR level at the genome-wide level (p = 5.0x10-08), an effect that replicated in an independent sample from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (N = 6,898 with 41,328 observations). Meta-analysis of rDR level confirmed the association (p = 5.0x10-11) and identified two others in TOMM40 (rs71352238 p = 1.0x10-10; rs157582 p = 7.0x10-09), and one in APOE (rs769449 p = 3.1 x10-12). Meta-analysis of IR change identified associations with three of the same SNPs in TOMM40 (rs157582 p = 8.3x10-10; rs71352238 p = 1.9x10-09) and APOE (rs769449 p = 2.2x10-08). Conditional analyses indicate GWAS signals on rDR level were driven by APOE, whereas signals on IR change were driven by TOMM40. Additionally, we found that TOMM40 had effects independent of APOE e4 on both phenotypes. Findings from this first U.S. population-based GWAS study conducted on both age-related immediate and delayed verbal memory merit continued examination in other samples and additional measures of verbal memory."

What remains unclear is whether the spike in gun sales is motivated by increased threat perceptions or by concerns about gun control, or whether the sales are mainly driven by non-owners purchasing guns or gun owners adding to their collection. Two surveys of gun owners and non-owners, conducted immediately before and after the Orlando shooting, allowed us to assess its impact on threat perceptions and on gun-purchasing intentions. Although there was a minor impact on threat perceptions of non-owners, neither group reported any increased gun-purchasing intentions or an increased need of a gun for protection and self-defense. We suggest that these responses are representative for the majority of Americans and, therefore, people who are influenced by mass shootings to buy guns are probably an atypical minority."
https://openalex.org/W2744515607,"Retinal ischemia is common in eye disorders, like diabetic retinopathy or retinal vascular occlusion. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effects of an intravitreally injected vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor (ranibizumab) on retinal cells in an ischemia animal model via immunohistochemistry (IF) and quantitative real-time PCR (PCR). A positive binding of ranibizumab to rat VEGF-A was confirmed via dot blot. One eye underwent ischemia and a subgroup received ranibizumab. A significant VEGF increase was detected in aqueous humor of ischemic eyes (p = 0.032), whereas VEGF levels were low in ranibizumab eyes (p = 0.99). Ischemic retinas showed a significantly lower retinal ganglion cell number (RGC; IF Brn-3a: p<0.001, IF RBPMS: p<0.001; PCR: p = 0.002). The ranibizumab group displayed fewer RGCs (IF Brn-3a: 0.3, IF RBPMS: p<0.001; PCR: p = 0.007), but more than the ischemia group (IF Brn-3a: p = 0.04, IF RBPMS: p = 0.03). Photoreceptor area was decreased after ischemia (IF: p = 0.049; PCR: p = 0.511), while the ranibizumab group (IF: p = 0.947; PCR: p = 0.122) was comparable to controls. In the ischemia (p<0.001) and ranibizumab group (p<0.001) a decrease of ChAT+ amacrine cells was found, which was less prominent in the ranibizumab group. VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGF-R2; IF: p<0.001; PCR: p = 0.021) and macroglia (GFAP; IF: p<0.001; PCR: p<0.001) activation was present in ischemic retinas. The activation was weaker in ranibizumab retinas (VEGF-R2: IF: p = 0.1; PCR: p = 0.03; GFAP: IF: p = 0.1; PCR: p = 0.015). An increase in the number of total (IF: p = 0.003; PCR: p = 0.023) and activated microglia (IF: p<0.001; PCR: p = 0.009) was detected after ischemia. These levels were higher in the ranibizumab group (Iba1: IF: p<0.001; PCR: p = 0.018; CD68: IF: p<0.001; PCR: p = 0.004). Our findings demonstrate that photoreceptors and RGCs are protected by ranibizumab treatment. Only amacrine cells cannot be rescued. They seem to be particularly sensitive to ischemic damage and need maybe an earlier intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2743454697,"Background/Aims The therapeutic options for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are limited. As PI3K signaling is often activated in NETs, we have assessed the effects of selective PI3Kp110α inhibition by the novel agent BYL719 on cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, signaling pathways, differentiation and secretion in pancreatic (BON-1, QGP-1) and pulmonary (H727) NET cell lines. Methods Cell viability was investigated by WST-1 assay, colony formation by clonogenic assay, apoptosis by caspase3/7 assay, the cell cycle by FACS, cell signaling by Western blot analysis, expression of chromogranin A and somatostatin receptors 1/2/5 by RT-qPCR, and chromogranin A secretion by ELISA. Results BYL719 dose-dependently decreased cell viability and colony formation with the highest sensitivity in BON-1, followed by H727, and lowest sensitivity in QGP-1 cells. BYL719 induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest associated with increased p27 expression. Western blots showed inhibition of PI3K downstream targets to a varying degree in the different cell lines, but IGF1R activation. The most sensitive BON-1 cells displayed a significant, and H727 cells a non-significant, GSK3 inhibition after BYL719 treatment, but these effects do not appear to be mediated through the IGF1R. In contrast, the most resistant QGP-1 cells showed no GSK3 inhibition, but a modest activation, which would partially counteract the other anti-proliferative effects. Accordingly, BYL719 enhanced neuroendocrine differentiation with the strongest effect in BON-1, followed by H727 cells indicated by induction of chromogranin A and somatostatin receptor 1/2 mRNA-synthesis, but not in QGP-1 cells. In BON-1 and QGP-1 cells, the BYL719/everolimus combination was synergistic through simultaneous AKT/mTORC1 inhibition, and significantly increased somatostatin receptor 2 transcription compared to each drug separately. Conclusion Our results suggest that the agent BYL719 could be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of NETs that may sensitize NET cells to somatostatin analogs, and that if there is resistance to its action this may be overcome by combination with everolimus."
https://openalex.org/W2742984764,"Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of major concern in Kuwait and the Middle East. Human brucellosis can be caused by several Brucella species with varying degree of pathogenesis, and relapses are common after apparently successful therapy. The classical biochemical methods for identification of Brucella are time-consuming, cumbersome, and provide information limited to the species level only. In contrast, molecular methods are rapid and provide differentiation at intra-species level. In this study, four molecular methods [16S rRNA gene sequencing, real-time PCR, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA)-8, MLVA-11 and MLVA-16 were evaluated for the identification and typing of 75 strains of Brucella isolated in Kuwait. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of all isolates showed 90–99% sequence identity with B. melitensis and real-time PCR with genus- and species- specific primers identified all isolates as B. melitensis. The results of ERIC-PCR suggested the existence of 75 ERIC genotypes of B. melitensis with a discriminatory index of 0.997. Cluster classification of these genotypes divided them into two clusters, A and B, diverging at ~25%. The maximum number of genotypes (n = 51) were found in cluster B5. MLVA-8 analysis identified all isolates as B. melitensis, and MLVA-8, MLVA-11 and MLVA-16 typing divided the isolates into 10, 32 and 71 MLVA types, respectively. Furthermore, the combined minimum spanning tree analysis demonstrated that, compared to MLVA types discovered all over the world, the Kuwaiti isolates were a distinct group of MLVA-11 and MLVA-16 types in the East Mediterranean Region."
https://openalex.org/W2743491624,"Nerve injury is accompanied by a liberation of diverse nucleotides, some of which act as 'find/eat-me' signals in mediating neuron-glial interplay. Intercellular Ca2+ wave (ICW) communication is the main approach by which glial cells interact and coordinate with each other to execute immune defense. However, the detailed mechanisms on how these nucleotides participate in ICW communication remain largely unclear. In the present work, we employed a mechanical stimulus to an individual BV-2 microglia to simulate localized injury. Remarkable ICW propagation was observed no matter whether calcium was in the environment or not. Apyrase (ATP/ADP-hydrolyzing enzyme), suramin (broad-spectrum P2 receptor antagonist), 2-APB (IP3 receptor blocker) and thapsigargin (endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump inhibitor) potently inhibited these ICWs, respectively, indicating the dependence of nucleotide signals and P2Y receptors. Then, we detected the involvement of five naturally occurring nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP and UDP-glucose) by desensitizing receptors. Results showed that desensitization with ATP and ADP could block ICW propagation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas other nucleotides had little effect. Meanwhile, the expression of P2Y receptors in BV-2 microglia was identified and their contributions were analyzed, from which we suggested P2Y12/13 receptors activation mostly contributed to ICWs. Besides, we estimated that extracellular ATP and ADP concentration sensed by BV-2 microglia was about 0.3 μM during ICWs by analyzing calcium dynamic characteristics. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the nucleotides ATP and ADP were predominant signal transmitters in mechanical stimulation-induced ICW communication through acting on P2Y12/13 receptors in BV-2 microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2743975644,"Epitope-tagging of proteins has become a widespread technique for the analysis of protein function, protein interactions and protein localization among others. Tagging of genes by chromosomal integration of PCR amplified cassettes is a widely used and fast method to label proteins in vivo. Different systems have been developed during years in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the present study, we analysed systematically a set of yeast proteins that were fused to different tags. Analysis of the tagged proteins revealed an unexpected general effect on protein level when some specific tagging module was used. This was due in all cases to a destabilization of the proteins and caused a reduced protein activity in the cell that was only apparent in particular conditions. Therefore, an extremely cautious approach is required when using this strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2744048050,"Young patients with advanced interstitial lung disease (ILD) are potential candidates for cadaveric lung transplantation. This study aimed to examine clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors in Japanese ILD patients awaiting lung transplantation.We investigated the clinical features and outcomes of 77 consecutive candidates with ILD who were referred to Kyoto University Hospital and subsequently actively listed for lung transplant in the Japan Organ Transplant Network between 2010 and 2014.Of the 77 candidates, 33 had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 15 had unclassifiable ILD. During the observational period, 23 patients (30%) received lung transplantations and 49 patients (64%) died before transplantation. Of the 33 patients with IPF, 13 (39%) had a family history of ILD and 13 (39%) had an ""inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia pattern"" on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The median survival time from registration was 16.7 months, and mortality was similar among patients with IPF, unclassifiable ILD, and other ILDs. Using a multivariate stepwise Cox proportional hazards model, 6-min walking distance was shown to be an independent prognostic factor in candidates with ILD (per 10 m, hazard ratio (HR): 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-0.99, p<0.01), while lower body mass index (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72-0.95, p < 0.01) independently contributed to mortality in patients with IPF.Japanese patients with ILD awaiting transplantation had very poor outcomes regardless of their specific diagnosis. A substantial percentage of IPF patients had an atypical HRCT pattern. 6-min walking distance in ILD patients and body mass index in IPF patients were independent predictors of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2742822544,"Aging has long been regarded as one of the most critical factors affecting crash injury outcomes. In South Korea, where the elderly population is projected to reach 35.9% by 2050, the implications of an increasing number of elderly vehicle users on road safety are evident. In this research, the confounding effect of occupant age in a vehicle in terms of seat position and seatbelt use was investigated. In addition, elderly occupants were divided into a younger-old group aged between 65 and 74 years and an older-old group aged 75 years and older in an effort to assess whether the conventional elderly age standard of 65 years should be reconsidered.A multinomial logit framework was adopted to predict two-level injury severity using collision data between 2008 and 2015. Predictor variables included gender, age group, seat position, seatbelt, road type, road slope, road surface, road line, and type of vehicle. Five models, a base model with no interactions and four interaction models which were combinations of age group, seatbelt use and seat position, were devised and evaluated.With no interacting term, age was the most prominent predictor. Elderly occupants were most likely to suffer from severe injury without a seatbelt in all seat positions, and the use of a seatbelt reduced this likelihood the most in the elderly group as well. Front passenger seats had the highest risk to elderly occupants, while the driver seat was statistically insignificant. When the elderly group was divided into the younger-old group and the older-old group, the older-olds were found to be much more vulnerable compared to the younger-olds. In particular, older drivers were five times more likely to suffer a severe injury without a seatbelt.The degree of injury severity of elderly occupants was reduced the most with the use of a seatbelt, demonstrating the importance of using seat restraints. The sharp increase in the risk of injury of the older-old group suggests that the age standard of 65 years as the elderly group with regard to traffic safety may require reconsideration due to the growing number of elderly vehicle users on the road. Our results provide practical evidence with which to formulate new safety policies, including mandatory seatbelt use, driving age limits and insurance pricing."
https://openalex.org/W2743125760,"Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) support numerous ecosystem functions in livestock-grazed pastures. Exposure to veterinary anthelmintic residues in livestock dung can have lethal and sublethal effects on dung beetles, and can reduce rates of dung removal, but the immediate and longer-term consequences for other dung beetle mediated functions have rarely been studied. We investigated the consequences of anthelmintic exposure on survival of the dung beetle Aphodius fossor and its delivery of four ecosystems functions that underpin pasture production: dung removal, soil fauna feeding activity, primary productivity, and reduction of soil compaction. We tested whether anthelmintic exposure had immediate or delayed effects on these functions individually and simultaneously (i.e., ecosystem multifunctionality). We found no evidence that ivermectin residues had a lethal effect on adult beetles. For dung removal, we found a significant interaction between the timing of exposure and functioning: while dung removal was impaired by concurrent exposure to high levels of ivermectin, functioning was unaffected when beetles that had been exposed previously to the same concentration of anthelmintic later interacted with untreated dung. Other ecosystem functions were not affected significantly by anthelmintic exposure, and there was no evidence to suggest any persistent impact of anthelmintic exposure on ecosystem multifunctionality. While anthelmintic residues remain a significant threat to dung beetle populations, for adult beetles, we found no evidence that residues have detrimental consequences for ecosystem functioning beyond the immediate point of exposure."

However, unlike cattle, little information is available on the transcriptome-wide changes during different postnatal stages in small ruminants, especially goats. In this study, the sequencing reads of goat LM tissues collected from kid, youth, and adult period were mapped to the goat genome. Results showed that out of total 24 689 Unigenes, 20 435 Unigenes were annotated. Based on expected number of fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced (FPKM), 111 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among different postnatal stages, which were subsequently assigned to 16 possible expression patterns by series-cluster analysis. Functional classification by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used for selecting the genes showing highest expression related to lipid metabolism. Finally, we identified the node genes for lipid metabolism regulation using co-expression analysis. In conclusion, these data may uncover candidate genes having functional roles in regulation of goat muscle development and lipid metabolism during the various growth stages in goats."
https://openalex.org/W2745203699,"Tumor cell invasion involves targeted localization of proteins required for interactions with the extracellular matrix and for proteolysis. The localization of many proteins during these cell–extracellular matrix interactions relies on membrane trafficking mediated in part by SNAREs. The SNARE protein syntaxin4 (Stx4) is involved in the formation of invasive structures called invadopodia; however, it is unclear how Stx4 function is regulated during tumor cell invasion. Munc18c is known to regulate Stx4 activity, and here we show that Munc18c is required for Stx4-mediated invadopodium formation and cell invasion. Biochemical and microscopic analyses revealed a physical association between Munc18c and Stx4, which was enhanced during invadopodium formation, and that a reduction in Munc18c expression decreases invadopodium formation. We also found that an N-terminal Stx4-derived peptide associates with Munc18c and inhibits endogenous interactions of Stx4 with synaptosome-associated protein 23 (SNAP23) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2). Furthermore, expression of the Stx4 N-terminal peptide decreased invadopodium formation and cell invasion in vitro. Of note, cells expressing the Stx4 N-terminal peptide exhibited impaired trafficking of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and EGF receptor (EGFR) to the cell surface during invadopodium formation.

https://openalex.org/W2742306367,"Mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons are located in the ventral midbrain. These neurons form the substantia nigra (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Two transcription factors that play important roles in the process of terminal differentiation and subset-specification of mdDA neurons, are paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (Pitx3), and homeobox transcription factor Engrailed 1 (En1). We previously investigated the single Pitx3KO and En1KO and observed important changes in the survival of mdDA neurons of the SNc and VTA as well as altered expression of pivotal rostral- and caudal-markers, Ahd2 and Cck, respectively. To refine our understanding of the regional-specific relationships between En1 and Pitx3 and their (combined) role in the programming mdDA neurons on the rostral-to-caudal axis, we created double En1tm1Alj/tm1Alj;Pitx3gfp/gfp (En1KO;Pitx3GFP/GFP) animals. Here we report, that in absence of En1 and Pitx3, only a limited number of mdDA neurons are present at E14.5. These mdDA neurons have a rudimentary dopaminergic cell fate, as they express Nurr1, Pbx3 and Otx2 but have lost their rostral or caudal subset identity. Furthermore, we report that the expression of Cck depends on En1 expression, while (in contrast) both Pitx3 and En1 are involved in the initiation of Ahd2 expression. Thus we reveal in this manuscript that regulated levels of Pitx3 and En1 control the size and rostral/caudal-identity of the mdDA neuronal population."
https://openalex.org/W2742203910,"Kelps have a major role in marine and atmospheric iodine cycling in the coastal zone of temperate regions, with potential wide-ranging impacts on ozone destruction in the coastal marine boundary layer. However, little is known about the impact of kelp forests on iodine speciation in coastal sea water. To address this, we examined iodide and iodate concentrations in seawater in and around a giant kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA, and a nearby site that was not influenced by kelp biology. Our data shows that while both iodide and iodate concentrations remained unchanged during the year at the nearby site, these concentrations changed significantly in and around the kelp forest, and were strongly related to changes in kelp canopy biomass. In particular, iodide reached its highest concentration and iodate reached its lowest concentration during the summer when the kelp canopies were near their maximum, while the opposite pattern was observed during the winter and spring when the kelp canopies were near their minimum. Further, comparisons of these changes with corresponding changes in seawater temperature and wind speed indicated that these relationships were relatively small compared to those with changes in kelp biomass. Together, our data show a strong relationship between kelp biomass and iodine metabolism."

A HPV-16 candidate therapeutic vaccine, LALF32-51-E7, was developed by fusing a modified E7 protein to a bacterial cell-penetrating peptide (LALF): this elicited both tumour protection and regression in pre-clinical immunization studies. In the current study, we investigated the potential for producing LALF32-51-E7 in a plant expression system by evaluating the effect of subcellular localization and usage of different expression vectors and gene silencing suppressors. The highest expression levels of LALF32-51-E7 were obtained by using a self-replicating plant expression vector and chloroplast targeting, which increased its accumulation by 27-fold compared to cytoplasmic localization. The production and extraction of LALF32-51-E7 was scaled-up and purification optimized by affinity chromatography. If further developed, this platform could potentially allow for the production of a more affordable therapeutic vaccine for HPV-16. This would be extremely relevant in the context of developing countries, where cervical cancer and other HPV-related malignancies are most prevalent, and where the population have limited or no access to preventative vaccines due to their typical high costs."
https://openalex.org/W2742425545,"Many drugs used for non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular purposes, such as sotalol, have the side effect of prolonging cardiac repolarization, which can trigger life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias by inhibiting the potassium-channel IKr (KCNH2). On the electrocardiogram (ECG), IKr inhibition induces an increase in QTc and Tpeak-Tend (TpTe) interval and a decrease of T wave maximal amplitude (TAmp). These changes vary markedly between subjects, suggesting the existence of predisposing genetic factors. 990 healthy individuals, prospectively challenged with an oral 80mg sotalol dose, were monitored for changes in ventricular repolarization on ECG between baseline and 3 hours post dosing. QTc and TpTe increased by 5.5±3.5% and 15±19.6%, respectively, and TAmp decreased by 13.2±15.5%. A principal-component analysis derived from the latter ECG changes was performed. A random subsample of 489 individuals were subjected to a genome-wide-association analysis where 8,306,856 imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with QTc, TpTe and TAmp modulations, as well their derived principal-components, to search for common genetic variants associated with sotalol-induced IKr inhibition. None of the studied SNPs reached the statistical threshold for genome-wide significance. This study supports the lack of common variants with larger effect sizes than one would expect based on previous ECG genome-wide-association studies.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00773201."

Considerable methodological variability exists. The effect of data acquisition and image analysis parameters on quantitative uptake measures, such as standardized uptake value (SUV) and target-to-background ratio (TBR) has not been investigated extensively. Objective The goal of this study was to explore the effect of several data acquisition and image analysis parameters on quantification of vascular wall 18F-FDG uptake measures, in order to increase awareness of potential variability. Methods Three whole-body emission scans and a low-dose CT scan were acquired 38, 60 and 90 minutes after injection of 18F-FDG in six rheumatoid arthritis patients with high cardiovascular risk profiles.Data acquisition (1 and 2) and image analysis (3, 4 and 5) parameters comprised:1. 18F-FDG uptake time, 2. SUV normalisation, 3. drawing regions/volumes of interest (ROI’s/VOI’s) according to: a. hot-spot (HS), b. whole-segment (WS) and c. most-diseased segment (MDS), 4. Background activity, 5. Image matrix/voxel size.Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC’s) and Bland Altman plots were used to assess agreement between these techniques and between observers. A linear mixed model was used to determine the association between uptake time and continuous outcome variables. Results 1. Significantly higher TBRmax values were found at 90 minutes (1,57 95%CI 1,35–1,80) compared to 38 minutes (1,30 95%CI 1,21–1,39) (P = 0,024) 2. Normalising SUV for BW, LBM and BSA significantly influences average SUVmax (2,25 (±0,60) vs 1,67 (±0,37) vs 0,058 (±0,013)). 3. Intraclass correlation coefficients were high in all vascular segments when SUVmax HS was compared to SUVmax WS. SUVmax HS was consistently higher than SUVmax MDS in all vascular segments. 4. Blood pool activity significantly decreases in all (venous and arterial) segments over time, but does not differ between segments. 5. Image matrix/voxel size does not influence SUVmax. Conclusion Quantitative measures of vascular wall 18F-FDG uptake are affected mainly by changes in data acquisition parameters. Standardization of methodology needs to be considered when studying atherosclerosis and/or vasculitis."
https://openalex.org/W2743244543,"Neural oscillation is attracting attention as an underlying mechanism for speech recognition. Speech intelligibility is enhanced by the synchronization of speech rhythms and slow neural oscillation, which is typically observed as human scalp electroencephalography (EEG). In addition to the effect of neural oscillation, it has been proposed that speech recognition is enhanced by the identification of a speaker’s motor signals, which are used for speech production. To verify the relationship between the effect of neural oscillation and motor cortical activity, we measured scalp EEG, and simultaneous EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a speech recognition task in which participants were required to recognize spoken words embedded in noise sound. We proposed an index to quantitatively evaluate the EEG phase effect on behavioral performance. The results showed that the delta and theta EEG phase before speech inputs modulated the participant’s response time when conducting speech recognition tasks. The simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment showed that slow EEG activity was correlated with motor cortical activity. These results suggested that the effect of the slow oscillatory phase was associated with the activity of the motor cortex during speech recognition."

Seventy seven SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP) (HLA matched unrelated donor (MUD), n = 50; matched related donor (MRD), n = 27) underwent whole exome sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generating alloreactive peptide libraries for each DRP (9-mer peptide-HLA complexes); Human CMV CROSS (Cross-Reactive Open Source Sequence) database was compiled from NCBI; HLA class I binding affinity for each DRPs HLA was calculated by NetMHCpan 2.8 and hCMV- derived 9-mers algorithmically compared to the alloreactive peptide-HLA complex libraries. Short consecutive (≥6) amino acid (AA) sequence homology matching hCMV to recipient peptides was considered for HLA-bound-peptide (IC50<500nM) cross reactivity. Of the 70,686 hCMV 9-mers contained within the hCMV CROSS database, an average of 29,658 matched the MRD DRP alloreactive peptides and 52,910 matched MUD DRP peptides (p<0.001). In silico analysis revealed multiple high affinity, immunogenic CMV-Human peptide matches (IC50<500 nM) expressed in GVHD-affected tissue-specific manner. hCMV+GVHD was found in 18 patients, 13 developing hCMV viremia before GVHD onset.

https://openalex.org/W2745124879,"Adaptive management involves learning-oriented decision making in the presence of uncertainty about the responses of a resource system to management. It is implemented through an iterative sequence of decision making, monitoring and assessment of system responses, and incorporating what is learned into future decision making. Decision making at each point is informed by a value or objective function, for example total harvest anticipated over some time frame. The value function expresses the value associated with decisions, and it is influenced by system status as updated through monitoring. Often, decision making follows shortly after a monitoring event. However, it is certainly possible for the cadence of decision making to differ from that of monitoring. In this paper we consider different combinations of annual and biennial decision making, along with annual and biennial monitoring. With biennial decision making decisions are changed only every other year; with biennial monitoring field data are collected only every other year. Different cadences of decision making combine with annual and biennial monitoring to define 4 scenarios. Under each scenario we describe optimal valuations for active and passive adaptive decision making. We highlight patterns in valuation among scenarios, depending on the occurrence of monitoring and decision making events. Differences between years are tied to the fact that every other year a new decision can be made no matter what the scenario, and state information is available to inform that decision. In the subsequent year, however, in 3 of the 4 scenarios either a decision is repeated or monitoring does not occur (or both). There are substantive differences in optimal values among the scenarios, as well as the optimal policies producing those values. Especially noteworthy is the influence of monitoring cadence on valuation in some years. We highlight patterns in policy and valuation among the scenarios, and discuss management implications and extensions."
https://openalex.org/W2742523565,"The objective of this study was to assess the usability benefits of adding a bedside central control interface that controls all intravenous (IV) infusion pumps compared to the conventional individual control of multiple infusion pumps. Eighteen dedicated ICU nurses volunteered in a between-subjects task-based usability test. A newly developed central control interface was compared to conventional control of multiple infusion pumps in a simulated ICU setting. Task execution time, clicks, errors and questionnaire responses were evaluated. Overall the central control interface outperformed the conventional control in terms of fewer user actions (40±3 vs. 73±20 clicks, p<0.001) and fewer user errors (1±1 vs. 3±2 errors, p<0.05), with no difference in task execution times (421±108 vs. 406±119 seconds, not significant). Questionnaires indicated a significant preference for the central control interface. Despite being novice users of the central control interface, ICU nurses displayed improved performance with the central control interface compared to the conventional interface they were familiar with. We conclude that the new user interface has an overall better usability than the conventional interface."

Aberrant anti-EBV immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies (EBV-IgA) may be present in the sera of non-cancer individuals and predict NPC. Limited studies report the presence of EBV-IgA antibodies within non-cancer individuals in Indonesia where the disease is prevalent. This study aimed at exploring whether EBV-IgA was found more frequently among first degree relatives of NPC patients and individuals presenting with chronic symptoms in the head and neck area compared to healthy controls. A total of 967 non-cancer subjects were recruited, including 509 family members of NPC cases, 196 individuals having chronic complaints in the head and neck region, and 262 healthy donors of the local blood bank. Sera were analyzed using a standardized peptide-based EBV-IgA ELISA. Overall, 61.6% of all individuals had anti-EBV IgA reactivity equal to or below cut off value (CoV). Seroreactivity above CoV was significantly higher in females (38.7%) compared to males (28.7%) (p = 0.001). Older individuals had more seroreactivity above CoV (42.5%) than the younger ones (26.4%) (p< 0.001). Seroprevalence was significantly higher in family members of NPC patients (41.7%), compared to 32.7% of individuals with chronic head and neck problems (p = 0.028) and 16.4% healthy blood donors (p< 0.001). As conclusion, this study showed a significant higher seroprevalence in healthy family members of NPC cases and subjects presenting with chronic symptoms in the head and neck area compared to healthy individuals from the general community. This finding indicates that both groups have elevated risk of developing NPC and may serve as targets for a regional NPC screening program."

Without heterologous binding partners, BECN1 forms an antiparallel homodimer via its coiled-coil domain (CCD).

Macroautophagy, hereafter called autophagy, is a conserved cellular homeostasis pathway responsible for engulfment of long-lived, misfolded, aggregated, damaged, or mutated proteins, organelles, and pathogens in multilayered vesicles called autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes to enable degradation of the sequestered contents, facilitating nutrient recycling (1De Duve C.

BECN1 up-regulates PI3KC3 activity and autophagy in response to diverse signals, although the exact mechanisms by which BECN1 performs this function remain unclear. BECN1 appears to be a major interaction hub for autophagy, interacting with at least 20 different cellular proteins as well as five virus (HIV, influenza virus, α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses)-encoded proteins that inhibit autophagy to prevent virus degradation (24Levine B.

Although the mechanism(s) by which BECN1 binds so many diverse partners is unknown, conformational flexibility often facilitates multivalent protein interactions, allowing one protein to interact with various binding partners to carry out diverse functions. Thus, understanding BECN1 conformational flexibility is key to understanding varied BECN1 interactions, which, in turn, will improve our understanding of the role of BECN1 in autophagy. Ultimately, this is essential to better understand how eukaryotic organisms respond to and survive cellular stressors. BECN1 is a conformationally flexible protein that has at least four domains (27Mei Y. Glover K. Su M. Sinha S.C.

The CCD (residues 175–265 in human BECN1) and the BARAD (residues 266–450 in human BECN1) are highly conserved, well-folded domains. The BARAD bears an aromatic finger composed of residues 359–361 (residues 430–432 of yeast VPS30) that is required for BARAD binding to membranes (33Huang W. Choi W. Hu W. Mi N. Guo Q. Ma M. Liu M. Tian Y. Lu P. Wang F.-L. Deng H. Liu L. Gao N. Yu L. Shi Y. Crystal structure and biochemical analyses reveal Beclin 1 as a novel membrane binding protein.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 473-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy hydrogen–deuterium exchange experiments show that this aromatic finger probably interacts with membranes when part of the PI3KC3 complex (13Rostislavleva K. Soler N. Ohashi Y. Zhang L. Pardon E. Burke J.E. Masson G.R. Johnson C. Steyaert J. Ktistakis N.T. Williams R.L. Structure and flexibility of the endosomal Vps34 complex reveals the basis of its function on membranes.Science. 2015; 350: aac7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, residues 248–264 preceding the BARAD form a helical region that we have named the “overlap helix” (OH), because it has been crystallized in two differently packed states: (i) as part of the anti-parallel CCD homodimer (30Li X. He L. Che K.H. Funderburk S.F. Pan L. Pan N. Zhang M. Yue Z. Zhao Y. Imperfect interface of Beclin1 coiled-coil domain regulates homodimer and heterodimer formation with Atg14L and UVRAG.Nat.

Identification of BECN1 and ATG14 coiled-coil interface residues important for starvation-induced autophagy.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 4239-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), constituting the C-terminal four turns of each CCD, or (ii) packed against the BARAD (33Huang W. Choi W. Hu W. Mi N. Guo Q. Ma M. Liu M. Tian Y. Lu P. Wang F.-L. Deng H. Liu L. Gao N. Yu L. Shi Y. Crystal structure and biochemical analyses reveal Beclin 1 as a novel membrane binding protein.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 473-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Notably, in the structure of the quaternary complex of yeast VPS34/PI3KC3, VPS15, VPS30/BECN1, and VPS38/UVRAG, VPS30 residues 304–327 (equivalent to residues 248–271 of human BECN1) are part of the VPS30/BECN1 CCD and pack against the VPS38/UVRAG CCD, stabilizing the parallel CCD heterodimer (13Rostislavleva K. Soler N. Ohashi Y. Zhang L. Pardon E. Burke J.E. Masson G.R. Johnson C. Steyaert J. Ktistakis N.T. Williams R.L. Structure and flexibility of the endosomal Vps34 complex reveals the basis of its function on membranes.Science. 2015; 350: aac7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This led to the assumption that the OH is part of the CCD in the context of full-length BECN1. Notably, mass spectroscopy hydrogen–deuterium exchange experiments indicate that VPS30 residues 312–327 (equivalent to BECN1 residues 256–271), which compose the latter half of the OH, undergo membrane binding–induced conformational changes, although these residues do not directly bind membranes (13Rostislavleva K. Soler N. Ohashi Y. Zhang L. Pardon E. Burke J.E. Masson G.R. Johnson C. Steyaert J. Ktistakis N.T. Williams R.L. Structure and flexibility of the endosomal Vps34 complex reveals the basis of its function on membranes.Science. 2015; 350: aac7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, different conformational states of the BECN1 OH probably play important roles in regulating protein–membrane or protein–protein interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that the BECN1 homodimer exists in cells (34Adi-Harel S. Erlich S. Schmukler E. Cohen-Kedar S. Segev O. Mizrachy L. Hirsch J.A. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Beclin 1 self-association is independent of autophagy induction by amino acid deprivation and rapamycin treatment.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the OH as part of the anti-parallel CCD homodimer would greatly increase stability of the autophagy-inactive homodimer. However, it is unknown whether the BECN1 OH is part of the CCD or the BARAD when BECN1 is not part of PI3KC3 complexes; nor have the factors that regulate this conformational change been established. Therefore, to determine the packing state of the OH in the absence of heterologous binding partners, we investigated the solution structure of a two-domain CCD–BARAD BECN1 fragment using CD spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in tandem with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Further, we assessed the impact of mutating OH residues that pack against either the partner helix of the CCD or the BARAD on self-dissociation, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC); on structure and stability of the CCD, BARAD, and CCD–BARAD by monitoring thermal denaturation by CD and structural changes by SAXS; and last on cellular autophagy levels by evaluating the change in the number of autophagosomes per cell. Superimposition of the human BECN1 OH of the OH+BARAD (PDB entry 4DDP) and one chain of the CCD homodimer (PDB entry 5HHE) reveals that the OH cannot simultaneously be within the CCD and packed against the BARAD, as there are extensive steric conflicts between the BARAD and the partner helix of the CCD (Fig. 1). Further, the same five OH residues (Val250, Met254, Ala257, Leu261, and Leu264) involved in the CCD homodimer interface also pack against the BARAD (Fig. 1). Thus, the OH in the CCD and OH+BARAD crystal structures represent mutually exclusive conformations of BECN1. Approximately 1359 Å2 of surface area are buried upon the OH packing against the BARAD, significantly more than the 937 Å2 buried when the OH packs within the CCD. Within the CCD, OH residues are only involved in paired interactions. However, OH residues pack against the first β-sheet and third α-helix of the BARAD (Fig. 1), resulting in more extensive packing. Each of the OH interface residues is largely conserved from yeast to humans (supplemental Fig. S1A). The position equivalent to human Met254 is least well-conserved, although all examined vertebrates have a Met or Val at equivalent positions. In comparison with the OH, residues of the partner BECN1 CCD that pack against the OH are not as well-conserved (supplemental Fig. S1B). Based on this preliminary analysis, we hypothesized that simultaneous alanine mutagenesis of four of the common OH interface residues (V250A, M254A, L261A, and L264A (tetrad mutant)) would differently impact structure and stability of the CCD and BARAD. Structural and thermodynamic analyses of these differences would allow us to determine whether the OH is part of the CCD, packs against the BARAD, or transitions between the two states. We find that the WT OH+BARAD and CCD–BARAD proteins aggregate during purification. Analysis of the OH+BARAD crystal structure (PDB entry 4DDP) indicates that the OH+BARAD molecules are arranged in a head-to-tail manner in the crystal lattice, stabilized by the aromatic finger, consisting of Phe359, Phe360, and Trp361, of one OH+BARAD molecule being buried within a hydrophobic pocket formed partly by the OH in the next OH+BARAD molecule (33Huang W. Choi W. Hu W. Mi N. Guo Q. Ma M. Liu M. Tian Y. Lu P. Wang F.-L. Deng H. Liu L. Gao N. Yu L. Shi Y. Crystal structure and biochemical analyses reveal Beclin 1 as a novel membrane binding protein.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 473-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). We hypothesized that this interaction may be the cause of protein aggregation during purification of WT OH+BARAD–containing constructs. The AFM, wherein the aromatic finger residues, Phe359, Phe360, and Trp361, are mutated to Asp, has no effect on the secondary structure content estimated from CD (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table S1) or the SEC-SAXS profiles (supplemental Fig. S4 and Table S2) of the CCD+BARAD constructs. This is consistent with previously published analyses that showed that the AFM does not change the overall secondary structure or thermal stability of the BECN1 OH+BARAD (33Huang W. Choi W. Hu W. Mi N. Guo Q. Ma M. Liu M. Tian Y. Lu P. Wang F.-L. Deng H. Liu L. Gao N. Yu L. Shi Y. Crystal structure and biochemical analyses reveal Beclin 1 as a novel membrane binding protein.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 473-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, we find that the AFM improves the yield of soluble homogeneous protein for both OH+BARAD and CCD+BARAD fragments. Because introduction of the AFM dramatically reduced aggregation and permitted large-scale purification of homogenous, high-quality protein without affecting structure, all BARAD-containing proteins used for subsequent analysis bear the AFM. The BECN1 CCD interface is composed of 26 interacting pairs comprising 13 unique pairs related by 2-fold homodimer symmetry. Only six of these 13 unique pairs constitute residue pairs that form good hydrophobic interactions, whereas for each of the remaining seven pairs, one residue has a polar and/or bulky side chain, resulting in non-ideal packing (30Li X. He L. Che K.H. Funderburk S.F. Pan L. Pan N. Zhang M. Yue Z. Zhao Y. Imperfect interface of Beclin1 coiled-coil domain regulates homodimer and heterodimer formation with Atg14L and UVRAG.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 662Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Mei Y. Su M. Sanishvili R. Chakravarthy S. Colbert C.L. Sinha S.C. Identification of BECN1 and ATG14 coiled-coil interface residues important for starvation-induced autophagy.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 4239-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At the termini of each set of 13 interacting pairs within the CCD homodimer, each OH contributes to five pairs of interactions: Val250–Glu191, Met254–Leu187, Ala257–Leu184, Leu261–Leu180, and Leu264–Ser177 (supplemental Fig. S1). This includes three of the six good hydrophobic interacting pairs. Thus, the OH contributes half of the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the BECN1 CCD homodimer. To assess the effect of the tetrad mutation on CCD homodimerization, we compared dimer self-dissociation constants (Kd) of the CCD and CCDTETRAD, as quantified by ITC. At 20 °C, self-association of the CCDTETRAD is ∼1.5-fold weaker than that of the WT CCD (Table 1). A comparison of the secondary structure content estimated by analysis of CD spectra for the CCD and CCDTETRAD indicates that the tetrad mutation reduces helicity by ∼9.5 residues with a concomitant ∼9-residue increase in coil content of the CCD but does not impact β-strand content (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Therefore, the tetrad mutation destabilizes CCD secondary structure. The cooperative, reversible melting curves indicate that the melting temperature (Tm) of ∼33.5 °C of the WT CCD (Fig. 2B and Table 2) decreases substantially to 22.5 °C for the CCDTETRAD (Fig. 2C and Table 2), which is also indicative of the tetrad mutation destabilizing the CCD structure.Table 1Thermodynamics of self-dissociation of CCD-containing BECN1 fragmentsBECN1 fragmentKdΔHaΔH = change in enthalpy.ΔSbΔS = change in entropy.μmkJ/molJ/K molCCD44.8 ± 2.045.0 ± 10.5236.6 ± 36.2CCDTETRAD70.7 ± 3.1157.0 ± 8.8615.1 ± 30.0CCD-BARADAFM61.0 ± 8.1207.1 ± 21.5787.1 ± 73.0CCD-BARADAFM,TETRAD134.2 ± 4.9143.0 ± 10.3561.9 ± 34.9a ΔH = change in enthalpy.b ΔS = change in entropy.

Open table in a new tab We used SEC-SAXS to investigate the impact of the tetrad mutation on size, shape, and structure of the CCD. The Rg of the CCDTETRAD, estimated from the Guinier plot and P(r) distribution, is ∼39 Å (Fig. 3 (A and B) and Table 3), which is similar to the Rg of ∼36 Å reported for the WT CCD (31Mei Y. Su M. Sanishvili R. Chakravarthy S. Colbert C.L. Sinha S.C. Identification of BECN1 and ATG14 coiled-coil interface residues important for starvation-induced autophagy.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 4239-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the Dmax of the CCDTETRAD obtained from the P(r) distribution is 155 Å, which is about 30% longer than the Dmax reported for the CCD (31Mei Y. Su M. Sanishvili R. Chakravarthy S. Colbert C.L. Sinha S.C.

Further, the Kratky plot indicates that the CCDTETRAD is largely unfolded (Fig. 3C), in contrast to the CCD, which is well-folded (31Mei Y. Su M. Sanishvili R. Chakravarthy S. Colbert C.L. Sinha S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2743251758,"Analysis of the nursing registration databases is a highly informative approach that provides accurate and reliable information supporting evidence based decisions relevant to the nursing workforce planning, management and development. This study presents the first systematic analysis of the nursing registration database in Lebanon. It Reports on the workforce distribution and trends using an updated version of the Order of Nurses in Lebanon (ONL) databases.This study presents a secondary data analysis of a de-identified subset of the updated ONL registration database. The workforce participation status of ONL registered nurses was categorized as active and eligible. For active nurses sectors and sub-sectors of employment were defined. Eligible nurses were categorized as unemployed, working outside nursing and working abroad. SPSS was used to conduct descriptive analysis to present workforce trends of Lebanese nurses for year 2009-2014 as frequencies, percentages and percentage changes.Increases in the size of the Active (35%) and Eligible (86%) nurses were observed over the past six years. The majority of nurses fell in the below 35 years age group (60% in 2014). The hospital sector remained the principle employer, with 87% of Lebanese nurses working in hospitals in 2014. A 173% increases was reported for nurses working abroad.Despite the growth of the Active nursing workforce, the skewed distribution of nurses in the below 35 age group and the growth in the Eligible category, especially for nurses living abroad, raise concerns on the longevity of nurses in the profession and the reasons for their attrition from the workforce.There is a need to investigate the push and pull factors that are affecting nurses and the design of policies and interventions that would encourage nurses to remain active in Lebanon. Furthermore, policies and interventions that would create employment opportunities outside hospitals, especially in the Community sector, are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2743612852,"The effects of retinoids on adrenal aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) expression and aldosterone secretion are still unknown. We therefore examined the effects of nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR) pan-agonist PA024 on CYP11B2 expression, aldosterone secretion and blood pressure, to elucidate its potential as a novel anti-hypertensive drug. We demonstrated that PA024 significantly suppressed angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced CYP11B2 mRNA expression, promoter activity and aldosterone secretion in human adrenocortical H295R cells. Human CYP11B2 promoter functional analyses using its deletion and point mutants indicated that the suppression of CYP11B2 promoter activity by PA024 was in the region from -1521 (full length) to -106 including the NBRE-1 and the Ad5 elements, and the Ad5 element may be mainly involved in the PA024-mediated suppression. PA024 also significantly suppressed the Ang II-induced mRNA expression of transcription factors NURR1 and NGFIB that bind to and activate the Ad5 element. NURR1 overexpression demonstrated that the decrease of NURR1 expression may contribute to the PA024-mediated suppression of CYP11B2 transcription. PA024 also suppressed the Ang II-induced mRNA expression of StAR, HSD3β2 and CYP21A2, a steroidogenic enzyme group involved in aldosterone biosynthesis. Additionally, the PA024-mediated CYP11B2 transcription suppression was shown to be exerted via RXRα. Moreover, the combination of PPARγ agonist pioglitazone and PA024 caused synergistic suppressive effects on CYP11B2 mRNA expression. Finally, PA024 treatment significantly lowered both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in Tsukuba hypertensive mice (hRN8-12 x hAG2-5). Thus, RXR pan-agonist PA024 may be a candidate anti-hypertensive drugs that acts via the suppression of aldosterone synthesis and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2744180372,"Background and objective Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using drug-eluting stents (DES) is an indispensable treatment for coronary artery disease. However, to evaluate the performance of various types of stents for PCI, numerous resources are required. We extracted clinical information from free-text records and, using practice-based evidence, compared the efficacy of various DES. Materials and methods We developed a text mining tool based on regular expression and applied it to PCI reports stored in the electronic health records (EHRs) of Ajou University Hospital from 2010–2014. The PCI data were extracted from EHRs with a sensitivity of 0.996, a specificity of 1.000, and an F-measure of 0.995 when compared with a sample of 200 reports. Using these data, we compared the performance of stents by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox hazard proportional regression. Results In the self-validation analysis comparing the first-generation to the second-generation DES, the second-generation DES was superior to the first-generation DES (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.423, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.284–0.630) in terms of target vessel revascularization (TVR), showing similar findings to the established results of previous studies. Among the second-generation DES, the biodegradable-polymer DES tended to be superior, with a risk of TVR (HR: 0.568, 95% CI: 0.281–1.147) falling below than that for the durable-polymer DES approximately 1 year after the index procedure. The Endeavor stent had the highest TVR risk among the newer generation DES (HR: 2.576, 95% CI: 1.273–5.210). Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated how to construct a PCI data warehouse of PCI-related parameters obtained from free-text electronic records with high accuracy for use in the post surveillance of coronary stents in a time- and cost effective manner. Post surveillance of the practice based evidence in the PCI data warehouse indicated that the biodegradable-polymer DES might have a lower risk of TVR than the durable-polymer DES."
https://openalex.org/W2744841818,"Ciliopathies are a group of rare disorders characterized by a high genetic and phenotypic variability, which complicates their molecular diagnosis. Hence the need to use the latest powerful approaches to faster identify the genetic defect in these patients. We applied whole exome sequencing to six consanguineous families clinically diagnosed with ciliopathy-like disease, and for which mutations in predominant Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) genes had previously been excluded. Our strategy, based on first applying several filters to ciliary variants and using many of the bioinformatics tools available, allowed us to identify causal mutations in BBS2, ALMS1 and CRB1 genes in four families, thus confirming the molecular diagnosis of ciliopathy. In the remaining two families, after first rejecting the presence of pathogenic variants in common cilia-related genes, we adopted a new filtering strategy combined with prioritisation tools to rank the final candidate genes for each case. Thus, we propose CORO2B, LMO7 and ZNF17 as novel candidate ciliary genes, but further functional studies will be needed to confirm their role. Our data show the usefulness of this strategy to diagnose patients with unclear phenotypes, and therefore the success of applying such technologies to achieve a rapid and reliable molecular diagnosis, improving genetic counselling for these patients. In addition, the described pipeline also highlights the common pitfalls associated to the large volume of data we have to face and the difficulty of assigning a functional role to these changes, hence the importance of designing the most appropriate strategy according to each case."
https://openalex.org/W2743084469,"Allergy to peanuts has become a common and severe problem, especially in westernized countries. In this study, we evaluated the target and epitope specificity of the capture and detection mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in a commercial peanut allergen detection platform. We first identified the target of these antibodies as Ara h 3 and then used an overlapping peptide array of Ara h 3 to determine the antibody-binding epitopes. Further amino acids critical for the binding via alanine substitutions at individual amino acid residues within the epitope were mapped. Finally, inhibition ELISA and inhibition immunoblotting using a recombinant Ara h 3 protein were performed to confirm these results. Surprisingly, the capture and detection mAbs showed identical binding characteristics and were presumed to represent two isolates of the same clone, a notion supported by both isoelectric focusing electrophoresis and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments. The simultaneous binding of a pair of identical mAbs to an individual allergen such as Ara h3 is attributed to the multivalency of the analyte and has implications for developing diagnostic assays for additional multimeric allergens."
https://openalex.org/W2743660514,"This study examined outcomes for two groups of stroke survivors treated in Veteran Health Administration (VHA) hospitals, those with a severe mental illness (SMI) and those without prior psychiatric diagnoses, to examine risk of non-psychiatric medical hospitalizations over five years after initial stroke.This retrospective cohort study included 523 veterans who survived an initial stroke hospitalization in a VHA medical center during fiscal year 2003. The survivors were followed using administrative data documenting inpatient stroke treatment, patient demographics, disease comorbidities, and VHA hospital admissions. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to examine the relationship between patients with and without SMI diagnosis preceding the stroke and their experience with non-psychiatric medical hospitalizations after the stroke.The study included 100 patients with SMI and 423 without SMI. Unadjusted means for pre-stroke non-psychiatric hospitalizations were higher (p = 0.0004) among SMI patients (1.47 ± 0.51) compared to those without SMI (1.00 ± 1.33), a difference which persisted through the first year post-stroke (SMI: 2.33 ± 2.46; No SMI: 1.74 ± 1.86; p = 0.0004). Number of non-psychiatric hospitalizations were not significantly different between the two groups after adjustment for patient sociodemographic, comorbidity, length of stay and inpatient stroke treatment characteristics. Antithrombotic medications significantly lowered risk (OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.73) for stroke-related readmission within 30 days of discharge.No significant differences in medical hospitalizations were present after adjusting for comorbid and sociodemographic characteristics between SMI and non-SMI stroke patients in the five-year follow-up. However, unadjusted results continue to draw attention to disparities, with SMI patients experiencing more non-psychiatric hospitalizations both prior to and up to one year after their initial stroke. Additionally, stroke survivors discharged on antithrombotic medications were at lower risk of re-admission within 30 days suggesting the VHA should continue to focus on effective stroke management irrespective of SMI."
https://openalex.org/W2744077778,"Organ-specific microcirculation plays a central role in tumor growth, tumor cell homing, tissue engineering, and wound healing. Mouse models are widely used to study these processes; however, these mouse strains often possess unique microhemodynamic parameters, making it difficult to directly compare experiments. The full functional characterization of bone and striated muscle microcirculatory parameters in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency/y-chain; NOD-Prkds IL2rg (NSG) mice has not yet been reported. Here, we established either a dorsal skinfold chamber or femur window in NSG mice (n = 23), allowing direct analysis of microcirculatory parameters in vivo by intravital fluorescence microscopy at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after chamber preparation. Organ-specific differences were observed. Bone had a significantly lower vessel density but a higher vessel diameter than striated muscle. Bone also showed higher effective vascular permeability than striated muscle. The centerline velocity values were similar in the femur window and dorsal skinfold chamber, with a higher volumetric blood flow in bone. Interestingly, bone and striated muscle showed similar tissue perfusion rates. Knowledge of physiological microhemodynamic values of bone and striated muscle in NSG mice makes it possible to analyze pathophysiological processes at these anatomic sites, such as tumor growth, tumor metastasis, and tumor microcirculation, as well as the response to therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2744852221,"To explore the repairing effect of combination of adipose stem cells (ASCs) and composite scaffolds on CWR, the electrospun Poly 1, 8-octanediol-co-citric acid (POC)-poly-L-lactide acid (PLA) composite scaffolds were prepared, followed by in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility evaluation of the scaffolds. Afterwards, ASCs were seeded on POC-PLA to construct the POC-PLA-ASCs scaffolds, and the POC-PLA, POC-PLA-ASCs, and traditional materials expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) were adopt for CWR in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbit models. As results, the POC-PLA-ASCs patches possessed good biocompatibility as the high proliferation ability of cells surrounding the patches. Rabbits in POC-PLA-ASCs groups showed better pulmonary function, less pleural adhesion, higher degradation rate and more neovascularization when compared with that in other two groups. The results of western blot indicated that POC-PLA-ASCs patches accelerated the expression of VEGF and Collagen I in rabbit models. From the above, our present study demonstrated that POC-PLA material was applied for CWR successfully, and ASCs seeded on the sheets could improve the pleural adhesions and promote the reparation of chest wall defects."
https://openalex.org/W2745047089,"The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum has become the second most important insect model organism and is frequently used in developmental biology, genetics and pest-associated research. Consequently, the methodological arsenal increases continuously, but many routinely applied techniques for Drosophila melanogaster and other insect species are still unavailable. For example, a protocol for non-lethal genotyping has not yet been adapted but is particularly useful when individuals with known genotypes are required for downstream experiments. In this study, we present a workflow for non-lethal genotyping of T. castaneum adults based on extracting genomic DNA from wing tissue. In detail, we describe a convenient procedure for wing dissection and a custom method for wing digestion that allows PCR-based genotyping of up to fifty adults in less than an afternoon with a success rate of about 86%. The amount of template is sufficient for up to ten reactions while viability and fertility of the beetles are preserved. We prove the applicability of our protocol by genotyping the white / scarlet gene pair alleles from the black-eyed San Bernadino wild-type and white-eyed Pearl recessive mutant strains spanning four generations. Non-lethal genotyping has the potential to improve and accelerate many workflows: Firstly, during the establishment process of homozygous cultures or during stock keeping of cultures that carry recessively lethal alleles, laborious test crossing is replaced by non-lethal genotyping. Secondly, in genome engineering assays, non-lethal genotyping allows the identification of appropriate founders before they are crossed against wild-types, narrowing the efforts down to only the relevant individuals. Thirdly, non-lethal genotyping simplifies experimental strategies, in which genotype and behavior should be correlated, since the genetic configuration of potential individuals can be determined before the actual behavior assays is performed."
https://openalex.org/W2742850159,"Background Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a significant nosocomial infection worldwide, that recurs in as many as 35% of infections. Risk of CDI recurrence varies by ribotype, which also vary in sporulation and germination rates. Whether sporulation/germination mediate risk of recurrence and effectiveness of treatment of recurring CDI remains unclear. We aim to assess the role of sporulation/germination patterns on risk of recurrence, and the relative effectiveness of the recommended tapered/pulsing regimens using an in silico model. Methods We created a compartmental in-host mathematical model of CDI, composed of vegetative cells, toxins, and spores, to explore whether sporulation and germination have an impact on recurrence rates. We also simulated the effectiveness of three tapered/pulsed vancomycin regimens by ribotype. Results Simulations underscored the importance of sporulation/germination patterns in determining pathogenicity and transmission. All recommended regimens for recurring CDI tested were effective in reducing risk of an additional recurrence. Most modified regimens were still effective even after reducing the duration or dosage of vancomycin. However, the effectiveness of treatment varied by ribotype. Conclusion Current CDI vancomycin regimen for treating recurrent cases should be studied further to better balance associated risks and benefits."
