https://openalex.org/W2028225563,"A unique form of lactate dehydrogenase was observed in the starch-gel electrophoretic patterns of adult human testes. It was present in sperm, but absent in prepubertal testes. Its electrophoretic mobility, heat stability, kinetic behavior with pyridine nucleotide analogs, and chromatographic characteristics on diethylaminoethyl cellulose were intermediate to those observed for lactate dehydrogenase isozymes 3 and 4."

These observations suggest that the rate-limiting factor for the former is membrane excitability (depressed by increased calcium), while that for the latter is the role that calcium plays in coupling membrane excitation with the development of tension by the contractile protein (a function that is augmented by increased calcium)."
https://openalex.org/W1990668691,"Human spermatozoa, representing a homogeneous population of postmitotic cells, contain five electrophoretically distinct lactic dehydrogenases and two malic dehydrogenases. This indicates that molecular heterogeneity of enzymes is characteristic of the individual cell and is not a reflection of heterogeneity of cell types within a tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1991955125,"Direct measurements of the freezing point depression of the protoplasm and of the fluid from the contractile vacuole of fresh-water amoebae showed that the fluid in the vacuole is distinctly hypoosmotic to the protoplasm. Fourteen samples of protoplasm from amoebae, placed in a medium with a milliosmolality of 7, had an average osmolality of 101 milliosmoles with a range of 73 to 116. Eleven samples of vacuolar fluid had an average osmolality of 32 milliosmoles, with a range of 24 to 38. It is suggested that the fluid may be isoosmotic to the protoplasm when secreted and that salt is subsequently reabsorbed, leaving the vacuolar fluid hypoosmotic to the protoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2043558286,"A microscopic, cytochemical technique for assay of interferon is described in which psittacosis virus is the indicator agent. Interferon, produced in tissue culture cells in response to duck hepatitis virus, is used to illustrate the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2024884527,"Ultrasonic vibrations can be perceived as audible sounds when a piezoelectric transducer is pressed against certain areas of the human body. In the range of frequencies investigated (20 to 108 kcy/sec), the threshold of perception seemed to lie near the threshold of feeling (about 10(-4) watt/cm(2)), and the perceived audible sound appeared to be between 8 and 9 kcy/sec, as judged by six test subjects. The threshold of perception and the perceived frequency appear to be dependent upon the hearing characteristics of the individual."

https://openalex.org/W1964476010,"Anterior hypothalamic temperature is reported for the unanesthetized cat resting at an air temperature of 22 degrees to 25 degrees C during the ingestion of cold or warm liquids, and during sleep. Drinking cold (5 degrees C) milk resulted in an immediate depression of hypothalamic temperature and a period of peripheral vasodilation in the ear and forepaw foot and toe pads, followed by a drop in rectal temperature. Drinking warm (body temperature) milk did not bring about these changes. Hypothalamic temperature during sleep is lower by approximately 0.5 degrees C and is characterized by widely varying, slow-frequency oscillations, compared to the higher, more precisely controlled temperature seen when the animal is awake."
https://openalex.org/W1997693826,"Fresh mammalian nerve, when subjected to a small stretch, shows a beading phenomenon. The larger fibers appear as a series of dilations and constrictions at intervals of 40 to 75 μ. Upon relaxation this beading is gone within a minute. The beading is not produced by the special technique of freeze-substitution used to show the phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2041302775,"In the presence of actinomycin D (90 μg/ml), mitosis in root meristem of Allium cepa L. ceases after a delay of 36 hours. The block occurs at interphase. Differentiation of prevascular tissue is suppressed, and the evidence suggests it begins to fail before mitosis stops. Autoradiograms of roots treated with tritiated uracil show that synthesis of ribonucleic acid is blocked after mitosis fails. The effects of the antibiotic are reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2076862484,"Three out of 18 psychotic children excreted N-methylmetanephrine, a metabolite of N-methylepinephrine. It is not clear whether this tertiary amine plays a part in causing some forms of psychosis or is merely a secondary result of mental dysfunction. Urinary excretion of bufotenin and of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine, each of which has been reported elevated in some adult schizophrenics, was not unusual in these children."
https://openalex.org/W2053909053,"Small folds and fractures (thrusts) up to 50 feet apart that have produced polygonal patterns in the Bonneville salt crust, western Utah, are believed to be caused by the annual expansion of the salt crust due to the growth of salt crystals within the salt layer plus the effect of increased summer temperature. It is suggested that these strain systems are caused by positive (compressional) isotropic planar stresses developed within the salt layers of the salt crust."
https://openalex.org/W2071496530,About 60 percent of the area shown in photographs taken at the axis of Florida Straits exhibits well-defined current ripple marks. These ripples indicate a flow of water of at least 0.2 to 0.6 knots from the north. This current is in the opposite direction from the surface currents of 2 to 4 or more knots.
https://openalex.org/W2018559207,"Previous indirect evidence that the endogenous concentration of plant hormones of the auxin type is controlled by a limitation of transport over the physiological range of concentration was confirmed by measuring directly the transport of the native auxin, indoleacetic acid, through segments of Coleus stems."
https://openalex.org/W2082879833,"The abundances of zirconium and hafnium in stone meteorites, were determined by neutron activation analysis. Specific radiochemical separations were used to obtain individual zirconium and hafnium samples of high radiochemical purity. The average abundance of zirconium in chondrites for six analyses was 35 parts per million; of hafnium, 0.19 ppm. The hafnium abundances are in good general agreement with the predictions of current theories of nucleosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030875977,Infant chimpanzees look at a visual stimulus for a regularly decreasing proportion of the time after presentation of the stimulus. Individual differences and presentation of a novel object affect the general level of fixation but do not significantly influence the slope of the curve showing the decline of fixation with time.
https://openalex.org/W1994856064,"Hazards from exposure to radiation are discussed. Sources of natural radiation are described. Early records of damage to man by ionizing radiation are summarized. The establishment of national and international standards for maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to radiation is reviewed. Considerations in the selection of MPE values are outlined, and units are defined. (M.C.G.)"
https://openalex.org/W2169448943,"Most uplifted islands lie in one of three types of tectonic location: on mid-ocean ridges; between 200 and 750 km on the convex side of island arcs; and along a great circle across the southern Pacific, which may be a fault. Since the usual habit of islands is to subside, these islands may owe their uplift to their special tectonic positions. The regularity of this pattern of uplift supports the view that in the earth an elastic surface layer rests upon a plastic or viscous substratum."

https://openalex.org/W1987368779,"Pneumococcal polysaccharides were implanted in rat brain and their distribution was studied by immunofluorescence. The polysaccharides spread selectively in white matter, and frequently extended from anterior to posterior poles. The results suggest that selective localization of experimental and natural leukoencephalopathies may be related to an innate property of white matter that permits or facilitates spread of noxious agents."
https://openalex.org/W1975978359,Fifty years ago Köllner reported that the initial fleeting sensation in binocular color rivalry is a bipartite color field such that the color presented to the left eye appears to the left of the color presented to the right eye. A method is described for maintaining such quasi hemianopia for long periods of time.

https://openalex.org/W2054698392,A simulator of lunar permafrost at 100 degrees K exhibits a dielectric relaxation centered at approximately 300 hertz. If permafrost exists in the moon between 100 degrees and 213 degrees K it should present a relaxation peak at approximately 300 hertz. For temperatures up to 263 degrees K it may go up to 20 kilohertz.
