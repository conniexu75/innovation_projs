https://openalex.org/W2095358033,"2,3-Dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) is an analog of the quinoxalinedione antagonists to the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate receptor. NBQX is a potent and selective inhibitor of binding to the quisqualate subtype of the glutamate receptor, with no activity at the NMDA and glycine sites. NBQX protects against global ischemia, even when administered 2 hours after an ischemic challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2091319839,"The Na+/H+ antiporter, which regulates intracellular pH in virtually all cells, is one of the best examples of a mitogen- and oncogene-activated membrane target whose activity rapidly changes on stimulation. The activating mechanism is unknown. A Na+/H+ antiporter complementary DNA fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein, and a specific antibody to the fusion protein was prepared. Use of this antibody revealed that the Na+/H+ antiporter is a 110-kilodalton glycoprotein that is phosphorylated in growing cells. Mitogenic activation of resting hamster fibroblasts and A431 human epidermoid cells with epidermal growth factor, thrombin, phorbol esters, or serum, stimulated phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ antiporter with a time course similar to that of the rise in intracellular pH."
https://openalex.org/W1982933686,"Synchronized monkey cells pulse-labeled with [35S]-methionine and chased for various lengths of time were extracted, and immunoprecipitations were performed using monoclonal antibodies directed against the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and SV40 T antigen (T). By following a discrete population of these two proteins through the cell cycle, the following information was obtained. RB, which is wholly unphosphorylated in G1, became phosphorylated at the beginning of S and remained phosphorylated through S and G2. RB was, then, completely dephosphorylated between the end of G2 and the beginning of G1. Second, while all of the detectable unphosphorylated RB can be found complexed with T, these complexes present during G1 dissociated in S and reformed again in M or early G1. Finally, T molecules appeared to oligomerize prior to binding RB. Thus, complex formation between T and RB may be regulated in part by the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RB and by the quaternary structure of T."

https://openalex.org/W2101870905,"A number of mutants of motA, a gene necessary for flagellar rotation in E. coli, were isolated and characterized. Many mutations were dominant, owing to competition between functional and nonfunctional MotA for a limited number of sites on the flagellar motor. A new class of mutant was discovered in which flagellar torque is normal at low speeds but reduced at high speeds. Hydrogen isotope effects on these mutants indicate that MotA catalyzes proton transfer. We confirmed an earlier observation that overproduction of MotA leads to accumulation of the protein in the cytoplasmic membrane and to significant decreases in growth rate. When nonfunctional mutant variants of MotA were overproduced instead, they accumulated in the cytoplasmic membrane, but growth was not impaired. These results also suggest that MotA conducts protons. This was confirmed by measuring the proton permeabilities of vesicles containing wild-type or mutant MotA proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1527093201,"Transport of newly synthesized cholesterol and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane is interrupted by incubation at 15 degrees C. Under this condition the newly synthesized molecules accumulate in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a subcellular vesicle fraction of low density called the lipid-rich vesicle fraction. The material in the lipid-rich vesicle fraction appears to be a post-ER intermediate in the transport process to the plasma membrane (PM). Although both newly synthesized cholesterol and G protein accumulate in this intermediate compartment at 15 degrees C, suggesting cotransport, treatment with Brefeldin A does not affect cholesterol transport to the PM, whereas it strongly inhibits G protein transport. We conclude that cholesterol and G protein leave the ER in separate vesicles, the cholesterol containing vesicles bypass the Golgi apparatus and proceed to the PM, whereas G protein containing vesicles follow the well documented Golgi route to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1566160921,"Recently, we reported the purification of a 46-kDa membrane-associated platelet protein which is phosphorylated in intact platelets and platelet membranes by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (Halbrugge, M., and Walter, U. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 185, 41-50). Here we demonstrate that both cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases catalyze the rapid incorporation of up to 1.4 mol of phosphate/mol of this purified vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). A specific rabbit antiserum was prepared which recognized both the 46-kDa dephospho form and the 50-kDa phospho form of VASP in Western blots. In untreated washed platelets, VASP was found to be present primarily as a 46-kDa dephosphoprotein. Sodium nitroprusside (100 microM) raised the intracellular platelet cGMP concentration from approximately 0.44 to 4.1 microM, without a significant effect on the cAMP level, and converted up to 50% of VASP to the 50-kDa phospho form. Prostaglandin E1 (10 microM) raised the platelet cAMP concentration from approximately 4.4 to 28.4 microM, without a significant effect on the cGMP level, and shifted up to 67% of VASP to the 50-kDa phospho form. Removal of the vasodilators sodium nitroprusside and prostaglandin E1 from the platelet suspension was followed by a return of the cyclic nucleotide concentration to basal levels and subsequent conversion of the 50-kDa phospho form of VASP to the 46-kDa dephospho form. The results support the hypothesis that VASP phosphorylation is an important component of the intracellular mechanism of action of these vasodilators in human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2163743218,"A complete physical map of the 11p13 region containing the Wilms' tumor locus has been developed and used to localize a candidate Wilms' tumor gene. Our strategy to construct the map combined the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and irradiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids. These hybrids, which contain limited segments of human chromosome 11 segregrated from the remainder of the human genome, permit direct visualization of restriction fragments located in 11p13 using human interspersed repeated DNA sequences as hybridization probes. The physical map has provided a framework to identify the sites of genes responsible for the complex of disorders associated with hemizygous 11p13 deletion: Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation. The Wilms' tumor locus has been limited to a region of less than 345 kb, and a transcript with many of the characteristics expected for the Wilms' tumor gene has been localized to this region."
https://openalex.org/W1580718840,"Interferon-gamma induces tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis in human cells and cell lines. Macrophages are peculiar in the formation of large amounts of neopterin derivatives as compared to tetrahydrobiopterin (Werner, E. R., Werner-Felmayer, G., Fuchs, D., Hausen, A., Reibnegger, G., and Wachter, H. (1989) Biochem J. 262, 861-866). Here we compare the impact of interferon-gamma treatment on activities of GTP-cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16), 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, and sepiapterin reductase (EC 1.1.1.153) in human peripheral blood-derived macrophages, normal dermal fibroblasts, THP-1 myelomonocytic cells, and the T 24 bladder transitional-cell carcinoma line. Upon interferon-gamma treatment, GTP-cyclohydrolase I activity is increased 7- to 40-fold, whereas 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase activities, which are constitutively present in all four investigated cells, remain unchanged. In fibroblasts and T 24 cells GTP cyclohydrolase I activity is the rate-limiting step of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. In macrophages and in THP-1 cells, however, the induced GTP cyclohydrolase I activity is higher than the 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase activity, leading to the accumulation of neopterin and neopterin phosphates."

https://openalex.org/W1651607230,"The light-induced inactivation of the photochemical reaction center II (RCII) of oxygenic chloroplasts (photoinhibition) was investigated in cells and isolated thylakoids of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The process is resolved into a reversible conformational change followed by an irreversible modification of RCII D1 protein. The light-induced changes in vivo persisted in isolated thylakoids. The first step is characterized by (i) destabilization of the secondary acceptor semiquinone anion, Q-B, bound to the D1 protein. This is demonstrated by a reduction in the activation energy of S2,3Q-B charge recombination as measured by the thermoluminescence technique; and (ii) a rise in the intrinsic fluorescence and a decrease of the maximal fluorescence. Unoccupancy of the QB site by plastoquinone partially protected RCII against the light-induced destabilization of Q-B. The extent of charge separation (P+680Q-A) was not affected. However, the slow phase (microsecond) of P+680 dark reduction increased, and the amplitude of signal II was reduced by 20-30%, indicating that in a fraction of RCII, electron donation from Z to P+680 was impaired without losing primary photochemistry. This modification correlates with the irreversible change in D1 protein resulting in the formation of a trypsin-resistant fragment of 16 kDa detected in D1 isolated from light-exposed cells. The change in the Q-B stability could allow charge equilibration with QA and thus explain the rise in the intrinsic fluorescence level and reduction of electron flow to plastoquinone. The change in the lifetime of P+680 can account for further reduction in electron flow (photo-inhibition). The irreversible light-dependent modification of D1 may serve as the signal for its degradation and replacement by a newly synthesized molecule (turnover)."
https://openalex.org/W1989000573,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is synthesized in male germ cells. The NGF receptor (NGFR) mRNA was found in the Sertoli cells of rat testis. Hypophysectomy increased both NGFR mRNA in testis and the number of NGFR hybridizing cells in seminiferous tubules. This was suppressed by treatment with chorionic gonadotropin or testosterone, but not with follicle-stimulating hormone. The NGFR mRNA also increased after destruction of Leydig cells or blocking of the androgen receptor. This suggests that NGF produced by male germ cells regulates testicular function in an androgen-modulated fashion by mediating an interaction germ and Sertoli cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605654974,"Cultured human endothelial cells synthesize and secrete two types of plasminogen activator, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase (u-PA). Previous work from this laboratory (Hajjar, K.A., Hamel, N. M., Harpel, P. C., and Nachman, R. L. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 80, 1712-1719) has demonstrated dose-dependent, saturable, and high affinity binding of t-PA to two sites associated with cultural endothelial cell monolayers. We now report that an isolated plasma membrane-enriched endothelial cell fraction specifically binds 125I-t-PA at a single saturable site (Kd 9.1 nM; Bmax 3.1 pmol/mg membrane protein). Ligand blotting experiments demonstrated that both single and double-chain t-PA specifically bound to a Mr 40,000 membrane protein present in detergent extracts of isolated membranes, while high molecular weight, low molecular weight, and single-chain u-PA associated with a Mr 48,000 protein. Both binding interactions were reversible and cell-specific and were inhibitable by pretreatment of intact cells with nanomolar concentrations of trypsin. The relevant binding proteins were not found in subendothelial cell matrix, failed to react with antibodies to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and interacted with their respective ligands in an active site-independent manner. The isolated t-PA binding site was resistant to reduction and preserved the capacity for plasmin generation. In contrast, the isolated u-PA binding protein was sensitive to reduction, and did not maintain the catalytic activity of the ligand on the blot. The results suggest that in addition to sharing a matrix-associated binding site (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), both t-PA and u-PA have unique membrane binding sites which may regulate their function. The results also provide further support for the hypothesis that plasminogen and t-PA can assemble on the endothelial cell surface in a manner which enhances cell surface generation of plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1575373997,"Crystal structures of the complexes formed between cytochrome c peroxidase and cyanide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and fluoride have been determined and refined to 1.85 A. In all four complexes significant changes occur in the distal heme pocket due to movement of Arg-48, His-52, and a rearrangement of active site water molecules. In the cyanide, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide complexes, Arg-48 moves away from the ligand while in the fluoride complex Arg-48 moves in toward the ligand to form a hydrogen bond or ion pair with the fluoride. More subtle changes occur on the proximal side of the heme. In an earlier study at lower resolution (Edwards, S. L., Kraut, J., and Poulos, T. L. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8074-8081), we found that nitric oxide binding causes perturbations in the proximal domain involving Trp-191 which has been confirmed by the present study. Trp-191 is stacked parallel to and in contact with the proximal ligand, His-175. Nitric oxide binding results in a slight movement of Trp-191 away from His-175 and a large increase in crystallographic temperature factors indicating increased mobility of these residues on the proximal side of the heme. These proximal-side changes are unique to nitric oxide and are not related strictly to spin-state or oxidation state of the iron atom since similar changes were not observed in the cyanide (low-spin ferric), carbon monoxide (low-spin ferrous), or fluoride (high-spin ferric) complexes."

These animals were bred to beta-thalassemic mice to reduce endogenous mouse globin levels. When erythrocytes from these mice were deoxygenated, greater than 90 percent of the cells displayed the same characteristic sickled shapes as erythrocytes from humans with sickle cell disease. Compared to controls the mice have decreased hematocrits, elevated reticulocyte counts, lower hemoglobin concentrations, and splenomegaly, which are all indications of the anemia associated with human sickle cell disease."
https://openalex.org/W1533466089,"The effects of membrane potential on resting and bradykinin-stimulated changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in fura-2 loaded cultured endothelial cells from bovine atria by spectrofluorimetry. The basal and bradykinin-stimulated release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, monitored by bioassay methods, were dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Similarly, the plateau phase of the biphasic [Ca2+]i response to bradykinin stimulation exhibited a dependence on extracellular Ca2+, whereas the initial transient [Ca2+]i peak was refractory to the removal of extracellular Ca2+. The effect of membrane depolarization on the plateau phase of the bradykinin-induced change in [Ca2+]i was determined by varying [K+]o. The resting membrane potential measured under current clamp conditions was positively correlated with the extracellular [K+] (52 mV change/10-fold change in [K+]o). The observed decrease in resting and bradykinin-stimulated changes in [Ca2+]i upon depolarization is consistent with an ion transport mechanism where the influx is linearly related to the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ entry (Em - ECa). The inhibition of bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ entry by isotonic K+ was not due to the absence of extracellular Na+ since Li+ substitution did not inhibit the agonist-induced Ca2+ entry. In K(+)-free solutions and in the presence of ouabain, bradykinin evoked synchronized oscillations in [Ca2+]i in confluent endothelial cell monolayers. These [Ca2+]i oscillations between the plateau and resting [Ca2+]i levels were dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and K+ concentrations. Although the mechanism(s) underlying [Ca2+]i oscillations in vascular endothelial cells is unclear, these results suggest a role of the membrane conductance."
https://openalex.org/W1497832606,"The interaction of urokinase-type plasminogen activators with receptors on the surface of endothelial cells may play an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis and cell migration. Therefore, we investigated whether human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) express receptors for single-chain urokinase (scu-PA) on the cell surface and examined the effect of such binding on plasminogen activator activity. Binding of 125I-labeled scu-PA to HUVEC, performed at 4 degrees C, was saturable, reversible, and specific (k+1 4 +/- 1 X 10(6) min-1 M-1, k-1 6.2 +/- 1.4 X 10(-3) min-1, Kd 2.8 +/- 0.1 nM; Bmax 2.2 +/- 0.1 X 10(5) sites/cell; mean +/- S.E.). Binding of radiolabeled scu-PA was inhibited by both natural and recombinant wild-type scu-PA, high molecular weight two-chain u-PA (tcu-PA), catalytic site-inactivated tcu-PA, an amino-terminal fragment of u-PA (amino acids 1-143), and a smaller peptide (amino acids 4-42) corresponding primarily to the epidermal growth factor-like domain. Binding was not inhibited by low molecular weight urokinase or by a recombinant scu-PA missing amino acids 9-45. Cell-bound scu-PA migrated at its native molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of plasminogen, scu-PA bound to endothelial cells generated greater plasmin activity than did scu-PA in the absence of cells. In contrast, when tcu-PA was added directly to HUVEC, sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes formed with cell or matrix-associated plasminogen activator inhibitors with a loss of plasminogen activator activity. These studies suggest that endothelial cells in culture express high affinity binding sites for the epidermal growth factor domain of scu-PA. Interaction of scu-PA with these receptors may permit plasminogen activator activity to be expressed at discrete sites on the endothelial cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1505319644,"The sequential actions of phosphoinositide 4-kinase and 5-kinase and hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4,5-P2 are stimulated during platelet activation. Recently, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase has been implicated in signal transduction in several cell types. Stimulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 synthesis has been shown in polyoma middle T-transformed and platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells, and this novel lipid has been implicated in signal transduction and regulation of cell proliferation. We demonstrate the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in human platelets and show that the synthesis of this lipid (and of PtdIns(4,5)P2) is stimulated during activation of platelets by thrombin. This indicates the presence of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in platelets. We postulate that PtdIns(3,4)P2 is involved in signal transduction in platelets and discuss the possibility that this novel lipid is a substrate for phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W2106561172,"Failure to detect hydroxyl radical (.OH)-derived spin adducts of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide in electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping experiments has been offered as evidence for the lack of the endogenous capacity of stimulated human phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM] to generate .OH. Recent reports that 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide spin adducts are unstable in the presence of superoxide-generating systems such as stimulated neutrophils has raised concerns regarding the sensitivity of spin trapping techniques for assessment of phagocyte free radical formation. Consequently, we have employed a new approach that uses the spin trap N-t-butyl-alpha-phenyl-nitrone (PBN) and dimethyl sulfoxide. In the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide and PBN, the formation of .OH via three different mechanisms in air-saturated aqueous solutions all yielded a single nitroxide species whose ESR peak amplitude remained stable in the presence of superoxide (.O2-). This nitroxide, which we have assigned as PBN/.OCH3, appears to be an oxygen-centered radical derived from the spin trapping of the reaction product of O2 and methyl radical. When neutrophils, monocytes, or MDM were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or opsonized zymosan in the presence of exogenous iron, catalase-inhibitable PBN/.OCH3 was the sole nitroxide detected. In the absence of exogenous iron, no nitroxide was observed, providing evidence for the lack of the endogenous capacity of neutrophils, monocytes, and MDM to generate .OH."
https://openalex.org/W1631972804,"By photoaffinity labeling with a photolysable analog of GTP, 8-N3GTP, we were able to find at least five distinct GTP-binding proteins in Myxococcus xanthus; two of them located in the membrane and the other three in the soluble fraction. The amino-terminal sequence of the 16-kDa GTP-binding protein from the soluble fraction was determined, and the gene that encodes this protein was isolated and cloned using degenerate oligonucleotides as a probe. The DNA sequence of the gene was determined, which did not show similarity with other known proteins. The gene product was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, by using the lacZ promoter, to a level of 13% of the soluble protein. Attempts to isolate deletion mutants were unsuccessful, although double crossing-over events leading to a deletion mutation of the gene were detected by Southern blot hybridization. This result indicates that this gene is essential for cell growth. In the following paper (Munoz-Dorado, J., Inouye, S., and Inouye, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2707-2712), the gene product was biochemically characterized and identified to be a nucleoside diphosphate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1557193358,"We have examined the hydrophobicity component of signal peptide function using polymeric sequences in combination with cassette mutagenesis. Using homopolymeric units of either isoleucine, leucine, valine or alanine to replace the natural core segment of the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase signal peptide, the hydrophobicity requirements for export and processing were delineated. The transport properties of these mutants demonstrated that the net hydrophobicity determines the total extent of precursor processing, while a high mean hydrophobicity/residue is critical for complete, rapid processing and translocation. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase was converted from a periplasmic to an active membrane-anchored protein via a signal containing 20 leucine residues. This application of polymeric sequences allows systematic comparisons to be made, unambiguously revealing the hydrophobicity requirements governing specific steps in the transport process."
https://openalex.org/W14348138,"The gene that encodes the 16-kDa GTP-binding protein from Myxococcus xanthus has been cloned, and its DNA sequence has been determined. The gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli by using the lacZ promoter, and its gene product was overproduced (Munoz-Dorado, J., Inouye, M., and Inouye, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2702-2706). The gene product thus overproduced in E. coli was purified to homogeneity by a simple four-step procedure and crystallized. Gel filtration of the purified protein revealed that the protein forms a complex of an apparent molecular weight of 50,000, indicating that it exists as a trimer in the cell. It was found that the purified protein can bind not only GTP, but also equally well the other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates with no specificity for either the base or the sugar. Nucleoside monophosphates, Pi, and pyrophosphate do not bind to the protein. In the presence of Mg2+, the protein hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates to diphosphates and Pi. However, in the presence of EDTA, most of the phosphate remains bound to the protein. The phosphorylated protein can then transfer the phosphate group to a nucleoside diphosphate to form the corresponding nucleoside triphosphate in the presence of Mg2+. The reaction is reversible, and it is considered to occur by a two-step ping-pong mechanism. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the M. xanthus 16-kDa GTP-binding protein is a nucleoside diphosphate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1528433521,"Guaiacol peroxidase from spinach catalyzes the oxidation of p-aminophenol to produce the aminophenoxy radical as the primary product which is converted further into a stable oxidation product with an absorption peak at 470 nm. The p-aminophenol radicals oxidize ascorbate (AsA) to produce monodehydroascorbate radicals. Kinetic analysis indicates that p-aminophenol radicals also oxidize monodehydroascorbate to dehydroascorbate. Incubation of AsA peroxidase from tea leaves and hydrogen peroxide with p-aminophenol, p-cresol, hydroxyurea, or hydroxylamine results in the inactivation of the enzyme. No inactivation of the enzyme was found upon incubation of the enzyme with these compounds either in the absence of hydrogen peroxide or with the stable oxidized products of these compounds. The enzyme was protected from inactivation by the inclusion of AsA in the incubation mixture. The radicals of p-aminophenol and hydroxyurea were produced by AsA peroxidase as detected by their ESR signals. These signals disappeared upon the addition of AsA, and the signal characteristic of monodehydroascorbate was found. Thus, AsA peroxidase is inactivated by the radicals of p-aminophenol, p-cresol, hydroxyurea, and hydroxylamine which are produced by the peroxidase reaction, and it is protected from inactivation by AsA via the scavenging of the radicals. Thus, these compounds are the suicide inhibitors for AsA peroxidase. Isozyme II of AsA peroxidase, which is localized in chloroplasts, is more sensitive to these compounds than isozyme I. In contrast to AsA peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase was not affected by these various compounds, even though each was oxidized by it and the corresponding radicals were produced."

The lambda P initiator protein binds to both lambda O and the host-coded dnaB helicase, giving rise to an ori lambda DNA.lambda O.lambda P.dnaB structure. The dnaK and dnaJ heat shock proteins have been shown capable of dissociating this complex. The thus freed dnaB helicase unwinds the duplex DNA template at the replication fork. In this report, through cross-linking, size chromatography, and protein affinity chromatography, we document some of the protein-protein interactions occurring at ori lambda.

https://openalex.org/W1584566365,"We have recently demonstrated the presence in the rat Leydig cells of a corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor and an inhibitory action of the peptide on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-induced cAMP generation and steroidogenesis. The inhibitory action of CRF was unaffected by pertussis toxin and was completely reversed by 8-bromo-cAMP (Ulisse, S., Fabbri, A., and Dufau, M. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2156-2163). In this study, we have evaluated the participation of protein kinase C in CRF action in the Leydig cells and the level of the gonadotropin signal pathway affected by CRF. Binding of 125I-labeled ovine CRF to Leydig cell membranes was reduced by GTP and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), in a dose-dependent manner. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, like CRF, caused time-dependent inhibition of hCG-induced cAMP generation and steroidogenesis. This inhibitory action was reversed by 8-bromo-cAMP. Both CRF and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not affect 125I-hCG binding. No additive effects of CRF and the phorbol ester were observed in these studies. CRF caused a rapid translocation of protein kinase C in Leydig cells. Preincubation of cells with protein kinase C inhibitors or TPA-induced depletion of protein kinase C prevented the inhibitory actions of CRF and TPA. CRF and TPA were able to inhibit the stimulation of cAMP and testosterone production by cholera toxin and forskolin. Adenylate cyclase stimulation by Gpp(NH)p, luteinizing hormone + Gpp(NH)p, and NaF in crude membranes or by forskolin and manganese in solubilized membranes, prepared from CRF- and TPA-treated cells, was also markedly inhibited. We conclude that CRF receptors interact with a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (possibly Gp) in the Leydig cell and that the inhibitory action of CRF on Leydig cell function is exerted mainly on the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase through a direct or indirect action of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1695830319,"The post-receptor events which follow the binding of interleukin 1 (IL1) to cells are unclear. The present studies provide evidence for the activation of a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) by IL1 in the membranes of an IL1 receptor-rich strain (NOB-1) of the EL4 murine thymoma line. IL1 alpha and beta increased the binding of the GTP analogue [35S]guanosine 5'-[gamma-thiol]trisphosphate (GTP gamma S) to membranes prepared from these cells. By 1 min after addition of IL1 there was a 2-fold enhancement in binding which was dose dependent in the range 0.1-100 ng/ml. A qualitatively similar result was obtained with IL1 beta although it was 10 times less potent. Specific neutralizing antisera to IL1 alpha and IL1 beta abolished the response. Experiments in which the concentration of [35S]GTP gamma S was varied revealed that IL1 increased the affinity of the binding sites for [35S]GTP gamma S and not their number. IL1 alpha was shown to stimulate GTPase activity in the membranes, the time and concentration dependence of this was similar to that observed for increased [35S]GTP gamma S binding. Half-maximal enhancement of [35S]GTP gamma S binding by IL1 alpha, measured after 4 min, occurred at 5% IL1 receptor occupancy. Maximal stimulation was achieved when 30% of receptors were occupied. Experiments with pertussis and cholera toxins revealed that pretreating membranes with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) inhibited by 50% the IL1-induced [35S]GTP gamma S binding and [gamma-32P]GTP hydrolysis. Cholera toxin (100 ng/ml) was without effect. However, both pertussis and cholera toxins at concentrations of 100 ng/ml inhibited IL1-induced IL2 secretion in EL4 NOB-1 cells. These results show that the IL1 receptor of a responsive thymoma line activates, and may be coupled to, a G protein(s). This is a possible mechanism of IL1 signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1601458675,"The production and characterization of an antibody to rat liver CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is described. This antibody quantitatively precipitated cytidylyltransferase from both rat liver and HeLa cell cytosol. Following affinity purification, the antibody was used to demonstrate, for the first time, the phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase in vivo. Following the immunoprecipitation of cytidylyltransferase from HeLa cells, acid hydrolysis, and thin layer electrophoresis of the amino acids, only [32P]phosphoserine was detected. The phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase in HeLa cells was examined following treatment with phorbol ester for 1 h. In agreement with previous studies, the incorporation of [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine via the CDP-choline pathway was stimulated 5-fold in cultures of HeLa cells following treatment with phorbol ester for 1 h. However, no appreciable translocation of cytidylyltransferase was detected, despite the utilization of two different methods of cell lysis. Furthermore, the inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors and chelators of divalent cations in the homogenization buffers had no effect on the observed distribution or activity of the enzyme. Immunoprecipitated cytidylyltransferase was phosphorylated to the same extent, and on serine residues only, in both control and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated cells. Measurement of the pool sizes of the aqueous intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway, following TPA treatment, revealed a modest decrease in the phosphocholine pool only, consistent with an activation of cytidylyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1512627224,"The activation in vitro of dioxin and glucocorticoid receptors from a non-DNA binding to a DNA binding state was characterized. Ligand-free dioxin and glucocorticoid receptors were partially co-purified from rat liver cytosol, and both receptors sedimented at 9 S following labeling with the respective ligand. The 9 S forms of the dioxin and glucocorticoid receptors have previously been shown to represent heteromeric complexes containing the Mr approximately equal to 90,000 heat shock protein. The 9 S ligand-free or ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor was converted to the monomeric 4-5 S form upon exposure to 0.4 M NaCl even in the presence of the stabilizing agent molybdate. Under identical conditions, the 9 S ligand-free and ligand-bound dioxin receptor forms remained essentially intact. However, in the absence of molybdate, the dioxin receptor could be converted to a 4-5 S form upon exposure to high concentrations of salt. These results indicate that the glucocorticoid receptor readily dissociates from the 9 S to the 4-5 S form even in the absence of hormone, whereas both the ligand-free and ligand-occupied 9 S dioxin receptor forms represent more stable species. Gel mobility shift experiments revealed that the 4-5 S glucocorticoid receptor interacted with a glucocorticoid response element both in the absence and presence of ligand. On the other hand, occupation of the dioxin receptor by ligand greatly enhanced the ability of the receptor to be activated to a form that binds to its target enhancer element. Once dissociated, the monomeric form of the dioxin receptor was also able to interact with its DNA target sequences even in the absence of ligand. Thus, ligand binding efficiently facilitates subunit dissociation of the dioxin receptor but is not a prerequisite for DNA binding per se. Given the apparent stability of its non-DNA binding 9 S form, the dioxin receptor system might be a useful model for the investigation of the mechanism of activation of soluble receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1837458378,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two forms of cytochrome c, iso-1-cytochrome c and iso-2-cytochrome c, encoded by the genes CYC1 and CYC7, respectively. The amino acid sequences of these two isozymes are approximately 80% identical. Cyc3- mutants lack both holocytochromes c, because of a deficiency of cytochrome c heme lyase, the enzyme catalyzing covalent attachment of the heme group to apocytochrome c. A deficiency of heme lyase also prevents import into mitochondria. Surprisingly, apo-iso-1-cytochrome c is absent in cyc3- strains, although apo-iso-2-cytochrome c is present at approximately the same level at which holo-iso-2-cytochrome c is found in CYC3+ strains. The lack of apo-iso-1-cytochrome c is not due to a deficiency of either transcription or translation, but to rapid degradation of the protein. Apocytochromes c encoded by composite cytochrome c genes composed of the central portion of iso-2-cytochrome c flanked by amino and carboxyl regions of iso-1-cytochrome c exhibit increased stability compared with apo-iso-1-cytochrome c. A region encompassing no more than four amino acid differences between iso-1- and iso-2-cytochromes c is sufficient to partially stabilize the protein. In contrast to what is observed in vivo with the apo forms, the holo forms of the composite isocytochromes c are even less stable to thermal denaturation than iso-1-cytochrome c or iso-2-cytochrome c. Either a small region of the sequence of apo-iso-1-cytochrome c is involved in degradation of the protein, or the corresponding region in apo-iso-2-cytochrome c is preventing degradation. The differential stability of the two isocytochromes c may be part of a regulatory process that increases the proportion of iso-2-cytochrome c under certain physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1661497224,"Human rhinoviruses are the major causative agents of the common cold in humans and have been divided into major and minor groups based on receptor specificity. cDNAs encoding the light and heavy chains of a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes the major group receptor were cloned, abundantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and renatured into Fab fragments that blocked virus binding and protected HeLa cell monolayers from rhinovirus infection. Elimination of the cysteines normally bridging the heavy and light chains yielded molecules indistinguishable from wild-type Fab fragments in virus binding assays. Single-chain antibodies with covalently linked light and heavy variable domains were also expressed and showed receptor binding and cell protection activities. These recombinant antibody fragments are potentially useful in preventing or treating common colds in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1560314955,"The abilities of a series of six mutants of the human insulin receptor, an insulin receptor/v-ros hybrid (IR-ros) and the P68gag-ros transforming protein to stimulate S6 protein kinase have been assessed. Insulin receptor mutants in which either 1 or 2 tyrosine residues have been replaced with phenylalanine (YF1, YF3) have lost some or all of the capacity to mediate the activation of S6 kinase in response to insulin. None of the four mutants that contain deletions (spBam, spBamYF3, iBgl, T-t) elicit an insulin-dependent stimulation of S6 kinase. A previous study of the IRros hybrid receptor demonstrated that it was unable to cause either insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation or glucose uptake (Ellis, L., Morgan, D. O., Jong, S.-M., Wang, L.-H., Roth, R. A., and Rutter, W. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 5101-5105). In contrast, the IRros chimera appears to mediate the activation of S6 protein kinase by insulin. In further evaluating the biological activities of the IRros hybrid, we have examined its effects on a microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) kinase that is thought to be an early target in the cascade of reactions leading to increased S6 phosphorylation (Sturgill, T. W., Ray, L. B., Erickson, E., and Maller, J. L. (1988) Nature 334, 715-718). We find that the IRros receptor stimulates the MAP2 protein kinase from 3- to 6-fold in insulin-treated cells, conferring more than a 30-fold increase in the insulin sensitivity of MAP2 kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1601635299,"Calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion among embryonic chick neural retina cells is mediated by N-cadherin, a 130,000-Da integral membrane protein. We have reported that the ability of chick neural retina cells to form calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion is also correlated with the presence of an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase at the cell surface (Balsamo, J., and Lilien, J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 349-354). This enzyme transfers N-acetylgalactosaminephosphate to endogenous acceptors (Balsamo, J., Pratt, R. S., and Lilien, J. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5402-5407) and is tightly associated with these acceptors forming a complex which can be isolated from neutral detergent extracts of plasma membranes. We now report that N-cadherin is present in the complex and is an acceptor for the N-acetylgalactosaminylphosphotransferase. Antibodies prepared against N-cadherin precipitate the transferase containing complexes from neutral detergent extracts; however, when the complexes are dissociated by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate prior to immunoprecipitation, only N-cadherin is precipitated. Similarly, anti-transferase antibodies immunoprecipitate N-cadherin containing complexes prior to disruption of the complex with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Catalysis of the transferase reaction in the complex results in the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine phosphate to oligosaccharide chains on N-cadherin. Glycosylation of N-cadherin by the transferase also occurs in situ; labeling of retina cells with [32P] orthophosphate results in N-cadherin molecules containing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine linked to an oligosaccharide chain via a phosphodiester bond."
https://openalex.org/W2144774847,"Mevalonate kinase may play a key role in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis because its activity may be regulated via feedback inhibition by intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. To study the regulation of mevalonate kinase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from rat liver, and monospecific antibody against mevalonate kinase was prepared. The purified mevalonate kinase had a dimeric structure composed of identical subunits, and the Mr of the enzyme determined by gel chromatography was 86,000. Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the subunit Mr was 39,900. The pI for mevalonate kinate was 6.2. The levels of mevalonate kinase protein and enzyme activity were determined in the livers of rats treated with either cholesterol-lowering agents (cholestyramine, pravastatin, and lovastatin) or with dietary modifications. Diets containing cholestyramine alone or cholestyramine and either pravastatin or lovastatin increased mevalonate kinase activity 3-6-fold. Mevalonate kinase activity decreased approximately 50% in rats treated with diets containing either 5% cholesterol or 5% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid. Fasting did not significantly change mevalonate kinase activity. The amount of mevalonate kinase protein in the liver was quantitated using immunoblots, and the changes in the levels of kinase activity induced by either drug treatment or by cholesterol feeding were correlated with similar changes in the levels of mevalonate kinase protein. Therefore, under these experimental conditions, mevalonate kinase activity in the liver was regulated principally by changes in the rates of enzyme synthesis and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2134077839,"The electrochemistry of the enzyme, sulfide:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, also known as flavocytochrome c552 from the purple sulfur bacterium, Chromatium vinosum, has been studied using several modified electrodes. Direct electron transfer between the heme of the flavocytochrome and an electrode is observed in the presence of a redox-inactive cationic species which promotes the voltammetry of the enzyme. Quasi-reversible electron transfer was achieved using the aminoglycoside, neomycin, as a promoter at either a modified gold or polished edge-plane graphite electrode. Further evidence for direct electron transfer is provided by the catalytic response of the enzyme at the electrode in the presence of substrate. Also reported is the direct spectroelectrochemistry of flavocytochrome c552 at an optically transparent thin layer gold electrode modified with Cys-Glu-Cys in the presence of neomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1489651485,"Three polypeptides with apparent Mr = 200,000, 135,000, and 115,000, reacting with antibody to human ceruloplasmin (Cp), were consistently found in sera of normal adult and newborn subjects, patients with Wilson's disease, as well as in the oxidase-active fraction of purified human Cp, resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentrations of the three Cp polypeptides were proportional to the total Cp oxidase activity measured in whole serum. Peptide mapping revealed that the three Cp polypeptides were closely related. Cross-linking of Cp135 resulted in dimers with electrophoretic mobility similar to that of Cp200. A common shift in electrophoretic mobility following N-glycanase treatment indicated that all three polypeptides were N-glycosylated, and that the apparent differences in molecular mass could not be related to the carbohydrate moiety. Immunoprecipitates of cell lysates of [35S]cysteine labeled HepG2 cells revealed the presence of two species of newly synthesized Cp polypeptides, Mr 200,000 and 135,000, which were secreted into the media. Secretion of Cp200 by the human liver appears to be physiologic and may be the result of posttranslational modification of Cp135."
https://openalex.org/W1570817778,"Gel filtration fractions of human hepatic cytosol obtained from an autopsy liver were examined for elution of bile acid oxidoreductases. Several enzymes including 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), 3-ketosteroid reductase, and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase eluted mainly in the 30,000-40,000 Mr fractions known to contain the newly identified bile acid binder (Stolz, A., Sugiyama, Y., Kuhlenkamp, J., and Kaplowitz, N. (1984) FEBS Lett. 177, 31-35). These enzyme activities could be resolved into six peaks of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity on chromatofocusing, some of which also had oxidoreductase activity with bile acids. Using equilibrium dialysis, the major lithocholate-binding activity was found to coelute with 3 beta-HSD, completely separate from 3 alpha-HSD. Reexamination of the surgical liver specimen originally used to purify the bile acid binder confirmed these results. The peak fraction from chromatofocusing, which exhibited the bulk of binding activity with bile acids, had 3 beta-HSD activity, whereas other fractions had 3 alpha-HSD. Anti-serum to the previously purified binder identified a single 36-kDa protein in both liver specimens and exclusively in the chromatofocusing fractions containing both the binding and 3 beta-HSD activity. However, upon further purification of the binder from this fraction, 3 beta-HSD activity was separated from the binder, but the homogeneous protein retained dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity. Thus, in contrast to the rat in which the major bile acid binder is identical to 3 alpha-HSD, in human liver the bile acid binder is distinct from 3 alpha-HSD and copurifies with a different oxidoreductase that has dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity but no activity with bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1600172723,"Post-transcriptional regulation of the asialoglyco-protein receptor (ASGR) in the HepG2 cell line can be mediated by the presence of biotin in the culture medium. To determine if the induction by biotin of intracellular cGMP affects ASGR expression, HepG2 were grown in biotin-depleted medium with the cell-permeant 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP). Both cell-surface and total ASGR binding of iodinated asialoorosomucoid (125I-ASOR) was increased from 30 to 95% of control levels by the addition of increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP. The rate of ASGR-mediated endocytosis of 125I-ASOR also increased with increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP. Estimates of the steady state levels of ASGR by transblot analysis utilizing both antisera to affinity-purified ASGR and to isoform-specific antibodies prepared against synthetic peptides confirmed that the increase in 125I-ASOR binding was due to an increase in ASGR expression. Metabolic labeling of biotin-deprived HepG2 with [35S] cysteine and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of immunoprecipitants revealed an increase of radiolabeled ASGR within 30 min of the addition of 8-Br-cGMP. Induction of cGMP by atrial natriuretic factor also increased the metabolic labeling of ASGR. ASGR expression in a second hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH-7, responded in a similar fashion to the addition of 8-Br-cGMP. In contrast to 8-Br-cGMP, exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP results in a reduction of ASGR expression even in the presence of biotin-containing medium. The antagonistic roles of cGMP and cAMP suggest a balance between cyclic nucleotides is required for the maintenance of differentiated functions by the hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1516616308,"It is well accepted that the mitochondrial K+/H+ antiporter is regulated by matrix Mg2+; however, this is not the only factor controlling its activity. The precise conditions used to deplete divalent cations have profound effects on the subsequent activity of the antiporter in a KOAc assay medium. Examination of the proton fluxes during both pretreatment and subsequent assay of K+/H+ antiport reveals that differences in K+/H+ antiport activity correlate very well with differences in matrix pH. Thus, inhibition of the K+/H+ antiporter following depletion of Mg2+ appears to result from inhibition by matrix protons. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the effect of modulating matrix pH in three different ways on the activity of the K+/H+ antiporter: 1) lowering the pH of the K+ pretreatment medium to 6.7 leads to inactivation of the K+/H+ antiporter; 2) adding NH4+ to the assay medium eliminates the lag in activity induced by depleting Mg2+ in a pretreatment medium containing NH4+; 3) permitting mitochondria to respire in a tetraethylammonium(+)-containing pretreatment medium activates the K+/H+ antiporter. Each one of these procedures leads to a change in matrix pH and an effect on K+/H+ antiport which appears to require regulation of the K+/H+ antiporter by matrix protons. This finding is not only physiologically significant but also provides a useful definition of conditions required for unmasking the K+/H+ antiporter in a reproducible manner."
https://openalex.org/W1548683182,"A 3-hydroxypicolinic acid activating enzyme from etamycin producing Streptomyces griseoviridus has been purified to apparent homogeneity. Etamycin is a member of mikamycin B antibiotics, chromopeptide lactones, which contain 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-HPA) as the chromophoric group. The enzyme catalyzes both the 3-HPA-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange and the formation of 3-HPA adenylate from 3-HPA and ATP. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the enzyme is a single polypeptide chain with a Mr between 56,000 and 58,000. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was in the same range. In addition to 3-HPA, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of adenylates from picolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and 2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid. Nicotinic acid and picolinic acid when added externally to etamycin producing S. griseoviridus cultures gave rise to the formation of etamycin analogues each containing nicotinic acid or picolinic acid instead of the genuine 3-HPA. The data strongly suggest that the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the chromopeptide lactone etamycin and possibly in that of other mikamycin B antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1596071257,"We have investigated the interactions of ligand with the canine hepatic glucagon receptor. Whereas time courses for radiolabeled glucagon binding to receptor and dissociation from receptor revealed fast and slow components at both 30 and 4 degrees C, time courses of ligand dissociation revealed a third component of irreversibly cell-associated (nondissociable) ligand only at the higher temperature. Related experiments identified that (a) the initial rate of formation of nondissociable ligand was slower than that of dissociably bound hormone; (b) the fraction of ligand bound to nondissociable sites achieved a plateau during extended incubations, whereas that bound to dissociable sites was seen to rise and then slowly to fall; (c) the kinetics of formation of a nondissociable ligand was consistent with linked, sequential reactions; (d) dissociable ligand-receptor complexes formed at 4 degrees C were converted to nondissociable complexes during subsequent incubation at 30 degrees C, and (e) nondissociable sites were filled by prior incubation of cells with unlabeled ligand. Analysis of receptor-bound hormone resulting from the incubation of cells with 125I-labeled glucagon and selected concentrations of either glucagon or [[127I]iodo-Tyr10]glucagon at steady state revealed in each case four components of receptor-bound ligand: those corresponding to high and low affinity components of dissociably bound ligand and to high and low affinity components of nondissociably bound ligand. Implications of these findings are considered in terms of mechanisms for the formation of irreversibly bound hormone and for the distribution of hormone among the various components of hepatic glucagon-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1529110653,"The effects of insulin on the subcellular distribution of the heavy chain of clathrin and on the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mannose 6-phosphate receptor were investigated in isolated rat adipocytes. Plasma membranes, intracellular membranes, and cytosol were separated by differential centrifugation, and the concentration of clathrin and receptor in each fraction was quantified by sequential immunoblotting with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against these proteins. A 3-fold increase in the amount of clathrin heavy chain associated with isolated plasma membranes was found after treatment of cells with low concentrations of insulin. This effect was complete within 2 min of stimulation at 37 degrees C and was abolished at 5-10 degrees C. The insulin-mediated increase in the cell surface concentration of receptors for IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate displayed a similar time course and temperature dependence. A concomitant decrease in the concentration of IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptors in intracellular membranes was observed. In contrast, no significant changes in the concentration of clathrin in this fraction could be detected. Instead, a marked decrease in the level of unassembled cytosolic clathrin was observed in insulin-treated cells compared with controls. These results suggest that insulin induces an increase in the assembly of cytosolic clathrin onto the plasma membrane in conjunction with its ability to increase the concentration of receptors on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1492337895,"Mammary-derived growth factor 1 (MDGF1, with a molecular mass of 62 kDa and pI of 4.8) has been purified from human milk (Bano, M., Salomon, D. S., and Kidwell, W. R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5745-5752). N-terminal sequence of 18 amino acids showed no homology to any known growth promoting peptides. The present study was carried out to evaluate the biological effects of and binding sites for MDGF1 on normal human and breast cancer cell lines. At a concentration of 10-25 ng/ml the factor stimulated the growth of estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by 50% and also stimulated the synthesis of collagen IV by 40%. It did not have any effect on ZR75-1, T47-D, and MDA-MB 231 cells. The factor showed a biphasic effect on the estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB 468 cells at concentrations above 5 ng/ml. The growth of normal human mammary epithelial cells (184 strain) was enhanced by 35%, whereas immortalized non-tumorigenic 184A1N4 human mammary epithelial cells were stimulated by about 60-70%. However, transformation of these cells by SV40-T, v-Ha-ras, or v-mos desensitized them to MDGF1. Iodinated MDGF1 binds to moderate affinity sites on the responsive MCF-7, MDA-MB 468, and 184A1N4 cell lines (KD = 6 x 10(-9) M). Cross-linking of 125I-MDGF1 to binding sites revealed the presence of a major band of molecular mass of approximately 180-200 kDa in MCF-7 and MDA-MB 468 cell lines. Labeling of this band was inhibited by excess unlabeled MDGF1. These data suggest that human mammary epithelial cell lines possess receptors for MDGF1."

Antisera to the alpha and beta subunits of wheat seedling PFP cross-reacted with the corresponding alpha and beta subunits of PFP preparations from wheat germ, potato tubers, and lettuce leaves. With the mung bean PFP, both antisera reacted with a protein band of Mr 60,000. A protein band corresponding to the Mr 67,000 alpha subunit was not detected in the mung bean PFP preparation. Tryptic digestion of wheat seedling and potato tuber PFPs resulted in the preferential cleavage of the alpha subunit. The trypsinized PFP retained most of its Fru-2,6-P2-stimulated activity but not its basal activity. The proteolyzed enzyme also exhibited a 2-fold increase in Ka for Fru-2,6-P2. Studies with the mung bean enzyme revealed that the anti-alpha immunoreactive component was more sensitive to trypsinization than the anti-beta immunoreactive component of the Mr 60,000 protein band. Thus, the Mr 60,000 protein band of the mung bean PFP appears to be heterogeneous and contains both alpha and beta-like proteins. The above observations indicate that the alpha and beta subunits of PFP are two distinct polypeptides and that alpha acts as a regulatory protein in regulating both the catalytic activity and the Fru-2,6-P2-binding affinity of the beta subunit."

A similar procedure for the substrates hydroquinone, 3-aminophenol, 3-chlorophenol, and 3-methylphenol yielded spectra that are also consistent with the known characteristics of their Intermediate II species. These spectral results give further support to the proposed biradical mechanism (Anderson, R.F., Patel, K. B., and Stratford, M. R. L. (1987) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1575892805,"Binding of carbamoyl phosphate to Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase and its relation to turnover have been examined as a function of pH under steady-state conditions. The pH profile of the dissociation constant of carbamoyl phosphate (Kiacp) shows that the affinity of the substrate increases as pH decreases. Two ionizing groups are involved in carbamoyl phosphate binding. Protonation of an enzymic group with pKa 9.6 results in productive binding of the substrate with a moderate affinity of Kiacp approximately 30 microM. Protonation of a second group further enhances binding by roughly another order of magnitude. This ionization occurs with a pKa that shifts from less than 6 in the free enzyme to 7.3 in the binary complex. However, tighter binding of carbamoyl phosphate due to this ionization does not contribute to catalysis. The turnover rate (kcat) of the enzyme diminishes in the acidic pH range and is governed by an ionization with a pKa of 7.2. Both the catalytic pKa of 7.2 and the productive binding pKa of 9.6 appear in the pH profile of kcat/KMcp. Together with earlier kinetic results (Kuo, L. C., Herzberg, W., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 4754-4761), these data suggest that the step which modulates kcat may occur prior to the binding of the second substrate L-ornithine."
https://openalex.org/W2103804338,"The activation of protein synthesis by mitogens in quiescent (G0) mammalian cells is obligatory for progression from G0 through G1 to DNA synthesis in S phase. When the activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter which occurs in mitogen-stimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts or murine fibroblasts is completely blocked by dimethylamiloride, there is little or no effect on the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 or the activation of protein synthesis assayed by [35S]methionine incorporation. Furthermore, the accumulation of the protein product of the activated c-myc gene is unaffected by dimethylamiloride in 3T3 fibroblasts. The data show that there is no requirement for activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter for the activation of S6 phosphorylation or protein synthesis by mitogens but do not preclude the possibility that activation of the antiporter is necessary for some other response(s) obligatory for DNA synthesis. These data are contrasted with previous reports for Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts that the increase in intracellular pH which results from activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter in bicarbonate-free media is necessary for S6 phosphorylation, protein synthesis, and hence, for subsequent DNA synthesis (Pouyssegur, J., Chambard, J.
