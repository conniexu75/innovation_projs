The vascular action of insulin to stimulate endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO), leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow is an important component of insulin-stimulated whole body glucose utilization. Therefore, we hypothesized that adiponectin may also stimulate production of NO in endothelium. Bovine aortic endothelial cells in primary culture loaded with the NO-specific fluorescent dye 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA) were treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (a calcium-releasing agonist) or adiponectin (10 μg/ml bacterially produced full-length adiponectin). LPA treatment increased production of NO by ∼4-fold. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment significantly increased production of NO by ∼3-fold. Preincubation of cells with wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) blocked only adiponectin- but not LPA-mediated production of NO. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we observed that either adiponectin or insulin treatment (but not LPA treatment) caused phosphorylation of both Akt at Ser473 and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at Ser1179 that was inhibitable by wortmannin. We next transfected bovine aortic endothelial cells with dominant-inhibitory mutants of Akt (Akt-AAA) or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (AMPKK45R). Neither mutant affected production of NO in response to LPA treatment. Importantly, only AMPKK45R, but not Akt-AAA, caused a significant partial inhibition of NO production in response to adiponectin. Moreover, AMPK-K45R inhibited phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 in response to adiponectin but not in response to insulin. We conclude that adiponectin has novel vascular actions to directly stimulate production of NO in endothelial cells using phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways involving phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 by AMPK. Thus, the effects of adiponectin to augment metabolic actions of insulin in vivo may be due, in part, to vasodilator actions of adiponectin."

We investigated the role that the hexosamine pathway, and especially altered nuclear O-Glc-NAcylation, plays in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Incubating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in high glucose (25 mm) resulted in prolonged calcium transients when compared with myocytes incubated in normal glucose (5.5 mm), which is consistent with delayed myocardial relaxation. High glucose-treated myocytes also exhibited reduced sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mRNA and protein expression, decreased SERCA2a promoter activity, and increased O-GlcNAcylation of nuclear proteins compared with myocytes treated with normal glucose. Exposure of myocytes to 8 mm glucosamine or an adenovirus expressing O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) resulted in prolonged calcium transient decays and significantly reduced SERCA2a protein levels, whereas treatment with an adenovirus encoding O-GlcNAcase (GCA) resulted in improved calcium transients and SERCA2a protein levels in myocytes exposed to high glucose. Effects of elevated glucose or altered O-GlcNAcylation were also observed on essential transcription factors involved in cardiomyocyte function. High glucose-treated myocytes (with or without OGT adenovirus) exhibited increased levels of O-GlcNAcylated specificity protein 1 compared with control myocytes, whereas infecting high glucose-treated myocytes with GCA adenovirus reduced the degree of specificity protein 1 Glc-NAcylation. Treatment of myocytes with 25 mm glucose, 8 mm glucosamine, or OGT adenovirus also significantly reduced levels of myocytes enhancer factor-2A protein compared with control myocytes, whereas infection with GCA adenovirus resulted in improved myocytes enhancer factor-2 expression. Our results suggest that the hexosamine pathway, and O-GlcNAcylation in particular, is important in impaired cardiac myocyte function and the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

The leading cause of mortality among diabetic patients in the United States is heart disease. Despite the numerous effects diabetes exerts on the cardiovascular system, there is substantial evidence indicating that a diabetes-specific cardiomyopathy occurs in the absence of coronary artery disease or hypertension (1Ahmed S.S. Jaferi G.A. Narang R.M. Regan T.J. Am. Heart J. 1975; 89: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Galderisi M. Anderson K.M. Wilson P.W. Levy D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1991; 68: 85-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by impaired cardiac contractility and poor myocardial performance without an attendant vascular or valvular disease and can lead to congestive heart failure. Studies in diabetic human patients and animal models have demonstrated the early development of diastolic dysfunction prior to the alteration of systolic function (3Fein F.S. Kornstein L.B.

Cardiol. 1988; 12: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Eventually, however, nearly all aspects of cardiac contractility appear to become impaired (5Trost S.U. Belke D.D. Bluhm W.F.

Increasing evidence indicates that abnormalities in cardiac Ca2+ handling may be an important contributor to decreased contractile function in the diabetic heart. Ventricular contraction and relaxation are controlled largely by Ca2+ release from and uptake into the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum; SERCA2a, SR Ca2+ ATPase; Sp1, specificity protein 1; MEF, myocytes enhancer factor; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenyl carbamate; NG, normal (5.5 mm) glucose; HG, high (25 mm) glucose; AM, acetoxymethyl; OGT, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (O-GlcNAc-transferase); GCA, O-GlcNAcase; MEF, myocytes enhancer factor; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; STZ, streptozocin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. (7Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). All aspects of SR function in the diabetic heart are depressed as documented by decreased SR Ca2+ uptake, reduced SR Ca2+ content, and impaired SR Ca2+ release (8Penpargkul S. Fein F. Sonnenblick E.H. Scheuer J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1981; 13: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Bouchard R.A. Bose D. Am. J.

Impaired SR function appears to result from reduced activity and expression of the SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) (5Trost S.U. Belke D.D. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Ganguly P.K. Pierce G.N. Dhalla K.S. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E528-E535PubMed Google Scholar), which is responsible for sequestering Ca2+ and inducing diastolic relaxation. The underlying mechanisms leading to abnormal SR function and calcium flux in the diabetic heart are poorly understood. Diabetic hyperglycemia results in a number of pathophysiological changes in the vascular system, but investigations of its role in diabetic cardiomyopathy are limited. Recently, studies exposing cardiac myocytes to elevated extracellular glucose resulted in impaired cardiomyocytes contractility and calcium flux (12Ren J. Gintant G.A. Miller R.E. Davidoff A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2876-H2883PubMed Google Scholar) and increased [Ca2+] i (13Gupta R.K. Wittenberg B.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2547-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The observation that the diastolic dysfunction observed in myocytes exposed to elevated extracellular glucose could be duplicated by incubation of cardiomyocytes with glucosamine, a precursor to cellular N- and O-linked glycosylation, suggests that the mechanism may involve increased flux of glucose into the hexosamine pathway (12Ren J. Gintant G.A. Miller R.E. Davidoff A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2876-H2883PubMed Google Scholar). Increased hexosamine flux is known to lead to insulin resistance in many tissues (14Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies (15Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we investigated specifically whether the impaired myocardial calcium cycling observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy is linked to O-GlcNAcylation in a hyperglycemia-dependent manner. Using cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate that elevated extracellular glucose impairs calcium cycling, that these changes appear specifically via increased cellular O-GlcNAcylation, and that the detrimental effect of increased cellular O-GlcNAcylation can be mitigated against through the use of adenovirally transfected O-GlcNAcase protein. Materials—Antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-Sp1 (07–124; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-MEF-2 (predominantly MEF-2a, sc-313; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-O-GlcNAc monoclonal (CTD 110.6; provided as a gift by Dr. Gerald Hart, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (17Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-mouse IgM (Sigma). Indo-1/AM and Pluronic were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Pre-cast Tris/glycine SDS gels and all electrophoresis supplies were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). O-(2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenyl carbamate (PUGNAc) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Cardiomyocyte Isolation and Culture—Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared as described previously (18Hartong R. Villarreal F.J. Giordano F. Hilal-Dandan R. McDonough P.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2467-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated culture dishes or laminin-coated glass chamber slides. Plating medium consisted of 4.25:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:M199, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone, and 5.5 mm d-glucose. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates for 24 h before changing to basic experimental culture medium (4.5:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:M199, 2% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone, and 100 μm insulin) and supplemented with glucose at either physiological (5.5 mm; normal glucose) or elevated (25 mm; high glucose) concentrations. For some experiments, medium was supplemented with 8 mm glucosamine, 40 μm aminoguanidine, 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin, 50 μm PUGNAc or an osmotic control (20 mm mannitol). In cases where cells were plated at exceptionally high density (5 × 106 per 100-mm plate), the culture medium was changed daily until the cells were harvested. Construction of Adenoviral Vectors—The rat cDNA corresponding to the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase gene (O-GlcNAc-transferase; OGT), which encodes the enzyme responsible for the O-linkage of single N-acetylglucosamine molecules to serine/threonine residues (19Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the human cDNA encoding the O-GlcNAcase gene (GCA), the enzyme responsible for removing O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues (20Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), were both kindly provided by G. Hart. Each cDNA was inserted into the E1 region of an adenoviral vector construct using methods described previously (21He H. Meyer M. Martin J.L. McDonough P.M. Ho P. Lou X. Lew W.Y. Hilal-Dandan R. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Replication-deficient adenovirus particles containing the target gene or empty vector (SR–) were generated by in vivo recombination in 293 cells, and single plaques were isolated and propagated to achieve high titer. Adenoviral particles were CsCl-purified and quantified by plaque titer assay. Myocytes were infected with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 25 for all viruses. Measurement of [Ca2 + ]i Transients—Indo-1 facilitated measurement of Ca2+ transients has been described previously (22He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated (5 × 104) onto glass chamber slides and incubated for 48–72 h in experimental medium as above. Cells were rinsed twice with appropriate serum-free culture medium (5.5 or 25 mm glucose) and then incubated with the same medium containing 10 μm Indo-1/AM, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator. Cells were rinsed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in appropriate serum-free culture medium containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 prior to making fluorescence measurements to allow for de-esterification of the Indo-1/AM. Myocytes were stimulated to contract (0.3 Hz) using platinum electrodes, and Indo-1 ratios (405/484 nm) were collected at 20 Hz at room temperature using methods and equipment as described previously (23McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diastolic and systolic Ca2+ levels were defined as the resting ratio and maximal ratio per cycle, respectively. Transients were measured from at least 18 cells per slide per treatment. For data analysis, transients were aligned and averaged using the initial upstroke of each transient as a reference point and then normalized using the diastolic and systolic ratios as references. Western Immunoblotting—To determine SERCA2a protein levels, myocytes (1 × 106) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then extracted with 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, and cellular debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by Bio-Rad protein reagent. 30 μg of protein diluted in extraction buffer and 4× Laemmli sample buffer were loaded without boiling onto pre-cast 4–20% Tris/glycine gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nylon membranes using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot apparatus and blocked overnight at 4 °C. Blots were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal SERCA2a antibody (18Hartong R. Villarreal F.J. Giordano F. Hilal-Dandan R. McDonough P.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2467-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 1-h incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were visualized by reacting with chemiluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film. Protein bands were quantified from scanned images using Scion imaging software (Scion, Frederick, MD). To examine cellular O-GlcNAcylation and MEF-2a levels, nuclear extracts were prepared from neonatal cardiomyocytes (2 × 106) using modifications of the procedures described by Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Samples of each extract (25–50 μg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on precast 4–20% Tris/glycine gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nylon membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight, exposed to the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody 110.6 (17Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (1:10,000) overnight at 4 °C, and then exposed for 1 h to 1:5,000 goat anti-mouse IgM-HRP. Alternatively, membranes were exposed to anti-MEF-2 (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h exposure to 1:10,000 goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP. Visualization and quantification was as described above. Sp1 Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were made from neonatal cardiomyocytes (5 × 106) using the procedures of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Protein (50 μ g) was diluted to 0.5 ml with binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 4 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of 1× sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min, separated on 7.5% Tris/glycine gels, and transferred to nylon membranes. Blots were incubated for 1 h with the same antibody used to immunoprecipitate Sp1 (1:1000 dilution) followed by exposure to a goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution). Visualization and quantification were as described above. Northern Blot Analysis—Cellular RNA was extracted from cultured myocytes using the guanidine thiocyanate method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) as described previously (5Trost S.U. Belke D.D. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. A 1.6-kb fragment of the 5′ end of a cDNA of the rat SERCA2a gene was used to generate a 32P-labeled probe (Multiprime DNA labeling system; Amersham Biosciences). A probe for 28s ribosomal RNA was used as a loading control. Bands were visualized on radiographic film, and the resulting images scanned and quantified using Scion imaging software. Transfections and SERCA2a Promoter Luciferase Assays—DNA transfection of neonatal cardiomyocytes was performed using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Cells (0.5 × 106) were transfected overnight in appropriate culture medium (either NG- or HG-containing medium) with 50 ng of either a 0.6-kb fragment of the rat SERCA2a promoter (corresponding to the 600 bases immediately upstream of the transcriptional start codon) (27Rohrer D.K. Hartong R. Dillmann W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8638-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a control plasmid (pGL3; Promega) and 3 μg of fill plasmid (pBS; Stratagene) and then washed with PBS and changed into fresh culture medium. Cells to be treated with adeno-OGT or adeno-GCA were first infected with an m.o.i. of 25 followed 24 h later by transfection. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h, then washed with PBS, and incubated for 10 min with gentle agitation at room temperature in 200 μl of harvest buffer (50 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1.3 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was measured using 100 μl of extract in a luminometer. Animals and Determination of Cardiac Sugar Nucleotides—Male CB6F1 mice weighing 20–25 g (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were made diabetic using methods described previously (5Trost S.U. Belke D.D. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Swanson E. Dillmann W.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, diabetes was induced with a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (150 mg/kg in citrate saline, pH 4.5) to animals fasted overnight (16 h). Diabetic animals were sacrificed 3 weeks following injection. To determine the degree of diabetes, blood was drawn via direct cardiac puncture in CO2-euthanized animals, and plasma glucose concentration was determined using the Sigma glucose kit (510-A). Sugar nucleotides were extracted from fresh ventricles and quantified by HPLC as described by Weckbecker and Keppler (28Weckbecker G. Keppler D.O. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hearts were homogenized in 3 volumes of ice-cold 0.3 m HClO4, and debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Two volumes of 1:4 trioctylamine:1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (Freon) were added to the supernatant, followed by vortexing for 30 s and centrifuging at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a fresh tube and frozen at –80 °C until assayed. Samples were diluted in 0.5 ml H2O and desalted on a Mono-Q column (flow rate 1 ml/min). The combined UDP-GlcNAc/GalNAc fraction was collected as a peak at 23 min, and the sample was lyophilized overnight. Dried samples were subsequently dissolved in borate solution (0.22 m boric acid, 0.09 m disodium tetraborate, and 1.2 m glycerol, pH 6.85) and separated into distinct UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc peaks on a Partisil SAX-10 column. Calibration of the peaks was performed by processing known amounts of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc using the same methods as above and comparing total area under the curve for the experimental versus control peaks for each fraction. Data Collection and Statistical Analysis—Experimental treatments were evaluated on myocyte cultures from at least three different isolations to control for variation among cultures. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (SigmaStat, Chicago, IL). Post-hoc multiple comparisons for calcium transients were made using a Student-Newman-Keuls test. Calcium Transients—To determine whether elevated extracellular glucose and increased O-GlcNAcylation would exert an effect on intracellular calcium flux, Indo-1 calcium transients were determined in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Because the exact Ca2+ binding dynamics of Indo-1 are uncertain, and given that Indo-1 has the potential to be compartmentalized intracellularly, we present data as the ratio of Indo-1 fluorescence observed at 405 and 485 nm, rather than as a calculated intracellular calcium concentration. To simplify comparisons, we also normalized transients to the diastolic (basal) and systolic (maximal) ratios. Fig. 1, A and C illustrates typical traces from these experiments. Treatment of myocytes with 5.5 or 25 mm glucose resulted in similar kinetics for achieving peak Indo-1 ratios during systole, but the diastolic decay phase was significantly prolonged in myocytes exposed to high glucose. The time to achieve a 50% decrease in the calcium transient (t ½) in normal and high glucose-treated myocytes was 914 ± 31 and 1149 ± 24 ms, respectively, and represents a 26% slower t ½ in the latter group (p < 0.01; see Fig. 1B). Exposing myocytes to treatments designed to increase nucleocytoplasmic GlcNAcylation further prolonged the t ½ and suggested a trend, albeit not significantly beyond high glucose treatment, toward slower systolic kinetics. Treatment of myocytes with 5.5 mm glucose supplemented with either 8 mm glucosamine or 50 μm PUGNAc increased t ½ to 1320 ± 61 and 1310 ± 85 ms, respectively (Fig. 1B), which corresponds to a 43% increase in diastolic calcium decay for both treatments relative to controls (p < 0.01). Infection of myocytes with adeno-SR (control virus), adeno-GCA, or adeno-OGT had no significant effect on normal glucose-treated myocytes (data not shown), but adeno-OGT infected cells exposed to 25 mm glucose exhibited prolonged t ½ (1213 ± 86) that was similar to treatment with glucosamine (Fig. 1, C and D). Infection of high glucose-treated myocytes with adeno-GCA resulted in a reduced t ½ that was similar to controls (Fig. 1D). SERCA2a mRNA, Protein Expression, and Promoter Activity—Northern blot analysis of mRNA extracted from myocytes demonstrated a substantial decrease in SERCA2a mRNA with exposure to 25 mm glucose compared with normal glucose-treated cells (–37 ± 6%; p < 0.05; see Fig. 2A). The decrease in SERCA2a mRNA with high glucose treatment paralleled a similar decrease in SERCA2a protein (–28 ± 4%; p < 0.01; see Fig. 2B). To examine the role of specific glycosylation pathways, myocytes were incubated in 40 μm aminoguanidine (an inhibitor of non-enzymatic glycosylation), 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation) (29Duksin D.

Cells exposed to both 5.5 mm glucose and 8 mm glucosamine exhibited a significant decrease (–25 ± 3%; p < 0.01) in SERCA2a protein compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, SERCA2a protein levels in myocytes exposed to both 25 mm glucose and glucosamine were unchanged compared with myocytes exposed only to 5.5 mm glucose. This effect was observed reproducibly, but we cannot explain it satisfactorily. Neither aminoguanidine nor tunicamycin appeared to influence SERCA2a protein levels regardless of glucose concentration (Fig. 2B), nor did we observe any osmotic effect when cells were treated with 5.5 mm glucose and a cell-impermeable osmotic carrier (20 mm mannitol) (data not shown). To examine specifically the effect of increased O-GlcNAcylation on SERCA2a protein expression, we infected myocytes with adenovirus encoding either OGT or GCA at an m.o.i. of 25. Treatment of myocytes with high glucose and adeno-OGT resulted in a 47 ± 9% decrease in SERCA2a protein expression compared with control cells infected with an empty adenovirus (SR–; see Fig. 2C), Importantly, infection of high glucose-exposed myocytes with adeno-GCA resulted in remarkably improved SERCA2a protein levels (Fig. 2C). The reduction in SERCA2a mRNA and protein expression observed following treatment of myocytes with high glucose prompted us to examine whether these effects were being exerted, at least in part, by interactions with the SERCA2a gene promoter. Cells were transfected with a 0.6-kb fragment of the rat SERCA2a promoter inserted into the luciferase vector, pGL3 (Promega). Luciferase assays indicated that myocytes exposed to either 25 mm glucose or 5.5 mm glucose/8 mm glucosamine exhibited a significant reduction in SERCA2a promoter activity (28 and 33%, respectively; p < 0.01) compared with normal glucose controls (Fig. 3). Overexpression of OGT had no effect on SERCA2a promoter activity in control cells (data not shown), but we measured considerably reduced promoter activity in high glucose-treated cells infected with adeno-OGT (31%; p < 0.01; see Fig. 3). Exposing myocytes to adeno-GCA and high glucose resulted in improved SERCA2a promoter activity, although activity did not return to control levels. Infection of myocytes with control virus had no effect on SERCA2a promoter activity relative to uninfected controls (data not shown). Effects of Nuclear O-GlcNAcylation—The effects of 25 mm glucose and adeno-OGT treatment on myocytes suggested that increased O-GlcNAcylation was affecting transcriptional activity in the cell. Because numerous transcription factors interact with the SERCA2a promoter and other elements of myocardial Ca2+ cycling), we examined whether the overall level of O-GlcNAcylation was altered in nuclear extracts from cardiomyocytes. The monoclonal antibody 110.6 recognizes the O-linkage of a single N-acetylglucosamine molecule to serine/threonine residues (17Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and thus provides a useful tool for examining the GlcNAcylation status of nuclear proteins. Our results revealed that overall levels of nuclear O-GlcNAcylation were substantially increased in myocytes exposed to 25 mm glucose, 5.5 mm glucose supplemented with either 8 mm glucosamine or 50 μm PUGNAc, or 25 mm glucose and infected with adeno-OGT (Fig. 4). Infection of high glucose-treated cells with adeno-GCA resulted in a significant reduction in overall cellular O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 4). No such changes in O-GlcNAcylation were observed when myocytes were incubated with control virus (data not shown).

However, its possible role in mediating or influencing the adrenergic control of lipolysis in adipocytes remains uncertain. In this study, we utilized the murine cultured preadipocyte line 3T3-L1 to examine this question. Treatment of adipocytes with isoproterenol or forskolin promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK at a critical activating Thr-172 residue in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This correlated well with a stimulation of the activity of AMPK, as measured in the immune complex. Analogs of cAMP mimicked the effect of isoproterenol and forskolin on AMPK phosphorylation. Treatment of adipocytes with insulin reduced both basal and forskolin-induced AMPK phosphorylation via a pathway dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. Overexpression of a dominant-inhibitory mutant of AMPK blocked isoproterenol-induced lipolysis by ∼50%. These data indicate that there exists a novel pathway by which cAMP can lead to the activation of AMPK, and in adipocytes, this is required for maximal activation of lipolysis.

These data indicate that there exists a novel pathway by which cAMP can lead to the activation of AMPK, and in adipocytes, this is required for maximal activation of lipolysis. One of the challenges that all eukaryotic cells face is adapting to periods of nutritional or oxygen deprivation. The strategies utilized to combat such stresses have been remarkably well conserved over long evolutionary periods, and one of the most critical adaptive pathways centers around the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazile-4-caboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside; 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate·sodium; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKA, protein kinase A; Sp-cAMPs, Sp-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylamine salt. AMPK is widely expressed and consists of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. It can be activated by phosphorylation at Thr-172 of the catalytic subunit by AMPK kinase, a protein that has so far eluded molecular identification. In addition, the allosteric binding of AMP to AMPK enhances both its activity as well the stability of its phosphorylated state (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). AMPK was initially described as an activity that phosphorylates and inactivates HMG-CoA reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby decreasing the rates of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, respectively (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have led to the idea that AMPK acts as an intracellular energy sensor, stimulated by the increased intracellular AMP/ATP ratio when cells are stressed by conditions such as hypoxia/ischemia in the heart and excessive contraction in skeletal muscle. Activated AMPK accelerates ATP-producing pathways, such as fatty acid and glucose oxidation, while reducing ATP consumption, ultimately leading to the preservation or restoration of adequate high energy phosphates (2Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In recent years, the study of AMPK in mammalian organisms has been directed in part toward the identification of physiological processes in which the enzyme is important and the search for extracellular factors that regulate its activity. In regard to the former, much attention has centered on the role of AMPK in both the short and long term response to exercise (3Zong H. Ren J.M. Young L.H. Pypaert M. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Shulman G.I.

Perhaps more surprising has been the identification of circulating factors implicated as modulators of AMPK activity. Two adipocyte-derived hormones, leptin and adiponectin, which regulate energy homeostasis and glucose and lipid metabolism, induce the activation of AMPK. Leptin stimulates phosphorylation and activation of the α2 subunit of AMPK in skeletal muscle, and this has been invoked as a principal mediator of effects of stimulation of fatty acid oxidation (6Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). Adiponectin promotes phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in both liver and skeletal muscle, and again this has been suggested to account for the stimulatory effect of adiponectin on glucose utilization and fatty acid oxidation (7Tomas E. Tsao T.S. Saha A.K. Murrey H.E. Zhang Cc C. Itani S.I. Lodish H.F. Ruderman N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16309-16313Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 8Yamauchi T.

Med. 2002; 8: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). In addition, the antidiabetic drugs metformin and the thiazolidinediones appear to activate AMPK in liver and skeletal muscle (9Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E. Olsen G.S. Hardie D.G.

Whereas the importance of AMPK to control lipid metabolism in liver and muscle is well established, its role in regulating lipolysis in adipose tissue has remained controversial. The β-adrenergic signaling pathway represents a prime regulator of triglyceride breakdown, acting via the accumulation of cAMP and subsequent PKA-dependent phosphorylation of hormonesensitive lipase (HSL). The activity of HSL, the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglyceride to diglyceride and monoglyceride, is regulated by both phosphorylation and translocation to the lipid droplet (13Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates HSL at Ser-563, Ser-659, and Ser-660, although the first has long been thought responsible for HSL activation. In 1989, Garton et al. (15Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) reported that AMPK phosphorylates HSL at Ser-565 in vitro without any direct effect on HSL activity, but this abolished the further phosphorylation of HSL by PKA at Ser-563. AICAR, a cell-permeable adenosine analog that can be phosphorylated to form 5-aminoimidizale-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-5′-monophosphate, stimulates AMPK activity and glucose uptake in both muscle and adipose tissues (16Bergeron R.

Gould G.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Preincubation of isolated rat adipocytes with AICAR led to a reduced response of these cells to the lipolytic agent isoproterenol (20Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 21Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that AMPK antagonizes lipolysis in adipocytes, presumably to prevent futile cycling and depletion of ATP. However, in 1998, Anthonsen et al. (22Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, whereas mutating Ser-659 and Ser-660 abolished the enzymatic activity of HSL, replacing Ser-563 by alanine did not reduce activity of the enzyme, questioning the importance of inhibiting modification of this residue. In addition, Moule and Denton (23Moule S.K. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that isoproterenol stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and kinase activity in isolated rat epididymal fat cells, an observation seemingly at odds with an antilipolytic role for AMPK. To clarify the role of AMPK in regulating lipolysis in adipose tissue, we utilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model system, measuring AMPK phosphorylation and activity after the treatment with different activators and/or inhibitors of the components along the β-adrenergic signaling pathway. Our data support the idea that β-adrenergic agents activate AMPK via an intermediary rise in cAMP and that this serves to enhance the lipolytic rate. Materials—Sp-cAMPs and glycerokinase were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Isoproterenol and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Phospho-AMPK has been described (5Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and phospho-AKT and phospho-PKA substrate antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). SAMS peptide was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured and differentiated as described (24Garza L.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used for experiments 7–12 days after differentiation. In all experiments except for the glycerol release assays, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were preincubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 2 h before the all the treatments. Adenovirus Infection—pcDNA3-Myc-tagged wild type and dominant-inhibitory mouse AMPKα2 (AMPKα2WT and AMPKα2KD), which have been described previously (5Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), were subcloned into adeno-X viral DNA from Clontech. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was obtained by transforming Escherichia coli. The positive recombinant adenoviral DNA was linearized by PacI and transfected into HEK 293 cells to produce recombinant adenovirus. The adenoviral infection was optimized using poly-O-lysine enhancement method as described by Orlicky and Schaack (25Orlicky D.J. Schaack J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of expression for different titers of adenovirus was measured by Western blot analysis and, and the multiplicity of infection for each adenovirus was adjusted to give equivalent levels for each of the different proteins. Lipolysis was measured 4 days after adenovirus infection when protein expression reaches maximum (26Lawrence J.T. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5276-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Western Immunoblot Analysis—Tagged proteins were detected by Western immunoblots as described previously (5Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were solubilized in adipocyte lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with the protease inhibitors or in SDS buffer containing 1 × phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% SDS. All the SDS-PAGE gels used were 10% polyacrylamide. Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—In vitro immunocomplex assays were performed as described previously (5Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Briefly, the preclarified cell lysates were incubated with anti-AMPK antibody for an hour and with protein A-agarose beads for another hour. The beads were washed three times with the 3T3-L1 adipocytes lysis buffer and once with the kinase reaction buffer. SAMS peptide was resolved by Coomassie Blue staining after electrophoresis on a 4–12% NuPage precast gel (Invitrogen). The autoradiograms were quantitated by NIH Image 1.61. Glycerol Release Assay—The stimulation of adipocytes and measurement of glycerol release was performed as described previously (27Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Prior to assaying glycerol release, adipocytes were incubated in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 0.9 mm MgSO4, and 0.9 mm CaCl2) + 5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 3 h. The samples were diluted 2-fold for the amount of glycerol to be in the linear range of the standard curve. Released glycerol was expressed relative to the cellular protein content. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Significance was assessed by Student's two sample t tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Isoproterenol and Forskolin Stimulate AMPK Phosphorylation and Activation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To reevaluate the role of AMPK in the regulation of lipolysis, we first considered the phosphorylation state and activity of the enzyme after exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to agents that raise intracellular cAMP. The β-adrenergic agent isoproterenol increased phosphorylation of AMPK at the critical activating threonine residue, Thr-172, as determined by its immunoreactivity with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated state (Fig. 1). This was blocked by preincubation with the β-adrenergic agent antagonist, propranolol. Treatment of adipocytes with forskolin, which activated adenylyl cyclase independent of the receptor, also increased AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1). As a positive control, we exposed cells to AICAR, a cell-permeable AMP analog and AMPK activator, which also induced phosphorylation of AMPK to a comparable degree (Fig. 1). The effect of isoproterenol on AMPK phosphorylation was dose-dependent, characterized by a detectable increase at 1 μm and reaching the maximum level at 10 μm, where phosphorylation was 4-fold above basal (Fig. 2, a and b). Similarly, forskolin produced phosphorylation of AMPK at 1 μm and a maximal response of 7-fold at 10 μm (Fig. 2, c and d). As a positive control, all extracts were immunoblotted using an antisera that recognizes the consensus phosphorylation site for protein kinase A. Multiple reactive bands were noted after treatment with isoproterenol or forskolin, and the dose dependence roughly paralleled that for AMPK Thr-172 phosphorylation (Fig. 2)Fig. 2Isoproterenol and forskolin stimulate AMPK phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with increasing doses of either isoproterenol (a and b) for 15 min or forskolin (c and d) for 30 min. Extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blots using anti-phosphoAMPK, anti-AMPK, and anti-phosphoPKA substrate antibodies (α-PKAS). All Western blots shown are representative of four independent experiments, which were quantitated and displayed in graphical format in panels b and d. Data are expressed relative to basal phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The phosphorylation of AMPK was detectable 1 min after the addition of isoproterenol, and the level reached maximum at 15 min (Fig. 3, a and b). The effect of forskolin was slower, not achieving a maximal Thr-172 phosphorylation till 30 min after the addition of drug (Fig. 3, c and d). Phosphorylation of Thr-172 on the α subunit of AMPK generally correlates well with AMPK activity and appears to be the major site of phosphorylation by the activating upstream protein kinase AMPK kinase (28Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To assess directly the effect isoproterenol or forskolin on the activity of AMPK, an immune complex kinase assay was performed on immunoprecipitates of AMPK prepared from adipocytes treated with drugs. Isoproterenol or forskolin increased AMPK activity of 1.8- and 2.5-fold, respectively, correlating with the increased Thr-172 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Stimulation of AMPK Phosphorylation by Membrane Permeant Analogs of cAMP—Since isoproterenol and forskolin increase the activity of both adenylyl cyclase and AMPK, the most probable mechanism is that the elevated level of cAMP is indirectly responsible for the augmented phosphorylation of AMPK. To test the possibility, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with cAMP. As shown in Fig. 5, both Sp-cAMPs and 8-bromo-cAMP increased AMPK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner that correlated well with general protein phosphorylation as detected by an antisera that recognizes a consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation site. Whereas these data do not establish whether cAMP is acting via protein kinase A to induce phosphorylation of AMPK, they do provide strong support for the notion that the cyclic nucleotide represents an important mediator for β adrenergic agent dependent AMPK activation. Insulin Reduces AMPK Phosphorylation through a PI 3′-kinase-dependent Pathway—A major regulator of anabolic metabolism, insulin antagonizes adipocyte lipolysis, in part by reducing intracellular cAMP. This is believed to occur by a PI 3′-kinase and Akt/PKB-dependent phosphorylation and activation of PDE3B (13Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 29Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). If isoproterenol and forskolin stimulate AMPK by increasing the level of intracellular cAMP, one might expect that insulin would antagonize the activation of AMPK. To test this idea, we first treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with forskolin, which was followed after 20 min by exposure to insulin, and then measured AMPK phosphorylation after an additional 10 min. As expected, insulin substantially reduced the effect of forskolin on AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 6, a and b). To test whether this effect of insulin is mediated by PI 3′-kinase, cells were also treated with the PI 3′-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Preincubation of wortmannin completely abolished the effect of insulin to antagonize forskolin-induced AMPK phosphorylation, whereas preincubation with wortmannin did not change either basal or forskolin-induced phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 6, a and b). The effect of insulin on AMPK phosphorylation is likely to represent a physiological meaningful event mediated by interaction with the insulin receptor as the decreased phosphorylation of AMPK was evident after treatment with 1 nm insulin and achieved a maximum at 10 nm insulin (Fig. 6, c and d). This dose dependence correlated well with phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, a serine/threonine kinase now recognized as an important mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin (Fig. 6, c and d). AMPK Is Required for Optimal Isoproterenol-induced Lipolysis—The major physiological target of increased cAMP in the fat cell is the augmentation of lipolysis, i.e. the breakdown of triglyceride to free fatty acid and glycerol. Although the experiments described above show clearly that cAMP positively regulates AMPK, they leave open the question of the contribution of AMPK to the control of lipolysis. To resolve this issue, we infected 3T3-L1 adipocytes with recombinant adenoviruses overexpressing either wild type (AMPK α2WT) or the dominant-inhibitory mutant (AMPK α2KD) of AMPK α2 subunit. To determine that infection by each of the adenoviruses led to expression of protein at roughly equivalent levels, Western blots were performed using anti-AMPKα antibody (Fig. 7a). Note that the endogenous proteins were not detected at this exposure, indicating a significant degree of overexpression. In addition, the overexpressed proteins were visualized by immunoreactivity with the Myc tag. These data demonstrate that, under the conditions used, both control and mutant AMPK subunits were expressed at equal levels (Fig. 7a). Under basal conditions, the relatively modest rate of glycerol release, a direct measure of lipolysis, was unaffected by infection by any of the viruses. Treatment of adipocytes with isoproterenol for 40 min increased lipolytic rate ∼10-fold; this was completely blocked by co-incubation with propranolol. Infection of adipocytes with adenovirus expressing α2WT did not affect either basal or isoproterenol-induced lipolysis. Overexpression of α2KD reduced isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol release by about 50% when measured either 20 or 40 min after the addition of drug (Fig. 7b). In this study, we investigated the role of AMPK in isoproterenol-induced lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Some contradictory data have existed pertaining to this issue, with most reports indicating that AMPK antagonizes triglyceride breakdown in adipocytes. In contrast, our results show clearly that AMPK activation is required for the maximal increase in lipolysis induced by isoproterenol. Moreover, and perhaps more surprisingly, our study also revealed a novel mechanism by which a rise in cAMP levels can lead to an increase in AMPK activity. Since AMPK has been suggested to be a “metabolic switch” driving the cellular response to nutritional stress, a fair amount of attention has been focused on understanding its control of lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. However, the contribution of AMPK to the regulation of lipolysis has remained controversial, largely due the lack of reagents to specifically reduce AMPK activity, as well as the potential nonspecificity of AICAR, the drug generally employed to activate AMPK. We have overcome these problems by relying on adenoviral transduction of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes with AMPK mutants specifically recognized to either block or activate the enzyme. AMPK exists as a stable heterotrimer; overexpression of a mutant α subunit leads to displacement and degradation of the endogenous wild type subunit and the production of a catalytically inactive enzyme complex (5Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Using this reagent, we show here that the maximal stimulation of lipolysis by agents that raise cAMP depends on AMPK activity. The 50% reduction of glycerol release shown in Fig. 7 is most likely an underestimate of the contribution of AMPK to lipolysis as it is unlikely that more than 75% of the adipocytes were productively infected with recombinant adenovirus under these conditions. Generation of a constitutively active AMPK variant depended on the identification of a series of spontaneous mutations in the non-catalytic γ subunit, initially in a pig with hypertrophic skeletal muscles and then in humans with cardiac conduction disturbances (31Blair E.

Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The activating nature of the mutation has been confirmed in tissue culture lines, although the precise mechanism remains unclear (34Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S.R.

Active AMPK alone had a minimal effect on glycerol release, which probably only emphasizes the critical role of the canonical cAMP pathway through HSL (13Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J.

The traditional view that AMP, creatine phosphate, and possibly other metabolites are the sole regulators of AMPK has been challenged by the recent reports that leptin and adiponectin can stimulate the activity of the enzyme (6Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar, 8Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S.

Med. 2002; 8: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Thus far, there has been little understanding of how these hormones transmit the signal from their plasma membrane receptors to the intracellular AMPK. One of the surprising results in the present studies is that agents that increase cAMP or the nucleotide itself activate AMPK in intact cells. This is consistent with the report of Moule and Denton (23Moule S.K. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that isoproterenol increases AMPK phosphorylation and kinase activity. In addition to isoproterenol, other β-adrenergic agents such as forskolin also increased AMPK phosphorylation and kinase activity via an intermediary increase in cAMP, as might be expected if AMPK were required for optimal lipolysis. Enthusiasm about the identification of a novel intracellular messenger capable of leading to the activation AMPK is tempered by uncertainty about the mechanism. Thr-172, the phosphorylation site on AMPK responsible for most of the increase in AMPK activity, is not a consensus PKA phosphorylation site, which suggests that either PKA regulates AMPK activity through an indirect mechanism, such as phosphorylating AMPK kinase, or the effect of cAMP is independent of PKA. There are now several such downstream signaling pathways recognized, including the Epac-Rap1 pathway, which has been implicated in regulating many critical cellular events, ranging from cell proliferation and cell differentiation to cell adhesion and morphogenesis (37Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, this pathway has not been reported to be active in adipocytes. The other critical question is how AMPK regulates lipolysis. HSL is the rate-limiting enzyme in this process of lipolysis, and both its activity and its subcellular location are regulated by phosphorylation. There are three PKA phosphorylation sites present on the regulatory module of HSL, Ser-563, Ser-659, and Ser-660, the latter two being most important for regulation of activity in vitro (22Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation by PKA alone cannot account for the maximal activity of HSL as in vitro PKA phosphorylation only causes a 1.5–2-fold increase of HSL lipase activity, whereas isoproterenol stimulates more than 50-fold increase of fatty acid release in vivo (27Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate Ser-565, another serine residue within the regulatory domain of HSL in vitro. One possibility is that phosphorylation of Ser-565 is critical to the translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet. In fact, Su et al. (39Su C.L. Sztalryd C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar) have found that mutation of this residue abolishes the ability of HSL to translocate to the lipid droplet. Alternatively, there are number of other proteins involved in lipolysis, including perilipin and lipotransin, and any of these might be direct targets of AMPK (40Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the activity of AMPK is required for the maximal lipolysis induced by isoproterenol and provided a novel mechanism of how AMPK is activated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our data suggest that upon β-adrenergic agents (such as isoproterenol) stimulation, AMPK is phosphorylated and activated, and this activation contributes to the maximal response of lipolysis, probably by phosphorylating HSL at Ser-565 and promoting the HSL translocation.

To examine the biochemical roles of the Suf proteins, we purified all of the proteins and assayed their effect on SufS cysteine desulfurase activity. Here we report that the SufE protein can stimulate the cysteine desulfurase activity of the SufS enzyme up to 8-fold and accepts sulfane sulfur from SufS. This sulfur transfer process from SufS to SufE is sheltered from the environment based on its resistance to added reductants and on the analysis of available crystal structures of the proteins. We also found that the SufB, SufC, and SufD proteins associate in a stable complex and that, in the presence of SufE, the SufBCD complex further stimulates SufS activity up to 32-fold. Thus, the SufE protein and the SufBCD complex act synergistically to modulate the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS. We propose that this sulfur transfer mechanism may be important for limiting sulfide release during oxidative stress conditions in vivo.

Numerous processes within the cell require the mobilization of elemental sulfur from l-cysteine. These processes include Fe-S cluster assembly as well as the synthesis of molybdopterin, thiamine, biotin, and thionucleosides in tRNA (1Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Often sulfur mobilization occurs via a cysteine desulfurase enzyme that converts l-cysteine to sulfane sulfur and l-alanine in a process that requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as a cofactor (2Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The sulfane sulfur, present as a persulfide intermediate on the active site cysteine of the desulfurase, is then transferred to various sulfur acceptors depending on the physiological pathway. One of the earliest identified cysteine desulfurases is the NifS protein of Azotobacter vinelandii, which is involved in Fe-S assembly in the nitrogenase enzyme (2Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A. vinelandii also contains another NifS homologue, IscS, which is involved in Fe-S cluster assembly in enzymes other than nitrogenase (3Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli contains three NifS homologues, IscS, CsdA (also known as CSD), and SufS (also known as CsdB). All three E. coli enzymes have been purified and shown to exhibit cysteine desulfurase activity (4Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol.

The three NifS homologues are present at separate loci and are co-expressed with different accessory proteins. The question arises as to why three NifS homologues are present in E. coli. Possibly they carry out divergent functions within the cell or are regulated differentially to provide similar functions under different conditions. One way to examine the functions of the three NifS homologues is to characterize the activities of the accessory proteins co-expressed with each homologue. In E. coli, IscS is part of an operon that includes IscR, IscU, and IscA. The IscR transcriptional repressor regulates the isc operon by sensing changes in Fe-S cluster assembly status (8Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). IscU is a Fe-S assembly scaffold protein used to construct nascent Fe-S clusters (9Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A conserved cysteine residue on IscU accepts sulfur from IscS during Fe-S cluster building (10Smith A.D. Agar J.N. Johnson K.A. Frazzon J. Amster I.J. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem.

Both hscA and hscB encode molecular chaperone proteins while fdx encodes a ferredoxin, and all three proteins play a part in isc-mediated Fe-S cluster assembly (15Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L.

In some organisms, the hscB-hscA-fdx operon is co-expressed with isc but in E. coli the two operons are regulated separately (3Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

In vivo the isc operon together with the hscB-hscA-fdx genes have been shown to be important for the assembly of a variety of Fe-S enzymes (18Takahashi Y. Nakamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The second E. coli NifS homologue, CsdA, is encoded adjacent to the ygdK gene, which encodes a homologue of SufE. Little is known about the in vivo role of CsdA. CsdA is the most efficient of the three E. coli NifS homologues at providing sulfur to MoaD for synthesis of molybdopterin in vitro (22Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and may be involved in molybdopterin synthesis in vivo. The SufS cysteine desulfurase is co-expressed with five additional gene products, SufA, SufB, SufC, SufD, and SufE (23Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Besides its cysteine desulfurase activity, SufS has also been shown to exhibit a strong selenocysteine lyase activity in vitro (5Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although SufS does not appear to be important for selenium metabolism in vivo (24Mihara H. Kato S. Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Kennedy R.A. Kurihara T. Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6679-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SufA is a homologue of IscA and can form Fe-S clusters in vitro (25Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Nachin L. Sanakis Y. Loiseau L. Barras F. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17993-18001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SufC has the sequence hallmarks of the ATPase subunit of ABC transporters and has been shown to exhibit ATPase activity (26Rangachari K. Davis C.T. Eccleston J.F. Hirst E.M. Saldanha J.W. Strath M. Wilson R.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The biochemical functions of SufB, SufD, and SufE are unknown, although fluorescence anisotropy and yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that SufB and SufD interact with SufC (26Rangachari K. Davis C.T. Eccleston J.F. Hirst E.M. Saldanha J.W. Strath M. Wilson R.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Most of the suf genes are well conserved in a variety of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, as well as in higher plants (28Ellis K.E. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Previous experiments are consistent with a role for the Suf proteins in Fe-S assembly. In E. coli, mutations in sufS or sufD result in the loss of a Fe-S cluster in the FhuF iron reductase (30Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby preventing the use of ferrioxamine B as a sole iron source. Similarly, mutations in SufB, SufC, or SufD impair Erwinia chrysanthemi growth on ferric chrysobactin as a sole iron source, a phenotype that has been attributed to loss of an unidentified Fe-S enzyme (27Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana, disruption of a SufB homologue leads to accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, indicating an undefined role for SufB in chlorophyll biosynthesis in that organism (31Moller S.G. Kunkel T. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Most suf mutants are synthetically lethal with isc mutants in E. coli, indicating overlap in the roles of the two operons (29Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). E. coli deletion mutants of suf also show decreased growth and loss of some Fe-S enzyme activity under oxidative stress conditions (23Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, transcription of the E. coli suf operon is induced by oxidative stress through the OxyR hydrogen peroxide sensor (19Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and by iron starvation through loss of repression by Fur (30Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lee J.H. Yeo W.S. Roe J.H. J. Microbiol. (Korea). 2003; 41: 109-114Google Scholar). To learn more about the roles of the individual Suf proteins, we have purified the suf gene products and determined that SufE stimulates the activity of the SufS cysteine desulfurase. In addition, the SufB, SufC, and SufD proteins interact in a stable complex and can further increase the desulfurase activity of SufS in a SufE-dependent manner. These results indicate that interactions with accessory proteins can enhance the activity of NifS homologues above that observed with the cysteine desulfurase alone. We propose that regulated sulfur transfer conferred by SufE and SufBCD may be important under iron-limited and oxidative stress conditions. Strains and Media—(His)6-SufE and SufABCDSE were expressed in TOP10 (Invitrogen), and (His)6-SufA and (His)6-SufS were expressed in BL21(DE3)plysS (Invitrogen). All of the bacterial growth was in Lennox Broth (10 g of tryptone,5 g of yeast extract,5 g of NaCl/liter). Ampicillin was used at 100 mg/liter, and chloramphenicol was used at 30 mg/liter. l-Arabinose was added to 0.2% final concentration by weight, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm final concentration. All of the chemicals used were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Plasmid Construction—All of the PCR reactions were carried out using MG1655 chromosomal DNA as template. SufABCDSE was PCR-amplified using two primers (5′-GAGGTAAATCGATGGATCCGCATTCAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCACCTGAATTCAAAACACTCCTGTGC-3′). The EcoRI-digested PCR fragment was ligated into the NcoI (bluntended with Klenow fragment) and EcoRI sites of pBADmychisC (Invitrogen) to generate pGSO164. SufE was amplified using two primers (5′-GAGGCACCATGGCTTTATTGCCGGATAA-3′ and 5′-CCTTTTAGTTTAGCTGAATTCAGCGGCTTTG-3′), digested with NcoI and EcoRI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBADmychisC to generate pGSO165. SufS was amplified using two primers (5′-GGAGGTGCAAGATGAGATCTTCCGTCGACAAAGT-3′ and 5′-CCATAGTGAATTCCTGTTATCCCAGCAAACGG-3′), digested with BglII and EcoRI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pRSETB (Invitrogen) to generate pGSO166. SufA was PCR-amplified using two primers (5′-GTTGCTTCAGAATTCCGAGACATAGTACCGCC-3′ and 5′-GAGGTAAATCGATGGATCCGCATTCAGGAAC-3′), digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pRSETB to generate pGSO167. Plasmids were designed such that (His)6-SufA and (His)6-SufS were fused with a (His)6-tag at their N termini while (His)6-SufE was fused with a Myc and (His)6-tag at the C terminus. Mutation of SufE Cys51 to Ser was performed using the pGSO165 construct, two mutagenic primers (5′-CAAAATAGCATTCAGGGCAGCCAGAGTCAGGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACACCTGACTCTGGCTGCCCTGAATGCTATTTTG-3′), and the QuikChange site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol to generate pGSO168. The nucleotide sequences of all of the plasmid inserts were confirmed. Protein Expression and Purification—Strains carrying the (His)6 expression constructs were induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside ((His)6-SufA and (His)6-SufS) or l-arabinose ((His)6-SufE) when the cultures obtained an A 600 of 0.4–0.6. After 3 h of expression at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation. All of the cells were lysed in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) via sonication ((His)6-SufA and (His)6-SufS)) or with a high pressure cell disrupter (Constant Systems LTD) at 10,000 p.s.i. ((His)6-SufE). Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, cleared lysate was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) column on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a step gradient of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. (His)6-SufA and (His)6-SufS were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, concentrated, and stored at -70 °C. Purified (His)6-SufE was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and then was digested with trypsin (1:400 ratio by weight of trypsin to (His)6-SufE). The digested SufE lacked the Myc and (His)6 tag but contained the full sequence of the native protein, as confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The digested SufE was treated with 10 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CD, circular dichroism; DLS, dynamic light scattering. further purified on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), concentrated, and stored at -70 °C. SufEC51S was purified as described for SufE. Similar yields were obtained for the SufEC51S mutant protein as compared with native SufE, and it was as resistant to proteolysis as the native SufE protein, indicating that it was correctly folded. The entire suf operon was expressed simultaneously to purify Suf-BCD. Cells expressing the entire suf operon induced by the addition of l-arabinose at A 600 of 0.4–0.6 turned grayish-black after the 3-h expression period, possibly because of the accumulation of iron sulfides within the cell. Cell pellets from the SufABCDSE expression were lysed in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet using a high pressure cell disrupter at 10,000 p.s.i. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, cleared lysate was loaded onto a Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing SufBCD were pooled, dialyzed overnight in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and concentrated. The concentrated fractions then were separated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified SufBCD was concentrated and stored at -70 °C. Purified IscS and NifS from A. vinelandii were kindly provided by D. R. Dean. Size Determination—A Superdex 200 gel-filtration column was used to determine size by gel-filtration chromatography. Concentrated protein samples in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl were loaded onto the column in 1-ml volumes to minimize dilution effects. Molecular weights were calculated by plotting log molecular weight versus the ratio of the elution volume/void volume for the standard proteins. Sizes were also determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a DynaPro instrument (Protein Solutions) and Dynamics software. Cysteine Desulfurase Activity Assays—Total sulfide was measured by a previously published protocol (11Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out anaerobically in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl using 500 nm cysteine desulfurase ((His)6-SufS, IscSA. vinelandii, or NifSA. vinelandii) and varying ratios of (His)6-SufA, SufBCD, SufE, and/or BSA. A molecular mass of 165 kDa (as measured by DLS) was used to calculate molar concentrations of the SufBCD complex. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate was added to 10 μm, and reactions were initiated by dilution of a 10 mm l-cysteine/10 mm DTT stock to a 100 μm final concentration of each in a total reaction volume of 800 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min at 27 °C and then were quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine in 7.2 m HCl. The addition of 100 μlof30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 m HCl and incubation for 20 min led to the formation of methylene blue. Precipitated protein was removed by 30-s centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and methylene blue was measured at 670 nm. Na2S was used as a standard for calibration. Sulfur Transfer Assays—Reactions consisted of 1 μm (His)6-SufS mixed with 20 μm (His)6-SufA, SufE, SufBCD, and/or BSA in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm DTT. Reactions were initiated by the addition of l-[35S]cysteine (150 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) to a final concentration of 30 μm. The final reaction volume was 35 μl. After a 30-s incubation, samples were loaded onto preequilibrated G50 ProbeQuant columns (Amersham Biosciences) and spun for 2 min at 1700 × g. Samples were separated on a non-reducing 10–20% Trisglycine gel, dried onto filter paper, and exposed overnight to a phosphorimaging screen or film. Control transfer reactions without DTT showed no increase in labeling as compared with samples with DTT. Purification of the Suf Proteins—The SufS cysteine desulfurase and its accessory proteins, SufA, SufB, SufC, SufD, and SufE, were purified to characterize their biochemical functions (Fig. 1A). (His)6-SufA, (His)6-SufS, and SufE were expressed and purified separately. (His)6-SufS was purified as a dimer with an absorption maximum at 420 nm as has been reported for native SufS (5Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SufE was expressed as a Myc and (His)6 fusion, but the tag was later removed by limited proteolysis. The molecular weight of SufE was analyzed using two different techniques. SufE eluted from a gel-filtration column as a single peak at a molecular mass of 19.8 kDa (Fig. 1B). This molecular mass is between the predicted molecular masses for a SufE monomer (15.8 kDa) and dimer (31.6 kDa). However, a monodispersed species with a molecular mass of 32 kDa was detected using DLS, indicating that SufE can exist in a homodimeric form. These differences in SufE molecular mass and oligomerization probably reflect differences between the two techniques. The SufE protein eluted from the gel-filtration column in a very dilute peak; therefore, its molecular weight was measured at a concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml. In contrast, the molecular mass was measured by DLS using a SufE concentration of 4 mg/ml. These results suggest that SufE can form monomers at low protein concentrations and homodimers at higher protein concentrations. The SufB, SufC, and SufD proteins were expressed simultaneously with all of the suf genes from a single expression construct. During isolation of Suf proteins from cells expressing the SufABCDSE construct, we found that SufB, SufC, and SufD always co-purified on both anion-exchange and gel-filtration resins (Fig. 1A). In addition, the SufBCD proteins co-purified during ammonium sulfate precipitation and on a variety of hydrophobic interaction resins. In fact, the individual SufB, SufC, and SufD proteins could only be completely separated from the complex using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, indicating tight association. This result is consistent with previous yeast two-hybrid (27Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and fluorescence anisotropy (26Rangachari K. Davis C.T. Eccleston J.F. Hirst E.M. Saldanha J.W. Strath M. Wilson R.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) studies that suggest interactions between SufC and the SufB and SufD proteins. The SufBCD complex was in a folded conformation based on its CD spectra and also possessed ATPase activity (data not shown). Analysis of the SufBCD complex using gel filtration resulted in a major species of 172 kDa (Fig. 1C). A similar monodispersed molecular mass of 165 kDa was obtained for the Suf-BCD complex by DLS. A small amount of SufBCD was also seen in a higher molecular mass peak of 324 kDa during gel filtration, which corresponds to a multimer of the complex. Several protein stoichiometries could match the 172-kDa molecular mass measured for the SufBCD complex, but on a denaturing gel the proteins appear to be present in equimolar amounts (Fig. 1A). Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the exact stoichiometry of the SufBCD complex. In this study, we simply refer to the 172-kDa complex of the SufB, SufC, and SufD proteins as SufBCD. SufE Enhances SufS Cysteine Desulfurase Activity—Our purified (His)6-SufS has a specific activity of 0.008 units/mg toward l-cysteine at 37 °C. This activity is slightly less (2–3-fold) than the 0.019 units/mg activity obtained for native SufS using a different assay that contained 500-fold higher levels of reductant and 120-fold higher levels of l-cysteine (5Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In general, the in vitro cysteine desulfurase activity of isolated SufS is low compared with the activities of the isolated IscS or CsdA enzymes (6Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, all of the previous experiments were carried out with purified SufS in the absence of the other suf gene products. Because the addition of IscU to IscS enhances the desulfurase activity of IscS (12Kato S. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that accessory proteins could alter the enzyme activity of SufS. To determine whether the SufA, SufBCD, or SufE proteins affect the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS, we measured (His)6-SufS activity in the presence of the accessory proteins. The addition of SufE increased the desulfurase activity of (His)6-SufS by nearly an order of magnitude (8-fold) while the addition of (His)6-SufA, SufBCD, or a nonspecific BSA control had little effect (Fig. 2A). Maximum enhancement was observed at a 6-fold molar excess of SufE (Fig. 2A), possibly reflecting a need for SufE in excess to fully promote (His)6-SufS activity or indicating that some fraction of the SufE protein is not fully active. (His)6-SufA, SufBCD, and SufE did not exhibit any measurable desulfurase activity in the absence of (His)6-SufS (data not shown). The SufBCD Complex Magnifies the SufE Enhancement of SufS Activity—To determine whether the other Suf proteins affect the SufE-dependent enhancement of (His)6-SufS activity, we also measured desulfurase activity in the presence of various Suf protein combinations (Fig. 2B). Although the addition of (His)6-SufA or BSA to a mixture of SufE and (His)6-SufS had no further effect on SufS activity, the addition of the SufBCD complex to SufE and (His)6-SufS increased desulfurase activity from 8- to ∼32-fold (Fig. 2B). The enhancement of desulfurase activity by SufE and SufBCD is specific for (His)6-SufS as the addition of SufE and SufBCD to the NifS and IscS cysteine desulfurases from A. vinelandii had little effect on their activities (Fig. 3). Cys51 Is Essential for SufE Function—It has been shown that IscS transfers sulfur to the Fe-S scaffold protein IscU via Cys63 on IscU and that this residue is required for IscU-dependent enhancement of IscS activity (12Kato S. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An examination of the SufE amino acid sequence for conserved residues that might be involved in its function revealed the presence of a highly conserved cysteine at position 51 (Fig. 4A). This residue represents a candidate to accept sulfur mobilized from l-cysteine by (His)6-SufS. We substituted this conserved cysteine with a serine, isolated the mutant protein, and assayed its effect on (His)6-SufS desulfurase activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, the SufEC51S mutant lacks the ability to enhance (His)6-SufS desulfurase activity. SufBCD enhancement of (His)6-SufS activity also was abolished in the presence of SufEC51S, further highlighting the importance of the Cys51 residue for SufE function (Fig. 4B). SufE Functions as a Sulfur Acceptor Protein—Because SufE and SufBCD enhancement of (His)6-SufS activity could involve specific transfer of sulfane sulfur to one of these proteins, we tested the ability of SufS to transfer sulfur to the Suf accessory proteins. We observed clear mobilization of 35S from l-[35S]cysteine to SufE via (His)6-SufS (Fig. 5A). In contrast, 35S labeling of (His)6-SufA by (His)6-SufS was essentially the same as that observed with the control protein BSA, indicating little to no specific transfer to this protein (Fig. 5A). Although there was more labeling of the SufBCD complex than (His)6-SufA, the labeling was substantially less intense than the labeling of SufE, suggesting that there is no specific sulfur transfer between (His)6-SufS and SufBCD. When SufBCD is added to (His)6-SufS in the presence of SufE, we observed a diminished level of SufE monomer labeling and more high molecular weight labeling (Supplemental Fig. 1A). The high molecular weight species result from increased disulfide bonding among (His)6-SufS, SufE, and SufB that occurs when the proteins are mixed in the presence of l-cysteine (Supplemental Fig. 1B). The SufEC51S mutant is not labele"

It is believed that the heterodimeric proteins XPC/hHR23B and UV-DDB (UV-damaged DNA binding factor, composed of the p48 and p127 subunits) perform this function in genomic DNA, but their requirement and lesion specificity in vivo remains unknown. Using repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)-A cells that stably express photoproduct-specific photolyases, we determined the binding characteristics of p48 and XPC to either CPDs or 6–4PPs in vivo. p48 localized to UV-irradiated sites that contained either CPDs or 6–4PPs. However, XPC localized only to UV-irradiated sites that contained 6–4PPs, suggesting that XPC does not efficiently recognize CPDs in vivo. XPC did localize to CPDs when p48 was overexpressed in the same cell, signifying that p48 activates the recruitment of XPC to CPDs and may be the initial recognition factor in the NER pathway.

In human cells, these photoproducts are repaired exclusively through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, and loss of NER leads to the skin cancer-prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). NER can be further subdivided into two pathways, global genomic repair (GGR), which repairs lesions found throughout the genome, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which removes lesions selectively from the transcribed strand of active genes (reviewed in Refs. 1de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar and 2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 221: 47-70PubMed Google Scholar). TCR is believed to be activated by the recognition of a stalled RNA polymerase at the lesion. Recognition of lesions by the GGR pathway is less well understood. Mutations in the XPC and DDB2 genes, resulting in the XP-C and XP-E complementation groups, respectively, lead to a loss in GGR but not TCR, suggesting that these genes encode for the UV-damage recognition factors initiating the GGR pathway (3Venema J. van Hoffen A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Further evidence that XPC and p48 (the protein product of the DDB2 gene) are DNA damage recognition factors comes from in vitro and in vivo experiments of the interaction of these proteins with UV-induced DNA lesions. In vitro binding studies have shown that XPC complexed with the hHR23B protein has a greater affinity for naked UV-damaged DNA than undamaged DNA and has a greater affinity for the 6–4PP than the CPD (5Sugasawa K.

The precise role of UV-DDB in GGR is not well understood because the repair reaction can be recapitulated in vitro in its absence (11Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V.

One caveat of these in vitro binding studies is that the DNA substrates were not bound by nucleosomes or folded into higher order chromatin structures as would be found in an intact nucleus that had sustained DNA damage. Regulation of many DNA processes, such as transcription and replication, involves chromatin remodeling; it is now clear that DNA repair also requires chromatin remodeling to access damaged nucleotides (14Meijer M. Smerdon M.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies performed in vivo are necessary to fully understand how these structures may be affecting damage recognition. Use of a localized UV irradiation technique whereby only parts of the nucleus are irradiated through a micropore polycarbonate filter is a powerful tool for analyzing protein localization to sites of UV irradiation in vivo. We and others have used this technique to demonstrate that p48 and XPC bind rapidly to areas that have been irradiated and that the binding of both of these factors can occur in the absence of other important repair factors, such as XPA and p53 (13Wakasugi M.

Although UV photoproducts are repaired solely by the NER pathway in human cells, many other organisms possess an alternative pathway for the repair of individual UV photoproducts by the use of single enzymes called photolyases (18Sancar G.B. Mut. Res. 1990; 236: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Once bound specifically to the lesion, these enzymes use energy from the visible spectrum of light to reverse the UV photoproduct without any incision or religation event, a process termed photoreactivation. Photolyases specific for either the CPD or the 6–4PP have been described from bacteria, lower eukaryotes, plants, and even marsupials (19Yasui A. Eker A.P. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6143-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). UV irradiation induces substantially more CPDs than 6–4PPs, yet the repair, or consequence of having unrepaired lesions, of either of the individual photoproducts in DNA is unclear. Therefore, generation of an experimental system with defined UV photoproducts is of great interest for understanding the physiologic response to UV irradiation. Photolyases have recently been used in mammalian systems to address the contribution of the individual photoproducts to the mutagenic effects of UV-B (20You Y.H. Lee D.H. Yoon J.H. Nakajima S. Yasui A. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44688-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the apoptotic response of HeLa cells to UV-C (21Chigancas V. Miyaji E.N. Muotri A.R. de Fatima J.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Yasui A. Menck C.F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2458-2463PubMed Google Scholar), and also UV resistance in whole animals (22Schul W. Jans J. Rijksen Y.M.A. Klemann K.H.M. Eker A.P.M. de Wit J. Nikaido O. Nakajima S. Yasui A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van der Horst G.T.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies have all suggested that the majority of the cellular response to UV is attributable to CPDs. Understanding the mechanism of recognition of CPDs versus 6–4PPs in the repair process is therefore of great importance. We have used NER-deficient XP-A cells that stably express either a heterologous CPD-specific photolyase or a 6–4PP-specific photolyase to address the specific roles in vivo of p48 and XPC in recognition of the individual photoproducts after UV irradiation. Antibodies—For immunoblots, rabbit polyclonal anti-photolyase antibodies were used at 1:2000 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit at 1:5000 (Pierce) for chemiluminescent detection (anti-photolyase antibodies were gifts from Dr. Andre P. M. Eker, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). 50 μg of protein was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE for analysis of the photolyases. Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence were mouse monoclonal anti-CPD at 1:1500 (TDM2), mouse monoclonal anti-6–4PP at 1:400 (64M-2) (gifts from Toshio Mori, Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan) (23Mori T.

Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, both used at 1:500 (Molecular Probes). Immunoslotblot detection of photoproducts was performed as previously described (24Fitch M.E. Cross I.V. Turner S.J. Adimoolam S. Lin C.X. Williams K.G. Ford J.M.

Cell Lines—All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, antibiotics, and 500 μg/ml G418 (for maintenance of transgenic photolyase genes) and were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

UV Irradiation—For photoreactivation, cells were irradiated at the indicated dose of UV-C using a germicidal lamp (predominantly 254 nm). After UV-C exposure, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and exposed to photoreactivating 360-nm UV-A light from two bulbs (Sankyo Denki, F15T8BLB 15W; PGC Scientific) from above. To block shorter wavelengths, the black lights were filtered through one 5-mm borosilicate glass plate. The distance from the bulbs to the cells was ∼15 cm. For local UV irradiation, cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips. Prior to irradiation, the media were aspirated, and the cells were washed in PBS. For every experiment using localized irradiation, a 3-μm isopore polycarbonate filter (Millipore) presoaked in PBS was placed over the cells, and the cells were irradiated through the filter with 200 J/m2 of UV-C from a germicidal lamp calibrated to deliver 10 J/m2/s. The membrane was removed, and the cells were photoreactivated for 2 h under UV-A blacklight. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown as indicated on coverslips in a 35-mm dish, washed in PBS, then fixed by 2% formaldehyde in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min on ice. Cells were washed three times in PBS, and then the DNA was denatured by incubation in 2 n HCl for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in 20% fetal bovine serum in washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Primary and secondary antibodies were made up in 1% bovine serum albumin in washing buffer and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After each antibody step, cells were washed three times for 5 min in washing buffer. When staining for both CPDs or 6–4PPs and the V5 epitope-tagged proteins, a second blocking step of 5 μg/ml mouse IgG (Sigma) was added for 30 min after the CPD and the goat-anti mouse antibodies had been incubated to block non-specific interactions between them and the V5 antibody. Anti-V5 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody was added after the IgG step and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in VectaShield with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Images were captured by a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (with ×60 oil objective) using an RT Slider CCD camera (Spot Diagnostic), analyzed by Spot RT 3.0 software (Spot Diagnostic), and further adjusted in Adobe PhotoShop 6.0. Characterization of Photolyase-expressing Cell Lines—XP-A cell lines were established that stably express either the CPD photolyase from the rat kangaroo Potorous tridactylis or the 6–4PP photolyase from Arabidopsis thaliana. The advantage of using XP-A cells completely deficient in repair of both CPDs and 6–4PPs (28Lommel L. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 970-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell D.L. Haipek C.A. Clarkson J.M. Mutat. Res. 1985; 143: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) is that any removal of a photoproduct occurs solely through the action of the photolyase and not through the NER pathway. Fig. 1A is an immunoblot demonstrating the specific expression of each photolyase in XP-A cells; CPD-3 cells express the CPD photolyase, and 6–4 cells express the 6–4PP photolyase. We examined the kinetics of photoreactivation by first irradiating the photolyase-expressing cells with 20 J/m2 of UV-C and then exposing the cells for varying times to the reactivating energy found in UV-A light. Substantial photoreactivation was observed with one hour of UV-A treatment as measured using monoclonal antibodies to the specific photoproducts (Fig. 1B). By two hours, ∼83% of CPDs had been photoreversed from CPD-3 cells. Increasing lengths of UV-A treatment did not cause significantly more reversal of CPDs (data not shown). Repair of 6–4PPs was much more efficient in the 6–4 cells, with 98% of the 6–4PPs reversed following 2 h of UV-A treatment (Fig. 1B). It is not clear why 6–4PPs were repaired so much more efficiently, but one factor may be that 6–4PPs typically occur outside of chromatinized regions and so may be more accessible to the enzyme (30Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous work (31Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Schieferstein U. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that nucleosomes inhibit the activity of photolyase on CPDs, suggesting that the residual CPDs seen in the UV-A-treated CPD-3 cells may reside within nucleosomal structures. Exposure of the cells to UV-A light did not induce more CPDs or 6–4PPs, as indicated by the lack of change in the band intensities of the vector-only expressing cells at the indicated time points. Notably, 6–4PPs also diminished in the CPD-3 cells after two hours of UV-A treatment to ∼30% of original levels, possibly because of some cross-reactivity between the CPD photolyase and the 6–4PP. Localization of p48 and XPC to DNA Damage after Photoreactivation of CPDs or 6–4PPs—Having established the characteristics of each photolyase clone, we utilized these cells to determine the binding properties of p48 or XPC to the individual photoproducts in vivo. For the study of each protein, we transiently transfected the photolyase-expressing XP-A cells with either a DDB2 or XPC cDNA that had an additional V5 epitope tag to aid in detection and then used indirect immunofluorescence to visualize both the protein and photoproduct of interest. Irradiation was performed using the localized introduction of lesions through a micropore polycarbonate filter and colocalization of nuclear proteins to sites of DNA damage determined using specific monoclonal antibodies to CPDs and 6–4PPs (23Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Photoreactivation under UV-A light was carried out for 2 h because this was sufficient to remove nearly all of the 6–4PPs in the 6–4 photolyase-expressing cells and the majority of CPDs in the CPD-3 photolyase-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). Fig. 2 shows representative images of p48 and XPC binding to lesions induced by 200 J/m2 UV-C through a 3-μm polycarbonate filter and then subjected to 2 h of UV-A reactivating light. We have previously used the local UV irradiation assay to demonstrate that a dose of 200 J/m2 through a 3-μm filter was able to activate the tumor suppressor protein p53 and that this dose induced irradiated sites that efficiently bound both p48 and XPC (16Fitch M.E. Cross I.V. Ford J.M. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In CPD-3 cells, where the majority of CPDs have been removed by the CPD-specific photolyase, p48 clearly localized to sites that contain 6–4PPs (Fig. 2A). This localization pattern was observed in 100 of 105 cells examined visually (95.2%). One caveat to this finding is that because of the small number of photolyase-resistant CPDs remaining in these irradiated sites, we have not definitively determined if p48 bound only to 6–4PPs or if the residual CPDs are the cause of the binding pattern seen. In 6–4 cells that express the 6–4PP-specific photolyase, p48 localized to sites that contained CPDs, as shown in Fig. 2B. This colocalization pattern was observed in 88 of 112 cells examined visually (78.5%). The binding of p48 to the irradiated sites in the 6–4 cells after 2 h of reactivation appears to be specific to CPDs because the vast majority of 6–4PPs had been removed by the photolyase at this time point (Fig. 1B). There were not as many cells with the specific colocalization pattern of p48 and CPDs in 6–4 cells as there were for p48 and 6–4PPs in the CPD-3 cells (78.5 versus 95.2%), suggesting that CPDs may not be as strong a recognition signal as the 6–4PP for p48 in vivo. This would be consistent with the in vitro findings that UV-DDB has a higher affinity for 6–4PPs over CPDs (6Batty D. Rapic'-Otrin V. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower percentage of localization observed in the 6–4 photolyase-expressing cells also suggests that the high percentage of colocalization of p48 to irradiated sites observed in the CPD-3 cells was indeed due to p48 recognizing the 6–4PPs and not only the residual CPDs. The XPC binding pattern was also determined in the photolyase-expressing XP-A cells. Fig. 2C is a representative image of XPC binding to irradiated sites that contained 6–4PPs in CPD-3 cells 2 h after UV-C irradiation and reactivation with UV-A. The colocalization of XPC to 6–4PP sites was observed in 99 of 108 cells (91.7%), suggesting that XPC is proficient at recognizing the 6–4PP in vivo. In contrast, 2 h after reactivation XPC did not colocalize to irradiated sites that contained only CPDs in 6–4 cells, as seen in Fig. 2D. Only 9 of 110 cells examined (8.2%) demonstrated an appreciable amount of colocalization of XPC to CPD-containing sites. The majority of 6–4PPs have been removed from these sites. Thus it can be inferred that the remaining CPDs were not able to efficiently recruit enough XPC to these sites to be seen by indirect immunofluorescence. The lack of binding to CPDs in the 6–4 cells further demonstrated that it was the 6–4PPs that were recognized by XPC in the CPD-3 cells and not the residual CPDs that were not removed by the CPD photolyase. This in vivo data is again consistent with in vitro binding studies that demonstrated that XPC has a much greater affinity for the 6–4PP than the CPD (6Batty D. Rapic'-Otrin V. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 7Hey T. Lipps G. Sugasawa K. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Krauss G.

Res. 2001; 485: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This is the first in vivo demonstration that p48 is a more efficient recognition factor for CPDs than XPC (78.5% positive colocalization verses 8.2%). p48 Activates XPC Binding to CPD-containing Sites—The different binding patterns observed between p48 and XPC led to the hypothesis that p48 may stimulate XPC binding to CPDs in vivo, thereby explaining why XP-E cells mutant for DDB2 are predominantly deficient in the GGR of CPDs, more than 6–4PPs (4Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that p48 can stimulate XPC binding to UV-irradiated sites that contained both CPDs and 6–4PPs (16Fitch M.E. Cross I.V. Ford J.M. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 is a representative image of 6–4 cells that were transfected with both XPC and p48, irradiated with 200 J/m2 UV-C, and then photoreactivated with 2 h of UV-A to remove the 6–4PPs. In comparison to Fig. 2D where no detectable XPC binding in 6–4 cells was seen after photoreactivation, XPC strongly colocalized to irradiated sites that contain only CPDs in cells that overexpressed p48 (Fig. 3A). This pattern was observed in 100 of 115 cells examined (87.0%). This clearly demonstrates that p48 stimulates XPC binding to CPDs in vivo and provides the mechanism for the previously observed enhancement of XPC binding by p48. One caveat to our transfection studies is that these conditions are not the same as the photoreversal conditions used to determine the efficiency of the 6–4 photolyase in Fig. 1 because we have overexpressed ectopic p48 and XPC, which potentially could interfere with the action of the 6–4 photolyase. We therefore also stained for 6–4PPs in the transfected 6–4 cells after2hof photoreactivating UV-A in the presence of overexpressed p48 and XPC. Fig. 3B shows two representative cells from a transfection experiment with both XPC and p48 transgenes as in Fig. 3A, only now stained for 6–4PPs and XPC. XPC can be seen localizing to areas that are presumably irradiated sites that contain CPDs, but there are no discernable 6–4PPs and the XPC-expressing cell has the same background staining pattern as the cell below it, which is not expressing the transgenic XPC and p48. These results were verified in whole cell irradiation experiments (20 J/m2, 2-h photoreactivation); again we did not observe any residual 6–4PPs in cells that had overexpressed p48 or XPC alone or in combination over cells that did not express the transgenes. In conclusion, we do not believe that p48 or XPC interferes with the action of the 6–4 photolyase and that the results we observe are due to p48 activating the binding of XPC to CPDs.

Open table in a new tab We have used XP-A cells that express specific DNA photolyases to define the in vivo binding properties of p48 and XPC. p48 bound to both lesion types, with a slight preference for the 6–4PP. XPC, in contrast, showed a very strong binding preference for the 6–4PP over the CPD. Our data corroborate in vitro studies of XPC and p48 binding preferences (6Batty D. Rapic'-Otrin V. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 7Hey T. Lipps G. Sugasawa K. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Krauss G.

Overexpression of p48 was able to dramatically alter the binding properties of XPC so that significant colocalization of XPC was observed to CPD-only-containing sites. Loss of p48 in XP-E cells causes a decrease in repair of CPDs but does not greatly affect the repair of 6–4PPs (4Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The ability of XPC to readily recognize 6–4PPs but not CPDs in vivo correlates with the phenotype of XP-E cells and demonstrates in vivo that XPC can function to recognize 6–4PPs. When p48 is present at higher levels, as with overexpression in our study or through upregulation by p53 both at basal levels and after DNA damage (4Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), p48 is able to recruit XPC to CPDs and therefore stimulate repair of these lesions. This also explains recent observations by Wang et al. (33Wang Q. Zhu Q. Wani M.A. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A. DNA Repair (Amst). 2003; 2: 483-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) describing a p53-dependent effect on binding of XPC and TFIIH to UV-irradiated sites, where they speculated that regulation of a p53-dependent gene may affect the recruitment of XPC to irradiated sites, and specifically to CPDs. This is the first demonstration in vivo of the mechanism by which p48 stimulates DNA repair through the NER pathway. There is some repair of CPDs in XP-E cells, and this may occur through the recognition of CPDs by XPC when other chromatin remodeling processes occur, such as those related to transcription or DNA replication. The in vitro binding studies of XPC to CPDs would suggest that there is some affinity between the two, yet the fact that we did not observe significant binding of XPC to CPDs when p48 was not overexpressed suggests that the amount of XPC binding at any one time was not enough to allow detection by our technique. Although p48 clearly enhances the binding of XPC to CPDs, we do not know the mechanism for this stimulation. p48 has recently been shown to interact with the COP9 signalosome (34Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), a complex that has ubiquitin ligase activity. This would suggest a mechanism whereby p48 mediates ubiquitin ligation of substrates around CPDs, possibly including histones, which may lead to nucleosome unfolding and thereby allow access of XPC and the remaining components of the NER machinery to CPDs. p48 is itself degraded rapidly after UV irradiation via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome (24Fitch M.E.

Gonzalez M. Levine A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2588-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); XPC stability is also regulated through the proteasome (36Ng J.M.Y. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T.J. Bergink S. Sugasawa K. Vrieling H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Genes Dev. 2003; : 260003Google Scholar). Clearly, regulation of ubiquitin pathways is an important feature of NER and an exciting new avenue to explore in the understanding of NER."

Unlike ubiquitin, which is often linked to its substrates as a polyubiquitin chain, only one SUMO moiety is attached per modified site in most substrates. However, SUMO has recently been shown to form chains in vitro and in mammalian cells, with a lysine in the non-ubiquitin-like N-terminal extension serving as the major SUMO-SUMO branch site. To investigate the physiological function of SUMO chains, we generated Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that expressed mutant SUMOs lacking various lysine residues. Otherwise wild-type strains lacking any of the nine lysines in SUMO were viable, had no obvious growth defects or stress sensitivities, and had SUMO conjugate patterns that did not differ dramatically from wild type. However, mutants lacking the SUMO-specific isopeptidase Ulp2 accumulated high molecular weight SUMO-containing species, which formed only when the N-terminal lysines of SUMO were present, suggesting that they contained SUMO chains. Furthermore SUMO branch-site mutants suppressed several of the phenotypes of ulp2Δ, consistent with the possibility that some ulp2Δ phenotypes are caused by accumulation of SUMO chains. We also found that a mutant SUMO whose non-ubiquitin-like N-terminal domain had been entirely deleted still carried out all the essential functions of SUMO. Thus, the ubiquitin-like domain of SUMO is sufficient for conjugation and all downstream functions required for yeast viability.

SUMOs are ubiquitin-related proteins that function by being covalently attached to other proteins as post-translational modifications. SUMO conjugation is essential for viability of most eukaryotic cells and participates in many cellular processes including transcription, DNA repair, chromatin organization, nuclear transport, signal transduction, and the cell cycle (1Melchior F.

SUMOs share only ∼18% sequence identity with Ub but contain a C-terminal domain with a Ub-fold that is virtually superimposable on the structure of Ub. SUMOs also contain a ∼20-residue non-Ub-related N-terminal extension. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a single SUMO protein encoded by the SMT3 gene, while mammals contain three different SUMOs: SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, which are 95% identical to each other, and SUMO-1. SUMO attachment is catalyzed by a three-step enzyme pathway, analogous to the Ub pathway, consisting of the heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (E1) Uba2·Aos1, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme (E2) Ubc9, and several different SUMO ligases (E3s) (4Johnson E.S.

Ubc9 and the E3s collaborate to confer substrate specificity on sumoylation: SUMO is often attached to the lysine in the short motif (I/V/L)KXE, and this motif is bound directly by Ubc9 (13Sampson D.A.

Sumoylation is a reversible modification, and a family of SUMO-specific isopeptidases, including the yeast proteins Ulp1 and Ulp2 (also called Smt4), removes SUMO from modified proteins. Ulp1 and Ulp2 have different subcellular localizations and are responsible for desumoylating different proteins (15Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

In S. cerevisiae many of the genes encoding SUMO pathway proteins are essential, including SMT3, UBA2, AOS1, UBC9, and ULP1, but it is not known what the essential function of SUMO conjugation is. SUMO is attached to many yeast proteins, but only five have been characterized to date: three members of the septin family of cytoskeletal proteins, the multifunctional replication processivity factor PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and topoisomerase II (Top2) (18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking the SUMO attachment sites on any of these proteins have quite subtle phenotypes, indicating that the substrate(s) involved in the essential function of SUMO remains to be discovered. The other SUMO pathway genes SIZ1, SIZ2, and ULP2 are not essential. ulp2Δ mutants grow poorly, are sensitive to a variety of stress conditions, and have defects in chromosome segregation and recovery from cell cycle checkpoint arrest (16Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 17Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen.

Intriguingly some of the ulp2Δ phenotypes are suppressed by elimination of the major SUMO attachment sites in Top2, suggesting that excessive SUMO attachment to Top2 may cause some of the phenotypes of ulp2Δ (21Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The siz1Δ and siz2Δ single mutants grow well and do not have obvious phenotypes, although they are each deficient for SUMO attachment to different classes of substrates (8Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 10Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol.

The siz1Δ siz2Δ double mutant is also viable, although it is cold-sensitive, delays in the cell cycle at G2/M, and has very low levels of SUMO conjugates. Thus, Siz1 and Siz2 have an overlapping function probably involving promoting SUMO conjugation to the same substrate(s). A critical property of Ub is its ability to form poly-Ub chains, in which successive Ub moieties are linked to an internal lysine of the previous Ub in the chain. Ub chains can have branch sites at several different lysines, and chains with different branch sites have different functions (23Johnson E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E295-E298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, most substrates of SUMO are modified with only one copy of SUMO per attachment site lysine, although a polypeptide may be multiply sumoylated by attachment of mono-SUMO at several sites (18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, it has been found recently that yeast SUMO and mammalian SUMO-2 and -3 readily form chains in in vitro reactions (8Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

The major branch sites are lysines in the N-terminal non-Ub-like domain: Lys15 in yeast SUMO and Lys11 in SUMO-2/3 (24Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H.

These lysines are in sequences that conform to the sumoylation consensus motif, although the yeast sequence contains a proline after the lysine, which is unusual. SUMO-1 does not have such a sequence but also forms chains in vitro with an as yet uncharacterized linkage (11Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). SUMO-2/3 also forms chains in cells, as the histone deacetylase HDAC4 is disumoylated in cells expressing wt SUMO-2 but monosumoylated if SUMO-2-K11R is expressed (24Tatham M.H. Jaffray E.

There is also evidence that generation of amyloid β peptide from the amyloid precursor protein involves SUMO chain formation (26Li Y. Wang H. Wang S. Quon D. Liu Y.W. Cordell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the function of SUMO chains, as well as their prevalence in SUMO-dependent processes, is unknown. To determine the physiological function of SUMO chain formation in yeast, we generated a series of yeast strains in which the genomic SUMO (SMT3) gene was replaced with mutant versions lacking combinations of its nine lysines. These experiments showed that SUMO chain formation is not a major feature of SUMO activity in yeast. However, the evidence suggests that SUMO chains do form but that their quantities are restricted by the activities of SUMO-specific isopeptidases. Media and Genetic Techniques—Standard techniques were used (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York2000Google Scholar). Rich yeast medium containing 2% glucose (YPD) was prepared as described previously (28Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Cells were arrested at G2/M in the cell cycle by incubating with 15 μg/ml nocodazole (Acros) for 3 h. Growth assays were performed by making 10-fold serial dilutions of logarithmically growing cells that had been normalized to A 600 1.0. A 2.5-μl sample of each dilution was spotted onto YPD plates or YPD plates supplemented with 0.1 m hydroxyurea (Acros); 10 mm caffeine (Acros); 1% dimethylformamide; or 75 μg/ml thiabendazole (Sigma), 1% dimethylformamide. Plasmids and Yeast Strain Construction—S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I. All strains are derivatives of JD51 (29Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrova H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A.

The SUMO lysine mutant alleles (smt3-R11,15,19, smt3-R15, smt3-R27, smt3-R38,40,41, smt3-R54,58, and smt3-allR) were constructed using an overlapping PCR strategy described previously (18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) to produce PCR products containing 500 bp of the SMT3 5′-flank followed by SMT3 containing Lys to Arg mutations followed by the TRP1 marker and then 500 bp of the SMT3 3′-flank. These PCR products were transformed into JD51, Trp+ diploids were sporulated, and the tetrads were dissected. Mutant alleles were reamplified and sequenced to confirm that they did not contain any additional mutations. smt3-(K to R) ulp2Δ double mutants were made by crossing SUMO mutants to GBY6, a MATα strain containing the ulp2Δ allele from IS30 (17Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), followed by sporulation and dissection of the tetrads. TOP2-HA-tagged strains were made by transforming the smt3-(K to R) ulp2Δ double mutants with a PCR product containing 500 bp of the C-terminal coding sequence of TOP2 followed by the HA epitope tag, the HIS3 marker, and 500 bp of the TOP2 3′-flank.Table IS. cerevisiae strainsNameRelevant genotypeSourceJD51MAT a/MATα trp1-Δ1/trp1-Δ1 ura3-52/ura3-52 his3-Δ200/his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 lys2-801/lys2-801Ref. 29Dohmen R.J.

Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). A truncated version of Siz1 (trSiz1), tagged with His8 and a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-derived epitope tag, was made by ligating a PCR-amplified fragment of Siz1 encoding Met313–Arg508 and bearing the C-terminal extension YTDIEMNRLGKHHHHHHHH into pET21a. Plasmids for expressing His6-tagged Smt3 lysine mutants in E. coli were constructed by amplifying the SMT3 sequence from genomic DNA of the corresponding yeast mutants with primers to add the N-terminal extension MASMHHHHHH and to produce a stop codon after Gly98. Resulting PCR products were ligated into pET21a. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm that they did not contain additional mutations. Oligo sequences and construction details are available upon request. A pGEM-based plasmid for expressing GST-Ulp2 (16Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Alaron Lewis and Mark Hochstrasser (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Antibodies and Immunoblot Analyses—Yeast whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (30Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting and chemiluminescent detection as described previously (18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal Ab against Smt3 (18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J.

Affinity Purification of Epitope-tagged Proteins—His6-SUMO, Ubc9-His6, and His6-Aos1/Uba2-His6 were expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described previously (8Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). VSV-G-His8-trSiz1 and Siz1-HF were expressed as described for Siz1-HF (8Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with 5 volumes of Y-PER (Pierce) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation to remove cell debris the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl plus 0.1 mm ZnCl2 and 5 mm imidazole and bound in-batch for 2 h at 4 °C to HIS-Select HC nickel affinity gel (Sigma). Proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole, 45 mm HEPES (pH 8), and 0.9 m NaCl. Septins were purified from EJY332, a yeast strain expressing Cdc12-HF, as described previously (8Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). GST and GST-Ulp2 were expressed and purified from E. coli JM101 cells using a modification of a described protocol (16Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Cells induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C were lysed under high pressure using an Avestin Emulsiflex C-5 in 1× PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) plus 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT. After centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, supernatant was bound in-batch to immobilized glutathione (Sigma) at 25 °C for 30 min. Beads were washed with 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm DTT and eluted with 15 mm glutathione, 60 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm DTT. Eluates were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 30% glycerol for 1 h at 4 °C using mini Slide-A-Lyzers (Pierce). In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—Sumoylation reactions were performed as described previously (8Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and contained ∼40 μg/ml wt or mutant Smt3, ∼5 μg/ml Uba2·Aos1, 3.5 μg/ml Ubc9, and ∼3 μg/ml trSiz1 or ∼12 μg/ml of the full-length Siz1 preparation, which contained primarily C-terminal fragments of Siz1 and E. coli proteins. Top2-HA Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitation of Top2-HA, cells were grown to A 600 ∼1 in rich medium at 30 °C followed by incubation with 15 μg/ml nocodazole (Acros) for 4 h at 30 °C. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described for isolation of Smt3 conjugates (16Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) except that cells were lysed using an Avestin Emulsiflex C-5 instead of by sonication. Clarified lysates were bound to anti-HA-agarose (Covance) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm NEM and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Ulp2 Cleavage of in Vitro Sumoylation Reactions—Sumoylation reactions containing recombinant Siz1-HF (see above) were incubated for 2.5 h at 30 °C and stopped by incubating with 25 mm glucose and 1 unit of hexokinase (Sigma) in a 26-μl reaction for 5 min at 28 °C. These samples were diluted 4-fold into new reactions to contain 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 175 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.125 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm imidazole, 1.25 μm ZnCl2. Then 2.5 μg/ml GST or the GST-Ulp2 preparation, which contained primarily free GST (∼90%), was added. In reactions with NEM or NEM plus DTT, the GST or GST-Ulp2 was preincubated with 10 mm NEM or 10 mm NEM plus 20 mm DTT for 15 min at 25 °C. Cleavage reactions proceeded for 3 h at 30 °C and were stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer. N-terminal Lysines Are Required for SUMO Chain Formation in Vitro—To identify the branch site(s) in SUMO chains that had been assembled in in vitro reactions containing Siz1, high molecular weight SUMO-containing species were excised from the top of an SDS-polyacrylamide resolving gel (much like Fig. 2B, lane 2), digested with trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C, and analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). A major peak was detected that was the correct size to contain the C-terminal tryptic peptide of SUMO covalently linked to the N-terminal peptide of SUMO up to Lys27. This experiment suggested that SUMO was attached to Lys11, Lys15, and/or Lys19 of SUMO but did not distinguish among them. Neither trypsin nor Lys-C cleaved after any of these lysine residues, which are all followed by prolines (Fig. 1). However, a similar experiment, using chains that were assembled by Uba2·Aos1 and Ubc9 alone and then cleaved with endoproteinase Glu-C, was published recently showing the major branch site to be at Lys15 (25Bencsath K.P.

A, there are nine lysines in Smt3 that fall into four groups. Mutant SUMOs were constructed by mutating one, all but one, or all groups of lysines to arginines.

The arrow above Smt3 designates the start position for the smt3-NΔ21 allele.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Yeast SUMO has a total of nine lysines that fall into four groups (Fig. 1). Three of these, Lys11, Lys15, and Lys19 are in the N-terminal non-Ub-like region and are part of a repeat sequence containing three tetrapeptide units resembling SUMO attachment consensus motifs. We decided to generate mutants lacking each of the nine lysines in yeast SUMO because preliminary experiments indicated that mutating only the N-terminal lysines, which were identified as potential branch sites by mass spectrometry, did not prevent formation of extremely high molecular weight SUMO conjugates in vitro (see below). Also we wanted to test thoroughly whether SUMO chains with different branch sites might have different functions in vivo. A series of SUMO mutants was constructed in which one group, all but one group, or all four groups of lysines were mutated to arginine. These mutants were expressed in E. coli, purified, and assayed in sumoylation reactions containing recombinant Aos1·Uba2 (E1), Ubc9 (E2), and trSiz1 (Fig. 2A). trSiz1 was used because full-length Siz1 was itself sumoylated and generated large amounts of high molecular weight conjugates that complicated analysis. Because these reactions did not contain any additional substrate, all SUMO-containing species larger than free SUMO contained SUMO attached either to itself (SUMO chains) or to the enzymes in the reaction. Wild-type SUMO formed a ladder of bands corresponding to SUMO chains (Fig. 2A, lane 3). This ladder was absent in all reactions containing SUMO mutants lacking Lys11, Lys15, and Lys19 (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 9–12). These results confirm that SUMO forms chains in vitro primarily via the N terminus (25Bencsath K.P. Podgorski M.S. Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol.

Complex I is composed of at least 46 structural subunits that are encoded in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Enzyme deficiency can result from either impaired catalytic efficiency or an inability to assemble the holoenzyme complex; however, the assembly process remains poorly understood. We have used two-dimensional Blue-Native/SDS gel electrophoresis and a panel of 11 antibodies directed against structural subunits of the enzyme to investigate complex I assembly in the muscle mitochondria from four patients with complex I deficiency caused by either mitochondrial or nuclear gene defects. Immunoblot analyses of second dimension denaturing gels identified seven distinct complex I subcomplexes in the patients studied, five of which could also be detected in nondenaturing gels in the first dimension. Although the abundance of these intermediates varied among the different patients, a common constellation of subcomplexes was observed in all cases. A similar profile of subcomplexes was present in a human/mouse hybrid fibroblast cell line with a severe complex I deficiency due to an almost complete lack of assembly of the holoenzyme complex. The finding that diverse causes of complex I deficiency produce a similar pattern of complex I subcomplexes suggests that these are intermediates in the assembly of the holoenzyme complex. We propose a possible assembly pathway for the complex, which differs significantly from that proposed for Neurospora, the current model for complex I assembly.

Using Blue-Native PAGE and a panel of antibodies specific for structural subunits of complex I, we identified a common set of complex I subcomplexes, and we propose a possible pathway for mammalian complex I assembly which differs significantly from that proposed for Neurospora.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCharacterization of Patients—At the time of biopsy, patient S was a 28-year-old male (described previously in Ref. 31Schwartz M. Vissing J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) who suffered from lifelong exercise intolerance. Cardiac and pulmonary functions were normal, and he was otherwise well. Both parents and a 23-year-old sister were healthy. The isolated myopathy was associated with severe lactic acidosis, and a muscle biopsy revealed the presence of ragged-red fibers. Biochemical analysis of the patient's muscle revealed a selective complex I deficiency (<10% of control), whereas complexes II–IV had normal activity. The analysis of mtDNA showed a heteroplasmic 2-bp deletion in the MTND2 gene (90% of mtDNA in the patient muscle carries the mutation) causing a premature stop codon, which predicts a truncated protein.At the time of biopsy, patient G was a 20-year-old male with a lifelong history of severe aerobic exercise intolerance associated with exertional dyspnea and tachycardia. Biochemical studies of patient muscle biopsy revealed a selective decrease in complex I activity (<20% of control), whereas other respiratory chain activities were normal. Histochemical analysis revealed normal mitochondrial staining, with no ragged-red fibers. The patient's sister (23 years old) also suffers from a pure myopathy and severe exercise intolerance. Myoblasts from both siblings showed slightly decreased complex I activity (75% of control); fibroblasts from both siblings showed no abnormality. Fusion of myoblasts from both siblings with 143B.TK– rho0 cells rescued the complex I deficiency, indicating that the defect in patient G and his sister is of nuclear origin.Patients B1 and B2 are brothers, 39 and 38 years old, respectively, at the time of biopsy. They both suffer from mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. Patient B1 had developmental problems, clumsiness, and borderline mental retardation since birth. He developed seizures at 19 years. Patient B2 has a lifelong history of learning disabilities. He had adult onset epilepsy and has a Wolff-Parkinson-White conduction defect. Muscle histochemistry showed ragged-red fibers in both patients, with increased SDH staining and no COX negative fibers. Complex I activity in muscle mitochondria from patient B1 was 11% and from patient B2 was 10% of the normal mean. All other respiratory chain enzyme activities were normal. Southern blot analysis of mtDNA from patient B1 muscle showed no evidence of a deletion, and sequencing of all the tRNA genes and all the mtDNA-encoded complex I genes showed no mutation. Low complex I activity was also found in fibroblasts from patient B1, and all other respiratory chain enzyme activities were normal. Fusion of patients fibroblasts with 143B.TK– rho0 cells rescued the complex I deficiency, indicating that the defect in patients B1 and B2 is of nuclear origin. Fusion of fibroblasts from patient B1 with fibroblasts from patient B2 showed low complex I in-gel activity, proving that they belong to the same genetic complementation group, as expected. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and protocols were approved by the relevant Institutional Review BoardsCell Lines—Primary skin fibroblasts were established from biopsy material and immortalized by transduction with retroviral vectors expressing the type 16 human papilloma virus E7 gene and the catalytic component of human telomerase (32Morales C.P.

The fibroblasts were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 110 mg/ml pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum. The LM.TK– rho0 mouse cell line (a kind gift of Dr. Eric Schon) was grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 110 mg/ml pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml uridine.Cell Fusion—LM.TK– rho0 cells were infected with a retroviral construct conferring resistance to puromycin (33Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Control fibroblasts were plated together with LM.TK– rho0 cells and fused 16 h later using polyethylene glycol-1500:Me2SO (40%:10%). The fused cells were selected in medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin and 400 μg/ml G-418 for 3 weeks.Muscle Tissue, Preparation of Mitochondria—Muscle biopsies from patients S, G, B1, and B2 and controls were obtained and stored frozen at –80 °C. Muscle homogenates (5%) prepared in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 600 × g to obtain postnuclear supernatant. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Methods—Mitoplasts were prepared by treatment with 0.8 mg (fibroblasts) or 1.2 mg (myoblasts) of digitonin/mg of protein, as described previously (35Klement P. Nijtmans L.G. Van den Bogert C. Houstek J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts or mitochondria were solubilized with 1% lauryl maltoside, and 10–20 μg of solubilized protein was used for electrophoresis. BN-PAGE (36Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar) was used for separation of samples in the first dimension on 6–15% or 5–12% polyacrylamide gradients. In-gel qualitative assays for complex I and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity were performed as described (37Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For the two-dimensional analysis, strips of the first dimension gel were incubated for 45 min in 1% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and then 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE was used to separate the proteins in the second dimension (38Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Respiratory complexes I–IV were detected by Western blot analysis using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Anti-COX IV, anti-complex II/70 kDa, anti-complex III/Core1, and complex I antibodies against subunits 30, 20, and 14 (Table I) were from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Other antibodies against complex I subunits were kindly provided by Dr. R. Capaldi (39, 15, and 8 kDa); Dr. B. Robinson (49 and 17 kDa), Dr. J. Walker (24 kDa), Dr. A. Lombes (ND1), and Dr. V.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSIdentification of Complex I Subcomplexes—BN-PAGE analysis of mitochondria from muscle biopsies of patients S, G, B1, and B2 showed decreased in-gel activity of complex I, whereas the activity of COX was normal (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis showed normal levels of immunodetectable COX, complex II (not shown), and complex III; however, fully assembled complex I was markedly decreased in all four patients (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, antibodies against both nuclear (39 and 49 kDa) and mitochondrial (ND1) subunits of complex I identified several common subcomplexes with apparent molecular masses of 250, 310, 380, 480, and 650 kDa (Fig. 1B, Table II). An additional subcomplex of about 830 kDa was seen only in patients B1 and B2. Although the pattern of the subcomplexes was similar in all four patients, the intensities of immunodetectable signals varied among the patients. The ratio between the unassembled (found in subcomplexes) and the fully assembled subunits in patients B1 and B2 was lower than in patients S and G, in whom the amount of ND1 and 49-kDa subunits in the subcomplexes was similar or higher than in the fully assembled complex.Table IISubunit composition of complex I subcomplexesSubcomplexMSaMS, molecular size.Subunit4939ND115302014182417bAntibody-detected pattern of the 17-kDa subunit presented as a streak and could not be assigned to any subcomplex.8kDaI200XXXII230XXXIII250XXXIV310XXXXV380XXXXXVI480XXXXXVII650XXXXXXXXXXFully assembled950XXXXXXXXXXXa MS, molecular size.b Antibody-detected pattern of the 17-kDa subunit presented as a streak and could not be assigned to any subcomplex. Open table in a new tab Subunit Composition of Complex I Subcomplexes—To determine the subunit composition of the complex I subcomplexes, we used a set of 11 antibodies directed against structural subunits of complex I (described under “Experimental Procedures”) in combination with two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis. Muscle mitochondria (20 μg of protein) from patient S were analyzed using BN-PAGE in the first dimension and Tricine/SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Fig. 2 shows markedly decreased amounts of individual subunits in the fully assembled complex I from the patient when compared with control. Seven distinguishable subcomplexes were present in patient S mitochondria (marked I–VII). In addition to the five subcomplexes described in the one-dimensional gels above, subcomplexes of molecular mass 230 and 200 kDa were identified (Table II). A largely similar pattern was seen in muscle mitochondria from patients G, B1 (Fig. 3), and B2 (data not shown), although the relative intensities varied. The specific 830-kDa subcomplex of patient B1 mitochondria contained all analyzed subunits (49, 39, 15, 30, 20, 14, and 18 kDa and ND1). In all patients, antibodies against subunits 49 and 30 kDa detected these subunits in all the subcomplexes except for subcomplex II. A similar pattern was found for subunit 39 kDa; however, it appeared more as a streak than strong individual subcomplexes. A second pattern was seen using antibodies to subunits 24, 20, and 18 kDa, which were present in subcomplexes II and VII. The 8-kDa subunit and ND1 also shared a similar pattern and were not present in the lower molecular mass subcomplexes. Although the 24-kDa antibody does detect some subcomplexes in the control, the ratio between the fully assembled enzyme and the subcomplexes is substantially higher than seen in the patient. The 14- and 15-kDa subunits were only detected in the 650-kDa subcomplex (VII) (and the 830-kDa subcomplex unique to patients B1 and B2), and the 17-kDa subunit formed a very weak streak that could not be linked to any of the subcomplexes. Subcomplexes of complex I were also detected in fibroblasts from patient B1 (data not shown); however, the intensities were markedly decreased in comparison with those seen in muscle mitochondria. In control mitochondria, a weak 650-kDa subcomplex could be detected with antibodies against the ND1 and 18-kDa subunits (Fig. 2); however, the other subcomplexes seen in the patients were not observed even after long exposure of the control immunoblot.Fig. 2Identification and subunit composition of complex I subcomplexes in patient S mitochondria. Control and patient S muscle mitochondria (20 μg of protein) were separated in the first dimension using BN-PAGE and in the second dimension using SDS-PAGE, and the presence of individual complex I subunits was determined by immunoblotting. The filled line marks the position of fully assembled complex I, and the dashed lines indicate subcomplexes I–VII.

Complementation of the biochemical phenotype in this experiment indicates a recessive nuclear gene defect. To test whether mouse nuclear genes could rescue human nuclear respiratory chain gene deficiencies, we previously carried out this experiment in several patient cell lines, but never observed complementation. In fact, fusion of a control human fibroblast line with mouse LM.TK– rho0 cells resulted in severely decreased COX and complex I activities. BN-PAGE analysis showed a strong dominant-negative effect of the mouse nucleus on complex I assembly, whereas complex II was normal (Fig. 4A). This phenotype does not arise from a loss of human chromosomes as Alu-FISH analysis shows a normal diploid chromosome number on metaphase spreads (data not shown). Rather, it appears to result from the dominant negative effects of specific mouse genes present in the human nuclear and mitochondrial background. Two-dimensional analysis of the fusion cells showed the presence of complex I subcomplexes (Fig. 4B) with apparent molecular masses of 650, 480, 380, 310, and 250 kDa, corresponding to subcomplexes III–VII. Almost no fully assembled complex could be detected in these cells, and the subunit pattern in the complex I subcomplexes was similar to that found in complex I patients.Fig. 4Identification of complex I subcomplexes in human/mouse hybrid cell line. Mitoplasts (20 μg of protein) isolated from control fibroblasts, the human/mouse hybrid line (control/LM.TK – rho0), and mouse rho0 cell line (LM.TK – rho0) were analyzed by BN-PAGE (A) and two-dimensional PAGE (B). As shown in A, a markedly decreased amount of fully assembled complex I was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies against complex I subunits 39 kDa and ND1. As shown in B, complex I subcomplexes were identified using antibodies against the complex I 49-kDa, 39-kDa, 15-kDa, and ND1 subunits. The filled lines indicate the positions of complex I (Co I), complex II (Co II), and complex III (Co III).

Pulse-chase labeling of mitochondrial proteins with [35S]methionine, together with BN-PAGE, allowed the identification of three intermediates in the assembly of COX in mammalian cells (40Nijtmans L.G.

https://openalex.org/W2031583642,"Mitochondria have been found to sequester and release Ca2+ during cell stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-generating agonists, thereby generating subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+ that sustain activity of capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). Procedures that prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibit local Ca2+ buffering and CCE, but it is not clear whether Ca2+ has to transit through or remains trapped in the mitochondria. Thus, we analyzed the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux on the ability of mitochondria to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+, to maintain CCE, and to facilitate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) refilling in endothelial cells. Upon the addition of histamine, the initial mitochondrial Ca2+ transient, monitored with ratio-metric-pericam-mitochondria, was largely independent of extracellular Ca2+. However, subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ produced a reversible decrease in [Ca2+]mito, indicating that Ca2+ was continuously taken up and released by mitochondria, although [Ca2+]mito had returned to basal levels. Accordingly, inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with CGP 37157 increased [Ca2+]mito and abolished the ability of mitochondria to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+, resulting in an increased activity of BKCa channels and a decrease in CCE. Hence, CGP 37157 also reversibly inhibited ER refilling during cell stimulation. These effects of CGP 37157 were mimicked if mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was prevented with oligomycin/antimycin A. Thus, during cell stimulation a continuous Ca2+ flux through mitochondria underlies the ability of mitochondria to generate subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+, to facilitate CCE, and to relay Ca2+ from the plasma membrane to the ER. Mitochondria have been found to sequester and release Ca2+ during cell stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-generating agonists, thereby generating subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+ that sustain activity of capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). Procedures that prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibit local Ca2+ buffering and CCE, but it is not clear whether Ca2+ has to transit through or remains trapped in the mitochondria. Thus, we analyzed the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux on the ability of mitochondria to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+, to maintain CCE, and to facilitate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) refilling in endothelial cells. Upon the addition of histamine, the initial mitochondrial Ca2+ transient, monitored with ratio-metric-pericam-mitochondria, was largely independent of extracellular Ca2+. However, subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ produced a reversible decrease in [Ca2+]mito, indicating that Ca2+ was continuously taken up and released by mitochondria, although [Ca2+]mito had returned to basal levels. Accordingly, inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with CGP 37157 increased [Ca2+]mito and abolished the ability of mitochondria to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+, resulting in an increased activity of BKCa channels and a decrease in CCE. Hence, CGP 37157 also reversibly inhibited ER refilling during cell stimulation. These effects of CGP 37157 were mimicked if mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was prevented with oligomycin/antimycin A. Thus, during cell stimulation a continuous Ca2+ flux through mitochondria underlies the ability of mitochondria to generate subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+, to facilitate CCE, and to relay Ca2+ from the plasma membrane to the ER. Mitochondria have been found to contribute to cellular Ca2+ homeostasis in many cell types by taking up and releasing Ca2+, thereby propagating and synchronizing Ca2+ signals (1Jouaville L.S.

Notably, mitochondria are often strategically located near Ca2+ release channels on the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BKCa, large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels; BHQ, 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone; [Ca2+]cyto, free cytosolic Ca2+; [Ca2+]pm, Ca2+ concentration at the inner side of the patch membrane; CCE, capacitative Ca2+ entry; CGP 37157, 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhyrazone; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; mtDsRed, mitochondrial-targeted DsRed; P o, open state probability of single BKCa channels; RP-mt, mitochondrial-targeted ratiometric-pericam; V applied, applied holding potential; V pm, effective potential of the patch; V wc, whole cell membrane potential; YC4-ER, ER-targeted yellow chameleon 4; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. or Ca2+ influx channels on the plasma membrane. This close connection allows mitochondria to capture a substantial fraction of the Ca2+ flowing through release or influx channels, and to generate microdomains of low Ca2+ near the mouth of these channels (5Rizzuto R.

Paradoxically, despite this close contact to Ca2+ sources, the mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]mito) increases only transiently during cell stimulation and returns rapidly to base line, regardless of the long lasting elevations in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyto) (9Rizzuto R.

The transient nature of mitochondrial Ca2+ signals is surprising, as the subplasmalemmal microdomains of low Ca2+ generated around Ca2+ influx pathways can be maintained for extended periods (6Hoth M.

Such long lasting microdomains have been postulated to underlie mitochondrial modulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), which is activated by emptying of the ER either by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) or by SERCA inhibition (17Putney J.J. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 18Putney J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the channel(s) responsible for CCE are still under investigation, CCE has been clearly demonstrated to be prevented by enhanced [Ca2+]cyto at the inner gate of the channel (6Hoth M.

Inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, either by mitochondrial depolarization or by inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, prevents the maintenance of CCE (12Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S.

Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that mitochondria maintain a low subplasmalemmal Ca2+ at the mouth of this Ca2+-inhibitable, Ca2+-entry pathway (20Duchen M.R. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, to account for the long lasting activation of CCE, the microdomain of low Ca2+ generated by mitochondria must be maintained for several minutes. The existence of such long lasting microdomains of low Ca2+ could be demonstrated directly under physiological conditions by using a combined approach of single channel recordings and high resolution confocal microscopy (21Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that, despite the short lasting [Ca2+]mito increase, mitochondria can generate sustained microdomains of low Ca2+ in the subplasmalemmal region. However, it is unclear whether mitochondria act as a Ca2+ sink or as a Ca2+ relay mechanism, or whether the increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ per se is an essential step in the activation of the CCE as suggested recently (22Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inter-organelle Ca2+ cross-talk between the ER and the mitochondria has also been described in both non-excitable and excitable cells (23Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh J.V.J. Demaurex N.

Therefore, the goal of this work is to elucidate the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis during cell stimulation in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived cell line EA.hy926. Materials—Cell culture chemicals were from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum was obtained from PAA Laboratories (Linz, Austria). Fura-2/AM and JC-1 were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). CGP 37157 (7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one) was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Northpoint, Avonmouth, Bristol, UK). Oligomycin, antimycin A, 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ), carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhyrazone (FCCP), and histamine were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany), and the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). All other chemicals were from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Cell Culture—The human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, EA.hy926 (29Edgell C.J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% HAT (5 mm hypoxanthine, 20 μm aminopterin, 0.8 mm thymidine). For experiments cells were grown on glass coverslips. Plasmids and Transfection—For double transfection YC4-ER (Cam4-ER) (30Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y.

A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and mtDsRed were cloned into the two multiple cloning sites of the transfection vector pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen). Alternatively, RP-mt (32Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), YC4-ER, and mtDsRed were inserted into pcDNA 3 for single transfection (Invitrogen). Cells (∼80% confluency) were transiently transfected with 1.5–3 μg of purified plasmid DNA using Trans-Fast™ Transfection Reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Organelle Visualization—Organelle organization was visualized in cells transiently transfected with YC4-ER, mtDsRed, or RP-mt as described previously (33Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional scans for visualization of the distribution of RP-mt was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M (Zeiss Microsystems, Jena, Germany) equipped with VoxCell Scan® (Visi-Tech, Sunderland, UK) and controlled by Metamorph 5.0 (Universal Imaging, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Image deconvolution was done using the quick maximum likelihood estimation with Huygens 2.4. (SVI, Hilversum, Netherlands), and image restoration was performed using Imaris 3.3. (Bitplane AG., Zürich, Switzerland). Ca2+ Measurements—Cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]cyto, [Ca2+]ER, and [Ca2+]mito) were measured using fura-2, YC4-ER, and RP-mt with high resolution imaging system as described previously (33Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Thyagarajan B. Malli R. Schmidt K. Graier W.F. Groschner K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To monitor [Ca2+]cyto, [Ca2+]ER, or [Ca2+]mito, cells were illuminated alternatively at 340 ± 15 and 380 ± 15 nm (fura-2, 340HT15 and 380HT15; Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT), 440 nm (YC4-ER, 440AF21; Omega Optical) and 410/433 and 485 nm (RP-mt, 433DF15 and 485DF15; Omega Optical), respectively. Emission was monitored at 510 nm (510WB40, Omega Optical) for fura-2, 480 and 535 nm for YC4-ER (480AF30, Omega Optical), or at 535 nm for RP-mt (535AF26, Omega Optical). For YC4-ER measurements an optical beam splitter (480 and 535 nm; Dual-View Micro-Imager™, Optical Insights, Visitron Systems) was used in order to allow simultaneous rationing with one given camera. The following buffers were used: Ca2+/Hepes-buffered solution containing (in mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 Ca2Cl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes acid; pH was adjusted to 7.4, and a nominal Ca2+-free solution containing (in mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA and 10 Hepes acid, pH adjusted to 7.4. Patch Clamp Recordings—The cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique was used as described previously (21Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using a pipette solution containing (in mm) 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with KOH). Current recordings were performed with an EPC-7 amplifier (List Medical, Darmstadt, Germany) and were filtered at 1 kHz (900C9L8L, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), and currents were sampled by a personal computer running with pClamp 8.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at 5 kHz. Single currents were analyzed with Fetchan and pStat (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The P o was normalized in respect to the number of channels in the patch (N)as follows: normalized P o = (t o1 + 2t o2 + 3t o3 +... + Nt oN)/Nt, where t oN is the time spent by a channel at the open level N. The BKCa channels were utilized to monitor subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration as described previously (21Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this work the physiological patch protocol was used that allowed free change of the cell membrane potential during stimulation. The bath solutions contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 8 Hepes (pH 7.45 with NaOH). As explained in detail previously (21Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the Ca2+ concentration at the mouth of the BKCa channel ([Ca2+]pm) was calculated under physiological conditions (i.e. no clamp of the cell membrane potential; V pm) according to Equation 1, log[Ca2+]pm=logEC50Ca-logPo(max)-PoPo+Po(min)(Eq. 1) where log EC50Ca is -5.566 (EC50Ca is Ca2+ sensitivity of the BKCa channel), P o(max) is the maximal P o, and P o(min) is the minimal P o measured in the respective experiments. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) was measured fluorometrically with JC-1 as described previously (34Thyagarajan B. Malli R. Schmidt K. Graier W.F. Groschner K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 5 μm JC-1 for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, washed twice, and mounted in a customized superfusion chamber. JC-1 fluorescence was alternatively monitored at 485 (485DF15; Omega Optical) and 575 nm (575DF25) and 528 and 633 nm emission (528–633DBEN; Omega Optical). Statistics—Analysis of variance and Scheffe's post hoc F test were used for evaluation of the statistical significance. p < 0.05 was determined to be significant. Measurements of Mitochondrial Ca2+ Signals with the Targeted Ca2+ Sensor RP-mt in Endothelial Cell—Mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling in response to an IP3-generating agonist, such as histamine (100 μm), markedly differs from that obtained in the cytoplasm and the ER. In the cytosol and the ER, the Ca2+ concentrations rapidly change in response to cell stimulation and stay high (cytosol, [Ca2+]cyto) or low (ER, [Ca2+]ER) as long as the stimulus is present (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to these long lasting changes in [Ca2+]cyto and [Ca2+]ER, mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]mito) increases only transiently even if the agonist has not been washed out (Fig. 1C). These experiments were conducted by transfection of the mitochondria-targeted Ca2+-sensory protein RP-mt (32Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) that revealed a distinct structure of the mitochondrial network in endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). Stimulation with 100 μm histamine transiently increased [Ca2+]mito to levels that were similar regardless of the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Notably, while in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ the [Ca2+]mito returned to basal level, and in the nominal absence of free extracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]mito decreased under the base line even in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 2B). Moreover, removal of extracellular Ca2+ after the initial Ca2+ transient caused a decrease in [Ca2+]mito, whereas the subsequent readdition of Ca2+ raised [Ca2+]mito back to basal levels (Fig. 2C). Because the removal of extracellular Ca2+ did not initiate such a drop in [Ca2+]mito in resting cells (Fig. 2B), these data indicate that Ca2+ fluxes across the mitochondria increased during stimulation, rendering [Ca2+]mito stringently dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. This suggests that, during cell stimulation, part of the Ca2+ entering the cell transits through mitochondria. Trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ Flux Occurs during Cell Stimulation—To test whether Ca2+ transits through mitochondria during stimulation, we used 20 μm CGP 37157, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCXmito). In the presence of 20 μm CGP 37157, 100 μm histamine initiated a long lasting elevation of [Ca2+]mito that did not return to base line upon agonist washout (Fig. 3A), indicating that Ca2+ was retained in the mitochondria. In resting cells 20 μm CGP 37157 failed to increase [Ca2+]mito within 3 min (data not shown), indicating that Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria was increased during agonist stimulation. More importantly, addition of 20 μm CGP 37157 after the transient increase, at a time when [Ca2+]mito had returned to basal levels, resulted in a slow but long lasting rise in [Ca2+]mito that reached a plateau after ∼3 min in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, CGP 37157 failed to elevate [Ca2+]mito when applied after the initial transient (data not shown). These data indicate that in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria remained increased throughout the agonist application but was balanced by an increased efflux of Ca2+ from mitochondria. The effects of CGP 37157 were not due to alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) as 20 μm CGP 37157 did not affect the fluorescence of the potentiometric indicator JC-1 (data not shown). Trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ Flux Critically Depends on Extracellular Na + —Because inhibition of the NCXmito by CGP 37157 prevented Ca2+ transfer across the mitochondria, the importance of extracellular Na+ as a source for Na+ influx that facilitates NCXmito activity was tested. In low extracellular Na+ conditions (i.e. 5 mm), the decline of [Ca2+]mito after the initial increase in response to 100 μm histamine was slow and was accelerated by increasing the extracellular Na+ concentration to normal values (i.e. 130 mm; Fig. 3C). Inhibition of NCX mito Prevents the Generation of Subplasmalemmal Microdomains of Low Ca2+—The ability of mitochondria to generate local microdomains of low Ca2+ (i.e. mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering) was found to depend on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (22Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine whether concomitant Ca2+ extrusion is also required, we investigated the effect of CGP 37157 on mitochondrial “Ca2+ buffering” under physiological patch conditions where hyperpolarization-facilitated Ca2+ entry occurs (21Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By using the physiological patch technique the cell is allowed to manipulate its membrane potential freely as the cell membrane potential is not clamped but a compensatory patch potential is applied that facilitates monitoring of single BKCa channels at around +40 mV patch potential (for further details see Ref. 21Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As a result of this approach, the local subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration under the patch (patch Ca2+ concentration; [Ca2+]pm) in the vicinity of mitochondria can be estimated by the activity of BKCa channels, whereas the cell hyperpolarization upon stimulation occurs that in turn provides the driving force to facilitate CCE. Endothelial cells were transiently transfected with the transfection vector pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen) encoding YC-4ER and mtDsRed, and the patch pipette was placed in the proximity and within distance to the mitochondria (Fig. 4A). In control cells, 100 μm histamine initiated a biphasic activation of plasma membrane BKCa channels (Fig. 4B , upper panel) that was accompanied by a long lasting cell hyperpolarization (Fig. 4B , middle panel). For further analysis, the initial transient phase (P1), which reflects Ca2+ release and early CCE, and the long lasting plateau phase (P2), which reflects mainly influx at the plasma membrane, were separately evaluated (Table I). Therefore, mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering became visible by the very limited elevation of [Ca2+]pm of about 0.25 and 0.10 μm in P1 and P2, respectively (Fig. 4B , lower panel; Table I).Table IInhibition of trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux by CGP 37157 weakened mitochondrial Ca2+ bufferingP1P2No. exp.No. channelsNormalized P oV WC[Ca2+]pmNormalized P oV WC[Ca2+]pmmVμmmVμmClose to mitochondria 82.3 ± 0.60.073 ± 0.024-59.2 ± 6.00.25 ± 0.070.038 ± 0.017-57.2 ± 6.10.10 ± 0.03Close to mitochondria + CGP 37157 42.0 ± 1.00.419 ± 0.092ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria-53.9 ± 4.81.34 ± 0.58ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria0.184 ± 0.050ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria-52.5 ± 5.00.40 ± 0.18ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondriaFar from mitochondria 143.2 ± 0.50.444 ± 0.044ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria-58.6 ± 1.74.51 ± 1.07ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria0.280 ± 0.046ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria-57.1 ± 1.91.21 ± 0.20ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondriaFar from mitochondria + CGP 37157 62.8 ± 1.00.420 ± 0.108ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria-59.9 ± 0.92.08 ± 0.87ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria0.308 ± 0.103ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria-50.7 ± 0.70.48 ± 0.25ap < 0.05 versus next to mitochondriaa p < 0.05 versus next to mitochondria Open table in a new tab In the presence of 20 μm CGP 37157, histamine induced an ∼7 times higher activation of BKCa channels than that in the absence of CGP 37157 (Fig. 4C , upper panel; Table I). The cell hyperpolarization was similar to that in the controls (Fig. 4C , middle panel). The lack of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering was strikingly shown by the large elevations in [Ca2+]pm to 1.34 and 0.40 μm in P1 and P2, respectively (Fig. 4C , lower panel; Table I; Fig. 4D , left panel). In contrast, if the pipette was located away from superficial mitochondria domains, 20 μm CGP 37157 failed to affect BKCa channel activation/[Ca2+]pm elevation in response to 100 μm histamine compared with experiments carried out in the absence of CGP 37157 (Table I). Moreover, CGP 37157 (20 μm) had no effect if Ca2+ influx through the CCE pathway was prevented by cell depolarization using the standard patch clamp technique (23Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh J.V.J. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Finally, 20 μm CGP 37157 had no effect on Ca2+-triggered BKCa channel activation/activity in inside-out patches (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that CGP 37157 does not affect BKCa activation/activity but prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering by inhibition of NCXmito. Trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ Flux Is Essential for Maintenance of CCE Activity—To elucidate the importance of trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux for CCE, we assessed the effects of uncoupling agents such as carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone and FCCP (6Hoth M.

The phosphoprotein of measles virus is a modular protein consisting of an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (Karlin, D., Longhi, S., Receveur, V., and Canard, B. (2002) Virology 296, 251–262) and of a C-terminal moiety (PCT) composed of alternating disordered and globular regions. We report the crystal structure of the extreme C-terminal domain (XD) of measles virus phosphoprotein (aa 459–507) at 1.8 Å resolution. We have previously reported that the C-terminal domain of measles virus nucleoprotein, NTAIL, is intrinsically unstructured and undergoes induced folding in the presence of PCT (Longhi, S., Receveur-Brechot, V., Karlin, D., Johansson, K., Darbon, H., Bhella, D., Yeo, R., Finet, S., and Canard, B. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 18638–18648). Using far-UV circular dichroism, we show that within PCT, XD is the region responsible for the induced folding of NTAIL. The crystal structure of XD consists of three helices, arranged in an anti-parallel triple-helix bundle. The surface of XD formed between helices α2 and α3 displays a long hydrophobic cleft that might provide a complementary hydrophobic surface to embed and promote folding of the predicted α-helix of NTAIL. We present a tentative model of the interaction between XD and NTAIL. These results, beyond presenting the first measles virus protein structure, shed light both on the function of the phosphoprotein at the molecular level and on the process of induced folding.

Its non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is packaged by the viral nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid. Mononegavirales use this N-RNA complex as a template for both transcription and replication. These reactions are carried out by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase polymerase (L) in conjuction with the phosphoprotein (P) (for a review see Ref. 1Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1305-1340Google Scholar). During genome replication, synthesis of viral RNA and encapsidation by N are concomitant (1Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed.

Virol. 2001; 75: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The P protein of Paramyxovirinae plays multiple roles in both transcription and replication, being an indispensable subunit of the viral polymerase complex and being responsible for binding and delivery of N0 to the newly synthesized genomic RNA. P is a modular protein, organized into two moieties functionally and structurally distinct: a poorly conserved N-terminal moiety (PNT), which is intrinsically unstructured (23Karlin D. Longhi S. Receveur V. Canard B. Virology. 2002; 296: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and a well conserved C-terminal moiety (PCT). PCT contains all the regions required for transcription (14Curran J. Virology. 1996; 221: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas PNT provides several additional functions required for replication (10Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. J.

Virol. 1995; 76: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Paramyxovirinae PCT share three common features: (i) oligomerization through a coiled-coil region, (ii) the presence at the extreme C terminus of a short predicted bundle of three α-helices, which is involved in binding to N (27Curran J. Boeck R. Lin-Marq N. Lupas A. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1995; 214: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and (iii) the presence of an L binding site (28Smallwood S. Ryan K.W. Moyer S.A.

The P protein of the related Sendai virus (SeV), a member of the Respirovirus genus, is tetrameric, whereas the oligomeric state of MV P is unknown (21Harty R.N. Palese P. J. Gen.

Experimental data available suggest that SeV P participates in both transcription and replication in its multimeric form, being tetrameric when complexed with both L (10Curran J. Marq J.B.

Deletion of the extreme C-terminal domain of SeV PCT (aa 479–568) abolishes binding to NNUC, as well as stable binding to N0 (10Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. J.

Virology. 1994; 202: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The SeV P gene contains an in-frame internal ribosomal entry site which is used to produce the C-terminal part of the P protein (30Curran J. Kolakofsky D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2869-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Curran J. Boeck R. Kolakofsky D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This internal translation product is named protein X and encompasses aa 474–568 (12Ryan K.W. Portner A. Virology. 1990; 174: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although SeV protein X encompasses an N binding site, stable binding of protein X on nucleocapsid determined by sedimentation through a caesium chlorure gradient could not be observed (12Ryan K.W. Portner A. Virology. 1990; 174: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Within the MV PCT gene region there are three in-frame AUG codons at amino acid positions 371, 422, and 446, but whether one of them is used to initiate translation of a protein X is unknown. The only structural information available so far concerns MV PNT (23Karlin D. Longhi S. Receveur V. Canard B. Virology. 2002; 296: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and SeV PCT. The structure of a slightly shortened form (aa 320–433) of the multimerization domain of SeV (P, aa 317–445) has been solved by x-ray crystallography (32Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It forms a very stable coiled-coil buttressed by a bundle of three short α-helices. The structure of the protein X of SeV (aa 474–568) has been solved by NMR (33Marion D. Tarbouriech N. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Blanchard L. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 75-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is monomeric and consists of a flexible linker (aa 474–517) fused to the X domain (XD) (aa 517–568). This linker is probably conserved also in MV PCT, as suggested by its high protease sensitivity (16Longhi S. Receveur-Brechot V. Karlin D. Johansson K. Darbon H. Bhella D. Yeo R. Finet S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18638-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that MV PCT is responsible for the induced folding of NTAIL (16Longhi S. Receveur-Brechot V. Karlin D. Johansson K. Darbon H. Bhella D. Yeo R. Finet S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18638-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The induced folding of NTAIL in the presence of its physiological partner opens new perspectives in the structural study of disordered regions within the MV replicative complex. Indeed, the gain of structure arising from the interaction with PCT may lead to the formation of a complex rigid enough to be crystallized. Furthermore, although natively unfolded proteins have been receiving increased interest in the last few years, the molecular bases of the disordered-to-ordered transitions are still unknown. To identify precisely the PCT regions involved in the induced folding of NTAIL and to characterize structurally these complexes, we have analyzed the domain organization of MV P. In this paper, we report the bacterial expression and purification of the extreme C-terminal domain, XD (aa 459–507), of MV P. We show that MV NTAIL undergoes induced folding in the presence of XD. We report the crystal structure of XD at 1.8 Å resolution, which represents the first measles protein structure to be solved. Finally, we present a tentative model of the interaction between XD and NTAIL, which casts light on this widespread and still structurally undefined protein-protein mode of interaction. Bacterial Strains and Media—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Stratagene) was used for selection and amplification of DNA constructs. The E. coli strain C41 [DE3] (Avidis) was used for expression of recombinant XD. E. coli was grown in Luria-Bertani medium. Cloning of the XD Coding Region—The XD gene construct, encoding residues 459–507 of the MV P protein (strain Edmonston B) with a hexahistidine tag fused to its C terminus, was obtained by PCR using pET21a/PH6 (23Karlin D. Longhi S. Receveur V. Canard B. Virology. 2002; 296: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as template and Pfu polymerase (Promega). Forward primer (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGGCATCACGCAGTGTAATCCGCTCC-3′) was designed to introduce an AttB1 site (bold), whereas reverse primer (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTTATTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCTTCATTATTATCTTCACCAGCAT-3′) was designed to introduce an AttB2 site (bold) and a hexahistidine tag (underlined) at the C terminus of XD. Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. After purification (PCR purification kit, Qiagen), the PCR product was cloned into the pDest14 vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). The final construct is referred to as pDest14/XDH6. The sequence of the coding region was checked by sequencing (MilleGen). Expression and Purification of XD—E. coli strain C41[DE3] (Avidis) was used for the expression of the pDest14/XDH6 construct. Because the MV P gene contains several rare codons that are used with a very low frequency in E. coli, co-expression of pDest14/XDH6 with the plasmid pLysS (Novagen) was carried out. This plasmid, which supplies six rare tRNAs, also carries the lysozyme gene, thus allowing a tight regulation of the expression of the recombinant gene, as well as a facilitated lysis. Cultures were grown overnight to saturation in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 17 μg/ml chloramphenicol. An aliquot of the overnight culture was diluted 1/25 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C. At OD600 of 0.7, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cells were grown at 37 °C for 3 h. The induced cells were harvested, washed, and collected by centrifugation. The resulting pellets were frozen at –20 °C. Expression of seleno-methionine-substituted XD was performed using the method of methionine biosynthesis pathway inhibition (34Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The pellet containing XD was resuspended in 5 volumes (v/w) buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with lysozyme 0.1 mg/ml, DNase I 10 μg/ml, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) (50 μl/gr cells). After a 20-min incubation with gentle agitation, the cells were disrupted by sonication (using a 750 W sonicator and 5 cycles of 30 s each at 60% power output). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Starting from a one-liter culture, the clarified supernatant was incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking with 4 ml Talon resin (Clontech) previously equilibrated in buffer A. The resin was washed with buffer A, and XD was eluted in buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of XD. The fractions containing XD were combined and concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 (molecular cutoff = 5000 Da) (Millipore). The protein was then loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in either 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl or 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, and 5 mm EDTA. The protein was stored at –20 °C. Purification of the seleno-methionine protein was performed as described above. Expression and purification of NTAIL and PNT was carried out as already described (16Longhi S. Receveur-Brechot V. Karlin D. Johansson K. Darbon H. Bhella D. Yeo R. Finet S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18638-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Karlin D. Longhi S. Receveur V. Canard B. Virology. 2002; 296: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All purification steps, except for gel filtrations, were carried out at 4 °C. Apparent molecular mass of proteins eluted from the gel filtration column was deduced from a calibration carried out with LMW and HMW calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were calculated either using the theoretical absorption coefficient ϵ (mg/ml/cm) at 280 nm (as obtained by using the program ProtParam at the EXPASY server) or the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed with a Dynapro MSTC-200 (Protein Solutions) at 20 °C. Samples of XD (7 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl) were filtered prior to the measurements (Millex 0.22 μm syringe filters, Millipore). The hydrodynamic radius was deduced from translational diffusion coefficients using the Stokes-Einstein equation. Diffusion coefficients were inferred from the analysis of the decay of the scattered intensity autocorrelation function. All calculations were performed using the software provided by the manufacturer. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 810 dichrograph using 1-mm thick quartz cells in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, at 20 °C. Structural variations of NTAIL were measured as a function of changes in the initial CD spectrum upon addition of different amounts of either XD or PNT. CD spectra were measured between 185 and 260 nm at 0.2 nm/min and were averaged from three independent acquisitions. Mean ellipticity values per residue ([Θ]) were calculated as [Θ] = 3300 m ΔA/(l·c·n), where l (path length) = 0.1 cm, n = number of residues, m = molecular mass in daltons, and c = protein concentration expressed in mg/ml. Number of residues (n) were 56 for XD, 139 for NTAIL, and 236 for PNT, whereas m values were 8,600 Da for XD, 15,300 Da for NTAIL, and 24,800 Da for PNT. Protein concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml were used. When recording spectra of protein mixtures, mean ellipticity values per residue ([Θ]) were calculated as [Θ] = 3300 ΔA/{[(C1·n 1)/m1) + (C2·n 2/m2)]·l}, where l (path length) = 0.1 cm, n 1 or n 2 = number of residues, m1 or m2 = molecular mass in daltons, and c1 or c2 = protein concentration expressed in mg/ml for each of the two proteins in the mixture. The theoretical average ellipticity values per residue ([Θ]Ave), expected assuming that neither any unstructured-to-structured transition nor any secondary structure rearrangement occur, were calculated as follows: [Θ]Ave = [([Θ]1·n 1) + ([Θ]2·n 2R)]/(n 1 + n 2R), where [Θ]1 and [Θ]2 correspond to the measured mean ellipticity values per residue, n 1 and n 2 to the number of residues for each of the two proteins, and R to the excess molar ratio of protein 2. The α-helical content was derived from the ellipticity at 220 nm as described in Ref. 35Morris M.C. Mery J. Heitz A. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Pept. Sci. 1999; 5: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Crystallization experiments were performed immediately after protein purification. Screening experiments were performed using the nanodrop approach (36Sulzenbacher G. Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Spinelli S. Valencia C. Pagot F. Vincentelli R. Bignon C. Salomoni A. Grisel S. Maurin D. Huyghe C. Johansson K. Grassick A. Roussel A. Bourne Y. Perrier S. Miallau L. Cantau P. Blanc E. Genevois M. Grossi A. Zenatti A. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2109-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with three commercial kits: Structure Screens 1 and 2, Stura Footprint Screen (both from Molecular Dimensions Ltd.), and Wizard Screens I and II (Emerald BioStructures). The screens were set up in 8 × 12-well Greiner crystallization plates for sitting drops, with three shelves for each well. Reservoir solutions were 200 μl in volume and crystallization drops were composed of 100, 200, or 300 nl of protein solution at 7.5 mg/ml and 100 nl of reservoir solution. The crystallization plates were sealed with transparent film after set-up of the drops and transferred to a storage cabinet at 20 °C. Crystallization of the SeMet protein was performed by doing a refinement of the conditions initially found for the native form, but this time using the hanging drop method. Crystallization drops were made by mixing 3 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of mother liquor, which were then left for equilibration at 20 °C. Crystals typically grew within 48 h to a size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm3. Final crystallization conditions were 0.1 m 2-n-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES), pH 8.5, and 1.25 m sodium citrate. The x-ray diffraction data on the SeMet XD were collected to a resolution of 1.8 Å on beamline ID14–2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, using an ADSC Q4 charged-coupled device-based detector. Crystals were cryo-cooled to a temperature of 100°K by an Oxford Cryostream system. As the concentration of sodium citrate was sufficiently high to serve as cryo-protectant in itself, crystals were cryo-cooled without any additional cryo-protectant. The wavelength at the beamline was 0.933 Å, which was off by a few hundreds of an Å on the high-energy side of the selenium K-edge, which was at 0.979 Å. As the anomalous contribution is still significant (f ″∼ 3.5) at this “remote” wavelength, we could solve the structure by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method. The data were indexed, merged, and scaled using the programs Mosflm and Scala (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4). The asymmetric unit contains one molecule, which corresponds to a solvent content of 49%. As the protein sequence contains four methionines (of 55 residues), including the N-terminal Met, the heavy atom search could directly be narrowed down to a maximum of four selenium sites. Structure Determination and Refinement—For the initial heavy atom search, the program Solve (37Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) was used in the SAD mode with a resolution cut-off of 3 Å. This allowed us to locate three of the four possible selenium sites. The sites were then refined further using the analyze_solve option in Solve, and phasing was performed to the maximum resolution of 1.8 Å. Subsequently, solvent flattening was performed by using the program Resolve (38Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which produced an electron density map that could be interpreted as being a protein. The phases after density modification were input as initial phases to the program ARP/wARP (39Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar, 40Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which then performed iterative automatic tracing of the density map, model building, and structure refinement in combination with Refmac5 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4). This produced an electron density map of outstanding quality as well as an almost complete model of the protein, with all but one of the side chains in the final model already in sequence (R/R free = 21/26%). 5% of the reflections were used for R free calculations. Maximum-likelihood refinement was performed with the program Refmac5. By inspection of 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc σA electron density maps, the model was built using the program O (41Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Building of the solvent structure was performed using ARP/wARP. At the final stages of refinement, a strong difference density was still unaccounted for in a position between molecules in the crystal lattice. By inspecting its shape, it was interpreted to be a molecule of CHES that was present in the crystallization media, and was refined as such. Model Minimization—Energy computations of the XD/NTAIL model were done with the GROMOS96 implementation of Swiss PDB Viewer (42van Gunsteren W.F. Hünenberojer P.H. Mark A.E. Smith P.E. Tironi I.G.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). 200 steps of steepest descent followed by 20 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization were performed. Modular Organization of P—The P protein of MV consists of an N-terminal moiety, PNT (aa 1–230), which is responsible for binding to NCORE within the N0-P complex (21Harty R.N. Palese P. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and of a C-terminal moiety, PCT (aa 231–507), which is responsible for binding to NTAIL in both N0-P and NNUC-P complexes (9Huber M.

The “gatekeepers” of the long, ATP-inhibited KIR6.0 pores of KATP channels are ABC proteins, SURs, receptors for channel opening and closing drugs. Several competing models for SUR/KIR coupling exist. We show that SUR TMD0, the N-terminal bundle of five transmembrane helices, specifically associates with KIR6.2, forcing nearly silent pores to burst like native KATP channels and enhancing surface expression. Inclusion of adjacent submembrane residues of L0, the linker between TMD0 and the stimulatory nucleotide- and drug-binding ABC core, generates constitutively active channels, whereas additional cytoplasmic residues counterbalance this activation establishing a relationship between the mean open and burst times of intact pores. SUR fragments, lacking TMD0, fail to modulate KIR. TMD0 is thus the domain that anchors SUR to the KIR pore. Consistent with data on chimeric ABCC/KIRs and a modeled channel structure, we propose that interactions of TMD0-L0 with the outer helix and N terminus of KIR bidirectionally modulate gating.

Assembly with SURs increases surface expression, the P O(max), and sensitivity to inhibitory ATP, and induces responsiveness to stimulatory MgADP, KATP openers, inhibitory sulfonylureas, and other insulin secretagogues (6Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ATP acts through the KIR cytoplasmic domains to close the pore, while MgADP acts through the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) in the ABC core to stimulate the channel (5Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M.

The recent structure of a related ABC transporter shows the SUR core (gray in Fig. 1A) consists of two bundles of six transmembrane helices (TMDs) fused to NBDs (12Chang G. J. Mol.

Here we used SUR fragments to generate “mini-KATP” that validate our original model (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol.

Molecular Biology—The N-terminal HA-tagged and C-terminal myc-tagged SUR1 constructs were generated starting with hamster SUR1 (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) using standard subcloning methods. Two copies of the myc epitope were inserted in the extracellular segment between SUR1 transmembrane helices 12 and 13 using a unique Bpu1102 site as described previously (18Sharma N. Crane A.

The constructs were co-expressed with human KIR6.2ΔC35, and green fluorescent protein as a transfection marker, in COSm6 cells as described previously (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human MRP1 was a kind gift from Susan Cole and Roger Deeley. Immunoprecipitation—COSm6 cells were transfected by electroporation with HA-TMD0, KIR6.2-myc, or both plasmids. After 24 h cells were starved for 1.5 h in methionine-free medium then grown in medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 3 h before lysis in 1% digitonin in phosphate-buffered saline plus protease inhibitors. Clarified lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min then immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-myc antibodies using protein A-agarose. Following electrophoresis gels were treated with Amplify™ fluorographic reagent (Amersham Bioscience) for 30 min, stained, dried, and visualized using autoradiography. Membranes were isolated from COSm6 cells transfected with SUR1, Ct196, or Ct288, incubated with [γ-32P]8-azido-ATP (1 μCi/ml), plus or minus 100 μm ATP, then irradiated at 254 nm. Labeled membranes were solubilized with 1% digitonin and immunoprecipitated using an anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis, and blotted using an anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibody visualized by chemiluminescence using a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The 32P label was visualized by autoradiography. Electrophysiology—Non-tagged subunits were used for the electrophysiological experiments. Patch clamp recordings, single channel kinetics, and macro-currents noise analysis were done as described previously (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl, 145; MgCl2,1; CaCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; pH 7.4 (KOH). The bath, “intracellular” solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 5; KOH, 10; pH 7.2 (KOH). The [Mg2+] i was kept at a quasi-cytosolic level of ∼0.7 mm by adding MgCl2. The Mg2+-free internal solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; EDTA, 5; HEPES, 5; KOH, 10; pH 7.2 (KOH). The holding potential was –40 mV. Burst analysis was done using a burst delimiter of 1 ms. ATP dose responses were taken at eight concentrations. In Figs. 1B and 3C, the arrowhead marks isolation of an inside-out patch; the horizontal dotted line shows the level where all KIR6.2-based channels are closed. The differences in averaged values (mean ± S.D.) with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Molecular Modeling—Homology models of the KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 pore, and the SUR core, were generated using KIR3.1 (1N9PA (10Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar)) and KirBac1.1 (1P7BA/B (11Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar)), and VC-MsbA (1PF4A/B (12Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar)) structures, respectively (for details, see Supplement Material). Models giving minimal Cα root mean square deviation values from the three-dimensinal templates were selected. Their quality was evaluated using ProCheck and WhatCheck available via www.expasy.org. Energy minimization did not lower the scores of the selected models. Fig. 1B shows that N-terminal fragments (Nt) of SUR1, including TMD0 and increasing lengths of the L0 linker, have dramatic effects on the gating of KATP pores lacking the C-terminal ER retention signal. TMD0 (Nt196) markedly stabilized the burst and conducting states of the poorly active KIR raising its PO(max) 5-fold, suggesting interactions of transmembrane helices are able to force KIR openings in novel mini-KATP channels. Nt232, including an amphipathic helix (19Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E. Szakacs G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within L0 made the pore constitutively active. In the Nt232-gated channels, when (Vm – E K) → 0 the mean open time of the KIR, τO → ∞, the intraburst closed time, τCf → 0 (20Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and PO → τO/(τO + τCf) → 1. The result argues that both trans- and submembrane contacts contribute additively to the opening of long K+ pores and suggest that Nt232 can lock pores in a conducting state under biochemical conditions (i.e. no K+ electrochemical gradient) without resorting to mutation. KATP channels display similar saturation of their PO when stimulated with nucleotide diphosphates (8Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), implying the locked state resembles the native open state. The inclusion of additional L0 residues, i.e. Nt256, Nt288, and Nt297, attenuated the PO(max) by destabilizing burst and open states in ATP-free solution. The results reveal that TMD0-L0 possesses separable stimulatory and inhibitory structures, consistent with the original observation that SUR1 TMD0-L0 specifies the β-cell channel-like (lower) spontaneous activity of chimeric SUR1–2/KIR6.2 channels (21Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While the inhibitory effect saturates with Nt288, all of the mini-KATP are more active than KIR alone, and the PO(max) of the fully attenuated channel is equivalent to the ∼35% inhibition of β-cell KATP channels, in nucleotide-free conditions, upon saturation of SUR1 with inhibitory sulfonylureas (22Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Single-channel kinetics data from ∼700 mini-KATP patches revealed a positive correlation between the mean burst (TB) and open (τO) times of KIR pores in ATP-free solution with data for full SUR-containing channels, without pore mutations, falling on the same curve (Fig. 2A). This relationship is intrinsic to KIR structure, reflecting the increased stability of the K+ driving force-dependent conducting state when pores are in the longer lived active (burst) conformation. The relationship is consistent with the possibility that the dynamics of the KIR selectivity filter are particularly susceptible to the “bending” of the inner helices associated with activation (23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). The KIR inner helix has two conserved glycines versus one upper glycine in Ca2+-activated MthK channel (23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). We speculate that bending at the lower, or both “hinges” (Gly156 and Gly165) is required for KATP opening and that bending stabilizes a “centered” position of the pore helices or a conducting conformation of the selectivity filter, seen in KcsA (24Doyle D.A.

A possibility that the lower glycine specifies gating of KIRs has been recently discussed in a report on closed KirBac1.1, crystallized in 0.1 m Mg2+ (11Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Our data and interpretation are consistent with this structure, where the long inner helices are in a straight configuration, clashing at their cytoplasmic ends, the pore helices are misaligned, and the conformation of the selectivity filter is altered. Stabilization of the open state in mini-KATP, as in full channels, increases the IC50(ATP) (IC50 value for inhibitory ATP) (Fig. 2B). The Nt196 mini channels lack the NBDs and other cytoplasmic domains illustrating that transmembrane helical interactions are sufficient to antagonize ATP inhibition. The SUR core is needed to restore the low KD for ATP seen in the presence of SUR1. The macroscopic inhibitory curves are all well fit by single component Hill functions consistent with there being essentially homogenous populations of mini-KATP at the cell surface. In support of this assertion IC50(ATP), determined for the most (Nt288) and least (Nt232) inhibited macrocurrents, reduced the PO of equivalent single mini KATP by ∼50%, indicating the lower IC50(ATP) seen in cells expressing the larger Nts does not reflect an increased fraction of KIR6.2ΔC channels. Normally, only tetradimeric KATP complexes reach the cell surface (4Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 18Sharma N. Crane A. Clement IV, J.P. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We observed no ATP-inhibited K+ channels in >100 macro-patches from 10 independent co-transfections of Nts with KIR6.2 showing TMD0-L0 cannot abolish the KIR retention. On the other hand, Fig. 2C shows that the same Nts enhance surface expression of RKR-free channels, albeit less effectively than SUR1 (6Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gating properties of mini-channels, determined from macro and single channel currents, were similar for molar transfections ratios (Nt:KIR) of 2:1 versus 1:2 again indicating essentially homogenous populations of surface channels. The data, consistent with the predominant intracellular distribution of KIR6.2ΔC in mammalian cells (25Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), show that partially assembled heteromeric channels traffick less effectively to the cell surface. Mini-KATP assemble under physiologic conditions and are stable that TMD0 will co-immunoprecipitate with KIR6.2 (Fig. 3A). We were unable to show a comparable stable association of SUR cores with KIR by co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting that TMD0-L0 is necessary for Cts to decrease the KD for inhibitory ATP (21Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nt233 and Nt248 from MRP1, a closely related ABCC protein, had no effect on KATP pores (80 macropatches showed no trapping of KIR6.2ΔC35 inside the cell in eight independent co-transfections). Ct196, Ct232, Ct256, Ct288, and Ct297 cores, and an the core half fragment, Ct1046 (see Fig. 1A), failed to modulate KIR6.2ΔC gating, even after substitution of the SUR RKR retention signal (4Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) with AAA to force surface expression (>200 macro-patches from six series of independent co-transfections). Fig. 3B confirms that Ct196 and Ct288 are expressed and are able to bind and photolabel with [γ-32P]8-azidoATP. A three-plasmid experiment provides a positive control for the Ct1046 fragment, whose misfolding cannot be tested using nucleotide binding; while Ct1046 has no effect on KIR6.2 pores, co-expression with Nt1046 rescues generation of “fragmented” KATP indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 3C). The results reveal strong interdomain interactions within the SUR core and show that TMD0-L0 is indispensable for assembly of KATP channels. TMD0-L0 is a combination of unique gatekeeper and coupling module anchoring the SUR core to KIR6.0 and modulating their trafficking and activity. The identification of TMD0-L0 as the principal coupling module positions it in contact with KIR in a composite model (Fig. 4). Contact is through the outer helix and involves T76MS critical for assembly of chimeric KIRs with SUR (15Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), illustrated here in a homology model of the closed channel built using recent crystal structures (10Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 11Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M.

Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (for details, see Supplement Material). Although the lack of a structural template for TMD0-L0 prohibits its explicit docking with KIR and the VC-MsbA dimer-like ABC core of SUR, activation of KIR by TMD0 argues that intramembrane intersubunit interactions are sufficient to reposition the KIR outer helices. Consistent with coupled movement of the inner and outer helices during activation of other K+ channels (26Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 27Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), repositioning would give the KIR inner helices freedom to bend and initiate ligand-independent bursting. Nt232 mimics the effect of SUR saturated with nucleotide diphosphates, revealing intersubunit interactions involving a submembrane part of L0 (red), which open KATP channels in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of intracellular ATP. Consistent with the MsbA model (12Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) ATP-driven dimerization of the SUR NBDs is expected to reposition TMD1 and 2, in a manner sensitive to MgADP and drug binding to SUR core, and by inference move L0. We propose that the submembrane amphipathic helix of L0 (19Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E. Szakacs G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) interacts with the KIR α-helix (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), named “slide helix” in KirBac1.1 (11Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), which is anchored at the membrane-water interface in KcsA (28Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Activation of chimeric channels containing the KcsA pore (29Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) required the proximal N-domain preceding the outer helix of KIR2.1 or the S4-S5 linker preceding S5 (analogous to the outer helix) from the Shaker KV channel. Part of S4 and the S4-S5 linker appear to be submembranous in the closed KvAP and their movement is proposed to pull the outer helix and the coupled inner helix away from the central pore axis during opening (27Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). KATP channels are a novel variation on this theme. The model provides a structural interpretation for the decrease in sensitivity of the KIR to inhibitory ATP upon stimulation by SUR. Models of the KIR6.2 and KIR6.1 cytoplasmic pores (see Supplement Material) suggest that C-terminal residues critical for ATP inhibition (e.g. Ile182, Lys185, and Gly334, predicted to be co-localized (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) lie in proximity (within the dimensions of an ATP molecule) to Arg50 adjacent to the slide helix of the neighboring KIR6.2 subunit. A R50Q/K185Q double mutation disrupts the ATP inhibitory machinery (20Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that ATP binding at intersubunit N-/C-terminal interfaces constrict the ring of KIR cytoplasmic domains repositioning the slide helices to lock channels in the interburst state with the lowest KD for ATP (8Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Conversely, pulling the slide helices away from the KIR pore, via their interactions with L0 helices, moves Arg50 and opens the ATP-binding pocket, thus increasing the KD. This mechanism can explain the marked increase in IC50(ATP) for Nt232-containing channels (∼0.7 mm; Fig. 2B). Based on the data from longer Nts, we propose that L0 parts, separable from the amphipathic helix, partner with the peripheral N terminus of KIR6.2 (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to attenuate the PO(max). This idea is supported by the finding that deletion of the peripheral KIR N terminus (8Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), or application of a hydrophilic N-terminal synthetic peptide competing with the endogenous N terminus (17Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), locks heteromeric, but not homomeric, channels in the burst state. Similarly, perturbing the mobility or positioning of the KIR N terminus by concatemerization increases the PO(max) (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the mobile peripheral N terminus has been needed to crystallize KIR pores (10Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 11Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), and beyond the amphipathic helix, L0 is predicted to be flexible. Transient interactions between these domains, rather than tight binding, is expected to increase the frequency of burst termination but not close the channel permanently. The model suggests how SUR1 mutations in the 5′ portion of human ABCC8, e.g. A116P, cause familial hyperinsulinemia (30Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and how a polymorphism, E23K, in the distal N terminus of KIR6.2 can increase the PO of KATP channels in insulin secreting β-cells of pancreatic islets, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes (31Schwanstecher C. Meyer U. Schwanstecher M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The Pro should kink TM3 of TMD0 that can cause misfolding and prevent normal SUR/KIR coupling or trafficking. Indeed, co-expression of SUR1A116P with KIR6.2 resulted in no ATP-inhibited K+ currents in >100 macro-patches (eight independent transfections). Lys23 could reduce the frequency of collisions between the KIR N terminus and L0. Similar alterations of SUR2 and KIR6.1 are predicted to contribute to certain forms of angina and vascular distonia, respectively. We thank Drs. L. Aguilar-Bryan, A. Crane, and W.

https://openalex.org/W2026349284,"To study the mechanisms of protein secretion as well as the cellular responses to impaired protein folding and transport in filamentous fungi, we have analyzed Trichoderma reesei cultures treated with chemical agents that interfere with these processes, dithiothreitol, brefeldin A, and the Ca2+-ionophore A23187. The effects of the drugs on the kinetics of protein synthesis and transport were characterized using metabolic labeling of synthesized proteins. Cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI, Cel7A), the major secreted cellulase, was analyzed as a model protein. Northern analysis showed that under conditions where protein transport was inhibited (treatments with dithiothreitol or brefeldin A) the unfolded protein response pathway was activated. The active form of the hac1 mRNA that mediates unfolded protein response signaling was induced, followed by induction of the foldase and chaperone genes pdi1 and bip1. Concomitant with the activation of the unfolded protein response pathway, the transcript levels of genes encoding secreted proteins, like cellulases and xylanases, were drastically decreased, suggesting a novel type of feedback mechanism activated in response to impairment in protein folding or transport (repression under secretion stress (RESS)). By studying expression of the reporter gene lacZ under cbh1 promoters of different length, it was shown that the feedback response was mediated through the cellulase promoter."

These results validate calcineurin as a target for enhancing insulin action in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle fibers can be separated into two major classifications: type I slow-twitch and type II fast-twitch fibers (1Saltin B. Gollnick P.D. Peachey L.D.D. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1983: 555-632Google Scholar). The knowledge that type I and type II muscle fibers exhibit distinctively different contractile and metabolic properties has been accepted for decades (1Saltin B. Gollnick P.D. Peachey L.D.D. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1983: 555-632Google Scholar, 2Hintz C.S. Chi M.M. Fell R.D. Ivy J.L. Kaiser K.K. Lowry C.V. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C218-C228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms controlling skeletal muscle fiber type have not been clearly elucidated. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin has been recognized as a major determinate of skeletal muscle fiber type. Early evidence for the involvement of calcineurin in skeletal muscle fiber type selection comes from studies implementing the use of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of calcineurin activity. Cyclosporin A blockade of calcineurin activity promotes the expression of fast-twitch fibers in rat soleus muscle (3Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin in cultured muscle cells induces the expression of reporter genes linked to promoters of slow-twitch muscle-specific genes such as myoglobin and slow troponin I (3Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, activation of calcineurin was proposed to be involved in the induction of slow muscle genes and the regulation of skeletal muscle fiber type. Consistent with this hypothesis, transgenic expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin in skeletal muscle increases the percentage of slow-twitch muscle fibers and promotes the expression of myoglobin and slow troponin I (4Naya F.J. Mercer B. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4545-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).The identification of calcineurin as a regulator of skeletal muscle fiber type may have clinical implications for improving insulin action in individuals with type II diabetes mellitus. A major contributing factor to the progressive development of type II diabetes is reduced insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal, with the greatest defects attributed to skeletal muscle (5DeFronzo R.A. Gunnarsson R. Bjorkman O. Olsson M. Wahren J. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle insulin resistance in individuals with type II diabetes is associated with impaired insulin signal transduction (6Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin.

Therefore, strategies to improve insulin signal transduction or enhance insulin-stimulated mobilization of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface are likely to correct glucose transport defects and lead to improved glucose homeostasis in diabetic individuals. One means of achieving improved glucose transport in skeletal muscle may be through activation of the calcineurin signaling pathway. Activation of calcineurin may promote metabolic adaptations within muscle cells, resulting in improved insulin-stimulated glucose transport. This hypothesis is supported in part by the observation that insulin action on glucose transport is greater in rat skeletal muscles that are highly enriched in slow-versus fast-twitch muscle fibers (9Henriksen E.J. Bourey R.E. Rodnick K.J. Koranyi L. Permutt M.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E593-E598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fiber type specificity of insulin-stimulated glucose transport appears to be due to increased expression and/or function of proteins involved in the insulin-signaling cascade (10Song X.M. Ryder J.W. Kawano Y. Chibalin A.V. Krook A. Zierath J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1690-R1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a greater abundance of GLUT4 (9Henriksen E.J. Bourey R.E. Rodnick K.J.

Furthermore, insulin-stimulated glucose transport is positively correlated with the percentage of slow-twitch muscle fibers in human skeletal muscle (12Hickey M.S. Carey J.O. Azevedo J.L. Houmard J.A. Pories W.J. Israel R.G. Dohm G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E453-E457PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of calcineurin in skeletal muscle represents a novel strategy to improve insulin-stimulated glucose transport and may counterbalance insulin resistance in type II diabetes. We utilized transgenic mice expressing an activated form of calcineurin in skeletal muscle (MCK-CnA* mice) to determine whether skeletal muscle reprogramming via activation of calcineurin improves insulin-stimulated glucose transport and prevents the development of diet-induced insulin resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransgenic Mice—A colony of transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of calcineurin (13O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A.

Mice were bred on a C57/BL6JBom background. Wild-type littermates served as controls in all experiments. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water. Food was removed from the cages of 12–14-week-old female mice 4 h prior to study unless indicated otherwise. When examining effects of a high-fat diet, female mice were placed on either a standard chow or a high-fat diet (14Zierath J.R. Houseknecht K.L. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from 4 to 20 weeks of age. The Ethics Committee on Animal Research in Northern Stockholm approved all experimental protocols.Muscle Incubations—Incubation media were prepared from pregassed (95% O2, 5% CO2) stocks of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) supplemented with 5 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade). Mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% avertin (0.02 ml/g body weight). Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were excised and incubated in 1 ml of KHB supplemented with 2 mm pyruvate and 18 mm mannitol. Incubations were performed at 30 °C in a shaking water bath under a constant gas phase (95% O2, 5% CO2) unless stated otherwise. For 2-deoxyglucose uptake and α-aminomethylisobutyrate (MeAIB) uptake experiments, muscles were preincubated for 40 min in the absence or presence of 12 nm insulin. For insulin signaling studies, muscles were incubated in KHB containing 2 mm pyruvate for a total of 60 min. Insulin (120 nm) was added for the final 5 min (for insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity) or 40 min (for Akt or glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylation).Glucose Transport Activity—Following preincubation, muscles were transferred to vials containing 1 mm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (2.5 μCi/ml) and 19 mm [U-14C]mannitol (0.7 μCi/ml). Insulin was added at concentrations identical to preincubation conditions. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was assessed for 20 min. After incubation, muscles were digested in 0.5 m NaOH. Sample aliquots were used for protein determination using a commercially available kit (Coomassie Plus, Pierce). Extracellular space and intracellular 2-deoxyglucose concentrations were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Glucose transport activity was expressed as nmol of 2-deoxyglucose/mg of protein/20 min.Amino Acid Transport Activity—Following preincubation, muscles were transferred to vials containing 0.1 mm [14C]MeAIB (0.4 μCi/ml) and 19.9 mm d-[2-3H]mannitol (2 μCi/ml) without or with insulin at concentrations identical to preincubation conditions. MeAIB uptake was assessed for 20 min. Muscles were processed as described above for 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Amino acid transport activity was expressed as pmol of MeAIB/mg of protein/20 min.Oleate Oxidation—Muscles were trimmed of excess tendon and weighed. Muscles were preincubated for 40 min in KHB containing 5 mm HEPES, 3.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm glucose. Thereafter, muscles were transferred to vials containing 1 ml of identical media with the addition of 0.3 mm [1-14C]oleate (0.2 μCi/ml) and incubated for 60 min. Vials were sealed with a rubber stopper, which was fitted with a center well. Muscles were oxygenated for the first 15 min of the incubation period via a needle inserted through the stopper, after which time the oxygen needle was removed to close the system. After 60 min, 0.2 ml of Protosol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected through the rubber stopper into the center well, and the medium was acidified by injection of 0.5 ml of 15% perchloric acid.

Endogenous levels of calcineurin protein were reduced in both muscle types in transgenic mice (Fig. 1, Table I); levels were greater in EDL compared with soleus muscle in both wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice. Constitutively active calcineurin was 4.5-fold greater in EDL compared with soleus muscle from MCK-CnA* mice. Constitutively active calcineurin accounted for ∼34 and 21% of the total calcineurin pool (endogenous plus transgenic) in MCK-CnA* EDL and soleus muscle, respectively.Table IProtein expression and phosphorylation in EDL and soleus muscles from wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice as determined by Western blot analysisWild typeMCK-CnA*p valueEndogenous calcineurinEDL100 ± 14 (4)35 ± 3 (4)p < 0.005Soleus25 ± 4 (4)15 ± 2 (6)p < 0.005Transgenic calcineurinEDL18 ± 3 (4)Soleus4 ± 1 (4)Insulin receptorEDL100 ± 19 (6)267 ± 45 (6)p < 0.01Soleus333 ± 82 (6)365 ± 76 (6)NSIRS1EDL100 ± 20 (6)168 ± 39 (6)NSSoleus263 ± 45 (6)389 ± 72 (6)NSAktEDL100 ± 14 (4)278 ± 18 (4)p < 0.0005Soleus220 ± 29 (4)311 ± 61 (4)NSPGC-1EDL100 ± 14 (4)216 ± 8 (4)p < 0.0005Soleus296 ± 11 (4)235 ± 31 (4)NSGLUT4EDL100 ± 5 (4)195 ± 20 (4)p < 0.005Soleus515 ± 44 (4)682 ± 100 (4)NSGlycogen synthaseEDL100 ± 11 (4)160 ± 11 (4)p < 0.01Soleus160 ± 10 (4)171 ± 9 (4)NSInsulin receptorphosphorylationEDL insulin100 ± 21 (4)75 ± 5 (4)NSSoleus insulin68 ± 19 (4)90 ± 3 (4)NSGSK3 αphosphorylationEDL insulin100 ± 11 (4)100 ± 13 (4)NSSoleus insulin62 ± 13 (4)71 ± 22 (4)NSGSK3 βphosphorylationEDL insulin100 ± 15 (4)105 ± 12 (4)NSSoleus insulin148 ± 16 (4)140 ± 21 (4)NS Open table in a new tab Alterations in Metabolism of MCK-CnA* Mice—In wild-type mice, insulin increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake 2.9-fold in EDL muscle and 4.2-fold in soleus muscle (Fig. 2A).

As observed for 2-deoxyglucose uptake, amino acid uptake was enhanced in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* compared with wild-type mice. Basal and insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake was 2- and 1.8-fold greater under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, respectively, in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2B).Oleate oxidation was determined in skeletal muscle from wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice. In wild-type mice, oleate oxidation was elevated 69% in soleus compared with EDL muscle (Fig. 2C). In MCK-CnA* mice, activation of calcineurin in EDL muscle resulted in a 63% increase in fatty oxidation compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). No further increase was observed in soleus mice from MCK-CnA* mice.Protein Expression of Molecules Involved in the Regulation of Insulin Action—Protein expression of insulin receptor, IRS1, Akt, GLUT4, and PGC-1 was determined in EDL and soleus muscles from wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice. The abundance of each of these proteins in wild-type mice was 2–5-fold greater in soleus than in EDL muscle (Fig. 3, Table I). In EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* mice, expression of insulin receptor, Akt, GLUT4, and PGC-1 was up-regulated 2–3-fold compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3, Table I).

Similar to the pattern observed for insulin receptor phosphorylation, insulin led to a robust stimulation of IRS1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, with comparable effects observed in both muscle types of each genotype (Fig. 4B). Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in skeletal muscle of wild-type mice was not different between EDL and soleus muscles (Fig. 4C).

https://openalex.org/W2078238119,"Clostridium difficile toxin B (269 kDa) is one of the causative agents of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Toxin B acts in the cytosol of eukaryotic target cells where it inactivates Rho GTPases by monoglucosylation. The catalytic domain of toxin B is located at the N terminus (amino acid residues 1–546). The C-terminal and the middle region of the toxin seem to be involved in receptor binding and translocation. Here we studied whether the full-length toxin or only a part of the holotoxin is translocated into the cytosol. Vero cells were treated with recombinant glutathione S-transferase-toxin B, and thereafter, toxin B fragments were isolated by affinity precipitation of the glutathione S-transferase-tagged protein from the cytosolic fraction of intoxicated cells. The toxin fragment (∼65 kDa) was recognized by an antibody against the N terminus of toxin B and was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis as the catalytic domain of toxin B. The toxin fragment located in the cytosol possessed glucosyltransferase activity that could modify RhoA in vitro, but it was not able to intoxicate intact cells. After treatment of Vero cells with a radiolabeled fragment of toxin B (amino acid residues 547–2366), radioactivity was identified in the membrane fraction of Vero cells but not in the cytosolic fraction of Vero cells. Furthermore, analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy revealed that the C terminus of toxin B was located in endosomes, whereas the N terminus was detected in the cytosol. Protease inhibitors, which were added to the cell medium, delayed intoxication of cells by toxin B and pH-dependent translocation of the toxin from the cell surface across the cell membrane. The data indicate that toxin B is proteolytically processed during its cellular uptake process."
https://openalex.org/W2158239420,"Crystal (Cry) proteins made by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis are pore-forming toxins that specifically target insects and nematodes and are used around the world to kill insect pests. To better understand how pore-forming toxins interact with their host, we have screened for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that resist Cry protein intoxication. We find that Cry toxin resistance involves the loss of two glycosyltransferase genes, bre-2 and bre-4. These glycosyltransferases function in the intestine to confer susceptibility to toxin. Furthermore, they are required for the interaction of active toxin with intestinal cells, suggesting they make an oligosaccharide receptor for toxin. Similarly, the bre-3 resistance gene is also required for toxin interaction with intestinal cells. Cloning of the bre-3 gene indicates it is the C. elegans homologue of the Drosophila egghead (egh) gene. This identification is striking given that the previously identified bre-5 has homology to Drosophila brainiac (brn) and that egh-brn likely function as consecutive glycosyltransferases in Drosophila epithelial cells. We find that, like in Drosophila, bre-3 and bre-5 act in a single pathway in C. elegans. bre-2 and bre-4 are also part of this pathway, thereby extending it. Consistent with its homology to brn, we demonstrate that C. elegans bre-5 rescues the Drosophila brn mutant and that BRE-5 encodes the dominant UDP-GlcNAc:Man GlcNAc transferase activity in C. elegans. Resistance to Cry toxins has uncovered a four component glycosylation pathway that is functionally conserved between nematodes and insects and that provides the basis of the dominant mechanism of resistance in C. elegans.

Bacterial pore-forming toxins that damage membranes are important virulence factors associated with pathogenic bacteria (1Gilbert R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Schmitt C.K. Meysick K.C. O'Brien A.D. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Examples include aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila, α toxin from Staphylococcus aureus, hemolysin from Escherichia coli, and main family crystal (Cry) 1The abbreviations used are: Cry, crystal; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin. proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis. Of these, Cry proteins are unique in that they specifically target invertebrates (insects and nematodes) and are generally considered innocuous to mammals. Mammalian resistance to Cry toxins is thought to be due to toxin insolubility, lack of proper proteolytic processing, and lack of proper receptors in the mammalian gut (3Betz F.S. Hammond B.G. Fuchs R.L. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2000; 32: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As such, Cry proteins demonstrate a degree of safety toward vertebrates that is unmatched by any other pest control product and are used extensively around the world in the control of insect pests that damage crops and carry disease. We previously reported on the isolation of Caenorhabditis elegans bre mutants (for Bt-toxin resistant) that resist Bt Cry protein intoxication (4Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When fed the main family crystal protein Cry5B either as protein crystals or as E. coli produced protein, C. elegans becomes rapidly sick and shows degeneration of the intestine, loss of coloration, inhibition of growth, inhibition of progeny production, and eventual death (4Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wei J.Z. Hale K. Carta L. Platzer E. Wong C. Fang S.C. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cry5B-resistant bre mutants were isolated among the F2 progeny of ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenized larvae. After screening 42,000 mutagenized haploid genomes for animals resistant to Cry5B, we isolated 14 alleles of bre-2, 19 alleles of bre-3, 9 alleles of bre-4, and 2 alleles of bre-5 (4Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2L. D. Marroquin and R. V. Aroian, unpublished results. All are strongly resistant to the pore-forming toxin, and all are healthy in the absence of toxin as well. To date we have also isolated one allele of bre-1 that has significantly weaker resistance to Cry5B (4Marroquin L.D. Elyassnia D. Griffitts J.S. Feitelson J.S. Aroian R.V. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No other loci have been identified in these screens. Thus, strong, healthy resistance to the pore-forming toxin inevitably leads to mutation of bre-2, bre-3, bre-4, or bre-5. The identification of bre-5 as a β1,3-glycosyltransferase gene has been reported (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this approach is unique in its objective to genetically characterize how whole animals interact with and resist a bacterial pore-forming toxin. In the case of Cry proteins, identifying the genes that mutate to confer resistance is important since the major threat to the long term utility of insecticidal Cry proteins is the emergence of resistance. More generally, understanding the pathways that can mediate resistance might suggest therapeutic strategies for coping with bacterial toxins that target mammals. Here, we identify the Cry5B toxin resistance genes bre-2 and bre-4 as glycosyltransferase genes that previously have not been genetically characterized. We find that bre-2 and bre-4 function in the intestine to confer susceptibility to Cry5B and are also required for the interaction of toxin with intestinal cells in vivo. We also identify the bre-3 resistance gene as sharing significant homology to Drosophila egghead (egh). Because bre-5 shares sequence similarity to the Drosophila brainiac (brn) gene and since egh and brn function in a single pathway in Drosophila, we hypothesized that the Cry protein intoxication pathway in C. elegans is equivalent to the Drosophila pathway. We indeed show that bre-3 and bre-5 function in a common pathway in C. elegans, that bre-2 and bre-4 are also part of this pathway, and that the C. elegans bre-5 gene has the same in vivo and in vitro activities as Drosophila brn. C. elegans Culture and Microscopy—C. elegans was propagated using standard techniques with strain Bristol N2 as the wild type (7Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All nematode assays were carried out at 20 °C. For microscopy of live animals, nematodes were mounted on pads consisting of 2% agarose and 0.1% sodium azide. Low magnification microscopy was carried out on an Olympus BX-60 microscope using a 10× objective coupled to a 0.5× camera mount and a DVC camera. Endocytosis assays were imaged and deconvolved using a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision) on an Olympus IX-70 microscope using a 40× objective (NA1.35) and differential interference contrast or fluorescence optics. Immunofluorescence images were captured on the DeltaVision system using a 40× or 100× objective (NA1.35) and differential interference contrast or fluorescence optics. Cloning of bre Genes—bre-2(ye31) was placed in trans to dpy-18(e364) unc-64(e246). 25/25 Dpy nonUncs segregated bre-2(ye31), and 23/23 Unc nonDpys segregated bre(+). The deficiency eDf2 also failed to complement bre-2(ye31), suggesting that bre-2 resided between unc-64 and the right breakpoint of eDf2. The bre-2(ye71) allele was generated by mutagenesis in the Hawaiian strain background (CB4856) and then placed in trans to unc-25(e156) bli-5(e518). Unc nonDpy and Dpy non-Unc recombinants were used to follow the segregation of single nucleotide polymorphisms, which indicated that bre-2 mapped between nucleotides 3,645 and 153,209 of Y39E4B. This region contains 14 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Sequencing of cDNAs isolated from two bre-2 alleles indicated that both alleles contained point mutations in Y39E4B.9. Identification of the putative glycosyltransferase Y39E4B.9 as bre-2 was confirmed by reproducing the phenotype using RNA-mediated interference (data not shown) and by cDNA rescue from a bre-2 mutant. Analogous to bre-3 (below, including spliced leader 1 primer at the 5′ end), a complete bre-2 cDNA was constructed using reverse-transcribed RNA from wild-type nematodes. The predicted amino acid sequence is exactly as predicted for Y39E4B.9. bre-4(ye13) was placed in trans to unc-35(e259) dpy-5(e61). 29/32 Dpy nonUncs-segregated bre-4(ye13) indicated bre-4 was near and to the right of unc-35. Bre nonDpy recombinants from bre-4(ye13) dpy-5(e61)/CB4856 heterozygotes placed bre-4 to the right of the single nucleotide polymorphism Y71G12B.60148. Dpy recombinants from heterozygotes unc-35(e259) dpy-5(e61),bre-4(ye43) (bre-4 allele in the Hawaiian background) placed bre-4 to the left of single nucleotide polymorphism Y92H12A.28829. The 150-kilobase region between these boundary single nucleotide polymorphisms contains 20 predicted ORFs. Sequencing of cDNA isolated from the bre-4 alleles revealed changes in the enzymatically characterized glycosyltransferase Y73E7A.7 (8Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

A complete cDNA was assembled as for the other bre genes (including using spliced leader 1-specific primers). The predicted protein sequence corresponds exactly as predicted for ORF Y73E7A.7. bre-3(ye28) was placed in trans to sma-2(e502) ced-7(n1892) unc-69(e587). Of 25 Sma non-Unc recombinants, 12 were sma-2(e502) bre-3(ye28) ced-7(+), 12 were sma-2(e502) bre-3(+) ced-7(n1892), and 1 was sma-2(e502) bre-3(+) ced-7(+). These data indicated bre-3 was close and to the left of ced-7. We co-injected bre-3(ye28) animals with cosmids in this region and plasmid pRF4, which encodes the dominant rol-6 marker, and found that 2/2 stably transmitting lines containing cosmid B0464 were rescued to toxin susceptibility. Subcloning and injection of different regions within B0464 indicated that the rescuing activity (8/8 lines) was conferred by a 4.3-kilobase FspI-NheI fragment containing nucleotides 13,437-17,729. This fragment contains a single predicted ORF B0464.4 and an additional ∼800 bases at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ORF. Sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA from three bre-3 mutant alleles indicated these alleles contained alterations in this ORF, confirming the identity of the gene. A complete wild-type cDNA was assembled and sequenced from two overlapping fragments generated 1) at the 5′ end by using random-primed total cDNA, a spliced leader 1 primer, an internal primer, and PCR and 2) at the 3′ end by using a λ phage cDNA library (generously provided by Robert Barstead), a 3′ end-specific vector primer, an internal primer, and PCR. The predicted protein sequence from this assemble cDNA corresponds exactly to that of the predicted B0464.4 ORF. Transmembrane domains in BRE-3 and other related proteins were predicted using TMHMM2.0. Intestine-specific Expression and Rescue—pBluescript (KS) (Stratagene) was used as the vector backbone for test constructs. The cpr-1 promoter (9Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), corresponding to nucleotides 9,541-11,581 of cosmid C52E4, was amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA and cloned upstream of bre gene coding regions (for bre-2, bre-3, and bre-5, respectively, nucleotides 66,617-69,835 of Y39E4B, 14,285-16,925 of B0464, and 22,694-23,958 of cosmid T12G3; the bre-4 coding region was amplified from C. elegans cDNA). Coding regions were fused in-frame to a double HA tag at their 3′ ends, with a downstream transcription termination region derived from the bre-5 locus (T12G3 nucleotides 21,578-22,699), except in the bre-3 construct, which contained the bre-3 transcription termination region downstream of the HA tag (B0464 nucleotides 13,437-14,287). Constructs were co-injected with the dominant rol-6 marker (pRF4) into mutant animals to obtain stably transmitting lines carrying extrachromosomal arrays. Eggs laid by Roller (or N2 control) hermaphrodites were placed on modified ENG agar plates containing 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and spread with E. coli cells expressing Cry5B (5Wei J.Z. Hale K. Carta L. Platzer E. Wong C. Fang S.C. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) or with vector-only cells. Eggs were allowed to hatch and grow for 72 h, and resistance was scored based on the ability of larvae to progress to adulthood during the course of the experiment. For each construct tested at least two independent transgenic lines were assayed, and all lines possessed the reported phenotypes with >90% penetrance, with ∼20 rollers and 20 non-rollers tested per line. Fixation and Staining for Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The fixation procedure was a modification of that of Finney and Ruvkun (10Finney M. Ruvkun G. Cell. 1990; 63: 895-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A mixed population of a rescuing line expressing cpr-1::bre-5::2XHA or cpr-1::bre-3::2XHA was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 25% methanol, 3% formaldehyde and flash-frozen. After thawing under tap water worms were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by 2 washes in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 9.5 (BO3T). Worms were then incubated for 20 min in BO3T plus 10 mm dithiothreitol followed by another wash in BO3T and a 20-min incubation in BO3T plus 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. Fixed and permeabilized worms were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide (antibody buffer). For staining, all steps were carried out in antibody buffer using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (16B12, Covance), and a final wash included 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for DNA staining. Assays for Endocytosis of Rhodamine-labeled Cry5B—Cry5B protoxin was purified as described previously (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and labeled using a 5-fold molar excess of NHS-rhodamine. Trypsinization was carried out at a 1:200 (trypsin:toxin) mass ratio for 2 h at 25 °C. Trypsinized toxin was still toxic but 5-10-fold less based on growth assays. We used Edman degradation sequencing and determined that trypsin removes the first 170 amino acids, which includes predicted α helix 3 but not helix 4. Consistent with our results studies with insecticidal Cry toxins show that α helices 4 and 5 are critical for toxin function and that helices 1-3 may contribute some activity (11Uawithya P. Tuntitippawan T. Katzenmeier G. Panyim S. Angsuthanasombat C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 825-832PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vachon V. Prefontaine G. Coux F. Rang C. Marceau L. Masson L. Brousseau R. Frutos R. Schwartz J.L. Laprade R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6178-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on the apparent molecular weight of trypsinized toxin, trypsin is predicted to remove most of the carboxyl-terminal protoxin domain. Animals (L4 stage) were incubated in M9 medium containing 50 μg/ml protoxin or 120 μg/ml trypsinized toxin for 3 h and washed 3 times in M9 before imaging. For wash-out experiments, bre-4(ye13) and bre-5(ye17) animals fed rhodamine toxin for a few hours in wells were pipetted onto standard NG plates and examined every few minutes on an Olympus green fluorescent protein dissecting scope fitted with a rhodamine filter. Single Mutant Versus Double Mutant Resistance Assays—All double mutants were constructed and confirmed using a similar strategy. For example, the bre-4(ye13),bre-5(ye17) double mutant was created by mating bre-4(ye13) males into the strain dpy-5(e61),bre-5(ye17) (bre-4 and dpy-5 are both on chromosome I). NonDpy F1 progeny were cloned, and in the F2 nonDpy Cry5B-resistant animals were picked that segregated F3 Dpy (bre-4(y13),dpy-5(e61),bre-5(ye17)). NonDpy F3 were cloned out, and those that did not segregate Dpy were selected as bre-4(ye13),bre-5(ye17) putative doubles. The presence of both mutations was verified by sequencing DNA. To measure resistance of single and double mutants we used the Cry5B-related crystal protein Cry14A (5Wei J.Z. Hale K. Carta L. Platzer E. Wong C. Fang S.C. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cry14A is required for these studies since bre-2, -3, -4, and -5 are very highly resistant to Cry5B (e.g. they are not killed by even 1 mg/ml Cry5B) but are only moderately resistant to Cry14A. Cry14A was produced in E. coli and incorporated into the assay diet as described (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 24-well plates, with each well containing 400 μl of S medium with 30 μg/ml each of tetracycline and chloramphenicol and ∼60 newly hatched L1 animals, with a final bacterial density of A 600 = 0.25. After a 60-h exposure at 20 °C, animals were mounted and imaged, and area measurements were made outlining the nematodes by hand and processing with NIH Image. bre-5 Rescue of the Drosophila brainiac Mutant—The bre-5 cDNA was cloned into pUAST (13Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used to transform yellow, white embryos using standard techniques. Two independent lines containing the transgene on chromosome II were used for brn complementation assays, which were carried out as described in Müller et al. (14Müller R. Altmann F. Zhou D. Hennet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32417-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, male UAS-bre-5 transformants were crossed to females of the genotype forked, brn 1.6P6/FM6,w 1, actin-, heat shock- or armadillo-GAL4,w +. Rescue was scored based on the ability of forked male progeny to hatch. The GAL4 drivers used for this experiment carry the Bloomington stock numbers 1560 (armadillo-GAL4), 2077 (heat-shock GAL4), and 4414 (actin-GAL4). These lines were generously provided by Markus Noll and Erich Frei (Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Zürich). Flies carrying UAS-brainiac and UAS-β3GnT-IV (a human N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. bre-5-dependent N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase Assays—N2 and bre-5(ye17) mixed larval-staged animals were reared on ENG medium (standard NG with an additional 2.5 g of peptone and 1 g of yeast extract per liter), washed, flash-frozen in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, as a 0.2-ml pellet, and stored at -70 °C. Samples were sonicated on ice in 0.05% Triton-X-100, 50 mm Tris and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a clarified supernatant. The assay mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.1% taurodeoxycholate, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (39.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences),10 mm Manβ1,4Glc-pNP (custom synthesis of Toronto Research, ON, Canada), and 8 μg of extracted protein (N2 or bre-5) as the enzyme source. After incubation at 25 °C for 7 h, the reaction products were diluted with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (100 mg; Waters). After washing the cartridge with 25 ml of water, the products were eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. To better understand how resistance to pore-forming Cry toxins develops, we used single-nucleotide polymorphisms to map the bre-2 and bre-4 genes to small molecular intervals of ≤20 genes, each of which contained a glycosyltransferase gene. Given that the previously identified bre-5 was shown to encode a glycosyltransferase gene (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we sequenced cDNAs isolated from bre-2 and bre-4 mutant alleles and found that multiple alleles of each were associated with point mutations in the glycosyltransferase genes Y39E4B.9 and Y73E7A.7, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). At least one allele for each gene (bre-2(ye68) and bre-4(ye13)) is predicted to eliminate protein function by truncation of the putative glycosyltransferase catalytic domain, indicating that Cry5B resistance is the null phenotype for each. That RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) of bre-2 recapitulates Cry5B resistance supports this (data not shown). Rescue data (see below) confirm that these glycosyltransferase genes encode bre-2 and bre-4. Cloning and characterization of bre-3, which encodes an unusual glycosyltransferase of striking resemblance to a known glycosyltransferase in Drosophila, is dealt with below. bre-2 encodes a putative family 31 β1,3-glycosyltransferase with a single amino-terminal membrane-spanning domain and an appropriately positioned DXD motif that is conserved in this enzyme family and is thought to be critical for catalysis (Fig. 1A). In general, BRE-2 shares ∼25% amino acid identity in its putative enzymatic domain with other β1,3-glycosyltransferases such as with BRE-5 (a β1,3-GlcNAc transferase; see Griffitts et al. (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and below) and insect and mammalian β1,3-Gal and GlcNAc-transferases. bre-2 is also a member of a more closely related and expanded subfamily of C. elegans β1,3-glycosyltransferase genes that includes T09F5.1, F14B6.6, T09E11.10, E03H4.11, C54C8.3, F14B6.4, C47F8.3, C47F8.5, C47F8.6, and T15D6.5 and to which it shares ∼40% identity in its glycosyltransferase domain. To our knowledge, bre-2 is the first one of these family members to be characterized genetically and to be demonstrated to have a loss of function phenotype. bre-4 is predicted to encode a member of the family 7 glycosyltransferases, of which β1,4-galactosyltransferases are the best characterized (15Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Qasba P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). BRE-4 is predicted to contain a single membrane-spanning region near its amino terminus as well as conserved residues involved in catalysis (Fig. 1B). BRE-4 has been previously characterized biochemically as a UDP-GalNAc:GlcNAc β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Ceβ4 GalNAcT) (8Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). BRE-4/Ceβ4GalNAcT specifically synthesizes the GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc sequence commonly found on glycoproteins and glycolipids. No mutational analysis of bre-4 has been previously reported. There are two other related glycosyltransferase genes in the C. elegans genome. Blast searches using both BRE-4 full-length protein and its enzymatic domain indicate a best hit and likely homologue in Drosophila melanogaster (predicted gene CG8536) and Anopheles gambiae (ORF from nucleotides 565443 to 566142, chromosome II). The predicted catalytic domains of these proteins, respectively, share 45 and 51% identity to the BRE-4 catalytic domain. Expression of bre-5, bre-2, and bre-4 in the Intestine Is Required for Cry Protein Intoxication—Based on the fact that Cry toxins appear to specifically attack the gut cells of insects and nematodes, we predicted that bre-2 and bre-4 glycosyltransferase genes should be required in intestinal cells for Cry protein intoxication. To demonstrate this intestinal requirement while simultaneously confirming the correct identities of bre-2 and bre-4, we placed wild-type bre-2 genomic coding region and bre-4 cDNA downstream of the intestinal-specific C. elegans promoter from the cpr-1 gene (9Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a control using the previously cloned bre-5 gene we also made a cpr-1::bre-5 construct in which a 2× HA tag was fused in-frame at the carboxyl terminus of bre-5. Intestine-specific expression of the cpr-1 promoter was confirmed by HA antibody staining of a stably transmitting line transformed with the cpr-1::bre-5:HA construct (Fig. 2, A and B). This construct was fully capable of restoring Cry5B susceptibility to a bre-5(ye17) mutant (Fig. 2, C and D), demonstrating that intestinal expression of wild-type bre-5 in an animal otherwise lacking bre-5 is sufficient for Cry protein intoxication and providing a complementary result to our mosaic experiments (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We similarly found that intestinal-specific expression of wild-type bre-2 in a bre-2(ye31) mutant background and intestinal-specific expression of wild-type bre-4 in a bre-4(ye13) mutant background fully restored Cry toxin susceptibility to each (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, like bre-5, both glycosyltransferase genes act in the intestine in their mediation of Cry protein intoxication. The fact that the bre-2 gene complements a bre-2 mutant and that the bre-4 gene complements a bre-4 mutant also confirms the identities of these genes. To demonstrate specificity of rescue, we transformed a bre-5(ye17) mutant with the wild-type cpr-1::bre-2 construct that fully rescues a bre-2 mutant. No rescue of the bre-5 mutant by the bre-2 gene was seen (Fig. 2G) despite the fact that both are members of the extended β1,3-glycosyltransferase family. Toxin Uptake in C. elegans Is Associated with Active Toxin and Requires bre-2, bre-4, and bre-3—We previously demonstrated that bre-5 is required for Cry5B toxin to interact with intestinal cells since bre-5(ye17) mutant animals fail to endocytose Cry5B protoxin labeled with rhodamine (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, because Cry proteins are produced as large (protoxin) precursors that are proteolytically activated, it was not demonstrated that toxin molecule taken up was the active toxin fragment or that the toxin had to be functional to be taken up. To extend these results, we fed C. elegans rhodamine-labeled Cry5B that was full-length (protoxin), proteolytically activated with trypsin (Fig. 3A), or boiled to inactive it. As reported (6Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), full-length protoxin is readily taken up by intestinal cells into autofluorescent gut granules, which are reported to be the secondary lysosome (Fig. 3, B and C). We found that trypsin-activated toxin is also endocytosed by intestinal cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, inactivated toxin is not taken up (Fig. 3E). Thus, toxin uptake into intestinal cells is associated with activated, functional toxin. In contrast to wild-type animals, bre-2(ye31) bre-4(ye13), and bre-3(ye28) (bre-3 is discussed further below), mutant animals do not endocytose either functional protoxin or trypsin-activated toxin into their intestinal cells (Fig. 3, F-K). Rhodamine toxin seen in the intestinal lumen is not stably associated with the intestinal membrane since bre-4(ye13) and bre-5(ye15) mutant animals fed a pulse of rhodamine toxin flush the labeled toxin from their lumen within 5-10 min; no residual binding was detected (Fig. 3L, shown for bre-4(ye13)). These results suggest that the glycosyltransferase genes make a component required for toxin to interact with the plasma membrane of the intestine. An alternative explanation, that these mutants are all defective in general endocytosis by the intestine"

https://openalex.org/W2001799565,"Presented is a study of the impact on the structure and function of human complex I of three different homozygous mutations in the NDUFS4 gene coding for the 18-kDa subunit of respiratory complex I, inherited by autosomal recessive mode in three children affected by a fatal neurological Leigh-like syndrome. The mutations consisted, respectively, of a AAGTC duplication at position 466–470 of the coding sequence, a single base deletion at position 289/290, and a G44A nonsense mutation in the first exon of the gene. All three mutations were found to be associated with a defect of the assembly of a functional complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In all the mutations, in addition to destruction of the carboxyl-terminal segment of the 18-kDa subunit, the amino-terminal segment of the protein was also missing. In the mutation that was expected to produce a truncated subunit, the disappearance of the protein was associated with an almost complete disappearance of the NDUFS4 transcript. These observations show the essential role of the NDUFS4 gene in the structure and function of complex I and give insight into the pathogenic mechanism of NDUFS4 gene mutations in a severe defect of complex I.

In mammals, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and the F0F1 ATP synthase are constituted, in addition to the conserved mitochondrial encoded subunits, by a large number of nuclear encoded subunits. Evidence is now emerging that indicates that the structural subunits of respiratory chain complexes, although not necessary for the catalytic activity, can contribute to the assembly of the complexes and/or have a regulatory role. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (E.C.1.6.5.3., complex I) of the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone and conserves the free energy thus made available as transmembrane proton motive force (1Walker J.E.

As far as the mammalian enzyme is concerned, the following questions remain to be understood: (i) how the expression of the 39 nuclear encoded subunits is coordinated with that of the seven mitochondrial encoded subunits; (ii) how the 39 nuclear encoded subunits are imported into mitochondria and assembled together with the mitochondrial subunits in the inner membrane mature complex; and (iii) the role of the supernumerary 32 subunits.

We have investigated the impact on the expression of the 18-kDa subunit and the assembly of the complex of three different homozygous NDUFS4 gene mutations in three children affected by Leighlike syndrome. The three mutations in the NDUFS4 gene consisted, respectively, of a 5-bp duplication leading to a deduced mutated form of the protein with destruction of a phosphorylation consensus site and elongation of the carboxyl terminus by 14 residues (patient 1) (15van den Heuvel L. Ruitenbeek W. Smeets R. Gelman-Kohan Z. Elpeleg O. Loeffen J. Trijbels F. Mariman E. de Bruijn D. Smeitink J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), a point deletion in the middle part of the coding sequence leading to a truncated polypeptide (patient 2) (16Budde S.M. van den Heuvel L.P. Janssen A.J. Smeets R.J. Buskens C.A. DeMeirleir L. Van Coster R. Baethmann M. Voit T. Trijbels J.M. Smeitink J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and a nonsense mutation causing premature termination after only 14 amino acids of the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (patient 3) (17Petruzzella V. Vergari R. Puzziferri I. Boffoli D. Lamantea E. Zeviani M. Papa S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Fibroblast cultures from the three patients exhibited severe depression of the normal activity of complex I, which also did not respond to activation by cAMP as observed in control cells from normal subjects (18Papa S. Scacco S Sardanelli A.M. Vergari R Papa F. Budde S. Van den Heuvel L. Smeitink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 489: 259-262Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All mutations were found to be associated with impairment of the assembly of a normal, functional complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In all three patients, in addition to destruction of the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation site, no protein was detected with an antibody against the amino-terminal segment of the 18-kDa protein. Estimation of the steady-state level of the NDUFS4 transcript showed an almost complete disappearance of the transcript only in patient 2. These observations provide clues for an essential role of the NDUFS4 gene in respiratory metabolism and the pathogenic mechanism of its mutations in the human inborn neurological syndrome. Culture and Preparation of Fibroblasts—Primary fibroblast lines established from skin biopsies of control subjects and three NDUFS4 mutated patients were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 110 μg/ml pyruvate, and 50 μg/ml uridine (12Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17578-17582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from patient 3 were made available to us by Dr. Massimo Zeviani, National Institute “C. Besta,” Milan, Italy. In the experiments depicted in Fig. 2a, once cells were at 75% confluence the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, after 3 days of serum starvation the cells were supplemented with 1 μg/ml cholera toxin (Sigma) and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine, which results in a permanent increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration (12Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol.

Enzymatic Assays—Freshly harvested fibroblasts were exposed to ultrasound energy at 0 °C and used immediately. All enzymatic assays were performed on the total cell lysate. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined as described (20Cooperstein S.J. Lazarow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V max of rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, measured with decylubiquinone as substrate, was obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots as described (12Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17578-17582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The V max of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase was obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots using decylubiquinol as substrate as described (21Boffoli D. Scacco S.C. Vergari R. Persio M.T. Solarino G. Laforgia R. Papa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 66-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Procedures—Mitoplasts (inner membrane matrix fraction of mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane) were prepared from cells as described previously (12Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17578-17582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF, 500 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Two-dimensional gel analysis (blue native PAGE/SDS-PAGE) of purified bovine heart mitochondria and mitoplasts from fibroblasts was carried out as described previously (12Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17578-17582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After the second dimension (SDS-PAGE), gels were either silver-stained or transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunoblotting of subunits of complexes as described (12Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A.M. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol.

Rabbit antisera raised against either the 20 residues of amino terminus or the 20 residues of C terminus with phosphorylated Ser131 of the mature protein were produced to our specifications and purchased from Neosystem, Strasbourg, France. Monoclonal antibodies against the NDUFA9, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, NDUFB6, NDUFS5, and NDUFA6 subunits of complex I, the core II subunit of complex III, and the β subunit of complex V were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). The NDUFA5 antibody was kindly provided by Prof. J. E. Walker. Extraction of RNA from Cultured Fibroblasts and Northern Blot Analysis—The steady-state level of the NDUFS4 transcript in the NDUFS4 mutated patients was assayed by filter hybridization on 10 μg of total RNA from 8–10 × 106 cultured fibroblasts. RNA samples were loaded on a 6.6% formaldehyde-1.2% agarose horizontal gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences), and then hybridized using ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (Clontech) with a PCR-prepared NDUFS4 cDNA probe labeled by random priming at a specific activity of 1.5–2 × 109 cpm/μg. The same blot was used for successive hybridization with a β-actin cDNA control probe that revealed the presence of a single 2-kb band in all lanes. The transcript signals were analyzed by using a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX. Synthesis of cDNA and Quantitative Real Time PCR of NDUFS4 Transcript from the Three NDUFS4-mutated Patients—Aliquots of total RNA from cultured fibroblasts extracted by TRIzol® (Invitrogen) were reverse-transcribed by using the oligo-dT primer with avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase RNaseH minus (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The determination of the expression profile of the NDUFS4 transcript was performed by two-step reverse transcription PCR and online measurement of PCR products based on the use of QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Cologne, Germany) with BIORAD instrument iCycler iQ, version 2.033 (Bio-Rad). The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing an aliquot of 2.5 μl of each cDNA, 7.5 pmol of primers, and 12.5 μl of QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit in a iCYCLER. The NDUFS4 amplicon was generated by use of the forward primer Real-F-30 (5′-GTGGTACTGAGGCAGACGTTGT-3′) and the reverse primer R-143 (5′-GTCCTGTGCCAATCTCCATGTG-3′). The PCR conditions were 20 s at 94°, 30 s at 59 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C for 45 cycles. For the amplification of GAPDH, 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; nt, nucleotide(s); contig, group of overlapping clones. we used the primers F-5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′ and R-5′-CATGGGTGGAATCATATTGGAA-3′. Each sample was run in duplicate, and the results reported represent the mean of two different sets of experiments. The PCR program was followed by a melting curve program consisting of a continuous measuring step at 0.5 °C/s up to 95 °C. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis—Primary fibroblasts from patient 2 were grown to 80% confluence in five 100-mm cell culture dishes in the same medium described above. 100 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) was added to the medium in four dishes and incubated for 12 h. Then, in three dishes, phosphate-buffered saline washes and medium replacement were performed 4, 8, and 12 h after the treatment had started. Total RNA was extracted from fibroblasts of each dish and used for reverse transcription PCR analysis as described above. Primers for PCR of the entire NDUFS4 coding region were the same as described (17Petruzzella V. Vergari R. Puzziferri I. Boffoli D. Lamantea E. Zeviani M. Papa S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA levels were quantified by the Bio-Rad VersaDoc imaging system and “volume analysis tools” of the Quantity One software, and the ratio of the signal intensities of the NDUFS4 band relative to those of the GAPDH band was determined for each lane. Activity of Respiratory Complexes—Fibroblasts of patients 1 and 2 showed a decrease of the V max of complex I activity as compared with that of the control fibroblasts (Fig. 2a). In both patients, unlike in the controls, the activity of complex I was insensitive to activation by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation induced by cholera toxin (see also Ref. 18Papa S. Scacco S Sardanelli A.M. Vergari R Papa F. Budde S. Van den Heuvel L. Smeitink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 489: 259-262Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In patient 3 the activity of complex I was not measurable either in the absence or presence of cAMP. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase was not diminished in the patients' fibroblasts as compared with controls (see legend to Fig. 2). The kinetic parameters of the antimycin-sensitive ubiquinone-cytochrome c oxidoreductase of complex III of the respiratory chain was also analyzed. The fibroblasts from the three patients harboring the NDUFS4 mutations showed some decrease of the V max (Fig. 2b). Our statistical analysis shows, however, that the differences in the kinetic parameters between controls and patients were not significant. These data call for more caution in interpreting the apparent decrease of complex III activity, as evidence exists supporting the possibility that alterations in the NDUFS4 gene product may affect complex III (16Budde S.M. van den Heuvel L.P. Janssen A.J. Smeets R.J. Buskens C.A. DeMeirleir L. Van Coster R. Baethmann M. Voit T. Trijbels J.M. Smeitink J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Assembly of the Respiratory Complexes—Two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE was used to examine the assembly of the respiratory complexes and the F0F1 ATP synthase (complex V) of mitoplasts from fibroblast cultures of control subjects and patients. Coomassie staining of bovine heart mitochondria was carried out to reveal the separation of oxidative phosphorylation complexes and their relative position in the native blue-PAGE (Fig. 3a). A functional complex I, which was directly detected on the first dimension native gel by the specific reagent nitro-blue tetrazolium (22Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) in the case of the control mitoplasts, did not reach a level of activity detectable in the gels of the mitoplasts from the three patients (Fig. 3b). When the constituent subunits of the complexes were resolved in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE) in all three patients, no normally assembled subunits of complex I could be detected by silver-staining in the position in which they appeared in the control fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Weak silver-stained subunit-bands of the complex were, however, seen lined up in a position closer to complex V. The result was verified by subunit immunostaining of the complexes. As expected, an antibody against the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of the 18-kDa subunit showed that this segment of the protein was absent in all the patients, both in the normal and lower molecular weight position of complex I (Fig. 5a). In addition, an antibody against the amino-terminal segment of the 18-kDa subunit also showed that this segment of the protein was absent in all the patients either at the normal or the lower molecular weight position of complex I (Fig. 5b). Immunodetection of the NDUFA5 subunit of complex I showed that this also moved in all three patients from its normal position, in the control fibroblasts, to the lower molecular weight position of the complex closer to complex V, whose β-subunit was detected by its specific antibody. Immuno-decoration with specific antibodies revealed that the subunits of complex I encoded by the nuclear genes NDUFA9, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, NDUFB6, NDUFS5, and NDUFA6 also moved to the same lower molecular weight sub-complex position (data not shown). In contrast, the position of complex III relative to complex V did not change in the three patients as shown by both the silver-staining and the immunodetection of the core II subunit of this complex (Figs. 4 and 5).Fig. 4Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of bovine heart mitochondria (BHM) and mitoplasts from control child and patient fibroblasts. Respiratory complexes (I, III, and IV) and ATP synthase (V) were separated by blue native electrophoresis, and their constituent subunits were resolved in a second dimension by SDS-PAGE.

Respiratory complexes (I, III, and IV) and ATP synthase (V) separated by blue native electrophoresis and resolved in their subunits in a second dimension by SDS-PAGE were blotted onto nitrocellulose and tested with different antibodies. The positions of subunits of complexes I, III, and V were detected by specific antibodies against the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus (a) and the amino terminus (b) of the NDUFS4 and NDUFA5 subunits (a and b), the core II subunit of complex III (a and b), and the β-subunit of complex V (a and b). According to its relative position to complex V, complex I exhibited in the three patients a molecular mass ≈200 kDa lower as compared with those in bovine heart mitochondria and control fibroblasts. For further details see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By double immunoblotting the 18-kDa subunit with specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of the carboxyl terminus and the amino terminus of the subunit, we found that, not only in the case of nonsense mutation (patient 3) as expected but also in the case of the other mutations (patients 1 and 2), the amino terminus segment of the protein could not be detected in the total fibroblast extracts, in addition to the absence of the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6). Steady-state Level of the NDUFS4 Gene Transcript—To assess the steady-state amount of NDUFS4 mRNA in the three patients, a Northern blot was performed on total RNA samples extracted from the fibroblasts of a normal child and the fibroblasts of the three NDUFS4 mutant patients. The Northern blot was hybridized with a labeled PCR fragment corresponding to the entire NDUFS4 cDNA and then probed for the nuclear encoded cytoplasmic β-actin gene, which estimates the amount of total RNA loaded. Although in the fibroblasts of patients 1 and 3 the expected NDUFS4 transcript (∼650 nt) showed a level practically equal to that of control fibroblasts, it was not detectable in the fibroblasts of patient 2 (Fig. 7A). This finding was confirmed by quantification of the NDUFS4 transcript by real time PCR, which enabled determination of the NDUFS4 transcript with respect to the GAPDH transcript used as an internal reference. The PCR results showed that, although the relative amount of the NDUFS4 transcript in the fibroblasts of patients 1 and 3 was the same as that in the control fibroblasts, it was reduced to ∼30% of the control in patient 2 (Fig. 7B). To determine whether nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) was induced in the NDUFS4 transcript that harbored the W97X nonsense mutation, primary fibroblasts from patient 2 carrying the premature termination codon were exposed to puromycin. This protein synthesis inhibitor has been shown to inhibit NMD (23Iborra F.J. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Science. 2001; 5532: 1139-1142Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Puromycin fully restored the NDUFS4 mRNA level in the cells of patient 2, whereas the removal of the protein inhibitor gradually restored the amount of the transcript to a level comparable with that of the untreated cells (0 h) (Fig. 7C). In patients with complex I deficiency, mutations in the nuclear encoded subunits of the complex have been found in six genes. The NDUFS4 gene is one of the most “hit” (with mutations) among these genes (14Petruzzella V. Papa S. Gene. 2002; 286: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Searching with the NDUFS4 cDNA sequence by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool Nucleotide (BLASTN) in the Human Genome Resources web site, two contigs derived from assembled genomic sequence data, including both draft and finished sequences, have been identified. The contigs NT006693 (147208 nt) and 12731439 (122694 nt), not full-length and found at NCBI and Celera, respectively, are split into five exons following the AG/GT rule. Each of the first two introns spans for ∼42 kb, thus accounting for the large size of the overall gene. A BLAST search in the EST data base (dbEST) has disclosed several cDNA clones extending the length of the published 5′-UTR to a size of at least 24 nt. Our results show that the three different mutations detected in the NDUFS4 gene in the three patients in the homozygous state (Fig. 1) were all associated with the following: (i) depression of the V max of the normal rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which was insensitive to cAMP stimulation; (ii) defective assembly of the complex, with the appearance of a non-functional lower molecular weight subcomplex; and (iii) undetectability of both the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus (as expected from the mutations) and the amino terminus. Disappearance of the amino-terminal segment was expected in the case of nonsense mutation (patient 3) but not in the other two cases, i.e. in the 5-bp duplication of the cDNA at position 466–470 (AAGTC) (patient 1) and the point deletion at position 289/290, introducing a stop codon corresponding to position 97 of the protein (patient 2) (Fig. 1). Quantitative analysis of the NDUFS4 transcript showed that, although in the fibroblasts of patients 1 and 3 its level was practically equal to that of control fibroblasts, it was much lower in the fibroblasts of patient 2. These findings show that the deletion at position 289/290, leading to introduction of a stop codon, can result in a transcript that is rapidly degraded with suppression of the synthesis of the truncated 18-kDa subunit. The low level of NDUFS4 mRNA appears to be due to the elicitation of a mechanism of NMD (24Culbertson M.R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), a mechanism of quality control that ensures fidelity of gene expression. This is an RNA surveillance pathway that detects and destroys aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons (see also Refs. 25Wagner E Lykke-Andersen J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 26Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The 289/290 mutation, which introduces a stop codon in the open reading frame of patient 2, is located 60/61 nt upstream of the junction between exon 3 and 4 (Fig. 1) and is therefore a candidate for NMD (25Wagner E Lykke-Andersen J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The NDUFS4 mRNA steady-state level was, on the other hand, not affected in the other two mutations in the gene. In these cases the transcripts, even those with an altered sequence, maintained a level corresponding to the wild-type transcript. In the case of patient 3, the mutation makes possible the synthesis of only the first 14 amino acids of the mitochondrial targeting pre-sequence so that a functional or even a partially functional mitochondrial protein cannot be generated. This nonsense mutation falls within the first half of exon 1, and an in-frame AUG resides 213 nt after the premature termination codon (Fig. 1) which could protect the transcript from NMD (27Zhang J. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Translation of this aberrant mRNA could lead to the production of an amino-terminal truncated NDUFS4 altered protein that, however, would be unable to localize into mitochondria because of the lack of the entire mitochondrial targeting sequence encoded by exons 1 and 2. The absence of the putative protein product of the mutated gene of patient 1 harboring the 5-bp duplication (Fig. 1) could be due to a defective translation of the mutated transcript and/or proteolytic degradation of this long translated product. Proteolytic systems regulate the stability of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins (28Langer T. Kaser M. Klanner C. Leonhard K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One role of these systems is the removal of non-assembled polypeptides from mitochondrial membranes (28Langer T. Kaser M. Klanner C. Leonhard K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Leonhard K. Guiard B. Pellecchia G. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the occurrence of a multi-step quality control process at the transcriptional and/or the posttranscriptional level that avoids the presence in the cell of abnormal polypeptides resulting from mutations in the NDUFS4 gene. The lack of the expression of a wild-type 18-kDa subunit of complex I prevents the assembly of a normal functional complex of ≈1000 kDa. A defective sub-complex of an apparent molecular mass of ≈800 kDa is apparently formed in all the three NDUFS4 mutant fibroblasts. This complex, which was still associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, showed a low, if any, level of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. Evidence has been presented for the stepwise assembly in the N. crassa complex I (30Schulte U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Impact of mutations in mammalian structural genes on the assembly of complex I has been described for the nuclear NDUFA1 gene (31Yadava N. Potluri P. Smith E.N. Bisevac A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21221-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and for the mitochondrial ND6 (32Bai Y. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4848-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and ND4 (33Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our finding of an apparently normal assembly and redox activity of complex III in patients harboring three different NDUFS4 mutations in the homozygous state seems to exclude an impact of this complex I gene on the structure/function of complex III. This conclusion is supported by a mutational analysis of the NDUFS4 gene that we carried out on a different cohort of 20 patients with a combined complex I and complex III deficiency detected in muscle samples. No mutations were in fact found in the NDUFS4 gene of this group of patients. A defect in the activity of the complex can result in a deficiency of the overall process of oxidative phosphorylation (10Papa S. Sardanelli A.M. Scacco S. Petruzzella V. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Vergari R. Signorile A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Papa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) This will be extremely deleterious in cells with high and variable energy demand, like those of brain regions, heart, and skeletal muscle. This and the large number of genes coding for constituent subunits, as well the possible existence of assembly genes (34Janssen R. Smeitink J. Smeets R van Den Heuvel L. Hum. Genet. 2002; 110: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), seems to explain why deficiency of complex I represents the most frequent of the human mitochondrial hereditary disorders of oxidative phosphorylation (≈ 40% of disorders with an estimated occurrence of 1:10,000 live births). This could also be related to the finding of complex I deficiency in aging and neurodegenerative age-associated disorders (35Lenaz G. Cavazzoni M. Genova M.L. D'Aurelio M. Pich M.M. Pallotti F.

We have cloned a hexokinase gene, PpHXK1, in the moss Physcomitrella patens where gene function can be studied directly by gene targeting. PpHxk1 is a novel type of chloroplast stromal hexokinase that differs from previously studied membrane-bound plant hexokinases. Enzyme assays on a knock-out mutant revealed that PpHxk1 is the major glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in Physcomitrella, accounting for 80% of the total activity in protonemal tissue. The mutant is deficient in the response to glucose, which in wild type moss induces the formation of caulonemal filaments that protrude from the edge of the colony. Growth on glucose in the dark is strongly reduced in the mutant. Sequence data suggest that most plants including Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis have both chloroplast-imported hexokinases similar to PpHxk1 and traditional membrane-bound hexokinases. We propose that the two types of plant hexokinases have distinct physiological roles.

Biochemical experiments suggest that there are several hexokinases in plants that differ in their intracellular locations. Thus, in addition to a cytosolic activity, hexokinases have been reported to be associated with mitochondria (1Cosio E. Bustamante E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wiese A. Gröner F. Sonnewald U. Deppner H. Lerchl J. Hebbeker U. Flügge U. Weber A.

Acta. 1978; 544: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Plant hexokinases that have been cloned and studied in some detail include Arabidopsis AtHxk1 and AtHxk2 (7Jang J.C. Léon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), spinach SoHxK1 (2Wiese A. Gröner F. Sonnewald U. Deppner H. Lerchl J. Hebbeker U. Flügge U. Weber A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and potato StHK1 and StHK2 (8Veramendi J. Roessner U. Renz A. Willmitzer L. Trethewey R.N. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 121: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Veramendi J. Fernie A.R. Leisse A. Willmitzer L. Trethewey R.N. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All of these plant hexokinases share an N-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor, which is not present in yeast and animal hexokinases. The intracellular location has been studied for SoHxK1, which is inserted into the outer envelope membrane of the chloroplast, facing the cytoplasmic side (2Wiese A. Gröner F. Sonnewald U. Deppner H. Lerchl J. Hebbeker U. Flügge U. Weber A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This insertion is mediated by the N-terminal membrane anchor that is conserved in AtHxk1, AtHxk2, StHK1, and StHK2 (2Wiese A. Gröner F. Sonnewald U. Deppner H. Lerchl J. Hebbeker U. Flügge U. Weber A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Veramendi J. Fernie A.R. Leisse A. Willmitzer L. Trethewey R.N. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that these other plant hexokinases also are membrane-bound, similar to SoHxK1. In addition to its enzymatic role, hexokinase has been implicated in sugar sensing and signaling in several organisms (10Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Frommer W.B. Schultze W.X. Lalonde S. Science. 2003; 300: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This notion originated with the finding that hexokinase is essential for glucose repression (12Entian K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), a key regulatory mechanism in yeast (13Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 14Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, attempts to identify the glucose-dependent signal that is transmitted by hexokinase have so far failed and its role in glucose repression is still not fully understood (15Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 183-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, sugars act as regulatory signals at several points in the life cycle (16Rolland F. Moore B. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S185-S205Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and can also repress a number of genes involved in, for example, photosynthesis (17Jang J.C. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plants that overexpress hexokinase are sugar hypersensitive, whereas plants expressing hexokinase antisense RNA show hyposensitivity to sugars (7Jang J.C. Léon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that plant hexokinases play a role in sugar sensing or signaling that is analogous to the role of yeast hexokinase in glucose repression (7Jang J.C. Léon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, this notion was challenged by Halford et al. (18Halford N.G. Purcell P.C. Hardie D.G. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) who pointed out that many sugar-responsive processes are affected by changes in the ATP level. Some effects cited as evidence of a role for hexokinase in sugar sensing could therefore just reflect its function as a rate-limiting enzyme in glucose metabolism. The question regarding the role of plant hexokinases in sugar sensing is complex (19Moore B. Sheen J. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Hardie D.G. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 251PubMed Google Scholar), but recent experiments with AtHxk1 point mutations support distinct metabolic and signaling functions for this enzyme (21Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.-H. Liu Y.-X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The moss Physcomitrella patens has recently emerged as a powerful model system in plant functional genomics following the discovery that gene targeting works in it with frequencies comparable with those in yeast (22Schaefer D. Zrÿd J.-P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 2001; 127: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Schaefer D. Ann. Rev. Biol. 2002; 53: 477-501Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the main vegetative phase of Physcomitrella is the haploid gametophyte, which makes it possible to study the phenotypes of knock-outs directly without further crosses. To study the function of hexokinases in plants, we have cloned a full-length cDNA and gene, PpHXK1, encoding a hexokinase in Physcomitrella. PpHxk1 is a novel type of chloroplast stromal hexokinase, which differs from the membrane-associated enzymes represented by SoHxK1. Enzyme assays on a knock-out mutant revealed that PpHxk1 is the major glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in Physcomitrella, accounting for 80% of the total activity in extracts. The hxk1 knock-out mutant is deficient in a response to intermediate levels of glucose, which involves the induction of caulonemal filaments that protrude from the colony. Growth on glucose in the dark is also severely impaired in the mutant. Sequence data suggest that both chloroplast stromal hexokinases similar to PpHxk1 and traditional membrane-bound hexokinases are present in most plants. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—The standard growth conditions used in this work were growth at 25 °C under constant light in a Sanyo MLR-350 light chamber with irradiation (2000 lux) from the sides. Subculturing of P. patens protonemal tissue was done on cellophane-covered BCD medium (1 mm MgSO4, 1.85 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm KNO3, 45 μm FeSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1× Hoagland′s number 2 solution, and 0.8% agar) supplemented with 5 mm ammonium tartrate. For functional studies, moss was grown on ammonium-free BCD plates with different additives. Cloning of the PpHXK1 cDNA and Gene—The Codehop software (24Rose T.M. Schultz E.R. Henikoff J.G. Pietrokovski S. McCallum C.M. Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1628-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) was used to design degenerate PCR primers based on previously known plant hexokinase sequences. Using Physcomitrella genomic DNA as the template, the primers HXKdeg-5′ and HXKdeg-3′ (Table I) were used to amplify a 1075-bp fragment, which was cloned into the TA-cloning vector pCR®2.1, producing plasmid pTO1 (Table 2). The sequence of this fragment was used to design gene-specific primers for 5′-RACE 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. and 3′-RACE. The RACE products were assembled to a PpHXK1 cDNA sequence, and based on that sequence, the primers PpHXK1–5′A and PpHXK1–3′A (Table I) were used to clone a full-length cDNA fragment into the TA-cloning vector pCR®2.1, thus producing plasmid pTO5. The same primer pair was also used to clone the PpHXK1 gene into the TA-cloning vector pCR®2.1, thus producing plasmid pTO6.Table IOligonucleotidesNameSequence (5′ → 3′)HXKdeg-5′caatggaattctgatgagatggacnaarggnttHXKdeg-3′cacccgtcgcacaatctcnccnadrtaPpHXK1-5′AgctctctgagcctcacctccctcgctccctPpHXK1-3′AcgcccagctccatcaccccacaatcacctcPpHXK1-5′BcgcatgctatgtcgaacgtgccgatgcPpHXK1-3′BctggtcccctggattgacgctgtctttgtcPpHXK1-RT-5′ggaactgtttggtggcaatgtccPpHXK1-RT-3′acaacgacttgaagaacggcgtgPpHXK1/GFP-5′AccagatctcgggtagcaatggcgaPpHXK1/GFP-5′BaagatcttgtctatgtcggttcagPpHXK1/GFP-3′Cgcggcacagatctcagaaccatcg Open table in a new tab Table IIPlasmidsPlasmidInsertpTO1Original PpHXK1 genomic PCR fragmentpTO4PpHXK-targeting constructpTO5PpHXK1 cDNApTO6PpHXK1 genepUBW302G418 resistance cassettepsmRS-GFPGFP expression cassette (P35S-GFP-TNOS1)pMT147PpHXK1 (codons 1-498) fused to GFPpMT148PpHXK1 (codons 38-498) fused to GFP Open table in a new tab GFP Fusions and Localization Studies—The vector psmRS-GFP (25Davis S.J. Vierstra R.D. Weeds World. 1996; 3: 43-48Google Scholar) is a pUC118 based plasmid carrying the 35S promoter in front of a soluble modified red-shifted GFP followed by the NOS1 terminator. Primers with BglII sites were designed to facilitate sticky end ligation of PCR products into a unique BamHI site located between the 35S promoter and the red-shifted GFP-coding region. The primers PpHXK1/GFP-5′A and PpHXK1/GFP-3′C (Table I) were used to amplify a 1525-bp PpHXK1 fragment that after BglII digestion and cloning into the BamHI site of psmRS-GFP produced pMT147, encoding a PpHXK1-(1–498)-GFP translational fusion. The primers PpHXK1/GFP-5′B and PpHXK1/GFP-3′C (Table I) were used to amplify a 1405-bp PpHXK1 fragment that after BglII digestion and cloning into the BamHI site of psmRS-GFP produced pMT148, encoding a PpHXK1-(38–498)-GFP translational fusion. Constructs were transiently introduced into wild type protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation (26Schaefer D. Zrÿd J.-P. Knight C. Cove D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two days after transformation, they were analyzed in a Zeiss Axioskop 2 mot fluorescence light microscope. The GFP signal was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (excitation 480 nm, emission 535 nm, dichronic beamsplitter 505 nm), while chloroplast autofluorescence was detected using a TRITC filter (excitation 535 nm, emission 620 nm, dichronic beamsplitter 565 nm). For each construct, all of the protoplasts analyzed without exception showed the same fluorescence pattern. Targeted Disruption of the PpHXK1 Gene—To disrupt the PpHXK1 gene, a 1971-bp selection cassette was blunt end-ligated into the BsrGI site of pTO1 to produce plasmid pTO4. The selection cassette was excised with BamHI and HindIII from pUBW302 and consists of the nptII gene expressed from the 35S promoter using the octopine synthase terminator. Prior to transformation, pTO4 was linearized with BamHI and XhoI, thus producing a 3137-bp fragment having 692 bp and 473 bp of PpHXK1 DNA flanking the selection cassette on each side (Fig. 2A). Moss protoplasts were transformed by the polyethylene glycol method of Schaefer et al. (26Schaefer D. Zrÿd J.-P. Knight C. Cove D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and stable transformants were selected in the presence of 50 mg/liter Geneticin (Sigma). PCR and Northern blot analysis were used to verify the gene disruption. The PpHXK1-specific primers used for PCR were PpHXK1–5′B and PpHXK1–3′B (Table I). Southern and Northern Blot Analysis—P. patens genomic DNA was isolated from young protonemal tissue and digested to completion with HindIII, BglII, or EcoRI. Using standard blotting procedures, the DNA was transferred to a nylon filter that was UV cross-linked. The filter was hybridized in rapid-hyb buffer (RPN1636, Amersham Biosciences) to a 32P-labeled probe for 4 h at 63 °C and then washed with 0.5 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 63 °C. A 460-bp PstI-SphI fragment from the PpHXK1 cDNA was used as the probe. Hybridizing bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager. Northern blot analysis was carried out with total RNA from young protonemal tissue grown on BCD medium under standard conditions. Approximately, 30 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane. The probe template was a 586-bp PstI-BglII fragment from the PpHXK1 cDNA. Ethidium bromide staining of rRNA was used to check for equal loading of RNA in each lane. Isolation and Fractionation of Chloroplasts—Protoplasts were produced by the digestion of 2–4 g of young protonemal tissue for 30 min in 1% driselase (Sigma, D9515), 8% mannitol. The protoplasts were then separated from undigested material by filtration through a 100-μm nylon mesh, and after several washes in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.3 m mannitol), they were disrupted by forcing them through a 15-μm nylon mesh. The disrupted protoplasts were loaded onto a Percoll step gradient in buffer A (10:30:60% v/v). After centrifugation in a swing-out rotor for 10 min at 4450 × g, the major chloroplast band was collected at the interphase between 60 and 30% Percoll. The chloroplasts were washed in buffer A to remove the Percoll and were then redissolved in 4 ml of buffer A. Phase-contrast light microscopy was used to confirm that the collected fraction consisted of chloroplasts and that most of them were still intact. Half of the chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and then solubilized in 2 ml of buffer AT (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm to produce a chloroplast extract. The total protein content in the extract was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad 500–0006). The remaining half of the chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and redissolved in 2 ml of buffer B lacking mannitol (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl, and 1 mm EDTA), which causes osmotic lysis of the chloroplasts as confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy. Chloroplast membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected as the chloroplast stroma extract. The membrane pellet was solubilized in 2 ml of buffer AT, after which debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, thus producing the chloroplast membrane fraction. Extracts were assayed for glucose-phosphorylating activity as soon as possible after preparation since we found that the activity in chloroplast membrane-containing fractions declined rapidly with time. Hexokinase Assays—The protocol was adopted from Wiese et al (2Wiese A. Gröner F. Sonnewald U. Deppner H. Lerchl J. Hebbeker U. Flügge U. Weber A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To prepare crude cellular extracts, young protonemal tissue (400 mg) grown on cellophane-covered BCD plates was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and then further homogenized in 2 ml of AT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The total protein content of the crude extract was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad 500–0006). To assay glucose-phosphorylating activity, extracts (crude, chloroplast, chloroplast stroma, or chloroplast membranes) were diluted to a total volume of 100 μl in 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.8 mm NADP, 0.2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma G5760), and 10 mm glucose. To assay fructose-phosphorylating activity, 0.2 units of phosphoglucose isomerase (128139, Roche Applied Science) was added and the substrate was changed from glucose to 10 mm fructose. Furthermore, a different preparation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma G8529) was used to minimize the extract-independent background. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min unless stated otherwise, after which the NADPH formed was measured at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6200 m–1. The NADPH values were in turn converted into moles of glucose-6-phosphate formed. Phenotypic Analysis—For colony morphology studies, protonemal tissue was precultured for 1 week on cellophane-covered ammonium-free BCD medium. Small pieces of fresh protonemal tissue (∼2 mm in diameter) were then transferred onto ammonium-free BCD plates without cellophane, containing various additives as described in the figures. The colonies were cultivated in constant light for 21 days and then photographed using a dissecting microscope. To analyze the morphology of dark grown colonies, small pieces of fresh protonemal tissue (∼2 mm in diameter) were inoculated on BCD plates supplemented with 0.05 m or 0.15 m glucose. The colonies were grown under standard conditions for 7 days. The plates were then placed vertically and cultivated in darkness for additionally 30 days before being photographed using a dissecting microscope. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of mRNA levels—Young protonemal tissue cultivated for 7 days on cellophane-covered BCD plates under standard growth conditions was transferred by disc lifts to tester plates. The conditions tested included growth in the dark or under intense light (6000 lux) and growth in the presence of 0.2 m glucose or 0.2 m mannitol. Each treatment was done in triplicate. After 24 h of treatment, the tissue was harvested and total RNA was isolated. Expression levels were measured as the ratio between the transcript-dependent RT-PCR product in 1 μg of total RNA and an internal standard product. The internal standard is added as in vitro transcribed RNA that is amplified with the same primer pair as the transcript of interest but produces a differently sized product (27Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The primers used were PpHXK1-RT-5′ and PpHXK1-RT-3′ (Table I). Cloning and Characterization of the PpHXK1 cDNA and Gene—Based on published hexokinase sequences from plants, we designed degenerate primers that were used in a PCR with P. patens genomic DNA as the template. Using this approach, we cloned several short fragments, one of which was derived from a gene that we named PpHXK1 and which shows clear homology to other hexokinases. PpHXK1-specific primers were then used with cDNA from moss grown under standard conditions in 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions. Based on the sequences of the resulting products, we could design the primers 5′A and 3′A (Table I), which were used to amplify a full-length cDNA clone and the corresponding gene. Several Physcomitrella genes have been found to have a gene organization that is identical to their higher plant homologs (23Schaefer D. Ann. Rev. Biol. 2002; 53: 477-501Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we found that the exon/intron distribution of PpHXK1 (Fig. 1A) is identical to that of the Arabidopsis AtHXK2 gene (7Jang J.C. Léon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To determine whether there are any other genes in the Physcomitrella genome that are closely related to PpHXK1, we performed a low stringency Southern blot with a cDNA probe recognizing the 3′ half of the PpHXK1-coding sequence. We found a single strongly hybridizing band in each lane that matched the size expected for the PpHXK1 gene (data not shown). In some lanes, there was also an additional faint band, indicating the presence of another more distantly related hexokinase gene. This finding is consistent with our recovery of other hexokinase-encoding sequences in the initial PCR reaction. An evolutionary tree based on pairwise amino acid sequence comparisons (Fig. 1B) places PpHxk1 among the other plant hexokinases. It is 85% similar and 53% identical in sequence to the Arabidopsis AtHxk1 and AtHxk2 proteins, whereas a comparison to the yeast Hxk2 protein yielded 72% similar and 34% identical residues. PpHxk1 Is the Major Glucose-phosphorylating Enzyme in Young Protonemal Tissue—To investigate the function of PpHXK1, we made a disruption construct (Fig. 2A) that was used to knock out the gene (26Schaefer D. Zrÿd J.-P. Knight C. Cove D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The presence of the desired gene disruptions in moss chromosomal DNA was verified by PCR (Fig. 2B), and the disappearance of the PpHXK1 transcript was confirmed in Northern blots (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the PCR analysis revealed that one of the knock-outs was a clean single copy insertion of the disruption marker. This is unusual in Physcomitrella where most knock-out mutants carry multiple tandem repeats of the inserted marker (23Schaefer D. Ann. Rev. Biol. 2002; 53: 477-501Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An initial phenotypic characterization was carried out with three independent knock-outs. Since these three mutants had the same phenotypes, further experiments were restricted to the single copy insertion mutant, which is referred to as the hxk1 mutant below. We proceeded to test whether we could detect a difference in glucose-phosphorylating activity between extracts of young protonemal tissue derived from the hxk1 mutant and the wild type. Using standard growth conditions, we found that wild type extracts have a glucose-phosphorylating activity of 40 pmol/min and μg of total protein. This activity is linear in the amount of added protein below 5 μg (Fig. 3A) and also linear in time (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we further found that most of this activity is absent in extracts from the hxk1 mutant (Fig. 3B). However, it should be noted that some glucose-phosphorylating activity remains in the hxk1 mutant and that this activity also is linear in the amount of added protein (Fig. 3A) and time (Fig. 3B). This indicates the presence of one or several minor hexokinases in addition to PpHxk1. The residual glucose-phosphorylating activity in the hxk1 mutant is 8.6 pmol/min and μg of protein, which accounts for 22% of the wild type activity. We conclude that PpHxk1 is the major glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in young protonemal tissue, accounting for 78% of the total glucokinase activity in these cells. Many hexokinases have a dual specificity for glucose and fructose. Therefore, we proceeded to assay fructokinase activity in protonemal extracts from the wild type and the hxk1 mutant (Fig. 3, C and D). As shown in Fig. 3D, we found that the fructokinase activity is 24.7 pmol/min and μg of total protein in the wild type and 13.0 pmol/min and μg of total protein in the hxk1 mutant. We conclude that PpHxk1 can phosphorylate both glucose and fructose and that it contributes 47% of the total fructokinase activity in protonemal tissue. The comparatively smaller effect of the hxk1 mutation on fructose phosphorylation does not necessarily mean that fructose is a less preferred substrate for PpHxk1 than glucose, because plants in addition to classical hexokinases like those in animals and fungi also possess specific fructokinases, which are more distantly related to the hexokinases. Therefore, it is probable that the effect of the hxk1 mutation on fructose phosphorylation in part is obscured by the presence of such specific fructokinases in the extracts. PpHxk1 Is a Chloroplast Stromal Enzyme Whose Import Depends on an N-terminal Transit Peptide—The presence of an N-terminal extension in PpHxk1, which is absent from AtHxk1 and AtHxk2, prompted us to analyze the PpHxk1 sequence using the TargetP software for prediction of subcellular localization (29Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). The result suggested that PpHxk1 could be a chloroplast-imported protein with a possible transit peptide cleavage site after amino acid residue 37 (30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we made plasmids in which different PpHxk1 fragments expressed from the 35S promoter were fused in-frame to the GFP. These constructs were transiently transformed into wild type Physcomitrella protoplasts after which the pattern of GFP fluorescence was analyzed. Chlorophyll autofluorescence was used as a chloroplast marker. As shown in Fig. 4, GFP alone resides in the cytoplasm and is clearly excluded from the chloroplasts. In contrast, when GFP is fused to an almost full-length PpHxk1 (amino acid residues 1–498), the fluorescence overlaps with the chlorophyll autofluorescence but is undetectable in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, a truncated PpHxk1-GFP fusion that lacks the predicted signal peptide (amino acid residues 1–37) shows a clear cytoplasmic localization similar to GFP alone and is excluded from the chloroplasts (Fig. 4). In conclusion, PpHxk1 is a chloroplast-imported enzyme whose localization depends on an N-terminal transit peptide. To confirm and further pinpoint the subcellular localization of PpHxk1, we isolated chloroplasts from wild type and hxk1 mutant protonemal tissue as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified chloroplasts were subjected to osmotic lysis and separated into soluble and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation. The glucose-phosphorylating activity was then assayed in the crude extracts, in the purified chloroplasts, and in the chloroplast-soluble and membrane fractions. As shown in Fig. 5, we found that 80% of the total activity in crude extracts disappears in the hxk1 mutant, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 3. In the purified chloroplasts, PpHxk1 is further enriched, accounting for 85% of the glucosephosphorylating activity. Interestingly, the PpHxk1-dependent activity is exclusively found in the soluble chloroplast fraction, indicating that PpHxk1 is a stromal enzyme. Furthermore, PpHxk1 seems to be the only glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in the chloroplast stroma because 98% of the stromal activity disappears in the hxk1 mutant (Fig. 5). In contrast, the much lower glucose-phosphorylating activity that is found in the chloroplast membrane fraction is not significantly affected in the hxk1 mutant, indicating that PpHxk1 does not contribute to this activity.

Identification of a flavonol methylating activity, partial purification of the enzyme, and sequencing of the corresponding peptide fragments revealed a novel S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that was specific for flavonoids and caffeoyl-CoA. Cloning and functional expression of the corresponding cDNA verified that the new methyltransferase is a multifunctional 26.6-kDa Mg2+-dependent enzyme, which shows a significant sequence similarity to the cluster of caffeoyl coenzyme A-methylating enzymes. Functional analysis of highly homologous members from chickweed (Stellaria longipes), Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) demonstrated that the enzymes from the ice plant, chickweed, and A. thaliana possess a broader substrate specificity toward o-hydroquinone-like structures than previously anticipated for Mg2+-dependent O-methyltransferases, and are distinctly different from the tobacco enzyme. Besides caffeoyl-CoA and flavonols, a high specificity was also observed for caffeoylglucose, a compound never before reported to be methylated by any plant O-methyltransferase. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence and differences in acceptor specificities among both animal and plant O-methyltransferases, we propose that the enzymes from the Centrospermae, along with the predicted gene product from A. thaliana, form a novel subclass within the caffeoyl coenzyme A-dependent O-methyltransferases, with potential divergent functions not restricted to lignin monomer biosynthesis.

Methylation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; PFOMT, Mg2+-dependent phenylpropanoid and flavonoid O-methyltransferase from the ice plant; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl coenzyme-A dependent O-methyltransferase; OMT, O-methyltransferases; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ES, electrospray. dependent O-methyltransferases (OMTs) (EC 2.1.1) is a common modification in natural product biosynthesis. Site-specific O-methylation modulates the physiological properties of such compounds and reduces the chemical reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl groups (1Zhu B.T. Ezell E.L. Liehr J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 292-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, O-methylation is also required for monolignol biosynthesis and accounts for the structural differences and properties of lignin, which next to cellulose is the most prominent polymer on earth (2Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Stafford H. Ibrahim R.K. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. Plenum Press, New York1992: 325-375Crossref Google Scholar). Plant OMTs can be categorized into two major classes (3Joshi C. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Class I includes a group of low molecular weight (23,000 to 27,000) and Mg2+-dependent OMTs, whereas class II consists of higher molecular weight OMTs of about 38,000 to 43,000 that do not require Mg2+ for catalytic activity. Prominent class II members include caffeic acid, flavonoid, coumarin, and alkaloid OMTs (4Ibrahim R. Muzac I. Romero J.T. Ibrahim R. Varin L. De Luca V. Evolution of Metabolic Pathways. Pergamon Press, Amsterdam2000: 349-384Google Scholar, 5Dong N. Anzellotti D. Ibrahim R.K. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. J. Biol.

Within the class I OMTs, a group of small caffeoyl coenzyme A OMTs (CCoAOMTs) have been suggested to be key enzymes in the biosynthesis of monolignols, the precursors of gymnosperm and angiosperm lignins (7Ye Z.H. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Varner J.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Ye Z.H. Varner J.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In angiosperms, this task may also be performed by class II OMTs that are specific for caffeic acid, caffeyl aldehyde, or caffeyl alcohol (COMT) (9Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This apparent redundancy results in a cell- and tissue-specific metabolic grid that is essential for plants to regulate lignin composition and structure (12Inoue K. Sewalt V.J.H. Ballance G.M.

In gymnosperms, the situation could be more complex, with a bifunctional caffeic acid/caffeoyl-CoA methylating activity (AEOMT) and an additional specific caffeoyl-CoA activity found in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda; Refs. 16Li L. Popko J.L. Zhang X.H. Osakabe K. Tsai C.J. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5416-5461Google Scholar and 17Li L. Osakabe Y. Yoshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, studies on transcriptional profiling of monolignol biosynthesis in P. taeda cell cultures question any such difference of methylating enzymes between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and confirm that methylation of guaiacyl residues is the exclusive role of class I CCoAOMTs (18Anterola A.M. Jeon J.-H. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18272-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Other phenylpropanoid esters or flavonoids have never been described as substrates for any of these enzymes (16Li L. Popko J.L. Zhang X.H. Osakabe K. Tsai C.J. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5416-5461Google Scholar). In contrast to plants, animals methylate endogenous metabolites like dopamine or xenobiotics by a soluble and membrane-bound enzyme derived from a single Mg2+-dependent catechol OMT gene (19Salminen M. Lundstrom K. Tilgmann C. Savolainen R. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Ulmanen I. Lundstrom K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 18: 1013-1020Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Crystal structures and inhibitor studies of the rat and human catechol OMTs have probed the precise mechanism for substrate binding and methyl transfer with the aim to design pharmacologically effective inhibitors (21Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Männistö P. Kaakkola S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 593-628PubMed Google Scholar). Although plant class I OMTs share only 15% sequence identity with their animal counterparts, the cation dependence, important catalytic residues, and topology are all conserved between the plant and animal enzymes (23Hoffmann L. Maury S. Bergdoll M. Thion L. Erard M. Legrand M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36831-36838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structural similarities of plant class I OMTs with animal catechol OMTs are in contrast to the apparent differences between class I and class II OMTs of plants, as recently elaborated by crystal structures of two alfalfa class II OMTs, which are involved in methylation of flavonoids and caffeic acid (24Zubieta C. He X.-Z. Dixon R. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 25Zubieta C. Kota P. Ferrer J.-L. Dixon R.-A. Noel J.-P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1265-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, the common ice plant, is a member of the herbaceous family Aizoaceae of the Caryophyllales. This taxon is characterized by its unique feature with regard to the phenylpropanoid pattern, in which betacyanins have replaced the anthocyanins as chromogenic fruit and flower pigments (26Mabry T.J. Bell E.S. Charlwood B.V. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol. 8. Springer Verlag, Berlin1980: 513-533Google Scholar). The ice plant has been intensively used as a model system to analyze abiotic stress (27Cushman J. Bohnert H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Upon irradiation with elevated light intensities, and UV light, the plant accumulates red betacyanins accompanied by elevated levels of methylated and glycosylated flavonol conjugates and feruloylglucose in the upper epidermal tissue (28Vogt T. Ibdah M. Schmidt J. Wray V. Nimtz M. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1999; 52: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Ibdah M. Krins A. Seidlitz H.W. Heller W. Strack D. Vogt T. Plant Cell Environ. 2002; 25: 1145-1154Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification, purification, and functional analysis of a novel Mg2+-dependent O-methyltransferase, designated PFOMT, from leaves of the ice plant M. crystallinum. In contrast to other plant CCoAOMTs involved in monolignol biosynthesis, PFOMT accepts as substrates a broad spectrum of compounds with a vicinal dihydroxyl structure, and shows a preference for phenylpropanoids like caffeic acid esters and flavonols (Fig. 1). Both are characteristic constituents of chromogenic leaf and fruit conjugates of the ice plant. Characterized by its unique substrate specificity and distinct N- and C-terminal sequence motifs, PFOMT defines a novel subset of class I OMTs, which can be clearly distinguished from other CCoAOMTs to be involved in lignin biosynthesis. This subclass of CCoAOMT-like proteins is apparently not restricted to the Caryophyllales, but, as demonstrated by the cloning and functional expression of a novel Arabidopsis OMT, is also present in other angiosperms. Plant Material—M. crystallinum L. (ice plant) was grown from seeds for 10 weeks in the greenhouse at a light intensity of 150 μmol m–2 s–1 for a 16 h/8 h, 25–30 °C/21–22 °C day/night cycle. Treatment of the plants with light at an intensity of 1000 μmol m–2 s–1 for 2 days was performed according to Ref. 29Ibdah M. Krins A. Seidlitz H.W. Heller W. Strack D. Vogt T. Plant Cell Environ. 2002; 25: 1145-1154Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar. Enzyme Purification and Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—The flavonol and caffeoyl ester-specific OMT (PFOMT) was extracted from 6 kg of M. crystallinum leaves that were grown at 150 μmol m–2 s–1 in a greenhouse, crushed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. All extraction and purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Extraction buffers contained 5% Polyclar AT (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% ascorbate, and 10% glycerol. The crude plant protein extract was passed over Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) to remove excess KPi and residual impurities. Forty-eight grams of crude protein were applied to Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm KPi (pH 7.5). Proteins were eluted with a stepwise KPi gradient (10, 50, 150, and 300 mm KPi, pH 7.5) with monitoring the enzyme activity. Active fractions were adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 1 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.5). Proteins were eluted by decreasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Active fractions were combined, diluted to 10 mm KPi (pH 7.5), and directly applied to a Mono-Q (HR 10/10) (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 10 mm KPi (pH 7.5), and then eluted with a linear KPi gradient from 10 to 300 mm KPi. Active fractions were adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on analytical high performance phenyl-Superose (Amersham Biosciences). Highly purified enzyme preparations were concentrated (30Ziegler J. Vogt T. Miersch O. Strack D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Samples of the enzyme preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE. One fraction of the major Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-visualized band representing the methyltransferase was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for N-terminal sequencing. The major fraction (∼2 μg) was digested in situ with endopeptidase trypsin. The peptide mixture was separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a Phenomenex 5-μm C18 column (15 × 0.3 cm). Peptide fragments were separated using a linear gradient from 2 to 45% acetonitrile in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. Amino acid sequence analyses of individual peptides were carried out on a Procise 492 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). The digestion, peptide separation, and amino acid sequence analysis was performed by TopLab (Martinsried, Germany). Determination of the molecular weight of partially purified recombinant PFOMT was performed on a High Load Superdex 200 16/60 (Amersham Biosciences) in 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KPi (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrysinogen (27 kDa) (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) as reference proteins. Enzyme Activity Measurements—Optimized enzyme assays were measured in a buffer containing 100 mm KPi (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 150 μm MgCl2, with 10 μm substrate (dissolved in 50% Me2SO), 0.5–50 μg of total protein, and 100 μm AdoMet in a total volume of 60 μl. The assay was incubated at 37 °C for 1 to 15 min (dependent on the amount of protein and substrate tested), after which the reaction mixture was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 3.5% trichloroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile. The reaction products were analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil 5-μm C18 column (5 × 4 mm inner diameter; Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany), as described previously (28Vogt T. Ibdah M. Schmidt J. Wray V. Nimtz M. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1999; 52: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Compounds were analyzed with a linear gradient from 10% B (100% acetonitrile) in A (1.5% aqueous phosphoric acid) to 70% B in A (for phenolics), from 5% B to 50% B in A (for free acids and CoA esters), from 5% B to 30% B (for glucose esters), and from 20% B in A to 80% B in A in 4 min (for flavonoids) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Detection of flavonoids, catechol, coumarins, and hydroxycinnamic acid esters was performed between 260 and 400 nm. Fluorescent flavonoid derivatives were identified online by a Waters 474 fluorescence detector (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) with an excitation at 370 nm and emission at 520 nm. Identification and quantification was achieved with reference compounds from our Institute collection or from external sources. Various 6-O- and 8-O-substituted quercetin and kaempferol derivatives were provided by E. Wollenweber (Technical University, Darmstadt, Germany) and K. Stich (Technical University, Vienna, Austria). 5-OH ferulic acid was obtained from V. Chiang (North Carolina State University). Quercetagetin, syringetin, eriodictyol, and naringenin were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay, France). Caffeoyl- and 5-OH feruloylglucose were prepared from caffeic acid, 5-OH ferulic acid, and UDP-glucose with the purified recombinant sinapic acid glucosyltransferase (SGT) from Brassica napus (31Milkowski C. Baumert A. Strack D. Planta. 2000; 211: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as follows. To 10 ml of 1 mm caffeic acid in KPi buffer (pH 7.0), 10 μg of highly purified SGT preparation and UDP-glucose (10 mm final concentration) were added. After incubation for 30 min the reaction was stopped by adding acetonitrile to a final concentration of 20% and the mixture was concentrated by RP18 solid-phase cartridge extraction (Waters). The concentrated mixture of caffeic acid and caffeoylglucose was further purified by a semipreparative reverse phase-HPLC on Nucleosil-RP18 (10-mm inner diameter, 25 cm length) (Machery & Nagel) with a 30-min gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration in 1% acetic acid (5–50% in 30 min, flow rate 2 ml min–1) and evaporated to dryness. Concentrations of caffeoylglucose and 5-OH feruloylglucose were calculated based on a standard of sinapoyl glucose (provided by A. Baumert, IPB) and calculated with an extinction coefficient of ϵ330 nm of 23,000. The standard curve for both esters by HPLC detection was linear at least up to 500 μm of the corresponding ester. Caffeoyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA, sinapoyl-CoA, and 5-OH feruloyl-CoA were prepared according to Ref. 32Strack D. Keller H. Weissenböck G. J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 131: 61-73Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar based on a method by Ref. 33Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar. For Km determination, substrate concentrations were varied between 2.5 and 100 μm. The Km and V max values were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots. All enzyme assays were recorded in triplicates. For determination of kinetic data, we adjusted the total protein quantity to 2 μg corresponding to ∼1 μg of the corresponding OMT in case of the highly purified PFOMT and AraOMT1. Up to 30 μg were used for the native PFOMT and the less purified enzymes from tobacco and chickweed. In the case of the recombinant PFOMT, two (kinetic data) and three (substrate specificities) independent measurements were performed. Standard deviations are shown for the substrate specificity of the PFOMT enzyme only, otherwise the data display the average of the two measurements. MS Analysis of Quercetagetin Derivatives—The positive and negative ion electrospray (ES) mass spectra and the ES-MS/MS measurements were obtained from a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 instrument (electrospray voltage positive ions: 4.5 kV, negative ions: 4.0 kV; heated capillary temperature 220 °C; sheath gas nitrogen) coupled with a Surveyor HPLC (ThermoFinnigan) system equipped with a RP18 column (5 μm, 1 × 100-mm, SEPSERV). The following HPLC gradient system was used: H2O:MeOH, 80:20 (each of them contained 0.2% HOAc) to 10:90 within 15 min and then held at 10:90 for a further 10 min; flow rate 70 μl min–1. The collision-induced dissociation mass spectra of the [M + H]+ and [M – H]– ions were performed during the HPLC run under the following conditions: collision energy –35 eV (positive ions), +35 eV (negative ions); collision gas: argon, collision pressure: 1.8 × 10–3 torr. All mass spectra are averaged and background subtracted. Positive ion ES collision-induced dissociation MS mass spectra (m/z (relative intensity)) of quercetagetin and its methylated derivatives were: Peak 1 (quercetagetin-5-O-methyl ether): m/z 333 ([M + H]+, 3), 318 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 317 (27), 301 ([M + H-MeOH]+, 2), 290 ([M + H-CH3-CO]+, 4), 273 ([M + H-MeOH-CO]+, 5), 244 (5), 137 (2); Peak 2 (quercetagetin): m/z 319 ([M + H]+, 100), 301 ([M + H-H2O]+, 5), 290 (6), 273 ([M + H-H2O-CO]+, 12), 245 (25), 217 (10), 199 (12), 169 (31), 153 (11), 137 (24), 123 (10); Peak 3 (quercetagetin-5,3′-di-O-methyl ether): m/z 347 ([M + H]+, 3), 332 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 331 (27), 317 ([M + H-CH2O]+, 17), 303 (4), 289 (7), 261 (3); Peak 4 (quercetagetin-3′-O-methyl ether): m/z 333 ([M + H]+, 24), 318 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 301 ([M + H-MeOH]+, 15), 290 ([M + H-CH3-CO]+, 13), 289 (12), 273 ([M + H-MeOH-CO]+, 14), 262 ([M + H-CH3-2CO]+, 5), 261 (7), 245 (7), 244 (9), 169 (22); authentic quercetagetin 3′-O-methyl ether: m/z 333 ([M + H]+, 52), 318 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 301 ([M + H-MeOH]+, 27), 290 ([M + H-CH3-CO]+, 22), 289 (22), 273 ([M + H-MeOH-CO]+, 16), 262 ([M + H-CH3-2CO]+, 13), 261 (12), 245 (22), 244 (7), 169 (73); Peak 5 (quercetagetin-6-O-methyl ether): m/z 333 ([M + H]+, 9), 318 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 317 (24), 301 ([M + H-MeOH]+, 5), 290 ([M + H-CH3-CO]+, 8), 289 (3), 273 ([M + H-MeOH-CO]+, 4), 244 (7); authentic quercetagetin 6-O-methyl ether: m/z 333 ([M + H]+, 7), 318 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 317 (20), 301 ([M + H-MeOH]+, 2), 290 ([M + H-CH3-CO]+, 3), 289 (2), 273 ([M + H-MeOH-CO]+, 3), 261 (2), 244 (4); and Peak 6 (quercetin-6,3′-di-O-methyl ether): m/z 347 ([M + H]+, 12), 332 ([M + H-CH3]+, 100), 331 (17), 317 ([M + H-CH2O]+, 19), 303 (4), 289 (4), 273 (4), 261 (4).

Isolation of Full-length cDNAs—Full-length cDNAs encoding PFOMT from M. crystallinum were isolated by screening 500,000 plaques of a cDNA library prepared in λ-ZAP III (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) using [α-32P]dATP-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides. The full-length CCoAOMT cDNA from Stellaria longipes (34Zhang X.-H. Dickson E.E. Chinappa C.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was used as a heterologous probe. Several positive signals were obtained. In vivo excision and transformation of the resulting plasmids in Escherichia coli XL-1 blue MRF′ according to the manufacturer's instructions revealed several candidate colonies. Plasmids were isolated, digested with restriction enzymes, and those with inserts of the expected size sequenced on an Applied Biosystems sequencer. Two analyzed clones that contained the deduced amino acid sequence of the native, purified and sequenced O-methyltransferase were completely sequenced in both directions using the T3 and T7 primers of the plasmids. Heterologous Expression of O-Methyltransferases—The full-length cDNA isolated by library screening was digested from the pBluescript SK(+/–) (Stratagene) with BamHI/KpnI, ligated into BamHI/KpnI-digested expression vector pQE 32 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and sequenced using the pQE promotor primer. The expression constructs were introduced into E. coli strain M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen). A 3-ml preculture was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (amp). This culture was used to inoculate 400 ml of fresh medium to which 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside was added after 3 h to induce protein expression. Cells were further grown for 12 h at 30 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 11,000 × g, the bacteria were resuspended in 50 mm KPi buffer, containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by a combination of a 20-min lysozyme treatment (1 mg/400 ml of culture) and subsequent ultrasonication. The supernatant containing the recombinant PFOMT was adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.5), and purified on Phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with a stepwise gradient of decreasing salt concentration, concentrated by ultrafiltration on PM 50 membranes (Waters), followed by metal affinity chromatography on Talon (BD Biosciences) with a stepwise gradient of increasing imidazole concentrations. Partially purified protein was used for enzyme assays, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots. Western blots were performed on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with a monoclonal anti-His antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Novagen, Madison, WI) and detected by the chromogenic bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium complex. The S. longipes cDNA was cloned in pBluescript (34Zhang X.-H. Dickson E.E. Chinappa C.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 35Zhang X.-H. Chinappa C.C. J. Biosci. 1997; 2: 161-175Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and protein expression in E. coli XL-1 blue was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside at 30 °C overnight. The tobacco CCoAOMT cDNA kindly provided by U. Matern (University of Marburg, Germany) was cloned into the vector pET21 (Novagen), and protein expression was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) with 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside at 30 °C overnight. The phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and Mono-Q anion exchange purified protein fractions were used for the analyses of kinetic data and substrate specificity of these recombinant enzymes. Cloning and Expression of the Arabidopsis PFOMT-like Gene—Based on sequence information obtained from GenBank™ two specific primers were designed corresponding to the 5′-end (5′-CGGGATCCATGGCTAAGGATGAAGCCAAG-3′ with a BamHI restriction site) and 3′-end (5′-CTCAAGCTTGTGTCAATATAACCTCCTGCAAATAG-3′ with a KpnI site) of the A. thaliana nucleotide sequence. RNA from the whole plants of A. thaliana Columbia-ecotype Col-0 1092 (obtained from the Arabidopsis Stock Center, Nottingham, United Kingdom) was isolated based on a kit provided by Qiagen. 5 μg of total RNA was reversed transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-RNase H(–) reverse transcriptase (Promega) and the corresponding cDNA was amplified to yield a 700-bp fragment, which after digestion with BamHI and KpnI was ligated in-frame into the vector pQE 30 (Qiagen) and transformed into E. coli M15rep 4 cells. Several amp(+)-resistant colonies were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. Bacteria were lysed and soluble protein was assayed for OMT activity and in parallel by SDS-PAGE. Bacteria from the most active preparation were grown on a 1-liter scale, bacteria lysed, and the His-tagged protein was partially purified by Talon affinity chromatography according to the manufacturers instructions (Clontech). 2 μg of partially purified protein per assay were used for determination of kinetic parameters. The correct sequence of the corresponding gene was confirmed by sequencing using a pQE promotor primer. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 200 mg of leaf tips and epidermis cells from plants grown in normal or high light conditions, using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. Northern blots were done according to standard procedures using PFOMT cDNA as a probe and the Mega-Prime™ labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed under stringent conditions with a buffer containing 7% SDS, 250 mm NaCl adjusted to pH 7.0 with 250 mm KPi. Sequence Analysis and Alignments—Sequence analysis was performed with National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST Search programs. Seque"
https://openalex.org/W2155278498,"The formation of muscle fibers involves the sequential expression of many proteins that regulate key steps during myoblast-to-myotube transition. MyoD, myogenin, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1 are major players in the initiation and maintenance of the differentiated state of mouse embryonic muscle cells (C2C12). The messenger RNAs encoding these three proteins contain typical AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs), which are known to affect the half-life of many short-lived mRNAs. HuR, an RNA-binding protein that regulates both the stability and cellular movement of ARE-containing mRNAs, interacts and stabilizes the p21cip1 message under UV stress in human RKO colorectal carcinoma cells. Here, by the use of gel shift experiments and immunoprecipitation followed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we show that HuR interacts with MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 mRNAs through specific sequences in their 3′-UTRs. To demonstrate the implication of endogenous HuR in myogenesis, we knocked down its expression in myoblasts using RNA interference and observed a significant reduction of HuR expression, associated with complete inhibition of myogenesis. Moreover, the expression of MyoD and myogenin mRNAs, as well as proteins, is significantly reduced in the HuR knockdown C2C12 cells. We were able to completely re-establish the myogenic process of these defective cells by introducing back HuR protein conjugated to a cell-permeable peptide. Finally, HuR accumulates in the cytoplasm during myogenesis. Thus, our results clearly demonstrated that endogenous HuR plays a crucial role in muscle differentiation by regulating the expression and/or the nuclear export of ARE-containing mRNAs that are essential for this process.

Thus, our results clearly demonstrated that endogenous HuR plays a crucial role in muscle differentiation by regulating the expression and/or the nuclear export of ARE-containing mRNAs that are essential for this process. The first step of skeletal muscle formation (also named myogenesis) is the cell cycle arrest of myoblasts, which leads to cell fusion and the formation of multinucleated myotubes. This transition is controlled by muscle-specific transcriptional regulators that respond to external signals to couple myogenesis to the development and growth of the organism (1Polesskaya A. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 757-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4 represent the main myogenic transcription factors and belong to the MRF (myogenic regulatory factor) family. MyoD and Myf-5 are expressed in proliferating myoblasts, whereas myogenin expression is induced only upon muscle differentiation (2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). MyoD activates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1 (3Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which, along with p57 (another Cip1/Kip1 family member), leads to cell cycle arrest (4Reynaud E.G. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch M.P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that p21cip1 induction follows myogenin expression during the myoblast-to-myotube transition and that a high level of p21cip1 is required for myotube maintenance (5Odelberg S.J. Kollhoff A. Keating M.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts (a mouse embryonic muscle cell line) provide a powerful model to study skeletal muscle differentiation (6Yamaguchi A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). They overexpress the myogenic factors described above and fuse to form muscle fibers when induced to differentiate. This overexpression is due not only to an increase in the transcription of their corresponding genes, but also to the stabilization of their mRNAs (7Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 8Bisbal C. Silhol M. Laubenthal H. Kaluza T. Carnac G. Milligan L. Le Roy F. Salehzada T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, preventing the degradation of mRNAs that encode key factors of muscle cell differentiation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the whole process. However, the mechanisms that affect the turnover and the cellular movement of these messages remain elusive. MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 mRNAs each harbor an AU-rich element (ARE) 1The abbreviations used are: AREAU-rich elementUTRuntranslated regionAUBPAU-binding proteinELAVembryonic lethal, abnormal visionAPantennapediaGSTglutathione S-transferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumsiRNAsmall interference RNARTreverse transcriptionHCHuR-associated complexIREiron-responsive elementDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolehnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinRNAiRNA interference.1The abbreviations used are: AREAU-rich elementUTRuntranslated regionAUBPAU-binding proteinELAVembryonic lethal, abnormal visionAPantennapediaGSTglutathione S-transferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumsiRNAsmall interference RNARTreverse transcriptionHCHuR-associated complexIREiron-responsive elementDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolehnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinRNAiRNA interference. in their 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) (9Figueroa A.

These AREs contain one or two AU3A sequences that trigger the rapid degradation of short-lived mRNAs, such as many oncogenes, lymphokines, and cytokines (10Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar, 11Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). AREs do not always target mRNAs for degradation (12Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) but may also serve as an anchor for some of the shuttling AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that monitor the nuclear export of ARE-containing mRNAs (13Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 14Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the half-lives and cellular movement of MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 mRNAs may be regulated through their AREs in association with AUBPs.

Unlike the other three ELAV proteins, HuB, HuC, and HuD (which are expressed primarily in the brain), HuR is ubiquitously expressed (22Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and functions as an adaptor protein for the nuclear export of many ARE-containing mRNAs (14Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A.

The elav locus was first discovered as a gene that is essential for the development and maintenance of the nervous system of Drosophila (20Campos A.R. Grossman D. White K. J. Neurogenet. 1985; 2: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Robinow S. Campos A.R. Yao K.M. White K. Science. 1988; 242: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the ELAV human counterparts, HuB, HuC, and HuD (22Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), are involved in mouse embryonic development (24Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3024-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the differentiation of a variety of embryonic cell lines (25Wakamatsu Y. Weston J.A. Development. 1997; 124: 3449-3460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol.

Terashima K. Yamamoto K. Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 667-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The first demonstration that an Hu/ELAV protein is involved in differentiation came from the work of Jain and coworkers (26Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They showed that the ectopic overexpression of HuB in the preadipocyte cell line 3T3 L1 leads to the enhancement of adipocyte differentiation and the stabilization, as well as the translation induction of the glucose transporter 1 mRNA. Furthermore, HuB induces neurite formation of human embryonic tetracarcinoma (hNT2) cells by stabilizing and/or regulating the translation of the neurofilamin mRNA (27Antic D. Lu N. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the tissue-specific ELAV proteins, through their ability to regulate the stability and/or the translation of many mRNAs, play a crucial role in cell differentiation (30Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that HuR, which is ubiquitously expressed, could have similar effects on the differentiation of other embryonic cell lines. Establishing this role for endogenous HuR would be unexpected and of high interest, because these regulatory functions are usually associated with tissue-specific proteins. However, there are many examples in the literature suggesting that many RNA-binding proteins may have different functions in different tissues (31Weighardt F. Biamonti G. Riva S. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Singh O.P.

Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). These different effects are due to a variation in their expression or in their regulation, through protein-protein associations or post-translational modifications, which will modulate the association with their end targets (such as an mRNA). The stabilizing function of HuR in mammalian cells was only demonstrated in experiments whereby cells were co-transfected with the recombinant HuR protein as well as an artificial ARE-containing message (15Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 17Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 19Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Thus, the question of whether endogenous HuR exercises the same function in vivo remains unanswered. Recently, it was observed that the overexpression of HuR in myoblasts correlates with the stabilization of MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 messages, as well as with the acceleration of muscle cell differentiation (9Figueroa A. Cuadrado A. Fan J. Atasoy U. Muscat G.E. Munoz-Canoves P. Gorospe M. Munoz A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4991-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because this effect was observed only upon the overexpression of exogenous HuR, we still do not know whether the observed stabilization and differentiation stimulation reflect the true function of endogenous HuR during myogenesis. Therefore, the best approach to define the implication of HuR in this process is to disturb its expression in myoblasts by RNA interference, then stimulate muscle differentiation and monitor the effect on myotube formation. HuR shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments by virtue of its HNS (HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling domain (37Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar)). We recently used a novel approach for delivering protein domains to the interior of mammalian cells to delineate the shuttling pathways of HuR (14Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Specifically, the HNS and the CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (38Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) domains were fused to the cell-permeable peptide antennapedia (AP). AP facilitates the cellular uptake of such chimeras into mammalian cells via a non-endocytic, non-degradative pathway with high efficiency (>90%). Using this approach, we demonstrated that, unlike other known shuttling proteins, HuR utilizes two pathways to export its mRNA targets from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (14Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, these findings (14Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) did not address whether the stabilizing function of HuR and/or its nucleocytoplasmic movement may affect vital processes such as cell growth and differentiation. To address these issues, C2C12 myoblasts were used to define the role of HuR during cell differentiation. Our results demonstrate that HuR plays an essential role in myogenesis and regulates the expression of mRNAs that encode key myogenic factors. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The AP PCR product was produced by self-amplification using AP-N-sense (5′-ggg gac aag ttt gta caa aaa agc agg ctt cga agg aga tag aac cat gcg tca aat taa gat ttg gtt cca gaa ccg tcg cat g-3′) and AP-N-antisense (5′-ggg gac cac ttt gta caa gaa agc tgg gtc cat atg aag ctt aga tat ctc gag tgc ggc cgc ttt ctt cca ttt cat gcg acg gtt ctg-3′) oligonucleotides. To create the AP-C entry vector, a binding protein recombination reaction between pDONR1 (Invitrogen) and the AP PCR product was performed using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). PCR amplification of HuR was performed using the GST-HuR plasmid as a template (39Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) with the primers HuR-TAG-For (5′-ccc ctc gag tct aat ggt tat gaa gac cac-3′) and AP-HuR-Rev (5′-ggg aag ctt tta ttt gtg gga ctt gtt gg-3′). The AP-HuR-GST plasmid was created by recombination between the AP-HuR-TAG entry vector and the pDEST15 plasmid (Invitrogen). The XhoI/HindIII fragment of the HuR PCR product was inserted into the XhoI/HindIII sites of the AP-N entry vector to produce the AP-HuR entry vector. The GST-AP plasmid was generated by recombination reaction between the AP-C entry vector and pDEST15 (Invitrogen). The fusion proteins were purified as described (39Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The proteins were eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads with three applications of 500-μl glutathione elution buffer (10 mm for the first elution, and 20 mm for the second and third elutions). Proteins were then dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The 20 mm glutathione eluates were the most pure (as determined by SDS-PAGE) and were used in all experiments. Cell Culture and Transfection—C2C12 cells (ATCC) were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine, following the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Differentiation was induced immediately upon 100% confluency on plates previously coated with 0.1% gelatin. To induce differentiation, growth media were replaced with differentiation media containing DMEM, 2% horse serum, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics, and 10 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml transferrin (Invitrogen), and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen). The transfection of siRNA into C2C12 cells was performed in six-well plates using twice the number of wells that were eventually needed. The first transfection with HuSi-1, HuSi-C, or mock (transfection reagents only, no oligonucleotide) was performed when cells were 20-30% confluent. At 24 h post-transfection, when cells were 50-60% confluent, the procedure was repeated. At 6-8 h after the second transfection, two wells (with the same siRNA treatment) were combined into one by trypsinizing one plate and moving the cells from each well to corresponding wells on the second plate. For all transfections, LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) was used, following the manufacturer's protocol. siRNA duplexes were ordered from Dharmacon. The siRNA duplex (0.12 μm) was used for each well of a six-well plate. Differentiation was induced 2 days after the second transfection. For rescue of siRNA-treated cells, 25 nm purified protein was added to the C2C12 growth media. This protein/media solution was added to the cells twice, for 2 days, following the second siRNA transfection. Differentiation was induced the day after the protein was added for the second time. Immunoblotting, Immunofluorescence, and Preparation of Cell Extracts—Total cell extracts, as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, were prepared as described (40Gallouzi I.E. Parker F. Chebli K. Maurier F. Labourier E. Barlat I. Capony J.P. Tocque B. Tazi J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 41Di Marco S. Hel Z. Lachance C. Furneaux H. Radzioch D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 863871Crossref Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described previously (39Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The blots were probed variously with antibodies to HuR (42Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), hnRNP A1 (kindly provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia), myogenin, MyoD, tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), myoglobin (DAKO), MF-20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and β-actin (Sigma). Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (37Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to myoglobin was used at a 1:500 dilution in 1% goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline, and was incubated simultaneously with a monoclonal antibody to HuR (1:1500). Myoglobin was detected using a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody, and HuR using an fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody, both at a 1:500 dilution. Hoechst stain, 1:1500, was also incubated with the secondary antibodies. A Zeiss Axiovision 3.1 microscope was used to observe the cells using a 40× oil objective, and an Axiocam HR (Zeiss) digital camera was used for immunofluorescence photography. Northern (RNA) Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described (43Wojciechowski W. DeSanctis J. Skamene E. Radzioch D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2688-2696PubMed Google Scholar) using 7 μg of total RNA prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After transferring to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and UV-cross-linking, the blot was hybridized with murine p21cip1, MyoD, or myogenin cDNA probes generated by random primer labeling (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (44Rios R. Carneiro I. Arce V.M. Devesa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified fragments from MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 cDNAs (kindly supplied by Dr. A. Lassar, at Harvard Medical School) were used to generate labeled probes. After hybridization, the membranes were washed and subsequently exposed on BioMax films. Preparation of mRNA (mRNP) Complexes and Analysis with RTPCR—Immunoprecipitation and RNA preparation were performed as previously described (45Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) using antibodies to HuR (3A2) and MF-20, and cell extracts were prepared from differentiating C2C12 cells. mRNP lysate (400 μl) was added to beads (protein-A-Sepharose) for each immunoprecipitation. Specific messages associated with HuR were defined using RT-PCR as described below. Purified RNA was resuspended in 10 μl of water, and 1 μl was reverse-transcribed using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in 20 μl of final volume. Subsequently, 2 μl of cDNA was PCR-amplified using platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) for 22 cycles using MyoD, myogenin, or p21cip1 cDNA-specific primers. The sequences of the primers, as well as the PCR conditions, were described previously (44Rios R. Carneiro I. Arce V.M. Devesa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Preparation of RNA Transcripts, RNA Binding Assay, and Gel Shift Assay—The MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 cRNA probes were produced by in vitro transcription as previously described (40Gallouzi I.E. Parker F. Chebli K. Maurier F. Labourier E. Barlat I. Capony J.P. Tocque B. Tazi J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The p21cip1 cRNA probe was transcribed from a synthesized oligonucleotide subcloned into pGEM 3Zf(+) vector (Promega), which was linearized with BamH1 prior to the reaction. The myogenin cRNA probe was generated from a synthetic oligonucleotide (spanning nucleotides 1244-1279 of myogenin 3′-UTR) fused to a T7 promoter (5′-gaattgtaatacgactcactatagggcga-3′). The MyoD cRNA probe was generated by PCR amplification of a region of the MyoD 3′-UTR spanning nucleotides 1301-1408 using a forward primer fused to the T7 promoter as well as a MyoD cDNA expression vector as the template. The RNA binding assay and the HuR supershift assays were performed as previously described (41Di Marco S. Hel Z. Lachance C. Furneaux H. Radzioch D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 863871Crossref Google Scholar). HuR Expression during C2C12 Differentiation—To investigate HuR function in regulating gene expression during muscle differentiation, mouse embryonic myoblasts (C2C12, also termed C2, myoblasts) were used as a system model. Myotubes and differentiation markers such as the myosin heavy chain (MF-20) and myoglobin become detectable in these cells ∼48-72 h after serum starvation (46Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 47Torgan C.E. Daniels M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HuR expression was first monitored during myogenesis (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis using total extracts from differentiating myoblasts and a monoclonal antibody against HuR demonstrated that HuR expression levels did not change throughout myogenesis and remained high in mature myotubes (Fig. 1, B, lanes 4 and 5, and A, lanes d3 and d5). Both light microscopy and Western blots showed that the C2C12 cells differentiated normally and expressed normal levels of myoglobin and MF-20 (Fig. 1, A and B) as previously described (48Yan Z. Serrano A.L. Schiaffino S. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17361-17366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results show that HuR protein levels do not change during the myoblast-to-myotube transition. HuR Associates with MyoD, Myogenin, and p21cip1 Messages during C2C12 Differentiation through Specific Sequences Located in Their 3′-UTR—Nucleotide sequence analysis of MyoD, myogenin, and p21cip1 indicated that each mRNA contains an AU/GU-rich sequences in its 3′-UTR (Ref. 9Figueroa A. Cuadrado A. Fan J. Atasoy U. Muscat G.E. Munoz-Canoves P. Gorospe M. Munoz A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4991-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A). Moreover, it was recently shown that HuR associates with the 3′-UTR of myogenin and p21cip1 during C2C12 differentiation (9Figueroa A. Cuadrado A. Fan J. Atasoy U. Muscat G.E. Munoz-Canoves P. Gorospe M. Munoz A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4991-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the association with the MyoD 3′-UTR, as well as the precise sequences that interact with HuR, remain unknown. To delineate the exact HuR binding sites in these messages, we performed RNA gel shift assays, using radiolabeled probes for the 3′-UTR of p21cip1, MyoD, and myogenin, on nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from differentiating C2C12 cells (Fig. 2B). The HuR antibody was incubated with the extracts in the presence of p21cip1 (Fig. 2A, c), MyoD (Fig. 2A, a), or myogenin (Fig. 2A, b) cRNA probes. With the p21cip1 cRNA probe (Fig. 2B, lanes 20-27), a complex was evident in both the cytoplasmic (Cc) (Fig. 2B, lanes 21-23) and the nuclear (data not shown) extracts. When the HuR antibody was added to these extracts, a shift of an HuR-associated complex (HC) was observed throughout differentiation (Fig. 2B, lanes 24-26). This shift was absent in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts incubated with an antibody to p38 (Fig. 2B, lane 27). HuR therefore interacts in vitro with the p21cip1 ARE in both the nuclear (data not shown) and cytoplasmic compartments during C2C12 differentiation. The same result was obtained with the myogenin cRNA probe (spanning nucleotides 1244-1279"
https://openalex.org/W2033073750,"Functional interactions between Fcγ-receptors (FcγR) and the β2 integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) have been described, but the molecular basis of this relationship remains unclear. Although the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked receptor FcγRIIIB of human neutrophils is constitutively associated with Mac-1, we found no evidence for direct physical association between Mac-1 and the FcγR of mouse macrophages, which are transmembrane proteins. Nevertheless, Mac-1 accumulated in the phagocytic cup following engagement of FcγR by IgG-opsonized particles. Blocking the CD18 chains of β2 integrins by using specific antibodies reduced Mac-1 accumulation in the cup. These antibodies or the addition of the recombinant CD11b I-domain inhibited the ingestion of IgG-opsonized particles. FcγR cross-linking stimulated cell adhesion to surfaces coated with Mac-1 ligands and in addition enabled macrophages to bind C3bi-opsonized particles, indicating that FcγR-derived signals induce activation of Mac-1. Measurements of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed that whereas most (>80%) of Mac-1 is immobile in resting cells, stimulation of FcγR markedly increases the mobile fraction of the integrin. Activation of Mac-1 by FcγR required the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase C, with the release of diacylglycerol and stimulation of protein kinase C. Because elevated cytosolic Ca2+ was not required, we suggest that novel protein kinase C isoforms are involved in Mac-1 activation. These results suggest that FcγR stimulation promotes Mac-1 clustering into high avidity complexes in phagocytic cups by releasing the integrin from cytoskeletal constraints and enhancing its lateral diffusion. FcγR can enhance host defense by activating Mac-1 (and possibly other integrins), having a synergistic effect on pathogen engulfment and promoting the adherence of phagocytes at sites of infection.

FcγR can enhance host defense by activating Mac-1 (and possibly other integrins), having a synergistic effect on pathogen engulfment and promoting the adherence of phagocytes at sites of infection. Mac-1, a heterodimeric receptor primarily expressed in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, is composed of a specific α chain (CD11b) and the β2 chain (CD18) which is common to the other members of the β2 integrin family (1Ehlers M.R. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As is the case for other integrins, Mac-1 (also known as CD11b/CD18, αMβ2, Mo-1, or CR3) activation is required for efficient binding to several ligands such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, C3bi, or fibrinogen. Activation of the cells by specific agonists induces the receptor to undergo conformational changes, mobilization, and clustering by a process known as inside-out signaling (2Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A variety of studies have demonstrated that Mac-1 participates in a number of important aspects of the innate immune response, including phagocyte adhesion, migration, and engulfment of complement-opsonized particles (1Ehlers M.R. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 4Coxon A. Rieu P. Barkalow F.J. Askari S. Sharpe A.H. von Andrian U.H. Arnaout M.A. Mayadas T.N. Immunity. 1996; 5: 653-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Such functions are generally triggered by direct binding of ligands like intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and C3 complement fragment C3bi to Mac-1. In addition, Mac-1 interacts with and appears to serve as a signaling partner for glycosylphosphatidylinositollinked receptors such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and CD14 (5Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whereas Mac-1 can directly recognize components of the microbial wall (6Vetvicka V. Thornton B.P. Ross G.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 7Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar), phagocytosis via this receptor is most efficient when the target particles are coated with complement fragment C3bi, a process known as opsonization. Opsonic phagocytosis can also be mediated by Fcγ-receptors (FcγR), 1The abbreviations used are: FcγR, Fcγ-receptors; agg-IgG, aggregated human IgG; FCS, fetal calf serum; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; HBSS, Hank's buffered saline solution; HPMI, Hepes-buffered solution RPMI-1640; IgG-RBC or C3bi-RBC, IgG-or C3bi-opsonized red blood cells; mAb, monoclonal antibodies; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Ab, antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PE, phycoerythrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester; DiC8, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; PLC, phospholipase C. which recognize the constant region of IgG bound to antigenic particles (8Gessner J.E. Heiken H. Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Ann. Hematol. 1998; 76: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Unlike the integrins, however, FcγR are capable of binding and responding to their ligands without priming, i.e. stimulation of the cells by other agonists. In vitro studies using single opsonins have demonstrated that engagement of either FcγR or Mac-1 suffices to initiate phagocytosis. However, interactions between the two systems have been suggested by various observations. Neutrophils from leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome patients, which have mutations in the gene encoding CD18 (9Etzioni A. Doerschuk C.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have a reduced ability to ingest IgG-opsonized red blood cells (IgG-RBC) (10Gresham H.D. Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibodies that block Mac-1 function depressed IgG-mediated phagocytosis without impairing the binding of FcγR to its ligands (11Graham I.L. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2352-2358PubMed Google Scholar). Also, FcγR-mediated adhesion of neutrophils to immobilized immune complexes was inhibited by antibodies targeting either CD18 or CD11b (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10556-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Kusunoki T. Tsuruta S. Higashi H. Hosoi S. Hata D. Sugie K. Mayumi M. Mikawa H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and Mac-1-deficient mice displayed impaired immune complex-mediated recruitment of neutrophils onto glomerular basement membrane in vivo or spreading on immune complexes in vitro (14Tang T. Rosenkranz A. Assmann K.J. Goodman M.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Carroll M.C. Cotran R.S. Mayadas T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These studies and that of Coxon et al. (15Coxon A. Cullere X. Knight S. Sethi S. Wakelin M.W. Stavrakis G. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N. Immunity. 2001; 14: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) suggest that Mac-1 is required for sustained leukocyte adhesion following FcγR engagement. The manner whereby FcγR and Mac-1 receptors interact remains largely obscure. One type of FcγR, the human FcγRIIIB, has been reported to exist in physical association with Mac-1. A carbohydrate-mediated interaction is thought to exist between these receptors, which undergo co-capping in human neutrophils (16Zhou M. Todd III, R.F. van de Winkel J.G. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3030-3041PubMed Google Scholar, 17Poo H. Krauss J.C. Mayo-Bond L. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 597-603PubMed Google Scholar). However, association with FcγRIIIB is unlikely to account for all the observations reported above. The expression of FcγRIIIB is restricted to human neutrophils (18Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 19Li M. Wirthmueller U. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), yet cooperation between Mac-1 and FcγR has been described in cell types that lack this receptor isoform. Moreover, it is unclear how clustering and signaling would be initiated by the complex of quiescent Mac-1 and FcγRIIIB, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and therefore signaling-incompetent form of FcγR. In this study we sought to define whether the transmembrane forms of FcγR, such as those expressed in murine cells (which lack FcγRIIIB), undergo functional interactions with Mac-1. To this end we studied the possible role of Mac-1 in the phagocytosis of IgG-RBC in unprimed RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. In particular, we explored whether direct physical interactions exist between Mac-1 and FcγR in these cells, and we considered the possibility that FcγR engagement may lead to inside-out activation of Mac-1.

Hamster anti-mouse CD18 and rat anti-mouse CD11b-producing hybridoma, 2E6 and M1/70, respectively, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and purified rat IgG2b and rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (FcγRIII/II) were from Pharmingen. Rat anti-mouse CD11a mAb (M17/5.2) and anti-talin Ab were kind gifts from Drs. H. Ostergaard (Edmonton, Canada) and A. Kupfer (Denver, CO), respectively. F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD18 or anti-CD11a were prepared from the IgG fraction purified from hybridoma supernatants by using immobilized pepsin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b Ab (M1/70) and IgG2b isotype control and anti-hamster IgG were from Serotec and Caltag, respectively. Hamster IgG F(ab′)2 and Cy5-, Cy3-, or tritc-conjugated secondary Ab were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. PP1, GF-109203X, and calphostin C were from Biomol. BAPTA-AM and Alexa 488- or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were from Molecular Probes. U73122 and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8) were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. Aggregated human IgG (agg-IgG) was prepared by heating 10 mg/ml human IgG to 63 °C for 20 min followed by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The freshly prepared supernatant was used at 250 μg/ml final concentration. Cell Culture and Transfections—RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and transferred onto acid-washed and poly-l-lysine (1 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips 1 day before the assays. For immobilized immune complex binding assays, RAW264.7 cells grown on glass coverslips were lifted by treating with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and allowed to recover at room temperature for 5 h in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 (HPMI). To study Fc receptor mobility, cells on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were transiently transfected with the FcγRI-γ-γ-GFP cDNA (21Kim M.K. Pan X.Q. Huang Z.Y. Hunter S. Hwang P.H. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 98: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. A. D. Schreiber (Philadelphia), using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and used within 24 h of transfection. Phagocytosis and Binding Determinations—Sheep RBC were opsonized with IgG as described (22Botelho R.J. Teruel M. Dierckman R. Anderson R. Wells A. York J.D. Meyer T. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1353-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). C3bi opsonization was performed by first incubating RBC with sub-agglutinating concentrations of IgM (1:10) in PBS with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. Excess IgM was then washed off, and RBC were incubated with C5-deficient serum (1:6) for 20 min at 37 °C with frequent mixing. C3bi-RBC were then washed and used immediately for binding assays. To induce IgG-mediated phagocytosis, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to IgG-opsonized RBC (∼5 RBC/macrophage) in HPMI with 1% heat-inactivated FCS at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were subjected to hypoosmolar shock by adding H2O for 20 s followed by three washes with PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight or with methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. For IgG-RBC binding assays, cells were exposed to IgG-opsonized RBC under the same conditions as for phagocytosis except that incubation was for 5 min at 4 °C followed by 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively with PBS prior to fixation with methanol. For C3bi-RBC binding assays, RAW264.7 cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then incubated with or without 100 nm PMA or 100 μm of DiC8 for 20 min prior to the addition of C3bi-RBC. Where indicated, the cells were pretreated with 10 μm PP1, 100 μm LY294002 (30 min), 10 μm GF-10923X (30 min), 10 μm BAPTA-AM (30 min), 10 μm U73122, or 500 nm calphostin C (15 min at 37 °C followed by 15 min under light) in serum-free medium prior to addition of C3bi-RBC. C3bi-RBC were incubated with the cells for 20 min before vigorous washing and fixing with methanol. Where specified, the cells were stimulated with agg-IgG. Blocking Experiments—Cells were washed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with HPMI containing 5% FCS to block nonspecific binding sites. The cells were next treated for 15 min at room temperature with or without (control) 5 μg/ml anti-CD18 (2E6), anti-CD11a (M17/5.2), or non-immune hamster IgG (all in F(ab′)2 fragments) with 1% FCS. Next, IgG opsonized RBC were added to the incubation mixture, and binding or phagocytosis experiments were conducted in the presence of the blocking Ab, as described above. To detect CD18 staining, the secondary Ab (TRITC anti-hamster IgG) was preabsorbed with IgG-RBC to eliminate cross-reactivity with opsonized RBC, by incubation for 1 h. The accumulation of CD18 in the cup versus membrane under normal and blocking conditions was determined from confocal images by determining the pixel density in the cup and in inactive plasma membrane regions by using NIH/Scion Image software. For blocking experiments using the recombinant proteins GST-αMI domain or GST, IgG-RBC were preincubated for 5 min with or without 10 μm recombinant protein in HPMI containing 0.2% BSA, and this suspension was then added to cells adherent to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Phagocytosis was quantified as described above. Immunostaining and Flow Cytometry—For internalization experiments cells were preincubated with 1 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD18 (2E6), of non-immune hamster IgG, or of FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b Ab (M1/70), as described above, prior to washing and incubation with or without agg-IgG for 30 min at 37 or 4 °C, as specified. For surface staining at 4 °C, 0.1% azide was added to the incubation buffers. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed, and incubated with secondary Ab to detect human IgG and CD18. For flow cytometric analysis cells were scraped from tissue culture flasks, washed, and incubated with agg-IgG in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min at 37 °C (or, in the case of controls, at 4 °C in the presence of azide) and washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing 2.5% FCS and 0.1% azide prior to blocking with 5% FCS for 10 min and staining at 4 °C for 30 min with FITC-labeled anti-human-IgG, 2E6/FITC anti-hamster, FITC anti-CD11b, or the corresponding control Ab. Live cells excluding propidium iodide were analyzed for surface staining of human IgG or integrin chains with FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To determine the number of integrin molecules per cell, the phycoerythrin (PE) fluorescence quantitation kit (Quantibrite™ PE, BD Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with saturating amounts of PE-anti-CD18 and -anti-CD11b mAb (Caltag Laboratories). The amounts of PE/Ab were determined by generating a standard curve with unconjugated R-PE (Molecular Probes), and the number of Ab molecules per cell were calculated. To assess affinity changes of β2 integrins, cells were incubated with an activation epitope-specific mAb (mAb24, a gift from Dr. N. Hogg, London, UK). Cells were treated at 37 °C for 15 min using mAb24 or mouse IgG1 (isotype control) in HBSS with 10 mm Hepes and 1% FCS with or without agg-IgG. Parallel incubations were performed in Ca2+,Mg2+-free HBSS, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% FCS. Alexa 488-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary Ab. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—The mobility of integrins and Fc receptors was estimated using FRAP. Cells layered on poly-l-lysine were either transfected with FcγRI-γ-γ-GFP cDNA or exposed to 1 μg/ml FITC anti-CD11b Ab for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed, and the dorsal surface of flat lamellae was imaged immediately. Spots of ∼2 μm in diameter were photobleached using the full power of the 488 nm laser line of the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope, resulting in a 70–90% reduction of the fluorescence intensity. A similar spot from the area that remained unbleached was selected to serve as a control. Sequential images were acquired after photobleaching with a decreased laser intensity to minimize further photobleaching for a period up to 120 s. The data were exported and analyzed in Microcal Origin 6.0 software. Starting values were set as 100% recovery, and photobleached values were normalized to the unbleached regions at all time points to correct for any bleaching incurred during measurement or for changes in focal plane. The percent recovery (mobile fraction) of the measured population of labeled CD11b Ab or FcγR-GFP was determined as the ratio of the final fluorescence to the pre-bleach fluorescence. The half-time to recovery (t ½) was also quantified. Images of the cells were taken before and after photobleaching and compared to verify that no gross morphological changes or drifting had occurred in the regions of interest. Immobilized Immune Complex Binding Assays—BSA and BSA/anti-BSA (immune complex)-coated coverslips were prepared as described (14Tang T. Rosenkranz A. Assmann K.J. Goodman M.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Carroll M.C. Cotran R.S. Mayadas T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, acid-washed coverslips were coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml) and treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. Coverslips were washed and coated with BSA (1 mg/ml) for 30 min and then blocked with 0.1 m glycine for 2 h. To create immobilized BSA/anti-BSA immune complexes, BSA-coated coverslips were incubated with 40 μgof rabbit anti-BSA IgG in PBS for 1 h. RAW264.7 cells suspended in HPMI were plated onto BSA or BSA/anti-BSA-coated coverslips and incubated for 8 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with phalloidin and/or primary Ab to integrins or talin, followed by secondary Ab. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Following treatment, RAW264.7 cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C or for 20 min at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 100 mm glycine for 20 min before blocking for 1 h with 5% FCS in PBS. Staining with anti-integrins Ab and phalloidin was for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% FCS. Following washing, samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies. Samples were analyzed by differential interference contrast and fluorescence confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. FITC, Cy5, and Cy3 channels were examined using the conventional laser excitation lines and filter sets. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean values ± S.E. Student's two-tailed t tests were performed to assess the significance of differences using InStat software (GraphPad, San Diego). CD18 Is Required for Optimal IgG-mediated Phagocytosis of RBC—We initially confirmed the expression and quantified the density of CD18 and CD11b on the surface of RAW264.7 cells by flow cytometry (see “Experimental Procedures”). An average of ∼3 × 105 CD18 molecules/cell of CD18 and 1.6 × 105 CD11b molecules/cell was estimated, which is similar to values reported for monocyte-derived macrophages (23Ross G.D. Reed W. Dalzell J.G. Becker S.E. Hogg N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data indicate that in RAW264.7 cells nearly half of the CD18 chains were associated with CD11b chains to form the Mac-1 integrin receptor. To assess whether a functional interaction exists between β2 integrins and transmembrane FcγR, we examined the effect of blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD18 (24Metlay J.P. Witmer-Pack M.D. Agger R. Crowley M.T. Lawless D. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1753-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) on the phagocytosis of IgG-RBC by RAW264.7 cells. Fig. 1 shows that pretreatment with F(ab′)2 fragments of the blocking mAb 2E6 impaired phagocytosis significantly. The phagocytic index dropped from 287 ± 31 in the controls (n = 9) to 132 ± 4 in antibody-treated cells (n = 4; p ≤ 0.001). This effect was specific, because a comparable concentration of non-immune F(ab′)2 fragments produced no significant inhibition of phagocytosis (Fig. 1). Inhibition of phagocytosis by anti-CD18 was not due to interference with the binding of the opsonins to the FcγR, because measurements of the number of IgG-RBC associated with the phagocytes revealed no difference between control and antibody-treated cells (Fig. 1, solid bars). Although we had no available F(ab′)2 fragments of blocking mAb against the α chain of Mac-1, we speculated that this receptor may have been responsible, at least in part, for the CD18-dependent component of phagocytosis, based on its abundance and on the data of Graham et al. (11Graham I.L. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2352-2358PubMed Google Scholar), who found that Mac-1 is the major β2 integrin contributing to Fc-mediated phagocytosis in primary human monocytes and neutrophils. A unique domain of about 200 amino acids of the extracellular moiety of CD11b, known as the I-domain, has been implicated in the binding of Mac-1 to several ligands (20Ustinov V.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To verify whether Mac-1 is required for optimal phagocytosis of IgGRBC, we tested the effect of a recombinant GST fusion protein of the I-domain of CD11b (GST-αMI-domain) on phagocytosis. Parallel control experiments were performed by using the GST protein alone. Fig. 1 shows that in the presence of the GST-αMI-domain fusion protein, the phagocytic index was reduced by 55% (to 128 ± 27) as compared with untreated controls, whereas preincubation in the presence of GST alone had no effect on phagocytosis. These results confirm that CD11b/CD18 is implicated in FcγR-induced phagocytosis, at least in part through the I-domain of CD11b. In addition to CD11b/CD18, we found that RAW264.7 cells express also CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1). We therefore examined the possible role of this β2 integrin during IgG-induced phagocytosis. F(ab′)2 fragments of blocking mAb against the α chain of LFA-1 did not alter phagocytosis of IgG-RBC (Fig. 1). These results imply that not all β2 integrin family members participate in IgG-mediated phagocytosis. We therefore focused on CD18 and CD11b during the rest of this study. Accumulation of CD18 and CD11b at the Phagocytic Cup—To investigate the relationship between FcγR and Mac-1, we first studied the distribution of CD18 and CD11b during phagocytosis of IgG-RBC. Fig. 2, A–D, shows that both CD18 and CD11b accumulate in phagocytic cups, identified by the presence of adherent IgG-RBC and, more importantly, by the enrichment in F-actin. Fig. 2E displays a typical case of CD18 accumulation in the cup and Fig. 2F illustrates the line-scanning method used to quantify the enrichment in CD18 and CD11b at the cup, in comparison to its density in the contralateral membrane. In 45 determinations, the density of CD18 at the cup consistently exceeded the levels found in other regions of the plasmalemma (62 ± 2% over the overall plasmalemma level). These results are consistent with the phagosomal localization of Mac-1 reported previously (25Morrissette N.S. Gold E.S. Guo J. Hamerman J.A. Ozinsky A. Bedian V. Aderem A.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in lipopolysaccharideprimed murine peritoneal macrophages during phagocytosis of IgG-zymosan. FcγR and CD11b Chains Do Not Interact Constitutively—Because FcγR are known to accumulate at the phagocytic cup, the concomitant accumulation of Mac-1 suggests that the two types of receptors may interact physically. To define whether the two receptor types are constitutively associated, we analyzed whether internalization of FcγR induced by soluble IgG complexes drives also the internalization of Mac-1. When added at 4 °C, agg-IgG binds to the surface of RAW264.7 cells, which can be readily verified by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, A and G) or flow cytometry (cf. Fig. 3G , inset) by using an anti-human secondary antibody. At 37 °C, the receptor clustering triggered by agg-IgG induces endocytosis of the FcγR, which can be visualized by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, D and J) and quantified by flow cytometry using antibodies to human IgG (cf. Fig. 3J , inset) or FcγR (not shown; see Ref. 26Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar for example). Note that whereas a sizable fraction of FcγR becomes internalized under these conditions, the density of Mac-1 at the cell surface remained unaltered. This was apparent by microscopy (cf. Fig. 3, B and H with E and K, respectively) but more accurately established by flow cytometry (cf. Fig. 3, C and I with F and L, respectively). Similar results were obtained when internalization was induced by cross-linking FcγR by using sequentially mouse IgG and anti-mouse IgG (not shown). These data strongly suggest that Mac-1 and FcγR are not constitutively associated. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that constitutively associated receptors may undergo dissociation upon endocytosis and that Mac-1 recycles rapidly to the surface. We therefore used an alternative approach to evaluate the interaction of the receptors, which did not require receptor cross-linking. This was accomplished by comparing the lateral mobility of Mac-1 and of FcγR by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Receptors on the dorsal membrane, near the edge of the cells, were chosen for these measurements to minimize the curvature and thereby ensure that the area under study was within the confocal plane. As depicted in Fig. 4, A–F, and quantified"
https://openalex.org/W1996483373,"The mechanism of flavin reduction in morphinone reductase (MR) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase, and flavin oxidation in MR, has been studied by stopped-flow and steady-state kinetic methods. The temperature dependence of the primary kinetic isotope effect for flavin reduction in MR and PETN reductase by nicotinamide coenzyme indicates that quantum mechanical tunneling plays a major role in hydride transfer. In PETN reductase, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is essentially independent of temperature in the experimentally accessible range, contrasting with strongly temperature-dependent reaction rates, consistent with a tunneling mechanism from the vibrational ground state of the reactive C–H/D bond. In MR, both the reaction rates and the KIE are dependent on temperature, and analysis using the Eyring equation suggests that hydride transfer has a major tunneling component, which, unlike PETN reductase, is gated by thermally induced vibrations in the protein. The oxidative half-reaction of MR is fully rate-limiting in steady-state turnover with the substrate 2-cyclohexenone and NADH at saturating concentrations. The KIE for hydride transfer from reduced flavin to the α/β unsaturated bond of 2-cyclohexenone is independent of temperature, contrasting with strongly temperature-dependent reaction rates, again consistent with ground-state tunneling. A large solvent isotope effect (SIE) accompanies the oxidative half-reaction, which is also independent of temperature in the experimentally accessible range. Double isotope effects indicate that hydride transfer from the flavin N5 atom to 2-cyclohexenone, and the protonation of 2-cyclohexenone, are concerted and both the temperature-independent KIE and SIE suggest that this reaction also proceeds by ground-state quantum tunneling. Our results demonstrate the importance of quantum tunneling in the reduction of flavins by nicotinamide coenzymes. This is the first observation of (i) three H-nuclei in an enzymic reaction being transferred by tunneling and (ii) the utilization of both passive and active dynamics within the same native enzyme.

Enzymes are phenomenal catalysts that can achieve rate enhancements of up to ∼21 orders of magnitude over the uncatalyzed reaction rate (1Lad C. Williams N.H. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Our quest to understand the physical basis of this catalytic power is challenging and has involved sustained and intensive research efforts by many workers in the physical and life sciences (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Neet K.E.

B. 2003; 107: 366-371Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that dynamics of the enzyme should be divided into two types, passive (reorganization energy) and active (gating or vibrational enhancement), and that tunneling is gated via active dynamics (i.e. a vibration modulating the hydrogen transfer coordinate becomes thermally active resulting in increased tunneling probability) (14Knapp M.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5503-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which prompted us to study more broadly a potential role for H-tunneling in flavoproteins that operate with nicotinamide coenzymes. Herein, we have studied hydride and proton transfer in morphinone reductase (MR) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase. Crystallographic structures of these enzymes have established a close relationship to Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) (28Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), reflected also in the ability of the OYE family members to reduce a number of two-cyclic enones and to form complexes with steroids. Like OYE, MR is a dimer, but the nature of the subunit interactions is different from those seen in OYE. PETN reductase is a monomer and resembles in fold a single subunit of OYE and MR, based on the archetypal 8-fold β/α barrel topology. The active sites of all three enzymes are remarkably conserved despite differences in their catalytic properties. NADPH-dependent PETN reductase was purified and cloned from a strain of Enterobacter cloacae (strain PB2), which was isolated on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate ester explosives such as PETN and glycerol trinitrate as a sole nitrogen source (31Binks P.R. French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1214-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6623-6627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MR was identified in a strain of Pseudomonas putida (strain M10) isolated from industrial waste liquors (33French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MR catalyzes the NADH-dependent saturation of the carbon-carbon bond of both morphinone and codeinone to produce hydromorphone (a powerful analgesic) and hydrocodone (an antitussive), which are valuable semi-synthetic opiate drugs (34Melmon K. Morrelli H. Clinical Pharmacology: Basic Principles in Therapeutics. Macmillan Publishing Co., New York1972Google Scholar, 35Moffat A. Jackson J. Moss M. Widdop B. Clarke's Isolation and Identification of Drugs. The Pharmaceutical Press, London1986Google Scholar). The half-reactions of MR and PETN reductase have been investigated using stopped-flow methods (29Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), enabling elucidation of the kinetic mechanisms for each half-reaction. We demonstrate in this report that hydride transfer from nicotinamide coenzyme to flavin in both enzymes occurs by quantum tunneling but that the nature of the tunneling reaction is different. Despite the similar active site architectures, this likely reflects differences in the dynamics of the enzyme scaffold in MR and PETN reductase. We show additionally that hydride transfer from reduced flavin to the substrate 2-cyclohexenone in MR also occurs by tunneling and that this reaction is concerted with proton transfer from an unidentified active site acid to the substrate unsaturated bond. Chemicals and Enzymes—Complex bacteriological media were from Oxoid. Mimetic Orange 2 and Mimetic Yellow 2 affinity chromatography resins were from Affinity Chromatography Ltd. Q-Sepharose resin was from Amersham Biosciences. PETN reductase was prepared from Escherichia coli JM109/pONR1 and purified as described previously (32French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6623-6627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also incorporating a final chromatographic step using Q-Sepharose (28Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). MR was purified from a recombinant strain of E. coli transformed with plasmid pMORB2, which expresses the enzyme from the cloned mor B gene as described previously (33French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but also incorporating a final chromatographic step using Q-Sepharose (29Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). NADPH and NADH were from Sigma. 2-Cyclohexenone was from Acros Organics. Deuterium oxide (99.9% deuterium) was from Goss Scientific Instruments Ltd. The following extinction coefficients were used to calculate the concentration of substrates and enzymes: NAD(P)H (ϵ340 = 6.22 × 103m–1 cm–1); PETN reductase and MR (ϵ464 = 11.3 × 103m–1 cm–1); and 2-cyclohexenone (ϵ232 = 11.0 × 103m–1 cm–1). Deuterated Compounds—A-side NAD2H was synthesized enzymatically as described previously (38Viola R.E. Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and ethanol-precipitated by using the method of Pollock and Barber (39Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1430-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A further purification step was performed using a Q-Sepharose column. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 9 (buffer A), and A-side NAD2H (∼20 mg) applied to the column. The column was washed with buffer A and then developed with a linear gradient of 10 mm to 400 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 9; NAD2H eluted at ∼300 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate. The A 260/A 340 ratio of nucleotide-containing fractions was determined, and those fractions with a ratio of ≤2.3 were deemed pure (39Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1430-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), pooled, and freeze-dried. Purified NAD2H was stored at –80 °C and dissolved in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, prior to use in kinetic experiments. The synthesis and purification of NADP2H was as for NAD2H but with the following modifications: NADP+-specific Thermoanaerobium brockii alcohol dehydrogenase was used in the enzymatic synthesis of NADP2H. NADP2H was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column with 400 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 9. Preparation of Anaerobic Samples—Buffers were made anaerobic by bubbling argon gas through solutions for ∼2 h. Solutions were then placed in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology) overnight to remove any residual traces of oxygen. Protein samples were made anaerobic by passing them through a small gel filtration (Bio-Rad 10 DG) column housed in the glove box, which had been pre-equilibrated with anaerobic buffer. Coenzyme solutions were made by adding the solid to anaerobic buffer. Solutions of 2-cyclohexenone were made by diluting a 10 m stock into anaerobic buffer. Solvent Isotope Effect Experiments—For experiments conducted in 2H2O, all buffer components and substrates were dissolved in 2H2O, and the pD of the solution was calculated by the addition of 0.4 to the pH meter reading to correct for the isotope effect on the electrode. Stock solutions of MR were exhaustively dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pD 7.0. Preparation of anaerobic samples was as outlined above. Kinetic Measurements—To prevent the oxidase activities of MR and PETN reductase, all kinetic studies were performed under strict anaerobic conditions (<5 ppm O2) within a glove box environment (Belle Technology). Experiments were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at the stated temperatures. Rapid reaction kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped-flow spectrophotometer contained within the glove box. Spectral changes accompanying flavin reduction and reoxidation in both enzymes were monitored by multiple-wavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy using a photodiode array detector and X-SCAN software (Applied Photophysics). Spectral deconvolution was performed by global analysis and numerical integration methods using PROKIN software (Applied Photophysics). For single-wavelength studies, data collected at 464 nm (flavin reduction and reoxidation) were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression analysis on an Acorn Risc PC microcomputer using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). In the reductive half-reaction, experiments were performed by mixing enzyme in the appropriate buffer with an equal volume of reducing cofactor in the same buffer at the desired concentration. For studies of the oxidative half-reaction, the sequential mixing mode of the stopped-flow apparatus was used. Enzyme was rapidly mixed with a stoichiometric amount of reducing cofactor to enable reduction of the enzyme-bound FMN and after a suitable pre-determined aging period, the reduced enzyme solution was rapidly mixed with 2-cyclohexenone and reoxidation monitored at 464 nm. In both half-reactions, the concentration of substrate was always at least 10-fold greater than that of enzyme, thereby ensuring pseudo-first-order conditions. For each substrate concentration, at least five replica measurements were collected and averaged. The kinetics of the reductive half-reaction of MR and PETN reductase were investigated at 464 nm, essentially as described previously (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Observed rate constants for flavin absorption changes occurring in the reductive half-reactions of both enzymes were obtained from fits of the data to a standard double-exponential expression, where k obs1 (95% total absorption change) and k obs2 (5% total absorption change) are observed rate constants for fast and slow phases, respectively. The faster of the two phases is attributed to flavin reduction, as indicated by photodiode array experiments of the reductive half-reaction. The slow phase represents a minor spectral change, the origin of which is uncertain. Observed rates for the fast phase (k obs1) for both half-reactions were fitted using the general hyperbolic expression (Equation 1), consistent with the kinetic schemes presented under “Results” and with previous reported studies (see Refs. 36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 37Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar for further details). kobs=klim[S]K+[S](Eq. 1) In Equation 1, k lim is the limiting rate for flavin reduction (reductive half-reaction) or flavin oxidation (oxidative half-reaction). At low temperatures (5 °C), flavin reduction was essentially independent of reducing nicotinamide coenzyme concentration, consistent with previous studies (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the rate of flavin reduction was measured in H2O in the range pH 5.5–9 using KMB buffer (55 mm MES, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm ethanolamine). In the oxidative half-reaction of MR, absorption changes at 464 nm were reported upon flavin oxidation by 2-cyclohexenone as described previously (29Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transients were biphasic, with the fast phase (k obs1; 90% of the total absorption change) reporting upon flavin oxidation. The origin of the slow phase (k obs2; 10% of the total absorption change) is uncertain. Observed rates for the fast phase were hyperbolically dependent on substrate concentration, and data were fitted using Equation 1. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed using a Jasco V530 UV/VIS spectrophotometer with a 1-cm light path. Assays were conducted in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. For determination of the kinetic parameters (apparent Km and k cat) for 2-cyclohexenone, the reaction mixture contained 150 μm NADH, 250 nm MR, and the concentration of 2-cyclohexenone was varied. Initial velocity data as a function of 2-cyclohexenone were analyzed by fitting to the standard Michaelis-Menten rate equation. The pH dependence of the steady-state reaction was measured in H2O and 2H2O in the range pH 5.5–9 using KMB buffer. In both the pH and temperature dependence studies the concentration of 2-cyclohexenone was kept constant (and saturating) at 50 mm. MR activity was measured by following the decrease in absorption at 350 nm due to oxidation of NADH, and initial rates of reaction were calculated using an ϵ = 5650 m–1 cm–1. Enzyme-monitored Turnover—Steady-state measurements were also performed using the enzyme monitored turnover method as described by Gibson et al. (40Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for reactions catalyzed by glucose oxidase. Reactions were performed in an Applied Photophysics SX18-MVR reaction analyzer. Solution conditions are described under “Results.” Data analysis was essentially as described elsewhere (40Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature Dependence of the Reductive half-reaction of MR and Kinetic Isotope Effects—The mechanism of flavin reduction in MR was determined previously and shown to involve the rapid formation of an E-NADHCT charge-transfer intermediate prior to flavin reduction (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). Formation and decay of the charge-transfer species can be monitored at 552 nm and flavin reduction at 462 nm. The decay of the charge-transfer species is kinetically indistinguishable from flavin reduction, indicating the two processes are linked (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Spectral changes observed in the reductive half-reactions of MR with a 10-fold excess of NADH were previously shown to fit to a two-step kinetic model: A → B → C, consistent with these assignments, where A is the oxidized enzyme, B is an enzymecoenzyme charge-transfer intermediate, and C is the enzyme containing the reduced (dihydroflavin) form of the flavin cofactor (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although fitting to more complex reversible kinetic models was not explored. In performing more extensive kinetic studies to search for tunneling regimes in the hydride transfer reaction from NADH to FMN, it is essential to know if the measured rate constants in stopped-flow experiments support (i) the approach to an equilibrium position for a reversible chemical step or (ii) an essentially irreversible reaction. With this in mind, we have conducted additional stopped-flow measurements using photodiode array spectroscopy and analyzed globally the spectral changes by fitting to reversible kinetic models. Data were collected for reactions of MR with protiated and deuterated coenzyme at both 5 °C and 36 °C (i.e. the extremes of the temperature range used in analysis of the temperature dependence of the reductive half-reaction described below). A typical dataset is shown in Fig. 1 for the reaction of 20 μm MR with 200 μm NADH at 5 °C. Attempts to fit to a fully reversible model, A ↔ B ↔ C were unsuccessful based on a number of criteria. 2Appropriate fitting to the kinetic model was assessed using a number of criteria. These involved: examination of the calculated spectra to ensure they made chemical sense in terms of shape and sign (in this case negative absorption spectra were predicted); the lack of systematic deviations of the residual plot; convergence to the model obtained within a sensible number of iterative cycles (no more than 10); confirmation that the number of significant singular values following singular value decomposition are consistent with the fitted model. However, the data were readily fitted to the A → B → C kinetic model (rate constant for A → B is 154 s–1; rate constant for B → C is 14.8 s–1) as described previously by Craig et al. (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the determined rate constants agree closely with those determined from single wavelength analysis of kinetic transients at 462 nm (flavin reduction) and 552 nm (charge transfer formation and decay). For the fully reversible kinetic model A ↔ B ↔ C, the criteria used to assess the fit 2Appropriate fitting to the kinetic model was assessed using a number of criteria.

Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The predicted spectra for the enzyme forms (Fig. 1B) obtained by fitting to a reversible scheme in which the rate of conversion of C → B is very small (0.1 s–1) are essentially identical to those obtained when fitting to the A → B → C model (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This indicates that the rate of reverse hydride transfer from FMNH2 to NAD+ is negligible. Qualitatively, similar results were obtained for reactions performed at 36 °C and in studies with NAD2H. These observations are consistent with the known reduction potential of NADH (–320 mV) and MR (–237 mV) (41Craig D.H. Barna T. Moody P.C. Bruce N.C. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. Scrutton N.S. Biochem.

In protozoan parasites they occur separately or as part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of molecules implicated in virulence, such as lipophosphoglycan (LPG), smaller glycosylinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), and GPI-anchored proteins.

At least 10% of the total membrane lipids in Leishmania consist of ether lipids within GPI anchors or in phospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylserine (17Beach D.H. Holz Jr., G.G. Anekwe G.E. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Singh B.N. Costello C.E. Beach D.H. Holz Jr., G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ether lipid analogs have strong inhibitory activity against parasites exemplified by the recent introduction of miltefosine into clinical usage against Leishmania donovani (for a review, see Ref. 20Croft S.L. Seifert K. Duchene M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In mammals ether phospholipids constitute nearly 20% of total phospholipids, occurring most commonly as 1-O-alkenyl-2-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens (for a review, see Ref. 21Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Plasmalogens have been implicated in signal transduction, membrane fusion and trafficking, oxidant resistance, and prostaglandin synthesis (for a review, see Ref. 21Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To focus on the question of the role of the lipid moiety of GPI anchors in the infective cycle, we took a genetic approach targeting alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (ADS, EC 2.5.1.26), the first committed step in ether lipid synthesis. In Leishmania as in other organisms, this pathway begins with the acylation of dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) followed by replacement of the acyl group with an alkyl group and then reduction to give the ether lipid precursors 1-alkylglycerol-3-phosphate (22Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Lux H. Heise N. Klenner T. Hart D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In mammals this pathway occurs in peroxisomes, while in trypanosomatids it occurs in glycosomes, a microbody variant of peroxisomes (for reviews, see Refs. 22Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 24Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ADS activity has been characterized, and its gene has been identified in a number of species including Trypanosoma brucei (22Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Lux H. Heise N. Klenner T. Hart D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem.

Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We used this information to identify the Leishmania gene ADS1 and to create null mutants to assess the role of ether lipids in parasite metabolism and virulence. Parasite Culture—Leishmania major Friedlin strain V1 (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin) promastigote forms were cultivated in M199 medium at 26 °C and transfected by electroporation (27Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As needed, G418, hygromycin, nourseothricin, or puromycin were added at 10, 50, 100, and 50 μg/ml, respectively. Metacyclic promastigotes were prepared by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (28Späth G.F. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 99: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology—All enzyme restriction reactions, PCR, and DNA and RNA extractions and hybridizations (Southern blot, Northern blot, and colony hybridization) were performed by standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA hybridization probes were made using a random priming kit (Roche Applied Science). The gene D/SHERP probe was obtained by PCR from genomic DNA with primers Y09088 137–156 (5′-GATCCGCGCAGACCAAGATG) and Y09087 320–300 (5′-CAGAGAACGGCGAAGGGACTG). For reverse transcriptase PCR, cDNA was prepared from RNA isolated from logarithmic phase promastigotes using random primers for the reverse transcription reaction (Invitrogen) and used as template for PCR with an oligonucleotide specific for the miniexon (SMB936, 5′-ACCGCTATATAAAGTATCAGTTCTGTACTTTA) and one specific for ADS1 (either SMB1012, 5′-ACTAGTGCTGTCCTGTGTTTTATCG, located in the 5′ untranslated region, or SMB1017, 5′-ATCTGCATCTGGACATCC, located within the ADS1 coding region). These products were directly sequenced by the chain termination method. Cloning of ADS1 of L. major and Plasmid Construction—A 1.58-kb fragment was obtained following PCR with L. major genomic DNA template and the ADS1 degenerate primers SMB929 (5′-AAGTGGAAYGGNTGGGG) and SMB931 (5′-CCSATNCCGTGGTGGTGNGT). This was inserted into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to give pCRII.DHAP-PCR (strain B3772) and sequenced. This PCR product was used to screen a L. major Friedlin strain V1 cLHYG cosmid library (30Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by colony hybridization. Positive clones were further analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion followed by Southern blot analysis probed with the 1.58-kb PCR product. A 3.6-kb SphI fragment containing ADS1 was cloned into pUC19 yielding pUC.DHAP.Sp1 (B3793) and sequenced on both strands. Plasmids for inactivation of ADS1 were generated as follows from pUC.DHAP.Sp1 (B3793) that carries a 3.6-kb SphI fragment containing the entire ADS1 gene and flanking regions. The 1.7-kb SphI-Eco47III fragment (blunt-ended) of the ADS1 open reading frame was replaced with the HYG or SAT cassettes as SpeI-AflII fragments (blunt-ended, 2.2 and 1.8 kb, respectively) excised from pX63HYG (31Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) or pXGSAT (B2352). pXGSAT was constructed by replacing the NEO marker with a PCR-amplified (SMB248, 5′-CGACTAGTTAGCCGTCATCCTGTGC; SMB249, 5′-GTGACTAGTATGAAGATTTCGGTGATCC) SAT cassette from pLEXSAT (32Joshi P.B. Webb J.R. Davies J.E. McMaster W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) cloned in the SpeI site of pXG1a (33Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), respectively. The plasmids carrying the resistance marker in the same transcription orientation as the ADS1 gene were kept and named pUC.DHAP: HYGΔSS (B3796) and pUC.DHAP:SAT-BΔSS (B3828), respectively. pXG-ADS1 and pXG-GFP-ADS1 (B3909 and B4187, respectively) were made as follows. BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ADS1 gene were introduced successively by PCR and cloning to yield pUC.BDHAP-B (B3840). The ADS1 BamHI fragment was ligated in the sense orientation into the BamHI site of pXG (33Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or pXG-GFP2+/(B2952). pX63PAC-LdSAcP-1 (B4191) was obtained by inserting a sense bluntended 3-kb NcoI-PstI fragment from pLdSAcP3.9 (34Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pX63PAC (B2949). Western Blot Analysis—Leishmania were first washed once in PBS (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) and then lysed in SDS-PAGE loading dye (2% SDS (w/v), 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated for 15 min at 70 °C and loaded on discontinuous 4%/10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by the Towbin method. Preincubation, antibody incubations, and washes were conducted in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% skim milk added. Detection was performed with a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography. Enzyme Assays—ADS activity was measured in an enriched glycosome fraction using slight modifications of the protocol by Heise et al. (22Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 7 ml containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (STE buffer) and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (1500–2000 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4 °C). Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was briefly sonicated. The sample was mixed with 80% Percoll, 20% STE buffer to a final volume of 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 70,000 × g in a Beckman NVI90 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. Glycosome fractions banding at a density of 1.09–1.1 g/ml were taken. Protein concentration was determined according to the bicinchoninic acid assay with a bovine serum albumin standard. Alkyl-DHAP synthase activity was measured in triplicate as described previously with slight modifications (26Zomer A.W. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 mg of glycosomal proteins were incubated in 100 μl containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 μm [14C]hexadecanol, 90 μm palmitoyl-DHAP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor at 37 °C for 40 min and extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) (35Schrakamp G.

The organic phase was dried under nitrogen, spotted onto silica gel 60 plates, and resolved in solvent chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, 5% sodium bisulfite (100:40:12:4, v/v/v/v); bands were visualized with Lester reagent (36Ryu E.K. MacCoss M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 561-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in bands with ∼R F of 3.5 was measured by scintillation counting. For secretory acid phosphatase assay cell supernatants were loaded on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in the absence of SDS (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar); separating and stacking gels were 6 and 3% acrylamide, respectively. Acid phosphatase was visualized as described previously (38Katakura K. Kobayashi A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase antibody was performed as described previously (39Shih S. Hwang H.Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1534-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry with WIC79.3 antibodies (40Tolson D.L. Turco S.J. Beecroft R.P. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and gp46 were performed according to Ref. 41Späth G.F. Epstein L. Leader B. Singer S.M. Avila H.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9258-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar. For transmission electron microscopy, parasites were washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7, and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (electron microscopy grade, Sigma) in cacodylate buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 5% sucrose, and 0.15% ruthenium red (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following three washes in cacodylate buffer, parasites were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), 2 mm CaCl2, 0.15% ruthenium red in cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then rinsed extensively in cacodylate buffer, 3% sucrose and deionized water prior to staining with 1% uranyl acetate. Following several rinses in deionized water, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Spurrs resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections of 70–80 nm were cut, stained with lead citrate, and viewed on a Zeiss 902 transmission electron microscope. Phospholipid, GIPL, and LPG Analysis—Bulk phospholipids and GIPLs were purified and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) in positive and negative ion modes as described previously (10McConville M.J. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 757-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Schneiter R. Brugger B. Sandhoff R. Zellnig G. Leber A. Lampl M. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Eder S. Daum G. Paltauf F. Wieland F.T. Kohlwein S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) (approximately 2 × 106 cell eq/μl) and introduced into the electrospray source of the mass spectrometer (Quattro triple quadrupole, Micromass) at 5 μl/min with a syringe pump. Parameters were as follows: skimmer/cone offset 5 V; capillary, high voltage lens, and cone voltages, 3 kV, 0.5 kV, and 25 V, respectively for positive ion mass spectra and 3 kV, 0.5 kV, and 45 V for negative ion mass spectra. CID spectra were achieved in a hexapole collision cell containing argon (2.5 × 10-3 torrs). Parent ion spectra were taken using the following accelerating voltages into the collision cell: parents of m/z 184 (for PC detection), 27 V (positive ion mode); parents of m/z 241 (for PI detection), 45 V (negative ion mode); neutral loss of m/z 141 (for detection of PE), 12 V (positive ion mode); and neutral loss of m/z 185 (for detection of phosphatidylserine), 27 V (positive ion mode). Daughter ion spectra of [M - H]- pseudomolecular ions used acceleration voltages of 30–100 V. GIPLs were dissolved in 70% propan-1-ol, 5 mm ammonium acetate at ∼20 pmol/μl and introduced into the electrospray source at 5 μl/min using a syringe pump. Samples were analyzed in positive ion mode with a capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 130 V. Daughter ion spectra were collected using an accelerating voltage of 30–100 V. Daughter ion spectra of alkenyl-acyl-PE [M - H]- pseudomolecular ions were recorded with an LCQ-Duo ion trap electrospray mass spectrometer (Finnigan-Thermoquest, San Jose, CA). Samples were introduced at 5 μl/min. Source voltage and current were 4.52 kV and 0.24 mA, and capillary voltage and temperature were set at 19–36 V and 200 °C. The collision energy was 28% (1.4 eV) under helium pressure. Fragmentation spectra were collected in the m/z 175–800 range at a rate of three microscans over a maximum ion injection time of 200 ms. LPG and the “LPG-like” material in ads1 - were purified as described previously (13Orlandi Jr., P.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10384-10391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments exponentially growing cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]galactose (50 μCi for 8 × 108 cells) for 6 h. PG repeat structures were determined from LPG (∼50 pmol in 5% propan-1-ol, 5 mm ammonium acetate) by ESI-MS as described previously (43Wilson I.B. O'Donnell N. Allen S. Mehlert A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Detergent-resistant Membrane (DRM) Preparation and Analysis— Crude membranes were prepared from 108 log phase parasites, and DRMs were isolated on a step gradient after extraction with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C as described previously (44Denny P.W. Field M.C. Smith D.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fractions were then taken from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting. Mouse and Macrophage Infections—Mice were injected with promastigotes that had been in stationary phase 4 days (1 × 106) or amastigotes (1 × 105) subcutaneously into footpads, and lesion size and parasite numbers were measured (41Späth G.F. Epstein L. Leader B. Singer S.M. Avila H.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9258-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 45Titus R.G. Marchand M. Boon T.

Parasitol. 2001; 99: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and crude amastigotes were prepared from lesions (41Späth G.F. Epstein L. Leader B. Singer S.M. Avila H.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9258-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised lesions were placed in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and dissociated with a Dounce homogenizer, tissue fragments and intact host cells were removed by a low speed centrifugation at 200 × g, and amastigotes were pelleted at 1800 × g. Amastigotes were washed twice in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then counted with a hemocytometer. For nitrite quantification, macrophages were induced in the presence of interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide (100 units and 100 ng/ml, respectively) exactly 4 h after the 2-h wash. Nitrite was quantified 48 h after macrophage induction according to Ref. 47Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal.

Lysis by human complement was measured with mid-log phase cultures (5 × 106/ml) incubated with varying amounts of human serum for 30 min at 26 °C (41Späth G.F. Epstein L. Leader B. Singer S.M.

Characterization of L. major ADS1—From known ADS sequences we designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers for amplification of the L. major gene and recovered the parasite gene by screening a L. major cosmid library. Southern blot analysis showed that the Leishmania ADS1 gene was single copy (Fig. 1A), which was confirmed by targeted gene replacement (described below, Fig. 1D). The sequence of the ADS1 gene predicted a protein of 621 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AY328521) with strong homology to the ADS proteins of T. brucei (59% identity) and other eukaryotes including mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Dictyostelium (30–37% identity). ADS1 lacked obvious transmembrane domains but contained at its C terminus the sequence SHI, which resembled typical type 1 peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1, Ref. 48Sommer J.M. Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 105-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We created an N-terminal GFP-ADS1 fusion protein, which was shown to be enzymatically active following transfection into ads1 - null mutants (below and data not shown). Fluorescence microscopy showed that GFP-ADS1 fusion protein was correctly targeted to the Leishmania glycosome (analogous to peroxisomes of other creatures) and co-localized with the glycosomal marker hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Fig. 1E and Ref. 39Shih S.

In trypanosomatids mRNAs bear a 39-nucleotide 5′-terminal exon added by trans-splicing (49Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase PCR with miniexon and ADS1-specific primers mapped the splice acceptor site to nucleotide position -355 relative to the predicted ADS1 initiation codon. Northern blot analysis showed that ADS1 mRNA was expressed at similar levels in all developmental stages as two transcripts of 4.6 and 6.6 kb (Fig. 1B). Generation of an ads1 - Knock-out—An ads1 - null mutant (ΔADS1::SAT/ΔADS1::HYG) was generated by two rounds of gene replacement since Leishmania is an asexual diploid (Ref. 31Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1, C and D, for predicted structures of replacements and Southern blot confirmation). These were recovered at typical frequencies, appeared morphologically to be normal, and grew well in culture with a doubling time of 8.1 versus 7 h for wild type (WT, Table I). As a control “add-back” line for subsequent studies, several ads1 - mutants were transfected with the ADS1-expressing plasmid pXG-ADS1, yielding lines termed ads1 -/+ADS1. ads1 - differentiated normally to the infective metacyclic stage (Table I) where it expressed stage-specific markers such as SHERP (Fig. 2B).Table IGrowth, differentiation, and serum sensitivity of WT and ads1 - mutant L. majorWTads1–ads1–/+ADS1Percentage of metacyclic promastigotes (after 4 days in stationary phase)4.5 ± 05.6 ± 0.8NDPercentage of human serum (complement) required for 50% lysis (IC50)6.3 ± 1.81.0 ± 0.046 ± 2.4Promastigote doubling time in vitro (h)7 ± 0.358.1 ± 0.5NDAmastigote doubling time in macrophages (days)1.8 ± 0.25.1 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.1 Open table"
https://openalex.org/W2003717601,"All type I DnaJ (Hsp40) homologues share the presence of two highly conserved zinc centers. To elucidate their function, we constructed DnaJ mutants that separately replaced cysteines of either zinc center I or zinc center II with serine residues. We found that in the absence of zinc center I, the autonomous, DnaK-independent chaperone activity of DnaJ is dramatically reduced. Surprisingly, this only slightly impaired the in vivo function of DnaJ, and its ability to function as a co-chaperone in the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE foldase machine. The DnaJ zinc center II, on the other hand, was found to be absolutely essential for the in vivo and in vitro function of DnaJ. This did not seem to be caused by a lack of substrate binding affinity or an inability to work as an ATPase-stimulating factor. Rather it appears that zinc center II mutant proteins lack a necessary additional interaction site with DnaK, which seems to be crucial for locking-in substrate proteins onto DnaK. These findings led us to a model in which ATP hydrolysis in DnaK is only the first step in converting DnaK into its high affinity binding state. Additional interactions between DnaK and DnaJ are required to make the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE foldase machinery catalytically active.

The heat shock proteins DnaJ (Hsp40), DnaK (Hsp70), and GrpE form a highly efficient and conserved molecular chaperone machinery. Under non-stress conditions, this chaperone system appears to be involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, in protein assembly and disassembly, and in the translocation of proteins into organelles. Under stress conditions, it plays a role in the protection of proteins against stress-induced protein unfolding and in the refolding of unfolded proteins (1Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar).The functions of the “foldase” DnaK and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE are quite well understood. In contrast, however, the roles of DnaJ and its homologues are still somewhat enigmatic (2Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). DnaJ consists of four domains that are conserved to various degrees among the homologues. The N-terminal 76-amino acid J-domain defines proteins as members of the DnaJ/Hsp40 family and is, thus, present in all DnaJ/Hsp40 family members (3Hennessy F. Cheetham M.E. Dirr H.W. Blatch G.L. Cell Stress Chaper. 2000; 5: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It contains the conserved tripeptide His-Pro-Asp, which is essential for DnaJ-DnaK interactions and for the stimulation of the ATPase activity of DnaK (4Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.U. McColl D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the J-domain resides the glycine- and phenylalanine-rich G/F domain (residues 77–107). Together with the J-domain, the G/F domain is essential for maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity of DnaK (7Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The central domain of DnaJ is the zinc-binding cysteine-rich CR-domain (residues 144–200), which is followed by a poorly conserved C-terminal CTD-domain (8Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Hsp40 homologues that contain all four domains are called class I DnaJ homologues. They exert autonomous, DnaK-independent chaperone activity as well as a DnaK-dependent co-chaperone activity (9Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The autonomous chaperone activity is characterized by the ability of excess amounts of DnaJ to bind to unfolded substrate proteins and to prevent their irreversible aggregation (10Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 11Schroder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone activity of DnaJ, on the other hand, is based on the synergistic interaction of DnaJ and DnaK with substrate proteins and results in the efficient suppression of aggregation at much lower DnaJ concentrations than DnaJ alone is capable of. DnaJ works as the “holdase” by binding to and delivering unfolded substrate proteins to the foldase DnaK, which folds the protein. Interaction of the DnaJ-substrate protein complex with the DnaK-ATP-substrate protein complex maximally stimulates ATP hydrolysis. This is thought to cause conformational changes in DnaK that increase DnaK affinity for unfolded substrate proteins and that causes the lock-in of substrate proteins to the substrate binding site of DnaK (7Karzai A.W.

A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Class II DnaJ/Hsp40 homologues lack the central cysteinerich zinc binding domain but have two C-terminal domains, CTD1 and CTD2, instead (16Sha B. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). They have not been found to exert any autonomous, Hsp70-independent ability to interact with unfolded substrate proteins. However, in concert with Hsp70 homologues, they will support the refolding of unfolded proteins such as luciferase in vitro, albeit with about 4-fold less efficiency than class I DnaJ homologues (9Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Class III DnaJ representatives only have the J-domain in common. They appear unable to work as molecular chaperones in vitro. In vivo, they have been found to be involved in protein secretion (17Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).The cysteine-rich zinc binding region of class I DnaJ homologues is thought to be involved in the DnaK-dependent chaperone activity based on domain truncation studies and cysteine mutagenesis (9Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, conflicting results have been reported concerning the role of the entire zinc binding region in the autonomous DnaK-independent chaperone activity (8Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of the individual zinc centers in the DnaK-dependent and -independent chaperone function of DnaJ has not been investigated. The cysteine-rich CR-domain contains four repeated CXXCXGXG motifs, which are invariable to all class I DnaJ proteins (20Bardwell J.C. Tilly K. Craig E. King J. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1782-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has long been known that the two sulfur atoms of each consensus motif are involved in zinc coordination, resulting in the tetrahedral coordination of two zinc ions per DnaJ monomer (18Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the specific residues involved in each zinc coordination remained unclear until the NMR structure of the isolated cysteine-rich domain was solved in 2000 (Fig. 1) (21Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Prior to the solution of the structure, it was assumed that the four immediately adjacent cysteine residues were involved in each zinc site, with the four N-terminal cysteine residues forming zinc center I and the four C-terminal cysteines forming zinc center II (19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The solution structure clarified the arrangement of the individual zinc centers and revealed that zinc center I is actually formed by the two non-adjacent cysteine motifs 1 (Cys-144, Cys-147) and 4 (Cys-197, Cys-200), which are furthest apart in primary sequence. Zinc center II is coordinated by the conserved cysteines of the two adjacent cysteine motifs 2 (Cys-161, Cys-164) and 3 (Cys-183, Cys-186) (21Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This somewhat surprising arrangement meant that a number of experiments that had been conducted to investigate the function of the zinc centers in type I DnaJ homologues needed to be re-interpreted. For instance, experiments that were designed to disrupt the zinc centers individually probably only succeeded in altering one zinc center (19Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This also meant that no experiments had been conducted as yet, that separately investigated the specific role of these highly conserved zinc centers.To analyze the exact functional role of the two individual zinc centers in type I DnaJ homologues in vitro and in vivo, we constructed two DnaJ mutants, based on the NMR structure, which had either zinc center I or zinc center II disrupted. Our investigations revealed that zinc center I plays an important role in the autonomous, DnaK-independent chaperone activity of DnaJ and that the absence of this activity only slightly impairs the in vivo function of DnaJ. Zinc center II, on the other hand, is crucial for the in vivo function of DnaJ. Zinc center II mutants appear to lack a necessary additional interaction site between DnaJ-substrate complexes and DnaK-ADP substrate protein complexes, which seems to be essential for the refolding activity of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE foldase machinery.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Zinc Center Mutants of DnaJ—The amino acid substitutions C144S, C147S, C197S, C200S to generate DnaJΔZnI and C161S, C164S, C183S, C186S to generate DnaJΔZnII were constructed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pUH21–12fdΔ12 (gift from Dr. Bernd Bukau) as the parental plasmid. The resulting plasmids were sequenced and transformed into the dnaJ deletion strain PK11 (MG1655 ΔdnaJ Thr::Tn10) (gift from Dr. Elizabeth Craig) for phenotypical studies or into wild-type Escherichia coli WM3110 containing the plasmid pDMI (22Buchberger A. Schroder H. Buttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) for protein purification.Protein Purification—Wild-type DnaJ as well as the DnaJΔZnI and DnaJΔZnII mutant proteins were purified as previously described (22Buchberger A. Schroder H. Buttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with modifications to remove all residual detergents. After elution of the proteins from S-Sepharose Hitrap-column (Amersham Biosciences), the protein solutions were applied to a hydroxyapatite column, equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m urea, 2 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; PAR, 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol; PMPS, p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Brij58. The column was then washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m urea, 2 mm DTT, 1 m KCl followed by a wash with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m urea, 2 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl. DnaJ, and the mutant proteins were eluted using a gradient from 0 to 400 mm KH2PO4. The pooled fractions were diluted into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 m urea, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl and applied onto a Q-Sepharose Hitrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through contained >99% pure DnaJ or the mutant proteins, respectively. The DnaJ variants were dialyzed against 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.2, 120 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, and the protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 13.400 m–1 cm–1. Wild-type DnaK, overexpressed from the plasmid pMOB45, and GrpE overexpressed from the plasmid pWKG20, were purified as described (22Buchberger A. Schroder H. Buttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Zinc Measurements—The zinc content of DnaJ was determined using a combined PAR/PMPS assay (23Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this assay, free zinc readily interacts with 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) (Sigma) to form a Zn-(PAR)2 complex, which strongly absorbs at 500 nm. To determine the amount of free zinc in the protein solution, 1 μm DnaJ in 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.2, 120 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol was mixed with 100 μm PAR and the A 500 nm was monitored. To determine the amount of zinc that is cysteine-coordinated in wild-type DnaJ and mutant proteins, 2-μl aliquots of a 1 mm p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid (PMPS) (Sigma) titration solution (in 100 μm PAR, 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) were added, and changes in A 500 nm were monitored after each addition, until no further changes were detected (24Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PMPS forms stoichiometric mercaptide bonds with thiols. This leads to the release of zinc into the solution, where it is immediately complexed by PAR, thereby turning the solution red. A zinc standard was used to determine the extinction coefficient of the Zn(PAR)2 complex at 500 nm in 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.2, 120 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol.CD Measurements—All DnaJ proteins were dialyzed against 30 mm phosphate buffer pH 8.2, 120 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol. Then, the protein concentrations were adjusted to 10 μm. Cuvettes with pathlengths of 1 or 10 mm were used for far-UV-CD or near-UV-CD, respectively. CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter.Luciferase Aggregation and Reactivation Assay—8 μm firefly luciferase (Roche Applied Science) was denatured in 5 m guanidinium-HCl in 30 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, for at least 2 h at room temperature. Aggregation and reactivation was initiated by a 1:100 dilution into 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgATP at 30 °C. The buffers were either not supplemented with any chaperones or supplemented with the indicated concentrations of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. The extent of luciferase aggregation was determined 600 s after the dilution using light scattering measurements (Hitachi Fluorimeter F4500, λex/em = 320 nm, slit widths of 5.0 nm). To determine luciferase reactivation, aliquots were withdrawn and diluted into assay buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.8, 25 mm glycylglycine, 70 μm luciferin, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Luciferase activity was analyzed by monitoring chemiluminescence 1 min after the start of the reaction using a Hitachi Fluorometer F4500 (900 V, λem = 557 nm, 20-nm slit). The chemiluminescence was followed for 45 s at room temperature, and the initial activity was obtained by linear extrapolation (25Herbst R. Schafer U. Seckler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7099-7105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Determination of the DnaK ATPase Activity—The influence of DnaJ on the ATP hydrolysis of DnaK was determined using single turnover experiments (26Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μm DnaK was incubated with 40 μm ATP, 0.1–0.2 μCi/ml [α-32P]ATP in 40 mm MOPS pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 for 2 min on ice to allow the DnaK-[α-32P]ATP complex to form. Free ATP was separated from the complex using a micro Bio-Spin chromatography column (BioRad). DnaK-[α-32P]ATP aliquots were kept frozen until further use. DnaK concentration was determined using a Bradford assay. To determine the rate of ATP hydrolysis, 30-μl reactions containing 0.16 μm wild-type DnaJ or mutant proteins in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl were prepared and incubated at 25 °C. Immediately after addition of chemically denatured luciferase (final conc. 0.08 μm), the reaction was started with the addition of 0.8 μm DnaK-[α-32P]ATP complex. At the indicated time points, 2 μl of the reaction were withdrawn and spotted directly onto a PEI-cellulose TLC-plate (Merck). The plates were developed in 2 m formic acid/0.5 m LiCl. The amount of ADP formed was determined using a phosphorimager.RESULTSZinc Center II, Essential for in Vivo Function of DnaJ—The DnaJ cysteine-rich domain forms two zinc centers, each of which is composed of four conserved cysteines (18Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Szabo A.

Mol Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of the individual zinc centers in the function of class I DnaJ homologues, we decided to construct DnaJ mutants that had either all 4 cysteines of zinc center I (DnaJΔZnI) or of zinc center II (DnaJΔZnII) replaced by serine residues. To test the in vivo function of the two mutant proteins, plasmids expressing either the mutated dnaJ genes or wild-type dnaJ were transformed into the dnaJ deletion strain PK11. dnaJ deletion strains such as PK11 are unable to propagate λ-growth (27Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), do not grow at heat shock temperatures (≥43 °C) (28Sell S. Eisen C. Ang D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 72: 4827-4835Crossref Google Scholar), and are unable to swarm (29Shi W. Zhou Y. Wild J. Adler J. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These three phenotypes appear to depend on slightly different functions of the DnaJ protein. We, therefore, decided that analyzing the extent to which the two mutant proteins are able to rescue those diverse phenotypes should provide a valuable first tool to functionally evaluate our mutant proteins. To exclude the possibility that any observed phenotype is due to the under- or overexpression of the mutant proteins, quantitative Western blot analysis was performed of PK11 strains expressing the two mutant proteins. We found that both mutant proteins migrated slightly different on SDS-PAGE than wild-type DnaJ, but were expressed to levels that were very similar to DnaJ expressed from its own promoter off the chromosome at 37 °C (data not shown).In vivo analysis of the two mutant proteins revealed dramatic functional differences. PK11 strains expressing the zinc center II mutant protein failed to grow at 43 °C and formed smaller colonies at 37 °C than PK11 strains expressing wild-type DnaJ (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutants lacking zinc center I, on the other hand, showed no significant growth defect at 37 °C and were able to form small colonies at 43 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, zinc center II mutants were non-motile at 37 °C, whereas zinc center I mutants were fully motile (Fig. 2C). These functional differences between zinc center I and II mutants were not due to solubility and/or stability problems of the mutant DnaJ proteins. This became evident when λ-growth was tested in these strains. λ-Propagation only requires the presence of a functional N-terminal domain of DnaJ (30Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to be nearly indistinguishable in both mutant and wild-type strains (Table I).Fig. 2Zinc center II is crucial for the in vivo activity of DnaJ. Wild-type strain MG1655, dnaJ deletion strain PK11 as well as PK11 expressing either wild-type DnaJ or the individual zinc center mutants DnaJΔZnI or DnaJΔZnII were grown on LB plates overnight at 37 °C (A) or 43 °C (B). To analyze the motility of these strains at 37 °C (C), dnaJ deletion strain PK11 as well as PK11 expressing either wild-type DnaJ or the individual zinc center mutants DnaJΔZnI or DnaJΔZnII were grown on 0.3% LB agar plates for 15 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of the in vivo and in vitro properties of DnaJ class I zinc center mutantsIn vivoPK11PK11 pdnaJPK11 pdnaJΔZnIPK11 pdnaJΔZnIIλ-Phage replication-++++++Growth at 43 °C-+++-Growth at 37 °C++++++Motility-++++-In vitroDnaJ WTDnaJΔZnIDnaJΔZnIIZinc content (μm)/DnaJ (μm)1.4 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1Chaperone activityAutonomous, DnaK-independent+++++++DnaK-dependent++++++(+)ATPase (min-1) of DnaK- DnaJ0.016+ DnaJ0.8 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.2+ DnaJ + unfolded luciferase10.1 ± 2.06.0 ± 1.210.0 ± 3.7 Open table in a new tab These in vivo results provided the first evidence that the two highly conserved zinc centers might not form a single functional entity in DnaJ but exert rather distinct functional properties. The absence of zinc center I showed only a slight influence on the DnaJ function at heat shock temperatures and did not appear to affect growth or flagellum synthesis at 37 °C. Lack of zinc center II, on the other hand, dramatically influenced the function of DnaJ under both heat shock and nonstress temperature conditions.Zinc Center I and II of DnaJ Form Independently—In order to analyze the in vitro function of the two zinc center mutant proteins, we investigated the following properties: (i) zinc content, (ii) protein conformation, and (iii) in vitro chaperone activity of the mutant proteins alone and in concert with the DnaK/GrpE machinery. The DnaJΔZnI and DnaJΔZnII mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The purification of DnaJΔZnI and DnaJΔZnII mutant protein was performed according to the purification protocol for wild-type DnaJ (see “Experimental Procedures”). The behavior of the two mutant proteins and DnaJ wild type was indistinguishable on the chromatography columns, suggesting that the deletion of zinc center I or zinc center II did not dramatically alter the physical-chemical properties of DnaJ.To determine whether the zinc centers can form independently of each other, the zinc content of the two mutant proteins and wild-type DnaJ was analyzed using the PAR/PMPS titration assay (23Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 24Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this assay, the total amount of zinc, which is specifically coordinated via thiol groups in a protein, can be determined. The assay is based on the presence of the chelator PAR, which quickly associates with free zinc and forms a bright red Zn(PAR)2 complex, whose absorption can be determined at 500 nm. When the zinc binding constant of the thiol-containing zinc center exceeds that of the Zn(PAR)2 complex (Ka = 2 × 1012m–2 in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0); however, addition of PAR is not sufficient to extract zinc from proteins (23Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this case, thiol-modifying agents such as PMPS have to be used, which form stoichiometric thiol-mercaptide bonds and cause the release of zinc. We found that both mutant proteins coordinated close to one molecule of zinc per molecule of protein (0.8 + 0.1) via the four remaining cysteines of each zinc center (Table I). The strict requirement for PMPS to release the zinc from the remaining zinc center of the mutant proteins (1 μm) into a solution containing 100 μm PAR, indicated that the zinc binding constant Ka for the individual zinc centers must be still higher than that of PAR under these conditions. These results revealed that each of the two mutant proteins harbor one intact zinc center and suggested that DnaJ mutants, which lack zinc coordination in one zinc center, still retain sufficient protein structure to bind and coordinate zinc in the second zinc center. We, therefore, concluded that the formation of the two individual zinc centers in DnaJ can occur independently.To determine to what extent the lack of zinc center I or II causes conformational changes in the mutant proteins that might explain the inability of DnaJΔZnII to rescue the observed phenotypes, far and near UV-CD spectra were recorded. These spectra showed that neither the secondary structure (Fig. 3) nor the tertiary structure (Fig. 3, inset) of DnaJ was significantly disturbed by the lack of the individual zinc centers, suggesting that the individual zinc centers do not play a major role in the overall secondary or tertiary structure of DnaJ. This agreed well with the NMR structure of the isolated zinc binding domain, which showed that this domain forms an autonomous folding domain (21Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) also play key roles in muscle development, and in the maintenance and repair of mature muscle, but their mechanisms of interaction with other muscle regulatory networks remain undefined. To evaluate the potential interplay between MyoD and IGF signaling pathways, we have studied muscle differentiation in C3H 10T1/2 fibroblasts acutely converted to myoblasts by quantitative infection with a recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse MyoD. In these cells, IGF-II gene and protein expression are induced as early events in differentiation, and the IGF-I receptor and downstream signaling molecules, including Akt, are rapidly activated. Interference with IGF-II production by a tetracycline-inhibited adenovirus expressing an IGF-II cDNA in the antisense orientation reversibly inhibited both production of muscle-specific structural proteins and myocyte fusion to form multinucleated myotubes. Similar results were achieved with a tetracycline-inhibited adenovirus expressing dominant-negative Akt. Our observations identify a robust autocrine amplification network in which MyoD enhances the later steps in muscle differentiation by induction of a locally acting growth factor.

As established by gene knock-out studies in mice, MyoD and Myf-5 act redundantly at an early step in myoblast specification. Mice expressing either factor alone form muscle but do not if both proteins are absent (7Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N. Stead R.H. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). MyoD also is required for normal muscle regeneration in the adult (8Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Seale P.

Biol. 2002; 156: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In muscle and in other cell types the actions of both IGFs are mediated by the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), a ligand-stimulated membrane-spanning tyrosine protein kinase that activates several intracellular signaling pathways through a series of adaptor molecules (20Nakae J. Kido Y. Accili D. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 818-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). IGF action also is modified through high affinity interactions with a series of extracellular IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP-1 through -6 that limit access to the IGF-IR, but also enhance growth factor half-life (21Clemmons D.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In contrast to differences observed among bHLH proteins in vivo, tissue culture studies have demonstrated similar functions for these transcription factors. In culture, each protein has been found to direct a range of cell types toward the myoblast lineage, to promote cell cycle arrest, and to stimulate differentiation (1Lassar A. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), in part through cooperation with members of the MEF2 family of transcriptional factors, which act as accessory regulators of muscle gene expression and differentiation (2Naya F.S. Olson E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Here using C3H 10T1/2 fetal fibroblasts as a model, we identify another mechanism by which MyoD enhances its myogenic actions, through induction of IGF-II gene and protein expression early in differentiation. Secreted IGF-II in turn activates the IGF-IR and downstream signaling molecules, including Akt. As inhibition of IGF-II expression or impairment of Akt prevents production of muscle structural proteins and blocks formation of multinucleated myofibers, these results define an autocrine amplification pathway by which myogenic bHLH proteins stimulate the later events of muscle differentiation through production of a locally acting growth factor.

Cell Culture—C3H 10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (ATCC catalog number CCL226) were incubated on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes in growth media (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10% newborn calf serum) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2, until they reached 50% of confluent density for acute infection with recombinant adenoviruses. Differentiation was initiated 1 day later after cells reached ∼95% of confluent density after washing with phosphate-buffered saline by addition of differentiation medium (DM), consisting of DMEM plus 2% horse serum (22Tureckova J.

In some experiments DM consisted of DMEM plus 0.5% horse serum. Construction and Use of Recombinant Adenovirus—A FLAG epitope tag followed by a stop codon and XbaI site were added to the 3′ end of the coding region of mouse MyoD by polymerase chain reaction. The modified cDNA was sequenced, digested with SalI and XbaI restriction endonucleases, and ligated into the pShuttle:CMV vector. A dominant-negative Akt (AktDN) was prepared by modifying a human Akt-1 cDNA with a T7 epitope tag at its 3′ end (a gift from Dr. Richard Roth, Stanford University School of Medicine) by mutating codons for lysine 179, threonine 308, and serine 473 to alanines using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each mutation was verified by restriction enzyme mapping and by DNA sequencing. The AktDN cDNA was then subcloned via SalI and XbaI restriction endonuclease sites into a modified pShuttle plasmid containing a tetracycline-regulated promoter (22Tureckova J. Wilson E.M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11330-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). All recombinant adenoviruses were generated and isolated via a protocol supplied by Q-BIO Gene. The adenovirus encoding a tetracyline-inhibited transactivator (Ad-tTA) has been described (22Tureckova J. Wilson E.M. Cappalonga J.L. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39264-39270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-β-Gal) was a gift from Dr. J. Molkentin, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine. All viruses were purified on discontinuous cesium chloride gradients and titered by optical density. For infections, recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-tTA at a multiplicity of infection of 125, others at 250) were diluted in DMEM plus 2% fetal bovine serum, filtered through a Gelman syringe filter (0.45 μm), and added to cells at 37 °C for 120 min. After addition of an equal volume of DMEM with 20% each of fetal bovine serum and newborn calf serum, cells were incubated for a further 24 h and then were placed in DM. Under these conditions, ∼90% of cells were infected. Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein lysates were prepared after washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline and incubating on ice for 15 min in RIPA Buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% IGEPAL CA-630). Lysates were passed through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Protein samples (30 μg each) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies as described previously (22Tureckova J. Wilson E.M. Cappalonga J.L. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39264-39270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-MHC (1:500), anti-myogenin (1:500), anti-troponin T (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:2000), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (1:1000), anti-IGF-II (1:1000), anti-IGF-I receptor β subunit (1:500), anti-phospho-tyrosine (1:1000). IGF-II was detected by immunoblotting after extraction from conditioned DM using Sep-Pak Vac 1cc C18 columns (Waters Corp., Milford, MA), as described previously (24Florini J.R. Magri K.A. Ewton D.Z. James P.L. Grindstaff K. Rotwein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15917-15923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detection limit was 20 ng (∼3nm) of purified IGF-II. Akt enzymatic activity was assessed by immunoblotting using GSK-3β as substrate and anti-phospho-GSK-3β for detection after immunoprecipitation of 200 μg of cell lysates with anti-Akt conjugated to agarose beads, according to a protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technology). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit of the IGF-I receptor was evaluated by two methods, with comparable results. Cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the β subunit of the IGF-I receptor (1:150 dilution), followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine; alternatively, lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine (1:40 dilution), followed by immunoblotting with anti-IGF-I receptor β subunit. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 20 °C and permeabilized with a 50:50 mixture of methanol and acetone for 2 min before blocking in 0.25% normal goat serum for >1hat20 °C. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer were added for 16 h at 4 °C (anti-MHC, 1:250 dilution, anti-myogenin, 1:250 dilution). After a washing step, cells were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C in goat anti-mouse IgG2b-Alexa 594 (red) and goat anti-mouse IgG1-Alexa 488 (green), each diluted to 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Images were captured with a Roper Scientific Cool Snap FX CCD camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse T300 fluorescent microscope using IP Labs 3.5 software. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Whole cell RNA was isolated as described (23Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11330-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and its quality assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA (2.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl using a RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primers. Each PCR reaction contained 1.0 μl of cDNA. Primer sequences were as follows: for IGF-II, 5′-TCAAGCCGTGCCAACCGTCGC-3′ (sense strand), 5′-CTCCGAAGAGGCTCCCCCGTG-3′ (antisense); for IGF-I, 5′-CTCTTCAGTTCGTGTGTGGACC-3′(sense), 5′-CCACACTGACATGCCCAAGAC-3′ (antisense); for myogenin, 5′-ATGGAGCTGTATGAGACATCC-3′ (sense), 5′-GACGAAACCATGCCCAACTGA-3′ (antisense); for S17, 5′-ATCCCCAGCAAGAAGCTTCGGAACA-3′ (sense), 5′-TATGGCATAACAGATTAAACAGCTC-3′ (antisense). The linear range of product amplification was established in pilot studies for each primer pair, and the cycle number representing the approximate midpoint was used in final experiments. This varied from 20 to 25 cycles. Results were quantified by densitometry after electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels. Akt Activity Is Required for MyoD-mediated Myoblast Differentiation—Recently published studies have demonstrated that Akt activity and protein expression are stimulated during differentiation of established muscle cell lines (17Bodine S.C.

Here we show that Akt enzymatic activity also is induced as an early event in differentiation in fibroblasts converted to myoblasts after acute infection with a recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse MyoD (Ad-MyoD) and that active Akt is needed for the later events in differentiation that culminate in myotube formation. Illustrated in Fig. 1 are results of time course experiments using 10T1/2 fibroblasts infected 1 day earlier with Ad-MyoD at an m.o.i. in which ∼90% of cells express MyoD (data not shown) and subsequently incubated in DM. As seen in Fig. 1A, Ad-MyoD-infected 10T1/2 cells underwent rapid and extensive muscle differentiation, with progressive expression of myogenin and MHC, and formation of large multinucleated myotubes within 2 days. Similarly robust muscle-specific protein expression was observed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Myogenin and MHC were induced in Ad-MyoD-infected cells but were not detected in fibroblasts infected with an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-β-Gal). Also seen in Fig. 1B is evidence of activation of Akt beginning by 16 h after addition of DM, as indicated by a progressive increase in phosphorylation on serine 473. A similarly large induction of Akt enzymatic activity was observed, as shown in Fig. 1C. In Ad-MyoD infected cells, Akt kinase activity was stimulated by ∼20-fold by 1 day in DM, was increased by over 30-fold by 2 days, and was maintained at high levels for at least 3 days. Little Akt activity could be detected in fibroblasts acutely infected with Ad-β-Gal (data not shown). In contrast to these results, minimal activation of the MAP kinases, Erks 1 and 2 or p38, was seen in Ad-MyoD or Ad-β-Gal-infected cells during the same interval (data not shown). The significance of the rise in Akt kinase activity in MyoD-mediated muscle differentiation was tested by co-infecting 10T1/2 cells with recombinant adenoviruses expressing MyoD and a dominant-negative Akt under control of a tetracycline-regulated gene promoter (Ad-AktDN). In pilot studies, Ad-AktDN blocked IGF-induced Akt enzymatic activity (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2, A and B, inhibition of endogenous Akt blocked MHC and troponin-T expression and myotube formation but had no effect on production of myogenin. In contrast, when expression of AktDN was impeded by the tetracycline analog, doxycycline, differentiation proceeded normally. Thus, Akt activity is required for MyoD-stimulated muscle differentiation. IGF-II mRNA and Protein Expression Are Induced, and the IGF-I Receptor Is Activated during MyoD-mediated Muscle Differentiation—We next investigated mechanisms responsible for activation of Akt during MyoD-stimulated myoblast differentiation. We first examined components of the IGF system, as IGF signaling has been found to stimulate Akt and to enhance differentiation of established muscle cell lines and in vivo (22Tureckova J. Wilson E.M. Cappalonga J.L. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39264-39270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Rommel C. Bodine S.C. Clarke B.A. Rossman R. Nunez L. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1009-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, IGF-II gene expression, measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, was progressively induced in Ad-MyoD infected fibroblasts beginning by 8 h after incubation in DM. In contrast, little IGF-I mRNA could be detected over the same time frame, and transcripts for IGF-II and myogenin were not seen in fibroblasts infected with Ad-β-Gal and incubated in DM for the same time period. Transcripts for ribosomal protein S17 did not change in abundance. IGF-II protein expression also was induced in Ad-MyoD-infected fibroblasts. As assessed by immunoblotting of conditioned DM, IGF-II accumulation was observed in concentrated media from cells infected with Ad-MyoD after 1 day and showed a dramatic increase by 2 days (Fig. 3B). Little IGF-II could be seen by 12 h in DM (data not shown), and none was detected in concentrated conditioned media from fibroblasts infected with Ad-β-Gal. Thus, induction of IGF-II gene and protein expression are early events in MyoD-regulated myoblast differentiation. IGF-II activates intracellular signal transduction pathways by binding to the IGF-IR, a ligand-stimulated tyrosine protein kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation as an initial event in its activation (20Nakae J. Kido Y. Accili D. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 818-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). To assess phosphorylation of the IGF-IR in Ad-MyoD-infected 10T1/2 fibroblasts, lysates from cells incubated in DM were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the β subunit of the receptor, followed by immunoblotting with an antibody to phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 3C, progressively increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR was detected beginning at 1 day after incubation of cells in DM. By 2 days, the extent of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation exceeded that induced in 10T1/2 cells after incubation with IGF-I for 15 min. By contrast, little receptor phosphorylation was seen after 12 h in DM in Ad-MyoD-infected fibroblasts (data not shown) or in Ad-β-Gal-infected 10T1/2 cells after up to 2 days in DM (Fig. 3C). IGF-II Action Is Required for MyoD-stimulated Muscle Differentiation—Experiments were performed next to assess the functional significance of production of IGF-II and activation of the IGF-IR for MyoD-mediated myoblast differentiation. Fibroblasts were co-infected with Ad-MyoD and a recombinant adenovirus encoding an antisense cDNA for mouse IGF-II under control of a tetracycline-inhibited promoter (Ad-IGF-IIAS). As shown in Fig. 4A, Ad-IGF-IIAS caused a marked decline in induction of IGF-II mRNA after a 1 day incubation of cells in DM, which was reversed by doxycycline. Secretion of IGF-II also was blocked in cells expressing IGF-IIAS mRNA, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR was impaired, being seen only at the 2-day time point (Fig. 4, B and C). This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the partial inhibition of IGF-II mRNA by Ad-IGF-IIAS and by the greater sensitivity of the assay for IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation than the assay for IGF-II protein (with a detection limit of ∼3 nm of IGF-II). Both were restored to normal with doxycycline (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, Ad-IGF-IIAS impaired both IGF-II production and IGF-IR activation. Inhibition of IGF-II also diminished MyoD-mediated differentiation. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, Ad-IGF-IIAS reduced the rise in myogenin accumulation, blocked MHC expression, prevented myotube formation, and delayed Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, when expression of IGF-IIAS mRNA was blocked by doxycycline, Akt phosphorylation was restored and differentiation proceeded normally. Thus, early production of IGF-II and activation of the IGF-IR are required for MyoD-stimulated muscle differentiation. The central role of MyoD and related bHLH transcription factors in muscle cell specification and differentiation has been known for over a decade (3Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), and numerous studies have demonstrated that MyoD can readily convert a range of cell types to myoblasts (3Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). We now find that an endogenously initiated signaling pathway, involving induction of IGF-II gene and protein expression, and stimulation of the IGF-IR and Akt, are additional key components of MyoD-mediated myoblast differentiation. IGF-II production, and IGF-IR and Akt activation, are relatively early events in the actions of MyoD in this model system, occurring soon after induction of myogenin, and this signaling pathway appears necessary for differentiation to proceed, as either inhibition of IGF-II or blockade of Akt impaired expression of MHC and troponin-T and formation of multinucleated myofibers. Thus, at least in the context of this model, our results indicate that IGF-II functions to initiate an essential autocrine amplification cascade for MyoD-mediated differentiation. Our observations also identify an approach that will be useful in defining the critical signaling pathways that act downstream of Akt in muscle cells. The biochemical mechanisms by which MyoD induces IGF-II gene expression are unknown. Previous studies have established that IGF-II gene transcription is stimulated during differentiation of established muscle cell lines (29Kou K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar) but have not identified key DNA response elements or defined critical transcription factors. The mouse IGF-II gene is complicated. It contains three tandem promoters, each with unique 5′ noncoding exons (30Rotwein P. Hall L.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). IGF-II gene expression is also regulated by genomic imprinting, and the gene resides ∼70 kb 3′ to the H19 gene within a large imprinted locus on mouse chromosome 7 (31Issa J.P. Baylin S.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The two genes are reciprocally imprinted with IGF-II being expressed from the paternally derived chromosome and H19 from the maternal chromosome (31Issa J.P. Baylin S.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Investigation into the mechanisms of imprinting has led to identification of a key paternally methylated genomic region located just 5′ to H19 that functions as an insulator element and regulates reciprocal expression of the two genes (32Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 33Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that binding of the nuclear zinc finger protein CTCF to the unmethylated (maternal) chromosome at this site directs activity of an enhancer located 3′ to the H19 locus to the nearby H19 promoter, while lack of binding of CTCF to the methylated (paternal) chromosome directs enhancer function to the further 5′ IGF-II gene (32Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 33Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). It is now possible to determine whether this region or other nearby sites containing putative enhancer elements (34Ishihara K.

https://openalex.org/W2038838903,"α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) utilizes cAMP to trigger pigmentation of melanocytes via activation of melanocyte-restricted microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (M-MITF) expression. M-MITF is a melanocyte-restricted helix-loop-helix transcription factor capable of transactivating promoters for multiple genes whose products modulate pigmentation. Although M-MITF promoter activation by MSH is known to occur through a conserved cAMP-response element (CRE), it remains unclear how this CRE exhibits such exquisitely tissue-restricted responsiveness. Here we show that cAMP-mediated CRE-binding protein activation of the M-MITF promoter requires a second DNA element located ∼100 bp upstream, a site that is bound and activated by SOX10. Mutations in the SOX10 transcription factor, like MITF, results in a disorder known as Waardenburg Syndrome. The cAMP response of the M-MITF promoter was analyzed in melanoma and neuroblastoma cells (which are neural crest-derived but lack both M-MITF and SOX10 expression). M-MITF promoter responsiveness to cAMP was found to depend upon SOX10, and reciprocally, SOX10 transactivation was dependent upon the CRE. Ectopic SOX10 expression, in cooperation with cAMP signaling, activated the M-MITF promoter function and the expression of measurable endogenous M-MITF transcripts in neuroblastoma cells. SOX10dom, a mutant allele, failed to cooperate with cAMP in neuroblastoma cells and attenuated the cAMP responsiveness of the M-MITF promoter in melanoma cells. These observations demonstrate a means whereby the ubiquitous cAMP signaling machinery is harnessed to produce a highly tissue-restricted transcriptional response by cooperating with architectural factors, in this case SOX10. α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) utilizes cAMP to trigger pigmentation of melanocytes via activation of melanocyte-restricted microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (M-MITF) expression.

Development of the melanocyte lineage from the neural crest depends critically upon the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), 1The abbreviations used are: MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; M-MITF, melanocyte-restricted MITF; MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; MC1R, melanocortin-1 receptor; CRE, cAMP-response element; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcriptase; CREB, CRE-binding protein. a helix-loop-helix-containing protein that resides in multiple signaling pathways important to this cell lineage. People with heterozygous MITF mutations exhibit pigmentation defects and deafness due to a reduced number of melanocytes in the skin, hair follicles, and inner ear, a condition known as Waardenburg Syndrome type 2A (see Ref. 1Price E.R. Fisher D.E. Neuron. 2001; 30: 15-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar for a review). Other mammalian species, including mice, have been shown to harbor MITF mutations. In its homozygous state, the MITF mutations are associated with the complete absence of the melanocyte lineage (2Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 3Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). With the recognition that MITF binds to DNA sequences fitting the canonical E-box element CA(C/T)GTG came the observation from several groups that MITF probably modulates expression of several major pigment enzyme genes whose promoters contain conserved copies of this element (4Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8058-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The prospect that MITF may play a central role in modulating pigment enzyme gene expression directly led to the observation that MITF also resides within the major mammalian pigmentation signaling pathway stimulated by the 12-amino acid peptide α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) (7Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Price E.R. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Weilbaecher K.N. Takemoto C.M. Landis M.W. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33042-33047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this signaling pathway, MSH binds and activates its receptor in melanocytes, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), resulting in a cAMP-mediated phosphorylation/activation of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. The MITF gene contains multiple promoter-exon 1 start sites that are alternatively spliced onto a common body comprising most of the coding region. One of these promoter-exon 1 units encodes an MITF isoform whose expression is melanocyte-restricted (M-MITF) and contains a consensus cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (9Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) responding to MSH signaling (7Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K.

MSH signaling thus up-regulates the melanocyte-restricted promoter of MITF via a cAMP-mediated signal cascade. The melanocyte-specific MITF promoter has been shown to be regulated by a number of important factors for neural crest development and melanocyte lineage specification. Wnt signals have been shown to drive melanocyte differentiation in neural crest progenitors via modulation of TCF/LEF target sequences within the orthologous MITF promoter, nacre, in a zebrafish model system (10Dorsky R.I. Moon R.T. Raible D.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 11Dorsky R.I. Raible D.W. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 158-162PubMed Google Scholar, 12Takeda K.

In addition, the transcription factors PAX3 (13Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and SOX10 (14Bondurand N.

Importantly, mutations in PAX3 or SOX10 are also associated with Waardenburg syndrome, eliciting very similar melanocytic defects as MITF mutations, in addition to other non-melanocyte-derived defects that discriminate their clinical syndromes as Waardenburg syndrome type 1, 3, or 4 (depending both on which gene is mutated and the precise mutations) (1Price E.R. Fisher D.E. Neuron. 2001; 30: 15-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). MITF has also been shown to be post-translationally modified by the action of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 in response to stimulation of the c-KIT signaling pathway (18Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), an event that is accompanied by recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator p300 to MITF (19Price E.R. Ding H.F.

Collectively, these observations place MITF at the crossroads of both vital developmental pathways and clinically important syndromes involving the melanocyte lineage. However, one mechanistically critical question that has not been answered relates to the exquisite tissue restriction of M-MITF expression and M-MITF promoter activity. Whereas certain of the factors regulating M-MITF expression are themselves quite highly restricted in their expression patterns (such as PAX3 and SOX10), others, such as the cAMP-activated transcription factors CREB/ATF, are highly ubiquitous, presenting a problem in understanding how MSH and its cAMP second messenger can up-regulate M-MITF expression in a melanocyte-restricted fashion. Concisely stated, how does the highly ubiquitous cAMP-triggered machinery exhibit restricted transcriptional activity confined to a particular cell lineage? To address this question, we have examined M-MITF transcriptional regulation in melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lineages, specifically utilizing neuroblastoma cells, which are also neural crest in origin but have diverged from melanocytes. The tissue-restricted regulation is seen to arise through a cooperation between CREB/ATF and SOX10. Construction of pGL2-MITF Series—MITF promoter sequences for the wild-type, truncation series and somatostatin promoter sequences were created by PCR using PfuTurbo (Stratagene). Flanking sequences of the MITF promoter with a 5′ KpnI and a 3′ XhoI restriction site added were used to PCR out the MITF promoter series. PCR products were digested and placed into pGL2.basic-luciferase (Promega). Construction of pGL2.MITF:Soma—The pGL2.MITF:Soma promoter fusion was made by overlap extension PCR using PfuTurbo (Stratagene). The 5′-flanking portion of the MITF promoter was generated with a 5′ KpnI sequence and a 3′ primer containing the MITF CRE and part of the somatostatin promoter. Upstream primers were RP1 (5′-GGGGGGTACCCTGCAGTCGGAAGTGGCAGTTATTCG-3′) and RP9 (5′-CTGTTTTAAACTCTCTCTCTGACGTCATGCTTTTTTTC-3′). Next, a 3′ portion of the somatostatin promoter was generated from the CRE to the TATA box with a 3′ EcoRI sequence: RP10, 5′-GAGAGAGAGTTTAAAACAGAGGG-3′; RP11, 5′-CCGAATTCATGCTCGAGAGCCGAGCTGGAGAGTGGCTGGTC-3′. The two PCR products were combined with the 5′ MITF-KpnI primer and 3′ Soma-EcoRI to create the MITF: somatostatin chimeric promoter. This PCR product was digested and placed into pGL2.basic-luciferase (Promega). Construction of pGL2.MITF(ΔCRE)—The pGL2.MITF(ΔCRE) was made by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (8Price E.R. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Weilbaecher K.N. Takemoto C.M. Landis M.W. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33042-33047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The pGL2.MITF(ΔSOX10) was made by a site-directed mutagenesis PCR protocol using the QuikChange™ method (Stratagene). The wild-type MITF promoter SOX10 site (–268/–262) was changed from CATTGTC to the mutant pGL2.MITF(ΔSOX10) promoter sequence using the following oligonucleotides: sense strand (5′-AAAGAGAAATACCAGGGTCTATTAATACTA) and antisense (5′-TAGTATTAATAGACCCTGGTATTTCTCTTT), where the mutated nucleotides are underlined. The pCMV5.SOX10 plasmid has been previously described (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of pcDNA3.1-HAHA—Vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) was digested first by HindIII/BamHI and ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides FWDHA1 (AGCTTATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCG) and REVHA1 (GATCCGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTACATA), carrying 5′-phosphate. Second, the resulting vector was digested with HindIII and once again ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides FWDHA2 (AGCTTCCACCATGGCCTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTCAGCTCC) and REVHA2 (AGCTGGAGCTGAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGGCCATGGTGG), yielding the vector pcDNA3.1-HAHA, which has two consecutive HA tags following an optimal Kozak initiation sequence. Construction of pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10 and Mutant—The pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10 construct was made by RT-PCR using human melanocyte total RNA and primers flanking the sequence of the SOX10 coding region with a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ XbaI restriction site included. PCR products were digested and placed into a pcDNA3.1-HAHA vector. pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10dom was generated by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis using complementary oligonucleotides with the following sense strand sequence: 5′-GAGTGCCCCGGTGGGGGAGGCCGAGCAAGG (underlined is the mutation inserted G). All sequences were verified by the ABI automated sequencing system. B16 cells were maintained on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamate (Invitrogen). SK-N-SH cells were maintained on minimal Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin/glutamate. Primary human melanocytes were maintained on TICVA medium (Ham's F-10 (Cellgro) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), 50 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (Sigma), 1 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dbcAMP (Sigma), and penicillin/streptomycin/glutamate). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All cells for Western blot analysis were grown to 75–90% confluence. For CREB activation, 1 μm α-MSH (Sigma) or 20 μm forskolin (Sigma) in Me2SO (Sigma) or an equal volume of Me2SO was added to cells for 30 min prior to analysis of phospho-CREB or 4 h prior to analysis of MITF. Cells were lysed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 15 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Protein samples were prepared with SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) and boiled prior to loading on 10% polyacrylamide (National Diagnostics)/SDS gel. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose using a Tris/glycine/methanol semidry transfer system (Owl). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in either 0.25 or 5% milk in TBST at the following concentrations: anti-phospho-CREB, 1:1,000 mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling); anti-CREB, 1:500 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling); anti-SOX10, 1:2,000 rabbit polyclonal antibody (CeMines); anti-α-tubulin, 1:10,000 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma); or anti-Mitf (C5), 1:20 mouse monoclonal antibody (previously described in Ref. 8Price E.R.

Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cappel/ICN)) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 0.25% milk in TBST. Bands were visualized using the Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). For reporter assays, cells were plated in a 96-well black and white tissue culture plate (Wallac) to a density of 5 × 103 cells/well for B16 and 1 × 104 cells/well for SK-N-SH. The following day, cells were transfected with 40 ng of promoter, 20 ng of pRL.null (Promega), and effector DNA (0.5–10 ng of pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10dom for Fig. 4; 0.8, 2, or 4 ng of pCMV5-SOX10 for Fig. 5; or 0.8, 2, or 4 ng of pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10/pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10dom for Figs. 4 and 6) or vector control DNA using FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were allowed to incubate with the transfection mixture for 20 h. At this time, 20 μm forskolin (or 1 μm α-MSH) or an equal volume of Me2SO was added to the transfected cells. The cells were then incubated for an additional 6 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 20 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). The assay samples were then analyzed on a 96-well plate luminometer (EG&G Berthold) using the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Luciferase signals were normalized to corresponding Renilla signals. Results are expressed as -fold activation over unstimulated vector control transfection for each individual promoter set and are plotted as the means ± S.E. from at least three independent data points.Fig. 5Exogenous SOX10 restores cAMP responsiveness of the M-MITF promoter in neuroblastoma cells.

The cells were then transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10, or pcDNA3.1-HAHA-SOX10dom using FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were allowed to incubate with the transfection mixture for 24 h, after which cells were stimulated with 20 μm forskolin for an additional 4 h. mRNA was prepared using the Poly(A) Pure kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A reverse transcription reaction was performed. Approximately 1 μg of mRNA was added to the mixture of 3′ template primers with dNTPs and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. The reaction was transferred directly to ice, and an appropriate amount of RT buffer was added. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 42 °C for 2 min. At this time, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was added, and the reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. The RT was then heat-inactivated at 75 °C for 15 min. Final conditions were as follows: 100 nm primer, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 1× RT buffer (New England Biolabs), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) in 20 μl. The cDNA was then used for a subsequent PCR. The conditions were as follows: 2 μl of cDNA from the above reaction with 2 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher), 1× Taq buffer (Fisher), 200 μm dNTPs, and 250 nm 5′ and 3′ primers in a 25-μl reaction. The PCR was run for 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose (Invitrogen) gel with 500 ng/ml ethidium bromide (Bio-Rad). Primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: M-MITF primer, 5′-CCTTCTCTTTGCCAGTCCATCTTC; human MITF common primer, 3′-GATCAATCAAGTTTCCCGAGACAG; and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT and 3′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. CREB-mediated Transcriptional Activation of the MITF Gene Is Melanocyte-restricted—MSH has been shown to regulate M-MITF promoter activity in melanocytes via the CRE at positions –147/–139 (Fig. 1A) (7Bertolotto C.

Nuclear extracts from B16 melanoma cells have been shown to bind the M-MITF promoter CRE with sequence specificity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (7Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This binding activity is stoichiometrically supershifted with an anti-CREB antibody belonging to a subgroup of cAMP-responsive element-binding proteins that include both CREB and ATF1 (7Bertolotto C.

Since M-MITF expression is melanocyte-restricted, whereas cAMP-dependent activation of CREB is not, we first verified that M-MITF expression was indeed tissue-restricted by examining M-MITF in melanoma cells or developmentally related neuroblastoma cells. The experiments were conducted by up-regulating cellular cAMP levels by using either MSH or the pharmacological agent, forskolin. As shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of MSH to melanoma cells produces phosphorylation of CREB followed by induction of M-MITF expression levels (Fig. 1C). MITF protein migrates as a doublet resulting from phosphorylation at serine 73 by MAPK (18Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Treatment with the drug forskolin, a potent activator of adenylate cyclase, also results in CREB phosphorylation and downstream M-MITF up-regulation in melanoma cells (Fig. 1, B and C; see also Refs. 7Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar and 8Price E.R. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G.

Stimulation of neuroblastoma cells with MSH is not expected to activate CREB, since MC1R (the MSH receptor) is absent in most nonmelanocytic cells (Fig. 1B). The MSH pathway can be mimicked by forskolin to increase the cAMP levels. This leads to phosphorylation of CREB in neuroblastoma cells. However, levels of M-MITF protein (Fig. 1, B and C) or RNA (as measured by RT-PCR as seen below) was not detectable after CREB activation in these cells. Consistent with earlier data (7Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Price E.R. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Weilbaecher K.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33042-33047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) lack of M-MITF responsiveness to forskolin treatment in neuroblastoma cells is probably due to a difference in transactivation capacity of the M-MITF promoter by CREB and not the ability to activate CREB in response to cAMP. To test whether the tissue-restricted M-MITF induction may be due to differential promoter responsiveness in the two cell types, reporter assays were carried out using 387 bp of the proximal human M-MITF promoter (Fig. 2A). In melanoma cells, the addition of MSH up-regulates the M-MITF promoter in a CRE-dependent fashion, and also up-regulates the somatostatin promoter (a control cAMP-responsive promoter whose CRE contains the identical consensus sequence as the CRE in the M-MITF promoter) (Fig. 2B). Like MSH, forskolin also stimulated the wild-type M-MITF and somatostatin promoters in melanoma cells but not the CRE mutated M-MITF promoter (Fig. 2C). However, forskolin did not alter the activity of the wild-type or CRE-mutated M-MITF reporters in neuroblastoma cells, although it potently stimulated the control (somatostatin) CRE-containing reporter (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that tissue restriction of cAMP-induced M-MITF expression may mechanistically reside at the level of promoter transactivation by activated CREB (P-CREB). An Upstream Second DNA Element Is Required for M-MITF cAMP Responsiveness—At least two nonexclusive mechanisms could account for tissue-restricted P-CREB responsiveness of the M-MITF promoter. One possibility is that transcriptional repression (via many potential means) could prevent CREB from activating this promoter in nonmelanocytes. A second possibility is that additional positively acting factor(s) may be required to synergize with CREB, and the expression of these cooperating factor(s) may be tissue-restricted in an overlapping manner that converges in the melanocyte lineage. A simple test of the latter possibility comes from truncation of the M-MITF promoter without removing the CRE site (Fig. 3A). If the loss of non-CRE sequences affects CREB responsiveness within melanocyte lineage cells, then additional cooperating factor(s) probably contribute significantly to the CREB response. As shown in Fig. 3A, truncation of the promoter upstream of the CRE, without affecting the CRE site itself, completely abolished forskolin responsiveness of the M-MITF reporter. Stepwise deletions suggested that the critical cooperative element could reside at a previously described SOX10 consensus element located at –268/–262 (14Bondurand N. Pingault V. Goerich D.E.

We examined the consequences of selectively mutating the SOX10 element at –268/–262 and found that this significantly (but incompletely) curtailed cAMP responsiveness (Fig. 3B). This observation is consistent with the possibility that CREB responsiveness of the M-MITF promoter requires a second transcription factor that binds at or near the SOX10 element at –268/–262. SOX10dom Inhibits Activation of the M-MITF Promoter—To examine the specificity of SOX10 in the cAMP responsiveness of the M-MITF reporter, we utilized a naturally occurring SOX10 mutant called Sox10dom.

The biological roles of N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins are thought to play a role in the interaction of terminal glycan structures and their receptors. The diversity and avidity of the terminal structures are, however, regulated by the core structure of N-glycans (1Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).

(GnT-I through GnT-VI) are involved in the biosynthesis of the highly branched complex-type N-glycan core structure (1Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A β1,6GnT, GnT-V, catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the core α1,6-mannose arm via a β1,6-linkage, forming the tri- and tetraantennary complex-type N-glycans (1Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The β1,6-branched tri- and tetraantennary glycans are preferentially elongated via the action of β1,3GnT and β1,4-galactosyltransferase to produce a poly-N-acetyllactosamine structure (2van den Eijnden D.H.

In addition, the N-glycans in GnT V-deficient cells are severely depleted of poly-N-acetyllactosamine but not O-glycans (4Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains are known to serve as ligands for cell adhesion molecules such as selectins and galectins (6Sharon N. Lis H. Science. 1989; 246: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 7Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6983-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Knibbs R.N. Agrwal N.

It has been suggested that changes in poly-N-acetyllactosamine content on sympathetic nerve cells affect their migration (9Margolis R.K. Greene L.A. Margolis R.U.

Furthermore, N-acetyllactosamine promotes the neural outgrowth of primary olfactory neurons (11Puche A.C. Key B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 364: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These collective findings suggest that GnT-V activity in the brain may play an important role in the process of nerve differentiation via the interaction of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains and their receptors. However, the GnT-V gene (Mgat5)-knockout mice that apparently lack both detectable GnT-V activity and Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin reactivity in the brain, appear to be neurologically normal (12Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Since a detailed analysis of the carbohydrate chains of these glycoproteins has not been examined, the issue of whether poly-N-acetyllactosamine structure is, in fact, altered in Mgat5 –/– brain remains to be elucidated. When the GnT-V gene was cloned, no homologous genes were evident, suggesting that GnT-V has a unique evolutionary origin (13Shoreibah M. Perng G.S. Adler B. Weinstein J. Basu R. Cupples R. Wen D.

The GnT-V ortholog gene (gly-2) was recently identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, and there is no homologous gene in this organism (15Warren C.E. Krizus A. Roy P.J. Culotti J.G. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22829-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the recent, rapid accumulation of EST and genomic data enabled us to identify a novel human β1,6GnT gene homologous to GnT-V. This new GnT catalyzes the synthesis of a unique N-linked oligosaccharide structure and was designated as GnT-IX, since two additional GnT activities (GnT-VII and -VIII) were demonstrated in CHO mutant cells, although their genes have not been identified (16Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14090-14098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GnT-IX gene is exclusively expressed in the brain. Thus, GnT-IX may play an essential role in the synthesis of such novel oligosaccharide structures in the brain. In addition, GnT-IX may compensate for the deficiency in Mgat5 –/– brain (12Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat.

Commun. 1994; 198: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as a query for a BLAST search at the DNA Data Bank of Japan homology search system, we found a fragment sequence, human hypothetical protein T50606, that exhibited a significant similarity to GnT-V. Using the amino acid sequence of T50606 for an EST data base search, seven clones (AL524151, BF569340, BE785253, BE789945, R87580, BF033743, and R87617) were identified that contained partial sequences corresponding to T50606. One μg of human brain total RNA (OriGene Technologies) was reverse-transcribed and then amplified by PCR with a pair of primers designed from the consensus sequence of the seven EST clones: S1 (5′-AGGGACCAGAAGCAGAT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 841–857 in Fig. 1) and AS1 (5′-GAACCTGCTGGTGCTTT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 2435–2451). The PCR product was subcloned into pT7Blue vector (Novagen) and then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems model 377 and 310). The 5′-end of the GnT-IX was determined by the combination of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a 5′-RACE system kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 μg of human brain total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the GnT-IX gene-specific antisense primer GSP1 (5′-TACTCTGCAGCTCCTT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1012–1027), and the first strand cDNA was tailed at the 3′-end by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase with dCTP followed by PCR with 5′-RACE abridged anchor primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′) and GSP1. The PCR product was size-selected (approximately 0.5–1 kb) and then subjected to nested PCR with abridged universal amplification primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) and GSP2 (5′-CCAGGACATAGAGTGCAGTC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 963–982). The sequence of the PCR product was used as a query for a further EST data base search. After aligning the sequences of the EST clones (BE276066, BE391943, BE730360, and BG478724) containing the putative start codon, the open reading frame was amplified by PCR with a pair of primers: 5′-CTGCTCGCACCAACAAGT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides –25 to –8 and AS1. The PCR product was subcloned and sequenced as described above. Construction of a Vector Encoding His6-tagged Human GnT-IX—To prepare a C-terminal His6-tagged GnT-IX construct, the full-length cDNA and a Myc-His6 tag sequence were ligated to pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) with KpnI/EcoRV sites. To prepare a soluble N-terminal His6-tagged version of the construct, GnT-IX cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GCCGAATTCACCATCCGCACAG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCTAGATCACAGACAGCCCTGGC-3′ and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo with Igκ signal and His6 tag sequences. Expression of Human GnT-IX in Neuro-2a Cells—Neuro-2a cells were transfected with the linearized plasmid using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the standard protocol used for stable transfection and selected for clones that stably express the gene, based on resistance to Zeocin (Invitrogen) followed by detection of the expression of the His6-tagged protein by Western blot analysis with an anti-His tag antibody (Tetra His Antibody; Qiagen). The cloned cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. The cells expressing full-length GnT-IX were washed and pelleted, and the microsomal fraction was prepared as described previously (19Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Tsuda T. Ihara H. Korekane H. Shiota K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 759-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the expression of the soluble form of GnT-IX, the cells were cultured for 3 days in the same medium with 1% serum and antibiotics without Zeocin. The soluble His6-tagged enzyme was partially purified by passing it through a chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column according to the manufacturer's instruction. For expression of GnT-V as a positive control for the transferase assay, COS-1 cells were transfected with the pSVK3-hGnT-V vector as described previously (19Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Tsuda T. Ihara H. Korekane H. Shiota K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 759-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction of the transfected cells was prepared, as described above. Capture and Immunoprecipitation of His6-tagged Enzyme—For the capture of the tagged enzyme, the solubilized microsomal fraction was incubated with Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen) in 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, and the beads were then washed four times with 20 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-His tag antibody. Briefly, the solubilized microsomal fraction was incubated with 5–10 μg/ml of the antibody for 1 h and then with Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The immune complex was washed four times with 0.5% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting enzyme captured by Ni-NTA beads or immunoprecipitated was subjected to Western blot analysis and a GnT assay. Western Blot Analysis—The captured His6-tagged proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% Laemmli's gel) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was probed with an anti-His tag antibody and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG. The reactive proteins were visualized by means of an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). GnT Assay—GnT activity was assayed using pyridylaminated acceptor substrates under conditions described previously (20Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with 20 μm pyridylaminated acceptor substrate (GnGn-bi-PA or Gn3-tri′-PA) and 40 mm UDP-GlcNAc in 125 mm MES (pH 6.25) or MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm GlcNAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 3 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was injected to a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 250 mm; TOSOH) equipped with a Shimadzu LC-VP HPLC system. Product was eluted with 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) with or without 0.05% n-butyl alcohol at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 320 nm; emission, 400 nm). MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—MALDI-TOF MS was performed with a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager RP-DE instrument. The mass spectra were acquired in the reflectron mode under a 20-kV accelerating voltage with positive detection. 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) was used as the matrix. NMR Analysis—For preparation of the NMR sample, a large scale reaction was carried out with 500 μm GnGn-bi-PA as a substrate in the presence of 0.5 m glycine. After a 3-day incubation at 37 °C, the reaction product was isolated using a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (7.8 × 300 mm; TOSOH) as described above. The separated sugar chains were lyophilized, dissolved in 99.9% D2O, and then lyophilized from D2O twice and dissolved in this solvent. Proton NMR measurements were carried out with a Varian Unity-400 spectrometer at 400 MHz at 30 °C. Chemical shifts are expressed as ppm relative to an external standard of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d 4. Northern Blot and Dot Blot Analyses—Human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern blot and human multiple tissue expression array (Clontech) were used for hybridization according to the manufacturer's protocol. Probes were prepared from the cDNA fragments from a PvuII digest (corresponding to nucleotides 1564–2286) of pSVK3-hGnT-IX, pSVK3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) containing human GnT-IX cDNA, and an EcoRV digest (corresponding to nucleotides 406–1306) of pSVK3-hGnT-V and then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). By performing a BLAST search with the amino acid sequence of human GnT-V as a query, we were able to find a human hypothetical protein that has a significant similarity to the catalytic domain of GnT-V (14Saito H. Nishikawa A. Gu J. Ihara Y. Soejima H. Wada Y. Sekiya C. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but lacking most of the deduced N-terminal region. Using the amino acid sequence of the hypothetical protein in an EST data base search, we found seven clones containing partial sequences corresponding to the hypothetical protein. From the consensus sequence of the seven EST clones, we designed oligonucleotide primers for reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from various human tissues. Since the PCR products were strongly detected in the brain and the clone of the hypothetical protein was derived from adult brain, we used total RNA from human brain for the subsequent cDNA cloning. The 5′-end of the cDNA was determined by a combination of RACE and a further data base search. The resulting full-length cDNA (termed GnT-IX) and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1A. The deduced protein is a type II membrane protein composed of 792 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 89,531 Da and has eight potential N-glycosylation sites. It appears to consist of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain, and the entire sequence identity to human GnT-V is 42%. Comparing the amino acid sequences of human GnT-V and GnT-IX with C. elegans ortholog gly-2 (15Warren C.E. Krizus A. Roy P.J. Culotti J.G. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22829-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using BLAST 2 sequences (21Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sequences of human GnT-V and GnT-IX exhibit 36 and 32% identities, respectively, to the GLY-2 sequence. The human GnT-V gene (Mgat5) is mapped to chromosome 2q21 (14Saito H. Nishikawa A. Gu J. Ihara Y. Soejima H. Wada Y. Sekiya C. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the GnT-IX gene is mapped to 17q25. Initially, we attempted to detect GnT activity using a whole cell lysate or a microsomal membrane fraction prepared from GnT-IX-transfected cells. Although we tested several cell lines, endogenous GnT-V activity was detected, and no other GnT activity was found under the conditions used in the tests. To concentrate the recombinant enzyme and to eliminate endogenous GnT-V activity, full-length human GnT-IX containing a His6 tag was expressed in Neuro-2a cells, captured by Ni-NTA beads, or immunoprecipitated with an anti-His tag antibody and Protein G beads, and the beads were then directly used for a subsequent GnT assay. Western blot analysis of the captured enzyme showed a 110-kDa band and a smear band at a higher molecular weight (Fig. 2). The captured tagged protein was directly subjected to GnT assay under conditions typical for GnT-V activity with GnGn-bi-PA as an acceptor substrate. When the reaction mixture was subjected to HPLC, the major product (designated as P1) of GnT-IX was eluted (peak 1 in Fig. 3A) with the same retention time as the GnT-V control (Fig. 3C). In addition, two more peaks (peaks 2 and 3) (designated as P2 and P3) that have never been seen in parental cells and GnT-V control cells were observed. These peaks were collected and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Fig. 4). The spectrum of P1 showed an m/z value for (M + Na)+ of 1621.7 (Fig. 4B), corresponding to that of Gn3-tri′-PA (refer to Fig. 6 for structure), 1621.3 (Fig. 4A). This result and the retention time on HPLC suggest that the structure of P1 could be same as the product of GnT-V. The spectrum of P3 (Fig. 4D) also showed nearly the same m/z value (1620.6) as Gn3-tri′-PA. On the other hand, the m/z value of P2 was 1824.0 (Fig. 4C), indicating that two GlcNAc residues had been transferred to the acceptor substrate. Furthermore, when Gn3-tri′-PA was used as a substrate, a product peak (peak 4 in Fig. 3D) appeared with the same retention time as peak 2 in Fig. 3A. Thus, GnT-IX transfers GlcNAc not only to the core α1,6-mannose arm via a β1,6-linkage, typical of GnT-V activity, but also to another position and/or via a distinct linkage.Fig. 3Elution profile of the reaction mixture on HPLC. A reaction mixture, using GnGn-bi-PA (A–C) or Gn3-tri′-PA (D–F) as a substrate (S or S′) and captured proteins from Neuro-2a/GnT-IX (A and D) or from parental Neuro-2a cells (B and E) by Ni-NTA beads, or a microsomal fraction of COS-1 cells transfected with pSVK3-GnT-V (C and F) as an enzyme source was applied to a TSKgel ODS-80TM column and eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The arrows indicate the positions of the eluted products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the reaction products.

GnT-IX catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc to the both mannose arms in the core of the acceptor substrate GnGn-bi-PA via β1,6-linkage, whereas GnT-V catalyzes transfer only to α1,6-mannose. The structures of the acceptor substrate and the enzymatic products are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using recombinant soluble GnT-IX, the pH optimum of the GnT activity of GnT-IX was examined in a reaction mixture composed of 200 mm each buffer, 40 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 200 mm GlcNAc, 10 mm EDTA, 20 μm GnGn-bi-PA. The optimal pH was found to be between 7.5 and 8.5 in MOPS or HEPES buffer, whereas that of GnT-V was around pH 6.5 (data not shown). The effects of divalent cations on GnT activity were also examined in the same reaction mixture with 10 mm each of metal chlorides or EDTA. Metal ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ had no effect on the reaction. GnT activity is strongly inhibited by Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. EDTA had no effect on the activity as for GnT-V and other β1,6GnTs. The activity of GnT-IX was enhanced by the presence of glycine. In the presence of 0.5 m glycine at pH 7.5, the yield of enzymatic products were increased about 30% after a 2-h incubation (data not shown). Therefore, we carried out a large scale reaction under this condition to prepare samples for NMR analyses. After a 3-day incubation, most of the substrate was converted to the enzymatic products: 45, 39, and 7% of biantennary substrate was converted to P1, P2, and P3, respectively. Therefore, P1 and P2 were collected and subjected to NMR analyses. NMR analyses were carried out to confirm of the structures of the enzymatic products P1 and P2. Proton NMR spectra of the substrate and the two products are shown in Fig. 5. The chemical shift values of their anomeric proton signals and methyl proton signals are summarized in Table I. The values for P1 were identical with those of Gn3-tri′-PA (22Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 14: 313-318Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the spectrum of the P2, a methyl proton signal of an additional GlcNAc appeared at 2.044 ppm. This chemical shift value suggests that the GlcNAc binds to the -CH2OH group at the 6-position. The anomeric proton signal of Man 4 (assigned at the Gn4-tetra′-PA structure in Fig. 6) was observed at 5.086 ppm and showed a shift to higher field by 0.50 ppm relative to that of Gn3-tri′-PA (spectra B and C in Fig. 5). When GlcNAc was attached to -CH2OH at the 6-position of Man 4′, the anomeric proton signal of Man 4′ shifted to higher field by 0.49 ppm (spectra A and B in Fig. 5). These results indicate that the additional GlcNAc of the P2 is linked to -CH2OH at the 6-position of Man 4 of the Gn3-tri′-PA (P1). The anomeric proton of the additional GlcNAc (GlcNAc 7″) gave a doublet signal with a coupling constant of 8.0 Hz at 4.561 ppm. This coupling constant value shows that the linkage of the GlcNAc is a β-form.Table IThe chemical shifts of anomeric proton signals and methyl proton signals of the substrate GnGn-bi-PA and two enzymatic products P1 and P2Anomeric proton signalsMan 4Man 4′GlcNAc 5GlcNAc 5′GlcNAc 7′GlcNAc 7″GnGn-bi-PA5.1274.9264.5664.566P15.1364.8754.5714.5734.549P25.0864.8794.5784.5754.5524.561Methyl proton signalsGlcNAc 1GlcNAc 2GlcNAc 5GlcNAc 5′GlcNAc 7′GlcNAc 7″GnGn-bi-PA1.9512.0802.0652.059P11.9532.0802.0702.0612.052P21.9412.0772.0632.0572.0552.044 Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis showed that the GnT-IX transcript of ∼5 kb is exclusively expressed in the brain, whereas the GnT-V transcript of ∼9 kb is expressed in various tissues (Fig. 7). Dot blot analysis also showed that GnT-IX is specifically expressed in all areas of the adult brain as well as the fetal brain (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Dot blot analysis of human GnT-IX and GnT-V transcripts.

C, tissues of loaded poly(A)+ RNA are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus far, no homologous gene of GnT-V in the genome in any mammalian species has been reported. Recently, a functional GnT-V ortholog was found in C. elegans, and the gene was the sole GnT-V homolog present in its genome (15Warren C.E. Krizus A. Roy P.J. Culotti J.G. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22829-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel homologous gene of human GnT-V, designated as GnT-IX, which possesses novel β1,6GnT activity. The domain architecture and the positions of the cysteine residues of mammalian and nematode GnT-Vs are well conserved in GnT-IX. In addition, Leu189 in the stem region of human GnT-V, corresponding to the position at a L188R point mutation in Lec4A Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells (23Weinstein J. Sundaram S. Wang X. Delgado D. Basu R. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is also conserved in GnT-IX (Leu201). It has previously been reported that the leucine residue is responsible for the Golgi localization of hamster and nematode GnT-Vs (15Warren C.E. Krizus A. Roy P.J. Culotti J.G. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22829-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Weinstein J. Sundaram S. Wang X. Delgado D. Basu R. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, GnT-IX is structurally related to GnT-V and may also be localized in the Golgi apparatus. Compared with GnT-V, GnT-IX has an extra 33 amino acid residues inserted in the C-terminal catalytic domain (Fig. 1B). Since two potential N-glycosylation sites exist in this short sequence, it may be exposed to the molecular surface. Whether this sequence is involved in the difference of substrate specificity between GnT-IX and GnT-V remains to be investigated. Recombinant human GnT-IX actually exhibited GnT-V activity, catalyzing the transfer of GlcNAc to the 6-OH position of the α1,6-linked mannose arm of GnGn-bi-PA and forming Gn3-tri′-PA (Fig. 6). This activity of GnT-IX was considerably lower than that of GnT-V when a similar amount of expression was observed as judged by reactivity to an anti-His tag antibody (data not shown). Interestingly, GnT-IX also acted on the α1,3-linked mannose arm in the acceptor substrate. Therefore, GnT-IX is able to catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc to the 6-OH position of mannose in the sequence GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα1, which is present in both α-linked mannose arms of the N-glycan, indicating that GnT-IX is different and distinct from GnT-V. GnT-IX preferentially transferred GlcNAc to the α1,6-linked mannose arm rather than the α1,3-linked mannose arm (peaks 1 and 3 in Fig. 3A), suggesting that the 6-OH position of α1,6-linked mannose is more accessible to GnT-IX than that of the α1,3-linked mannose. The expression of the GnT-IX gene was found to be exclusively in the brain, whereas the GnT-V gene is ubiquitously expressed. Similar results were also observed in fetal tissues, suggesting that GnT-IX may play important roles in fetal and adult brains. In addition, although Mgat5 –/– mice lacked most detectable GnT-V enzyme activity and P. vulgaris leukoagglutinin reactivity, brain development and function in these mice appeared to be normal (12Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Since the poly-N-acetyllactosamine extension is dependent on β1,6-branch formation by GnT-V, β1,6-branch formation is thought to be important in the process of nerve differentiation via the interaction of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains and their receptors (4Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6253-6260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yousefi S. Higgins E. Daoling Z. Pollex-Kruger A. Hindsgaul O. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1772-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GnT-IX may compensate for the deficiency in Mgat5 –/– brain with regard to neuronal development and functions. Fig. 6 summarizes the predicted synthetic pathway of the core structure in N-glycan catalyzed by GnT-IX. GnT-IX catalyzes the synthesis of two unique N-linked oligosaccharide structures, namely the triantennary oligosaccharide possessing a β1,6-branched GlcNAc on the α1,3-linked mannose arm (Gn3-tri″-PA, peak 3) and the tetraantennary oligosaccharide containing two β1,6-branched GlcNAc residues in the core mannose (Gn4-tetra′-PA, peak 2). These structures have never been reported in any mammalian tissues. For further progress, it will be necessary to determine whether these structures actually exist in the brain.

However, because of the great variety of isoforms and their ubiquitous distribution within the β-cell, it is difficult to predict the importance of a particular isoform and its mode of action. Previous data revealed that two PKC isoforms (α and ϵ) translocate to membranes in response to glucose (Zaitzev, S. V., Efendic, S., Arkhammar, P., Bertorello, A. M., and Berggren, P. O. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 9712–9716). Using confocal microscopy, we have now established that in response to glucose, PKC-ϵ but not PKC-α associates with insulin granules and that green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC-ϵ changes its distribution within the cell periphery upon stimulation of β-cells with glucose. Definite evidence of PKC-ϵ requirement during insulin granule exocytosis was obtained by using a dominant negative mutant of this isoform. The presence of this mutant abolished glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas transient expression of the wild-type PKC-ϵ led to a significant increase in insulin exocytosis. These results suggest that association of PKC-ϵ with insulin granule membranes represents an important component of the secretory network because it is essential for insulin exocytosis in response to glucose.

In pancreatic β-cells, glucose metabolism generates a great variety of intracellular signals that in concert promote insulin exocytosis (for review see Refs. 1Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev.

There are other insulin secretagogues; however, their mode of action occasionally involves the regulation of signaling molecules that are different from the ones regulated in response to glucose. Among those signals, particular attention has been focused on the role of protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Gli, glibenclamide; INS-1E cells, rat insulinoma cell line; WT, wild type; DN, dominant negative.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Gli, glibenclamide; INS-1E cells, rat insulinoma cell line; WT, wild type; DN, dominant negative. because it is known that protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation can rapidly affect the function of a given protein or signaling molecule in response to a given agonist (3Nishizuka Y.

Definite proof of the role that PKC may have in the process of insulin exocytosis has been difficult to obtain, primarily because of the great diversity of PKC isoforms, the lack of specific inhibitors, and the use of different experimental designs and cell models to study their functions (for review see Ref. 5Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocrine Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous attempts to establish the identity of the PKC isoforms that are responsive to glucose in pancreatic β-cells, although complex, indicated that the α and ϵ isoforms are likely candidates (6Ganesan S.

Moreover, cell fractionation assays of intact islets exposed to high glucose confirm that both PKC-α and PKC-ϵ isoforms indeed translocate to membranes, an event that was even fast enough to coincide with the initial phase of insulin secretion (8Zaitzev S.V.

Using antibodies against specific PKC isoforms and selective anchoring peptides that block their activation, it was possible to assess the role of different isoforms during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (9Yedovitzky M.

Furthermore, functional studies are lacking that examine the relevance of those isoforms at early time points, matching glucose metabolism and early phases of insulin exocytosis. The present study was designed to examine whether PKC-α and PKC-ϵ associate with insulin granule membranes and thereby translocate to the plasma membrane during insulin exocytosis and to determine the relevance of such an event for insulin release. Materials—The cDNAs for PKC-ϵ and PKC-βI were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nishizuka (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). A dominant negative mutant of PKC-ϵ was obtained from Dr. K. Ridge (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). INS-IE cells were obtained from Dr. C. B Wollheim (University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland). Isolation of Pancreatic β-Cells from ob/ob Mice—Pancreatic β-cells were isolated from ob/ob mice. Mice were obtained from a locally bred colony at the animal facility within the Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The animals (starved overnight) were decapitated, the pancreas was excised from the abdominal cavity and pancreatic islets, and β-cells were isolated after collagenase digestion as previously described (10Lernmark Å. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were kept overnight in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 11 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Plasmid Construction—To generate pRcCMVi·PKC-ϵ and pRcCMVi·PKC-βI, both PKC-ϵ and PKC-βI cDNA were subcloned into a pRcCMVi backbone plasmid, i.e. pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) shortened by BamHI digestion and religation (12Moede T. Leibiger B. Pour H.G. Berggren P.O. Leibiger I.B. FEBS Letters. 1999; 461: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To obtain pRcCMVi·PKC-ϵ·GFP, we first subcloned the cDNA for the humanized and enhanced version of the GFP gene into pRcCMVi. Thereafter, the PKC-ϵ fragment lacking the stop codon obtained by digesting with EheI and EcoRI was subcloned in-frame in front of the GFP gene following digestion of pRcCMVi·GFP with EcoRV and EcoRI. To obtain pRcCMVi·PKC-βI·GFP, we first introduced a ClaI site in front of the stop codon of PKC-βI, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which then allowed in-frame fusion with the GFP gene via ClaI and XhoI sites. All vector constructions were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Culturing of INS-1E Cells—INS-1E cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), 2 mm glutamine, 50 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 m HEPES, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cell Transfection—Transfection of ob/ob and INS-1E cells was performed by lipofection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For transfection, 1 × 105 cells were treated with ∼3 μg of DNA and LipofectAMINE overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described for ob/ob and INS-1 cells, respectively, at 37 °C for at least 24 h. All experiments were performed 1 day after transfection. Confocal Microscopy—Primary cultures of ob/ob β-cells were grown on glass coverslips and incubated in the presence of either 3 or 16 mm glucose for 3 min at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by fixation of the cells with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, as previously described (13Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T.

After rinsing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, β-cells were incubated for 5 min in acetone at -20 °C and then quenched with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Staining with primary antibodies against insulin (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) and against PKC-α and PKC-ϵ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Detection of insulin and of PKC-α and PKC-ϵ was performed by incubation with anti-mouse Oregon green-labeled and anti-rabbit rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were mounted (SlowFade light; Molecular Probes) and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS NT; Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Excitation wavelengths of 488 nm for Oregon green and 568 nm for rhodamine were used. The confocal microscope was equipped with an Ar/Kr laser, a double dichroic mirror for rhodamine/fluorescein and a ×63 objective (Leica PL APO 63×/1.32–0.6 oil). Analysis of the data was performed with IMARIS and COLOCALISATION software (Bitplane; Zurich, Switzerland). Fluorescence Imaging in Living Cells—INS-1E cells expressing either PKC-ϵ·GFP or PKC-βI·GFP were grown on 24-mm glass coverslips in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described under “Culturing of INS-1E Cells.” The medium was changed to low glucose (2 mm) RPMI 1640 medium two hours before the experiment. For fluorescence imaging, the coverslip was placed in a perifusion chamber and mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope Leica DMIRB (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH). The cells were maintained throughout the experiment in low glucose RPMI 1640 at 37 °C. The fluorescence of GFP-tagged PKCs was monitored by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, using an argon/krypton laser at 488 nm (Leica TCS NT; Leica Lasertechnik GmbH). The following filter settings were used: dichroic mirror TK 500, emission filter BP525/50, with ×63 (Leica PL APO ×63/1.32–0.6 oil) and ×100 (Leica PL APO ×100/1.40–0.7 oil) objectives. Analysis of Translocation Kinetics—To analyze translocation kinetics, cells were imaged at 4 frames/min for 3 min, and glucose (16 mm) was added as a puff immediately after the first frame was recorded. Sequences of GFP images were processed using the Leica Confocal Software v.2.437. Analysis of moving structures between successive frames was done using the subtraction function of the three-dimensional module of the Leica Confocal Software v.2.437. The running subtraction shown is the actual mathematical subtraction performed on the corresponding pixels (pixels with identical locations) of two successive images. Thus, the program subtracts the pixel value in an image from the corresponding pixel in the previous frame, canceling out those pixels with identical values and showing only those structures that either move or experience a change in fluorescence intensity in the second image. Determination of β-Cell Capacitance—Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, coated with Sylgard near their tips, and fire polished. When filled with the pipette solution, the electrodes had a resistance of 3–4 MΩ. Exocytosis was measured as changes in cell capacitance using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and pulse software (version 8.30; HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht/Pfalz, Germany) (14Deeney J.T. Gromada J.

The interval between two successive points was 0.2 s. The measurements were initiated <5 s after establishment of the standard whole-cell configuration. The extracellular solution consisted of (in mm) 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 5 glucose. The pipette solution consisted of (in mm) 125 potassium glutamate, 10 KCl 10, NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2, 3 Mg-ATP, 10 EGTA, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.15 with KOH). The free Ca2+ concentration of the pipette solution was estimated to 0.2 μm with the binding constants of Martell and Smith (15Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants, Vols. 1 and 2. Plenum Press, New York1971Google Scholar). The volume of the recording chamber was 0.4 ml; the solution entering the bath (1.5 ml/min) was maintained at 33–34 °C. The exocytotic rate was estimated during the first 60 s following the establishment of the whole-cell configuration, ignoring any rapid changes occurring during the initial ∼10 s. Statistical significance was evaluated using Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons to a single control. Previous experiments (6Ganesan S. Calle R. Zawalich K. Zawalich W.S. Schulman G.I.

However, those experiments did not reveal the identity of the membranes to which these isoforms translocate. Therefore, we examined whether PKC-α and PKC-ϵ associate with insulin granule membranes in response to glucose, thereby playing an important regulatory role in insulin exocytosis. Our approach included confocal microscopy and PKC isoform-specific antibodies to evaluate a possible co-localization of PKC-α and/or PKC-ϵ with insulin granules in a glucose-dependent manner. Primary ob/ob β-cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with either 3 or 16 mM glucose for 5 min. At substimulatory glucose concentrations (3 mM), insulin granules (green) and PKC-ϵ (red) are depicted as punctuated structures of homogeneous distribution in scans along the surface of the cell (Fig. 1a). Incubation with 16 mM glucose, however, promoted the co-localization of PKC-ϵ and insulin granules, revealed by the yellow intensity seen in overlay images and co-localization analysis of the data. Middle scans of the same β-cells (Fig. 1b) indicated the polarized distribution of the co-localization between PKC-ϵ and insulin granules in response to 16 mM glucose, most prominent in the periphery of the β-cell. By contrast, using the same strategy as above it was found that 16 mM glucose did not promote the co-localization of PKC-α with insulin granules (Fig. 2, a and b). Taken together, these results indicate that although the PKC-ϵ isoform translocates to membranes, the structures are likely to be part of the insulin-containing granules, whereas the PKC-α isoform might indeed translocate to the plasma membranes or to membranes of other intracellular organelles.Fig. 2Effect of glucose stimulation on the subcellular localization of PKC-α (red) and insulin granules (green) in pancreatic β-cells. Experimental protocols were as described in Fig. 1. a, top scans at plasma membrane and submembrane levels. b, middle scan (across nuclei). Experiments are representative of five different preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the real-time changes in PKC-ϵ distribution in response to high glucose, we developed a fluorescent form of the kinase by adding a GFP tag to its C-terminal region. The presence of the tag did not affect its ability to translocate or to phosphorylate histone (not shown). An insulin-secreting cell line derived from rat insulinoma (INS-1E) was transiently transfected with the vector containing the PKC-ϵ·GFP cDNA, and the cells were analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fig. 3). To effectively study the movement of PKC molecules, the cells were maintained in low glucose (2 mM) RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h prior to the experiment. The cells were imaged at 4 frames/min over a period of 2.5 min, and glucose stimulation was achieved by raising the sugar concentration in the microscope chamber to 16 mM immediately after the first frame was recorded. To maximize the detection of moving fluorescent structures, we performed a running subtraction of the successive frames taken after glucose was introduced to the microscope chamber. This subtraction cancels out stationary structures to reveal only moving elements within the picture (16Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The analysis of a representative xy subtracted image shows the tracks followed by GFP-tagged PKC-ϵ molecules (Fig. 3). Glucose promoted a rapid translocation of PKC-ϵ molecules to the periphery of INS-1E cells. This fast translocation was directed to selected areas of the membrane and seemed to peak at ∼45 s after glucose stimulation of the cells and to decrease thereafter until a second association event can be observed occurring at ∼2 min (Fig. 3) and in conjunction with changes in membrane morphology. This effect of glucose on PKC-ϵ motion was not exclusively observed in INS-1E cells; it also occurred in an insulin-secreting cell line (MIN6) of mouse origin (not shown). To further prove the specificity of this response, we transfected INS-1E cells with a fluorescent construct (PKC-βI·GFP) of a PKC isoform not implicated in glucose-induced insulin secretion (PKC-βI). As predicted, the distribution of PKC-βI·GFP remained unchanged in response to 16 mM glucose (up to 10 min), whereas it did change dramatically, as expected, after incubation with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 4), thus indicating that in pancreatic β-cells glucose induces the translocation of PKC-ϵ in a specific manner. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is also known to affect the cell cytoskeleton and focal adhesion molecules (17Vaaraniemi J. Palovuori R. Lehto V.P. Eskelinen S. J. Cell Physiol. 1999; 181: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and it may therefore contribute to the extensive changes observed in cell morphology (Fig. 4). The functional relevance of PKC-ϵ during exocytosis was further studied. Although inhibitors of different PKC isoform groups have been described, the lack of specific isoenzyme inhibitors makes it difficult to assess with certainty their specific role in diverse cellular functions. Therefore, we took advantage of the use of dominant negative mutants. A mutant of PKC-ϵ was constructed in which a single amino acid mutation (Arg → Lys) was introduced in its catalytic domain that abolished the ATP binding ability (18Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weisntein I.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Efficient transient transfection of these constructs has been established previously (18Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weisntein I.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The role of PKC-ϵ on insulin secretion was evaluated by measuring membrane capacitance in INS-1E cells transiently transfected with either the PKC-ϵ wild-type or a dominant negative mutant. Increases in cell capacitance occurring during intracellular dialysis with a Ca2+ buffer containing 0.2 μM [Ca2+]f are illustrated in Fig. 5. Under control conditions, exocytosis was observed as a gradual capacitance increase that reached a new steady-state level within 2–4 min. It is clear that the exocytotic response was stimulated in cells transfected with the wild-type isoform of PKC-ϵ, whereas the dominant negative PKC-ϵ isoform significantly reduced the rate of exocytosis (Fig. 5a). On average (Fig. 5b), wild-type PKC-ϵ evoked a 202% stimulation of the exocytotic rate (p < 0.01; n = 5), whereas the dominant negative mutant of PKC-ϵ induced a reduction of 58% (p < 0.05; n = 5). Transient expression of the PKC-βI isoform did not influence exocytosis (Fig. 5). The latter was anticipated because this isoform did not translocate in response to glucose (Fig. 4). We have previously demonstrated that sulfonylureas stimulate insulin exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells in a PKC-dependent manner (19Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Ammala C. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. Bokvist K. Chibalin A. Deeney J.T. Flatt P.R. Gabel J. Gromada J. Larsson O. Lindstrom P. Rhodes C.J. Rorsman P. Science. 1996; 271: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This also applies to INS-1E cells, as suggested by the 3-fold stimulation (p < 0.01; n = 10) of exocytosis following inclusion of 100 nM glibenclamide in the pipette-filling solution (Fig. 5). As expected, glibenclamide produced a dose-dependent increase in exocytosis in INS-1E cells (Table I). Thus, the involvement of PKC-ϵ in the secretory pathway evoked by glibenclamide was evaluated through the use of the dominant negative mutant PKC-ϵ. The effect of glibenclamide (100 nM) was significantly increased in wild-type PKC-ϵ-transfected cells as the combination of glibenclamide and wild-type PKC-ϵ produced an additive increment of cell capacitance (Table I). Interestingly, cell capacitance was significantly reduced to almost control levels in cells expressing the dominant negative form of the PKC-ϵ isomer (74% inhibition; p < 0.01; n = 5), (Table I). The degree of stimulation in cell capacitance induced by glibenclamide was not affected by the PKC-βI isoform, again suggesting a specific response mediated by the PKC-ϵ isoform (Table I).Table IEffect of glibenclamide and of PKC-ϵ on insulin exocytosis on INS-1E cellsTreatmentCell capacitancefF/sNone4.7 ± 0.5 (n = 14)PKC-ϵ wt14.1 ± 1.6 (n = 5)ap < 0.01 versus untreated cells10–7m Gli17.7 ± 0.7 (n = 10)ap < 0.01 versus untreated cells10–6m Gli28.3 ± 1.7 (n = 5)ap < 0.01 versus untreated cells10–5m Gli27.9 ± 2.2 (n = 5)ap < 0.01 versus untreated cells10–7m Gli + PKC-ϵ wt27.8 ± 2.1 (n = 5)ap < 0.01 versus untreated cells10–6m Gli + PKC-ϵ wt28.9 ± 2.1 (n = 6)ap < 0.01 versus untreated cells10–7m Gli + PKC-ϵ DN7.3 ± 1.3 (n = 7)bp < 0.01 versus 10–7 M Gli + PKC-ϵ wt10–6m Gli + PKC-ϵ DN6.5 ± 1.7 (n = 5)cp < 0.01 versus 10–6 M Gli + PKC-ϵ wtPKC-βI wt5.0 ± 0.4 (n = 20)10–7m Gli + PKC-βI wt16.7 ± 0.7 (n = 15)dp < 0.01 versus PKC-βI wta p < 0.01 versus untreated cellsb p < 0.01 versus 10–7 M Gli + PKC-ϵ wtc p < 0.01 versus 10–6 M Gli + PKC-ϵ wtd p < 0.01 versus PKC-βI wt Open table in a new tab A recent work reported the translocation of the PKC-βII isoform to the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, suggested to be mature insulin granules, in response to glucose (20Pinton P.

Although that report eloquently demonstrates the motion of the βII isoform in living cells, the functional significance of such motion (potential targets) remains to be addressed. The results of the present study show for the first time that PKC-ϵ associates with insulin granules in response to glucose, thereby indicating a specific role of PKC-ϵ in insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Our data also indicate that glibenclamide promotes insulin secretion in INS-1E cells by a mechanism of action that involves PKC-ϵ. Thus, the interaction of PKC-ϵ with the insulin granule membrane appears to be a mechanism not only associated with glucose-induced insulin secretion but also with other secretagogues such as sulfonylureas, because these compounds directly stimulate insulin exocytosis in a PKC-dependent manner (19Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Ammala C. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. Bokvist K. Chibalin A. Deeney J.T. Flatt P.R. Gabel J. Gromada J. Larsson O. Lindstrom P. Rhodes C.J. Rorsman P.

The molecular mechanisms for the association of PKC-ϵ and insulin granule membranes as well as the potential PKC-ϵ targets within that membrane remain to be explored.

https://openalex.org/W1985566364,"Post-translational geranylgeranylation of Rab GT-Pases is essential for their membrane association and function as regulators of intracellular vesicular transport. The reaction is catalyzed by Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RGGT) and is assisted by the Rab escort proteins (REP), which form stable complexes with newly synthesized GDP-bound Rabs. Two genetic diseases involve the Rab geranylgeranylation machinery: choroideremia, an X-linked retinal degeneration resulting from loss-of-function mutations in REP1, and gunmetal, a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome resulting from mutations in the α-subunit of RGGT. A small subset of Rab proteins is selectively under-prenylated in both diseases, most notably Rab27a. Here we analyze why Rab27a is selectively affected in diseases of Rab geranylgeranylation. Semi-quantitative immunoblotting suggests that mass action, i.e. the amount of Rab27a relative to other Rabs, is unlikely to be a factor as the expression level of Rab27a is similar to other Rabs not affected in these diseases. In vitro binding assays and fluorescence resonance energy transfer detected by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in intact cells demonstrate that Rab27a binds equally well to both REP1 and REP2, suggesting differential affinity of Rab27a for REP isoforms is not an important factor. However, steady-state kinetic analysis of the geranylgeranylation reaction indicates that REP2-Rab27a has lower affinity for RGGT compared with REP1-Rab27a. Furthermore, we show that Rab27a has relatively low GTPase activity, presumably decreasing the affinity of the REP interaction in vivo. We suggest that the restricted phenotypes observed in these diseases result from multiple contributing factors.

Protein prenylation is a common post-translational lipid modification, which consists of the covalent addition of the C15 farnesyl or more commonly the C20 geranylgeranyl to C-terminal cysteine residues in specific cellular substrates (1Yokoyama K. Gelb M.H. Tamanoi F.A. Sigman D.S. Lipid Modifications of Proteins. Vol. 21. Academic Press, New York2000: 106-130Google Scholar, 2Seabra M.C. Tamanoi F.A. Sigman D.S.

The largest family of prenylation substrates is the Rab GTPase family, all of which undergo single or more commonly double geranylgeranylation. Geranylgeranylation enable Rabs to associate with specific subcellular compartments where they regulate trafficking pathways (4Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar, 5Pfeffer S.R.

The reaction is catalyzed by a heterodimeric enzyme, Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RGGT). 1The abbreviations used are: RGGTRab geranylgeranyltransferaseREPRab escort proteinsCHMchoroideremiaDTTdithiothreitolPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPGGPPgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphateFLIMfluorescence lifetime imaging microscopyBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycinedansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. The protein substrate for RGGT is a 1:1 complex between any given newly synthesized Rab protein and Rab escort protein (REP) (7Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E.

RGGT first binds the lipid substrate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, then binds the REP-Rab complex (8Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alternatively, RGGT binds REP first and then Rab binds the REP-RGGT-GGPP complex (9Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48637-48643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RGGT then catalyzes the transfer of geranylgeranyl groups to one or two cysteines present in the C termini of Rab proteins (10Farnsworth C.C. Seabra M.C. Ericsson L.H. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11963-11967Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme may bind only one lipid at once, the addition of two geranylgeranyl groups to Rabs bearing two cysteines is likely to be sequential (8Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B.

After lipid transfer, the enzyme dissociates from the REP-Rab complex, and REP is believed to deliver the prenylated Rab to cellular membranes (15Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol.

Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked slow-onset retinal degeneration affecting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the choroid, and the photoreceptors, which results from loss-of-function mutations in REP1 (19Seabra M.C. Ophthalmic Genet. 1996; 17: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). REP function in CHM cells is provided by REP2, a protein functionally redundant with REP1. Nevertheless, REP2 is not able to fully compensate for the loss of REP1, and a selected subset of Rab proteins is found under-prenylated in CHM cells (20Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Cremers F.P. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most prominent protein was subsequently identified as Rab27a and shown to be highly expressed in the same layers of the rat eye that are observed to degenerate in CHM patients, the RPE and the choroid (20Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that defects in Rab27a function, resulting from the loss of REP1, might underlie the retinal degeneration observed in CHM. Another disease in which Rab prenylation is affected is in the gunmetal (gm) mouse, a model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. The gm mutation was identified as a Gly to Ala substitution in a splice acceptor site in the gene encoding the murine RGGT α-subunit (22Detter J.C. Zhang Q. Mules E.H. Novak E.K. Mishra V.S. Li W. McMurtrie E.B. Tchernev V.T. Wallace M.R. Seabra M.C. Swank R.T. Kingsmore S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4144-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the major RGGT transcript in the gm mutant lacks a start codon and is nonfunctional. However, the gm mutant contains a reduced level of RGGT activity due to the low frequency activation of a cryptic splice acceptor site within RGGT-α RNA, which results in the production of a full-length transcript. This observation suggested that deficiency of Rab(s) prenylation results in the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome phenotype, an hypothesis remarkably similar to the one proposed for CHM. Consistent with this possibility, a subset of Rabs accumulate unprenylated in the gm cytosol, including Rab27a (22Detter J.C. Zhang Q. Mules E.H. Novak E.K. Mishra V.S. Li W. McMurtrie E.B. Tchernev V.T. Wallace M.R. Seabra M.C. Swank R.T. Kingsmore S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4144-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Q. Zhen L. Li W. Novak E.K.

Interestingly, Rab27 isoforms are highly expressed in the tissues affected in the gm mouse suggesting that the gm phenotype is at least in part a result of reduced Rab27 function. In the present study, we analyze why Rab27a is selectively affected in diseases of Rab geranylgeranylation. We demonstrate that Rab27a binds equally well to both REP1 and REP2. However, the REP2-Rab27a substrate has lower affinity for RGGT. Furthermore, we show that Rab27a is likely to be mostly GTP-bound due to low intrinsic GTPase activity, presumably decreasing the affinity of the REP interaction in vivo.

The chimeric Rab1a-loop in pET14b (pET14b-Rab1a-li) was constructed by inserting a sequence encoding a 10-amino acid stretch (residues 54–63 of rat Rab27a) between residues 56 and 57 of canine Rab1a using PCR mutagenesis in two stages.

The pGEX3T-ratRab5a was a gift from Dr. Thomas Sudhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The production of hexahistidine-tagged Rab proteins in Escherichia coli and REP1, REP2, and RGGT in Sf9 cells has been described previously (8Anant J.S.

Commun. 2003; 301: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rab-REP Binding Assays—Recombinant Rab proteins were labeled with 0.85 mm dansyl chloride (Molecular Probes, D21) in buffer containing 100 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GDP. After modification, excess dansyl chloride was removed by eluting the labeled proteins through a PD10 column according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Each collected fraction was monitored at 280 and 336 nm. The absorbance at 336 nm had to be lower than 0.02 absorbance so that absorbance would not interfere with fluorescence. A concentration range of 50–200 nm REP1 or REP2 was titrated against dansylated Rab1a and Rab27a in reaction buffer (25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT) at 37 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra were detected by an LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer with Flwinlab software. Dansyl chloride alone and dansylated K-Ras were used as negative controls. The relative fluorescence intensity (F) was calculated from the spectra by the following equation: ΔF = F – Fo/Fmax – Fo, where Fmax is the maximum fluorescence intensity at saturation, Fo is the maximum fluorescence intensity of the dansylated Rab without REP, and F is the maximum fluorescence intensity at different REP concentrations. The graph of ΔF versus REP concentrations (nm) allowed the determination of the KD values. The curves were fitted using non-linear regression in SigmaPlot for Windows version 5 (SPSS Inc.), and the KD values were determined by the same software. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—COS-7 cells and CHM patient-derived CPF1 fibroblast cells (29Anand V. Barral D.C. Zeng Y. Brunsmann F. Maguire A.M. Seabra M.C. Bennett J. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Lymphoblast cells from CHM patients (L659 and L660) and unaffected individual (L423 and L430) (20Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells for transfection were grown on 13-mm glass coverslips for 24 h, transfected with 0.2 μg of DNA using the liposomal transfection reagent LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), and then fixed 48 h later. Immunoblotting and Immunostaining of FRET Samples—Pelleted lymphoblast cells were lysed by brief sonication in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with occasional agitation. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting. Briefly, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody diluted in solution 1 (PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% non-fat dry milk) for 1 h, washed with solution 2 (PBS, 0.2% Tween 20), followed by incubation for 30 min with 1:10,000 dilution of appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) diluted in solution 1 and washing as before. Bound antibody was detected using the Western Supersignal System (Pierce). Blots were calibrated with prestained molecular weight standards (BioRad). For immunofluorescence, coverslip-grown cells were washed in PBS and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Excess fixative was removed by washing with PBS; cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and washed as before. Cells were then incubated in 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride in PBS for 10 min to quench and washed twice with PBS and once with PBS containing 1% BSA (PBS/BSA). Cells were then incubated with 0.22-μm filtered Cy3-conjugated J905 anti-REP rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted in PBS/BSA for 2 h. Coverslips containing fixed cells were then mounted in Immuno Fluor medium (ICN). FRET Methods—A detailed description of the FRET monitored by FLIM detection in the frequency (phase) domain can be found elsewhere (31Larijani B. Allen-Baume V. Morgan C.P. Li M. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Hughes W.E. Larijani B. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Phase methods provide an average lifetime where sinusoidally modulated light is used to excite the sample. The lag in the emitted fluorescence signal permits measurement of phase (τp) and modulation depth (τm) of the fluorescence. The lifetime, 〈τ〉, is the average of phase shift and relative modulation depth (τm + τp)/2 of the emitted fluorescence signal. The average EGFP lifetime without acceptor (〈τd〉) was calculated from 10 cells per experiment, and the average EGFP lifetime with acceptor (〈τda〉) was deduced from 7 cells per experiment. Each experiment was repeated three times. The cumulative lifetimes of EGFP-Rab27a, EGFP-Rab1a, and EGFP-Hras alone and that measured with acceptor fluorophore were plotted on two-dimensional histograms. The average population variation, a concomitant decrease in τp and τm, indicates a reduction in EGFP lifetime due to FRET. GraphPad InStat software (version 3.0 for Mac-2001) was used for the statistical analysis. An unpaired t test with Welch correction was used to determine the significance of variation in lifetime (7 or more cells were analyzed per experiment; n = 3). The p values were determined at 95% confidence interval. All images were taken using a Zeiss Plan-APOCHROMAT 100×/1.4 numerical aperture, phase 3 oil objective, with images recorded at a modulation frequency of 80.218 MHz. The GFP-Rab/Ras was excited using the 488 nm line of an argon/krypton laser and the resultant fluorescence separated using a combination of dichroic beam splitter (Q 505 LP; Chroma Technology Corp.) and interference filter (HQ510/20 Chroma Technology Corp). Anti-REP antibody J905 (33Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was conjugated to monofunctional Cy3 (Molecular Probes) as follows. Antibody J905 (250 μm) was added to 50 μl of buffer containing 1 m Bicine, pH 8.0, and 20 μl of Cy3 dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min under protection from light. Excess Cy3 was separated from bound Cy3-J905 by gel filtration chromatography (EconoPac 10 DG, Bio-Rad) in PBS buffer, and elution was monitored by spectrophotometry. The dye to antibody concentration was calculated as follows: [antibody] = A280 nm – ((0.08 A552 nm))/ 170,000; [Cy3] = A552 nm/150,000. Dye to protein ratio was optimized to be 3:1 for best results. Prenylation Assays—Rab geranylgeranyltransferase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) into recombinant Rab proteins (34Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained the following in a total reaction volume of 25 μl: 50 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm recombinant Rab, 0.02 μm Rab GGTase, 4 μm GGPP (0.3 μm [3H]GGPP and 3.6 μm unlabeled GGPP), and varying concentrations of REP from 0.1–3 μm. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped by adding 1 ml of ethanol/HCl (90:10 v/v). After incubating at room temperature for 30 min, the precipitable radioactivity was measured by filtration on a 1.2-μm glass fiber filter and scintillation counting. The data obtained were fitted by non-linear regression to equations describing general Michaelis-Menten kinetics using SigmaPlot for Windows version 4 (SPSS Inc.). GTPase Assay—The protocol was adapted from Liang et al. (35Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μm GST-Rab was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The beads were then incubated in buffer A containing 250 mm ammonium sulfate for 10 min before 0.1 μm [α-32P]GTP was added to the beads and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Unbound [α-32P]GTP was removed by washing the beads twice with 1 ml of buffer A. GTP hydrolysis was initiated by resuspending beads in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2). Aliquots (10 μl) were taken at the indicated times and solubilized in 10 μl of buffer C (0.2% (w/v) SDS, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm GTP, 5 mm GDP) by heating at 65 °C for 2 min. Eluted nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets (J. T. Baker Inc.) with 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5, as the developing solvent. Radioactive GTP and GDP spots were revealed by exposing for 2 h on a Cyclone storage phosphor multipurpose screen and quantified using the Cyclone storage PhosphorImager System (Packard Instrument Co.). At the outset, we tested whether Rab27a accumulated in an unprenylated state in CHM cells due to differences in its ability to bind REP1 and REP2. We first measured the affinity of Rab27a toward REP1 and REP2 by using an in vitro fluorescence assay. In this assay, recombinant Rabs were fluorescently labeled with dansyl chloride. The binding of REP to dansylated-Rabs changed the local chemical environment and resulted in fluorescence emission quenching. Fig. 1 shows the binding curves for Rab27a and Rab1a for REP1 and REP2. The observed dissociation constants (KD) between Rab27a and REP1 and REP2 were KD(REP1) = 223 ± 51 nm and KD(REP2) = 240 ± 39 nm, respectively. The KD values for Rab1a were not significantly different from Rab27a (KD(REP1) = 106 ± 39 nm; KD(REP2) = 229 ± 47 nm). These values are similar and suggest that the affinities of Rab1a and Rab27a for REP1 and REP2 are not significantly different. To examine the interactions in intact cells between REPs and Rab27a, we exploited FRET measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Fig. 2 illustrates the specific interaction of REP and Rab proteins in intact COS-7 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-Rab1a or EGFP-Rab27a. The fixed cells were then labeled with Cy3-conjugated J905 (anti-REP antibody which recognizes both REP1 and REP2), and the fluorescence lifetime of EGFP-Rab (donor) was measured with and without Cy3-J905 (acceptor). In the presence of acceptor, the average EGFP-Rab1a and EGFP-Rab27a lifetimes decreased from 2.10 to 1.72 ns and 2.00 to 1.65 ns, respectively. Moreover, the two-dimensional histograms illustrate a simultaneous decrease in both the τp and τm indicating a reduction in EGFP lifetime due to FRET (Fig. 2C). Parallel experiments were performed with EGFP-Hras as a specificity control. The EGFP-Hras lifetime remained unchanged with or without Cy3-J905, suggesting that the results obtained with the Rab proteins were specific. Concomitantly, experiments were performed with CHM fibroblasts (Fig. 3). CHM fibroblasts exhibit loss-of-function mutations in REP1 and do not express detectable amounts of REP1 (29Anand V. Barral D.C. Zeng Y. Brunsmann F. Maguire A.M. Seabra M.C. Bennett J. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In these cells, we observed a similar extent of decrease in EGFP-Rab27a lifetime (2.1 to 1.5 ns) and EGFP-Rab1a lifetime (2.1 to 1.55 ns) in the presence of Cy3-J905 acceptor. The significant decrease in EGFP lifetime due to FRET is also represented by two-dimensional histograms (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, no changes were detected with EGFP-Hras as observed in COS-7 cells. Altogether, these results suggest that the affinity of Rab27a for REP1 is similar to its affinity to REP2 in vitro and in intact cells. Furthermore, Rab27a exhibits comparable affinities to other Rabs for REPs (8Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results indicate that differences in the affinity of Rab27a versus Rab1a for the REP proteins do not explain the accumulation of non-prenylated Rab27a in the cytosol of CHM patient lymphoblasts. Thus, another possibility is that Rab27a is expressed at much higher levels than other Rabs in lymphoblastoid cells, and thus its selective accumulation could be explained by mass action. We undertook comparative immunoblotting of Rab proteins in control and CHM lymphoblast cell lines by using antibodies reactive to Rab27a, Rab5a, and Rab6a together with known amounts of recombinant hexahistidine-tagged Rab proteins. By using this semi-quantitative technique, we observed that Rab27a was not significantly overexpressed relative to Rab5 or Rab6 in lymphoblast cells indicating that the accumulation of unprenylated Rab27a in CHM lymphoblasts is not simply due to the high expression of Rab27a. 2A. N. Hume and M. C. Seabra, unpublished data. We then considered the possibility that the REP2-Rab27a complex could be a poorer substrate for RGGT. By using an established in vitro prenylation assay (8Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for the substrate complexes REP1 or REP2 in complex with either Rab27a or Rab1a (Fig. 4, A and B). Table I summarizes the kinetic parameters obtained. Our results indicate that the Km value for the REP1-Rab27a complex is significantly lower than either REP2-Rab27a or any REP-Rab1a complex. The differences in Km values obtained for Rab27a in complex with REP1 and REP2 were highly reproducible, consistent with a previous result (20Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and suggest that the REP1-Rab27a is a better substrate for prenylation than REP2-Rab27a. We hypothesized that a 10-amino acid insert present in loop 3 of Rab27 proteins (residues 54–63 in human Rab27a), but not in other Rabs, could be responsible for this effect. We prepared two mutant recombinant proteins, one where the loop was deleted in Rab27a (Rab27a loop-out) and one where the Rab27a loop was inserted into Rab1a (Rab1a loop-in). The kinetic analysis is shown in Fig. 4 and Table I. The significant changes in the kinetic parameters induced by the mutagenesis were a decrease in the Km value of Rab1a loop-in compared with Rab1a and an increase in Vmax value of Rab27a loop-out compared with Rab27a. These results suggest that the loop insert in Rab27a affects the affinity of the REP-Rab27a complex for RGGT.Table IKinetic parameters for RGGT reactionRab substrateApparent KmApparent VmaxREP1REP2REP1REP2μmnmol·min-1·mg-1Rab27a0.08 ± 0.030.37 ± 0.151.45 ± 0.151.43 ± 0.25Rab1a0.48 ± 0.110.41 ± 0.115.47 ± 0.564.98 ± 0.55Rab27a loop-out0.25 ± 0.120.54 ± 0.321.90 ± 0.331.41 ± 0.41Rab1a loop-in0.16 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.033.79 ± 0.213.27 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab REPs binds preferentially Rabs in the GDP-bound state, but Rabs are presumably GTP-bound after synthesis (24Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14398-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates of Rab proteins could affect the efficiency of prenylation. To test this possibility, we analyzed the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis using an established thin layer chromatography assay (Fig. 5). We used Rab5a and Rab3a as controls given the extensive data available on the enzymatic properties of these Rabs. At 37 °C, we obtained a rate of 0.164 min–1 for Rab5a, 0.082 min–1 for Rab3a, and 0.0058 min–1 for Rab27a (Fig. 5). These data suggest that Rab27a exhibits a slow rate of intrinsic hydrolysis. The molecular basis of CHM and other genetic diseases affecting Rab prenylation appears to result from defects in prenylation of a subset of Rabs, most notably Rab27a. In this paper we suggest two reasons that might contribute to the selectivity of the defect. One is that Rab27 is among the slowest hydrolyzing Rabs, suggesting that a high proportion of newly synthesized Rab27a is in the GTP-bound form and therefore not able to bind to REP. The second reason is that the REP1-Rab27a complex is recognized by RGGT with greater affinity than REP2-Rab27a. In the absence of REP1 in CHM, all Rab27a is processed by REP2. We have hypothesized previously that REP1 exhibited higher affinity for Rab27a than REP2, but the present results do not support this possibility (19Seabra M.C. Ophthalmic Genet. 1996; 17: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We used a fluorescence-based in vitro binding assay for REP and Rab and determined the association constants for the interaction between REP1 and REP2 and different Rab proteins. Analysis suggests that both REP1 and REP2 exhibit the same affinity toward Rab27a and, furthermore, that the affinity for Rab27a is similar to that of other Rabs such as Rab1a. The values measured using this assay were comparable with those obtained previously using another fluorescence-based in vitro binding assay (8Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vivo studies using FRET detected by FLIM confirmed the results obtained in the in vitro binding assays. We were able to detect FRET of similar efficiency (reflected by a comparable variation in the donor (GFP) lifetimes) between REP1/2 and Rab1a, and REP1/2 and Rab27a in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, we used a CHM cell line, which only expresses REP2 to test specifically the interactions between REP2 and different Rabs, given that the anti-REP antibody used in the FRET experiments did not discriminate between REP1 and REP2. As in COS-7 cells, in CHM fibroblasts we were able to establish a strong association between REP2 and Rab27 and REP2 and Rab1a detected by the variation in donor lifetimes. We then studied the kinetics of the prenylation reaction. We found that the REP1-Rab27a substrate exhibited a higher affinity for RGGT than any other substrate analyzed to date. In contrast, the REP2-Rab27a substrate exhibited an affinity comparable with other REP-Rab complexes studied previously. Interestingly, the addition of a stretch of 10 amino acids characteristically present in the putative loop 3 of Rab27a into the corresponding location in Rab1a altered the kinetics of the fusion protein. The Rab1 loop-in substrate exhibited lower Km values than Rab1 wild type, suggesting that this stretch of amino acids is involved in the recognition by RGGT. Conversely, the removal of this 10-amino acid stretch from Rab27a increased the apparent Km value for the reaction. These differences may account for the selective defect in CHM but not for those in gm where Rab27a under prenylation also features pre-eminently. In gm cells REP1 and REP2 expression is unaffected, instead it is a quantitative reduction in the amount of RGGT that leads to the prenylation defect. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intrinsic hydrolysis rate could affect prenylation efficiency, given that we have previously established that REPs have a marked affinity for the GDP-bound state of Rabs (24Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14398-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our analysis suggests that, among Rabs, Rab27a has one of the slowest rates of GTP hydrolysis. Similar GTPase rates were observed previously for Rab7 and Rab9 (37Shapiro A.D. Riederer M.A. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6925-6931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We suggest that in vivo, in the absence of other factors, e.g. Rab GAPs, Rabs that have slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate may be disadvantaged in their ability to become prenylated relative to other, faster hydrolyzing, Rabs. Interestingly, Rab7 has been reported to bind REP in vitro with higher affinity than Rab27a (39Alexandrov K. Simon I. Iakovenko A. Holz B. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This may explain why other slow hydrolyzing Rabs do not accumulate unprenylated in CHM patients. Future studies will be required to further understand the events leading to REP-Rab complex formation in vivo. Altogether, our in vitro and in situ studies suggest that the molecular basis for the selective under-prenylation of certain Rabs in genetic disease associated with defects in Rab prenylation machinery are complex and probably multifactorial.

https://openalex.org/W2085487753,"The number of postsynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors is a fundamental determinant of the variability of inhibitory synaptic responses in the central nervous system. In rat visual cortex, [3H]SR-95531 binding assays revealed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the neurotrophins, induced a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors, through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases. We also demonstrated that BDNF rapidly induced a sustained potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents, using nystatin-perforated patch clamp recordings, in visual cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons freshly isolated from P14 rats. The potentiation was caused by the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase and phospholipase C-γ. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ was important for the potentiation of GABAA responses induced by BDNF. The selective increase in mean miniature inhibitory postsynaptic (mIPSC) current amplitude without effects on mIPSC time courses supports the idea that BDNF rapidly induces an increase in the total number of cell surface functional GABAA receptors in visual cortical pyramidal neurons. These results suggest that BDNF could alter the number of cell surface GABAA receptors in a region-specific manner.

The selective increase in mean miniature inhibitory postsynaptic (mIPSC) current amplitude without effects on mIPSC time courses supports the idea that BDNF rapidly induces an increase in the total number of cell surface functional GABAA receptors in visual cortical pyramidal neurons. These results suggest that BDNF could alter the number of cell surface GABAA receptors in a region-specific manner.

GABAergic transmission is characterized by high variability of synaptic responses attributable to many factors at both pre- and postsynaptic sites (2Cherubini E. Conti F.

These complex results suggest that region-specific phosphorylation or dephosphorylation processes regulate GABAergic function in a cell-specific manner. The number of postsynaptic GABAA receptors is a fundamental determinant of the variability of postsynaptic responses (2Cherubini E. Conti F. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The endocytosis of GABAA receptors occurs both in hippocampal (9Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in cortical (10Kilman V. van Rossum M.C.W. Turrigiano G.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) neurons. In contrast, the ubiquitin-like protein Plic-1 increases the number of GABAA receptors available for the recruitment to the plasma membrane (11Bedford F.K. Kittler J.T. Muller E. Thomas P. Uren J.M. Merlo D. Wisden W. Triller A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In hippocampus, insulin induces a rapid recruitment of functional GABAA receptors to the postsynaptic membranes through the activation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, thereby increasing the amplitude of GABAA receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) without effects on their time courses (12Wan Q. Xiong Z.G. Man H.Y. Ackerley C.A. Braunton J. Lu W.Y. Becker L.E. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Nature. 1997; 388: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the neurotrophins, rapidly modulates postsynaptic GABAA receptor function. In hippocampus of postnatal day (P) 14 rat, BDNF acutely inhibits postsynaptic GABAA responses by elevating intracellular Ca2+ levels via the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent phospholipase C (PLC) γ phosphorylation (13Tanaka T. Saito H. Matsuki N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2959-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but at P6, BDNF reversibly potentiates postsynaptic GABAA responses (14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BDNF also alters the number of cell surface GABAA receptors. In cultured hippocampal (15Brünig I. Penschuck S. Berninger B. Benson J. Fritschy J.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cerebellar granule (16Cheng Q. Yeh H.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 711-721Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) cells, BDNF rapidly induces an internalization of postsynaptic cell surface GABAA receptors, through the Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase activation, thereby decreasing the amplitudes of mIPSCs. In visual cortex, the timing of the critical period for ocular dominance columns formation (which is normally between P23 and P33) is determined, not simply by visual stimuli but also by the maturation of the inhibitory circuits themselves (17Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F. Science. 1998; 282: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Mice overexpressing BDNF exhibit a precocious maturation of GABAergic inhibition in visual cortex and accelerated decline of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (18Huang Z.J. Kirkwood A. Pizzorusso T. Porciatti V. Morales B. Bear M.F. Maffei L. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1999; 98: 739-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In developing rat visual cortex, the expression of Trk B receptor is most prominent in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (19Cellerino A. Maffei L. Domenici L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the levels of both BDNF mRNA (20Bozzi Y. Pizzorusso T. Cremisi F. Rossi F.M. Barsacchi G. Maffei L. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and BDNF protein (21Tropea, D., Capsoni, S., Tongiorgi, E., Giannotta, S., Cattaneo, A., and Domenici, L. Eur. J. Neurosci., 13, 709–721Google Scholar) are highest in layers 2, 3, and 5. In layer 5 of rat visual cortex, the level of BDNF mRNA rapidly increases around P14 (when the eyes have just opened) (20Bozzi Y. Pizzorusso T. Cremisi F. Rossi F.M. Barsacchi G. Maffei L. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and thereafter decreases to reach a plateau level at P18 (22Capsoni S. Tongiorgi E. Cattaneo A. Domenici L. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, increasing evidence suggests that BDNF has important roles on GABAergic transmission in developing visual cortex, but the potent mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. We tested the rapid effect of BDNF on the cell surface expression of GABAA receptors in visual cortex of P14 rats, using [3H]SR-95531 binding assays. [3H]SR-95531 binding assays revealed that BDNF induced a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors in rat visual cortex, through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases. We also demonstrated that BDNF rapidly induced a sustained potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents, using nystatin-perforated patch clamp recordings, in visual cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons isolated from P14 rats. The selective increase in mean mIPSC amplitude without effects on mIPSC time courses supports the idea that BDNF rapidly induces an increase in the total number of cell surface functional GABAA receptors in visual cortical pyramidal neurons. All experiments conformed to the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Animals approved by the Council of the Physiological Society of Japan, and all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. [3H]SR-95531 Binding Assays—Visual cortical cells were freshly isolated from rats using papain dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) intended for the cell dissociation and culture procedures developed by Huettner and Baughman (23Huettner J.E. Baughman R.W. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3044-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by which high yields of viable and morphologically intact neurons were dissociated from visual cortex of P1–15 rats. In brief, 14-day-old Wistar rats were decapitated under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg kg–1, intraperitoneally). Brains were quickly removed and bathed in cold incubation medium bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Blocks of tissue comprising visual cortex were removed from the occipital cortex of both hemispheres and were gently minced or cut into small pieces. The tissue was placed in the Earle's balanced salt solution, equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, including papain (at a final concentration of 20 units ml–1) and DNase (0.005%). The mixed solution was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After albumin-ovomucoid inhibitor was added to the mixed solution, the mixture was gently triturated with 10-ml pipette three times and centrifuged at 1,100 r.p.m. for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the obtained visual cortical cells were immediately resuspended with external standard solution. Cell viability of the obtained visual cortical cells, determined by the trypan blue exclusion method (24Michaels R.L. Rothman S.M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was 87.8 ± 2.5% (n = 4 rats). The trypan blue exclusion method was as follows. The cell suspension was incubated for 5 min in 0.4% trypan blue solution (at a final concentration of 0.2%; Sigma) and washed twice in external standard solution. In each experiment, five randomly chosen optical fields (at least 250 cells in each field) were analyzed by a phase contrast, bright field microscopy at low magnification. Viable cells are determined as dye-negative, whereas nonviable cells with damaged cell membrane are stained blue. Cell viability was expressed as a percent of the number of total viable (unstained) cells relative to the total (unstained and stained) cells. The final value was obtained as mean ± S.E. of four separate experiments. Visual cortical cells were incubated in standard solution with vehicle (standard solution), BDNF (20 ng ml–1) alone, or BDNF plus K252a (200 nm) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with standard solution by centrifugation at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 min and resuspended in ice-cold standard solution. The protein concentration of the cell suspension was measured using a Lowry method (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. Twenty μl of cell suspension was added to the assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin) containing 20 nm [3H]SR-95531, a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist (specific radioactivity 2,186.7 GBq mmol–1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without 10 μm SR-95531, and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C (26Günther U. Benson J. Benke D. Fritschy J.M. Reyes G. Knoflach F. Crestani F. Aguzzi A. Arigoni M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Möhler H. Lüscher B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7749-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To calculate the specific binding, nonspecific binding values (determined in the presence of 10 μm SR-95531) were subtracted from the total binding values (in the absence of 10 μm SR-95531). For Scatchard analysis (27Zivin J.A. Waud D.R. Life Sci. 1982; 30: 1407-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), assay buffers containing 5–30 nm [3H]SR-95531 were used. Samples were filtered under negative pressure over Whatman GF/C filters, which were then rapidly rinsed two times with 5 ml of ice-cold assay buffer. Radioactivity on filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Electrophysiological Recordings—Visual cortical pyramidal neurons from 14-day-old Wistar rats were freshly dissociated using procedures similar to those described previously (14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Mizoguchi Y. Monji A. Nabekura J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were decapitated under pentobarbital anesthesia. Brains were quickly removed and transversely sliced at a thickness of 370 μm (VT-1000; Leica; Nussloch; Germany). The slices were kept in the incubation medium saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at room temperature for at least 1 h. After 30 min of enzyme digestion, the slices were transferred into a 35-mm culture dish, and layer 5 of the visual cortex was identified under a binocular microscope (×20, SMZ-1; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A fire-polished glass pipette was touched lightly onto the surface of the region and was vibrated horizontally at 30–50 Hz for 3 min using an apparatus developed in our laboratory (29Rhee J.S. Ishibashi H. Akaike N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Kakazu Y. Uchida S. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Nabekura J. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Slices were removed from the dish, and dissociated pyramidal neurons with a large pyramidal-shaped soma, a prominent apical dendrite, and a skirt of basal dendrites (31Feldman M.L. Peters A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 179: 761-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 32Peters A. Kara D.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 234: 218-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) adhered to the bottom of the dish within 20 min (Fig. 3A). Electrical measurements were performed using the nystatin-perforated patch recording method (14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Mizoguchi Y. Monji A. Nabekura J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Nabekura J. Omura T. Akaike N. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All recordings were performed using voltage clamp at a holding potential of –50 mV, using patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7; List Biologic, Campbell, CA). Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate capillary glass tubes (G-1.5; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) in two stages on a vertical pipette puller (PB-7; Narishige). The resistance between the patch pipette filled with the internal solution and the reference electrode in the normal external solution was 4–6 megaohms. Neurons were visualized with phase-contrast equipment on an inverted microscope (Diaphoto; Nikon). Current and voltage were continuously monitored on an oscilloscope (VC-6725; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and a pen recorder (Recti-Horiz-8K; Sanei, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded on a digital-audio tape recorder (RD-120TE; TEAC). Membrane currents were filtered at 1 kHz (E-3201A Decade Filter; NF Electronic Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), and data were digitized at 4 kHz. For mIPSCs recording, the extracellular solution was supplemented with 6-cyano-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 μm) and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (20 μm). The mIPSCs were completely blocked by the competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (10 μm; data not shown). mIPSCs were detected and analyzed using MiniAnalysis program (Synaptosoft, NJ). All experiments were performed at room temperature (27 ± 1 °C). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 being considered significantly different. Solutions and Drugs—The ionic composition of the internal (patch pipette) solution was 40 mm methanesulphonic acid potassium salt, 110 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES. The pH of internal solution was adjusted to 7.2 with Tris-OH. Nystatin (Sigma) was dissolved in acidified methanol at 10 mg ml–1. This stock solution was diluted with internal pipette solution just before use to a final concentration of 100–200 μgml–1. The ionic composition of the incubation medium was 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose. Following equilibration with 95% O2, 5% CO2, the pH was 7.4. The ionic composition of the external standard solution was 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH of the external standard solution was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris-OH. Drug solutions were applied, using the Y-tube perfusion system, allowing rapid exchange of the solution surrounding a cell within 20 ms (34Murase K. Randic M. Shirasaki T. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Brain Res. 1990; 525: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35Kakazu Y. Akaike N. Komiyama S. Nabekura J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nabekura J. Ueno T. Okabe A. Furuta A. Iwaki T. Okabe C.S. Fukuda A. Akaike N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The drugs used in the present study included GABA, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, 6-cyano-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, bicuculline, diazepam, muscimol, and BAPTA-AM (Sigma), TTX (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), K252a, U73122, and KN-62 (Calbiochem). Drugs that are insoluble in water were first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and then diluted in the external solution. The final concentration of Me2SO was always less than 0.1% and did not affect neuronal responses observed in the present study. Human recombinant BDNF (Sigma) was dissolved (100 μg ml–1) in phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and stored below –20 °C. Before the experiment, this stock solution was diluted with external solution to obtain the final concentration (5 or 20 ng ml–1). A Rapid Increase in the Total Number of Cell Surface GABAA Receptors Induced by BDNF in Rat Visual Cortex—We examined the expression of cell surface GABAA receptor α/β subunits of BDNF-(20 ng ml–1) treated and -untreated cells in visual cortex of P14 rats, by measuring the binding of the hydrophilic GABAA receptor competitive antagonist [3H]SR-95531. The hydrophilic nature of [3H]SR-95531 restricts its binding to GABAA receptors on the cell surface (37Bourguignon J.J. Schlewer G. Mclikian A. Chantreaux D. Molimard J.C. Heaulme M. Chambon J.P. Biziere K. Wermuth C.G. Pharmacologist. 1985; 27: 518Google Scholar, 38Alicke B. Schwartz-Bloom R.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2808-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine whether BDNF modulates the cell surface GABAA receptor number or its affinity or both, total specific [3H]SR-95531 radioligand binding activity expressed by visual cortical cells was determined by Scatchard analysis. In 20 ng/ml BDNF-treated cells, total binding (maximal binding capacity, B max) was increased by 2.25-fold as compared with the BDNF-untreated control cells (n = 4 rats), whereas the dissociation constant (Kd) remained unchanged (n = 4; p > 0.05, Fig. 1). The values are summarized in Fig. 1B, and a representative Scatchard plot is shown in Fig. 1A. This result suggests that BDNF induced a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors in rat visual cortex, without effects on the receptor affinity. BDNF specifically binds to Trk B, a neurotrophin receptor, which contains a catalytic domain of tyrosine kinase (39Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The specific binding of 20 nm [3H]SR-95531 to BDNF-treated cells was significantly increased as compared with the control cells, by 72.6 ± 5.6% (n = 4 rats; p < 0.005). On the other hand, the inclusion of 200 nm K252a, a membrane-permeant inhibitor of Trk receptor tyrosine kinases (40Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1992; 2: 371-381Google Scholar, 41Knussel B. Hefti F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to the BDNF-treated cells, blocked the elevation of [3H]SR-95531 binding (by 6.2 ± 2.4%, n = 4, Fig. 2). All together, these results suggest that BDNF induced a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors in rat visual cortex, through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases. Rapid Potentiation of GABAA Responses Induced by BDNF in Rat Visual Cortical Pyramidal Neurons—We next tested whether BDNF rapidly potentiates GABAA responses in pyramidal neurons. Fresh pyramidal neurons were dissociated from layer 5 of the visual cortex isolated from P14 rats (Fig. 3A). Voltage clamp recordings were obtained at a holding potential of –50 mV using nystatin-perforated patch clamp recordings, which preserves Ca2+ and other soluble intracellular constituents intact. The application of 10 μm GABA or muscimol, using the Y-tube perfusion system, to these neurons induced a GABAA receptor-mediated inward current (Fig. 3B, control), which was completely blocked by 10 μm bicuculline (n = 3, data not shown). In the presence of BDNF (5 ng ml–1), this GABAA response was potentiated in every neuron tested (by 71.6 ± 20.0%, n = 12; Fig. 3B), within 5 min of BDNF application, and in the longest recordings obtained, persisted more than 60 min after BDNF washout (Fig. 3C). A higher BDNF concentration (20 ng ml–1) caused an even more marked potentiation (by 154.3 ± 26.6%, n = 12). These results show that BDNF rapidly induces a sustained potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents in rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons. Intracellular Regulatory Pathway Involved in the Potentiating Effect of BDNF on GABAA Responses—In the presence of K252a (200 nm), BDNF (20 ng ml–1) failed to potentiate the GABAA responses in visual cortical pyramidal neurons (n = 5; Fig. 4, A and B). K252a (200 nm), by itself, had no effect on the control GABAA responses (n = 5). Thus, BDNF potentiated GABAA responses through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition to causing tyrosine kinase activity, the binding of BDNF to the Trk B receptor activates many intracellular signaling pathways, including the PLC-γ pathway, leading to generation of inositol trisphosphate and the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (42Widmer H.R. Kaplan D.R. Rabin S.J. Beck K.D. Hefti F. Knüsel D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2111-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 43Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). BDNF stimulates PLC-γ1 phosphorylation within 20 s (42Widmer H.R. Kaplan D.R. Rabin S.J. Beck K.D. Hefti F. Knüsel D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2111-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and elevates intracellular Ca2+ levels within 1–2 min (44Berninger B. Garcia D.E. Inagaki N. Hahnel C. Lindoholm D. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 45Mizoguchi Y. Nabekura J. NeuroReport. 2003; 14: 1481-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the presence of 150 μm BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator, BDNF (20 ng ml–1) failed to potentiate the GABAA responses (n = 5; Fig. 4C). In the presence of U73122 (5 μm), a membrane-permeant PLC-γ inhibitor (46Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), again BDNF (20 ng ml–1), failed to potentiate the GABAA responses (n = 5; Fig. 4C). In mouse cortical (5Aguayo L.G. Espinoza F. Kunos G. Satin L.S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), rat cerebellar Purkinje (4Kano M. Kano M. Fukunaga K. Konnerth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13351-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and immature rat hippocampal neurons (14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), an increase in intracellular Ca2+ enhances postsynaptic GABAA responses via an activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK-2). In the presence of KN-62 (5 μm), a membrane-permeant specific CaMK-2 inhibitor (48Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-432050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BDNF (20 ng ml–1), potentiated the GABAA responses. These results suggest that BDNF potentiated GABAA responses through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase and PLC-γ. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ was important for the potentiation of GABAA responses induced by BDNF. In contrast, CaMK-2 was not involved in the sustained potentiation of GABAA responses induced by BDNF in rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons. The application of K252a (200 nm) did not affect the GABAA responses potentiated by BDNF (20 ng ml–1) (n = 3; Fig. 5A). In addition, either U73122 (5 μm) or BAPTA-AM (150 μm) failed to suppress the GABAA responses potentiated by BDNF (Fig. 5B). Potentiation of mIPSCs by BDNF in Rat Visual Cortical Pyramidal Neurons—We next recorded mIPSCs in rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons at P14 to examine whether BDNF could also potentiate the response of GABAA receptors to released GABA in the synaptic cleft. We used an enzyme-free dissociation procedure so as to preserve functional presynaptic boutons adherent to the isolated neurons (49Akaike N. Moorhouse A.J. Trends Pharmacol.

BDNF (20 ng ml–1) caused a significant increase, of approximately 78%, in the mean amplitude of mIPSCs (from –19.3 ± 2.2 pA to –34.3 ± 2.7 pA, p < 0.001, n = 5). BDNF increased mIPSC amplitude without affecting the mIPSC frequency (67.3 ± 2.3 events/3 min in control conditions and 68.0 ± 2.1 events/3 min during BDNF application, p > 0.1, n = 5). Fig. 6, A and B, show representative currents and corresponding amplitude histograms from one of these neurons. Thus, BDNF potentiates the GABAA receptor responses to both exogenously applied and released GABA in the synaptic cleft in rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons. We compared the actions of BDNF on mIPSCs with a well established GABAA receptor modulator, the benzodiazepine, diazepam. Diazepam (1 μm), which increased the affinity of GABAA receptors (50Rogers C.J. Twyman R.E. Macdonald R.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 69-82Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar), prolonged the mIPSCs decay without markedly affecting peak amplitude (n = 5; Table I and Fig. 6C). In contrast, BDNF caused a significant increase in mean mIPSC amplitude and no change in either the mIPSC rise time or the decay time constant (n = 5). If GABA released from a single vesicle is sufficient to nearly saturate the cluster of postsynaptic GABAA receptors in our experimental condition, then one possible reason for the increase in mIPSC amplitude is that BDNF induces a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors in rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons.Table IEffect of BDNF or diazepam on mIPSCsControl+Diazepam+BDNFAmplitude (pA)-19.3 ± 2.2-19.8 ± 1.1-34.3 ± 2.7ap < 0.001; t-test.Rise time (ms)4.25 ± 0.234.16 ± 0.344.13 ± 0.22Decay time (ms)51.5 ± 4.190.7 ± 5.1bp < 0.005.52.3 ± 5.1a p < 0.001; t-test.b p < 0.005. Open table in a new tab The present experiments demonstrated that BDNF induced a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors in visual cortex of P14 rats, through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases. In visual cortical pyramidal neurons isolated from P14 rats, BDNF rapidly induced a sustained potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents. The potentiation was caused by the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase and PLC-γ. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ was important for the potentiation of GABAA responses by BDNF. The selective increase in mean mIPSC amplitude without effects on mIPSC time courses supports the idea that BDNF rapidly induces an increase in the total number of cell surface functional GABAA receptors in visual cortical pyramidal neurons. In the binding assays, we used visual cortical cells as preparations, which include not only pyramidal neurons but also interneurons or glial cells. A rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors induced by BDNF that we observed might not simply reflect the BDNF effect on pyramidal neurons. In hippocampus at P6, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK-2) plays important roles in the reversible potentiation of postsynaptic GABAA responses by BDNF (14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In visual cortical pyramidal neurons isolated from P14 rats, CaMK-2 was not involved in the sustained potentiation of GABAA responses induced by BDNF (Fig. 4D). Thus, different intracellular regulatory pathways seem to underlie the potentiating effect of BDNF on GABAA responses in hippocampus of P6 rat and visual cortex at P14. In rat hippocampus at P14, BDNF acutely inhibits postsynaptic GABAA responses by elevating postsynaptic Ca2+ levels via the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase and PLC-γ (13Tanaka T. Saito H. Matsuki N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2959-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mizoguchi Y. Ishibashi H. Nabekura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 703-709Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar transduction mechanism seems to underlie the potentiating effect of BDNF on GABAA responses observed in isolated visual cortical pyramidal neurons. However, the activation of the Trk B-PLC γ pathway was not important for the maintenance of the sustained potentiation of GABAA responses induced by BDNF (Fig. 5). This also supports the idea that BDNF increases the total number of functional GABAA receptors in visual cortical pyramidal neurons. In cultured hippocampal (15Brünig I. Penschuck S. Berninger B. Benson J. Fritschy J.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cerebellar granule (16Cheng Q. Yeh H.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 711-721Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) cells, BDNF induces a rapid down-regulation of cell surface GABAA receptors. We proposed an opposite effect of BDNF in visual cortex, i.e. a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors. Thus, in the CNS, BDNF may rapidly increase or decrease the cell surface expression of GABAA receptors through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases in a region-specific manner. In our experimental conditions, GABA released from a single vesicle is likely to be sufficient to saturate the cluster of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, as reported at other central nervous system synapses (51Otis T.S. Koninck Y.D. Mody I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7698-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 52Keller A.F. Coull J.A.M. Chery N. Poisbeau P. De Koninck Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7871-7880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the degree of receptor occupancy and the use of benzodiazepines for determining postsynaptic GABAA receptor occupancy remain controversial. In layer 5 pyramidal neurons of visual cortex, GABAA receptors were not shown to be saturated by the synaptically released GABA (53Perrais D. Ropert N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 578-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Hájos N. Nusser Z. Rancz E.A. Freund T.F. Mody I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but in layers 2 and 3, GABAA receptors were fully occupied (54Hájos N. Nusser Z. Rancz E.A. Freund T.F. Mody I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Zolpidem, a benzodiazepine, enhances the amplitudes of mIPSCs if applied at room temperature (22–25 °C) but not at physiological temperature (35 °C), suggesting that zolpidem cannot be used as a tool to determine the GABAA receptor occupancy at physiological temperature (53Perrais D. Ropert N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 578-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The variation in the GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft underlies the amplitude variability of postsynaptic responses (55Frerking M. Borges S. Wilson M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 885-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). There might be differences in the GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft between our experimental conditions and those in previous reports. BDNF induced a rapid increase in the total number of cell surface GABAA receptors in visual cortex of P14 rats, through the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinases. In visual cortical pyramidal neurons isolated from P14 rats, BDNF rapidly induced a sustained potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents. The potentiation was caused by the activation of Trk B receptor tyrosine kinase and PLC-γ. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ was important for the potentiation of GABAA responses induced by BDNF. The selective increase in mean mIPSC amplitude without effects on mIPSC time courses supports the idea that BDNF rapidly induces an increase in the total number of cell surface functional GABAA receptors in visual cortical pyramidal neurons."

A series of apoB COOH-terminal truncation mutants, spanning a range from apoB34 (amino acid residues 1–1544 of apoB100) to apoB19 (residues 1–862) were transfected into COS cells with and without coexpression of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). ApoB34, -25, -23, -21, -20.5, and -20.1 underwent efficient conversion to buoyant lipoproteins when coexpressed with MTP. ApoB19.5 (amino acids 1–884) also directed MTP-dependent particle assembly, although at reduced efficiency. When apoB19.5 was truncated by another 22 amino acids to form apoB19, MTP-dependent lipoprotein assembly was abolished. Analysis of the lipid stoichiometry of secreted lipoproteins revealed that all apoB truncation mutants formed spherical particles containing a hydrophobic core. Even highly truncated assembly-competent forms of apoB, such as apoB19.5 and 20.1, formed lipoproteins with surface:core lipid ratios of <1. We conclude that the translation of the first ∼884 amino acids of apoB completes a domain capable of initiating nascent lipoprotein assembly. The composition of lipids recruited into lipoproteins by this initiating domain is consistent with formation of small emulsion particles, perhaps by simultaneous desorption of both polar and neutral lipids from a saturated bilayer.

One of the most commonly cited mechanisms of assembly involves intercalation of apoB into the inner leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it nucleates triglyceride (TG) droplet formation within the bilayer; the apoB-associated droplet ultimately buds from the inner leaflet of the bilayer into the ER lumen as a lipoprotein emulsion particle (6Schumaker V.N.

The LV monomer contains a funnel-shaped hydrophobic lipid-binding cavity, formed by a series of amphipathic antiparallel β sheets that can accommodate the acyl chains of a phospholipid bilayer, which in turn can solubilize a small lens of TG (10Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 895-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The LV component of the Xenopus laevis yolk system contains ∼37 molecules of phospholipid (PL) and ∼13 molecules of TG (11Ohlendorf D.H. Barbarsh G.R. Trout A. Kent C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7992-8001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Identification of the minimum size apoB translation product competent to direct particle assembly, as well as analysis of the number and types of lipids that are acquired during the initiation phase of assembly, could help elucidate the mechanism by which apoB directs this process. Previous studies with truncated forms of apoB suggest that the first ∼22–28% of the protein must be translated to achieve nascent lipoprotein assembly (8Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J.

However, no systematic attempt has been made to exactly map the structural boundary in apoB required to initiate lipoprotein assembly, nor has the lipid composition of particles assembled by such a truncation mutant been examined. In the present report we used fine truncation mapping to identify the initiating domain of apoB. We found that a narrow, ∼50-amino acid interval (amino acids 862–912), specifies the transition of apoB from a form that is only secreted as a polypeptide to a form competent to initiate lipoprotein assembly. Analysis of the lipid composition of particles formed by apoB mutants containing this domain suggests that simultaneous acquisition of both surface and core lipid components defines the mechanism by which apoB directs the early stage of very low density lipoprotein and chylomicron assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of His6-tagged ApoB Truncation Mutants—ApoB truncation mutants containing COOH-terminal His6 tags were generated by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (14Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid coordinates of each truncation mutant are summarized in Fig. 1. All constructs were cloned into the expression vector, pCMV5 (15Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing.Transfection of COS-1 Cells and Analysis of ApoB Secretion—COS-1 cells were cultured as described (16Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected with the indicated apoB construct and either MTP large subunit (–MTP) or truncated human placental alkaline phosphatase (–MTP) at a mass ratio of 2:1 (6 μg of total DNA) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) (14Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were metabolically radiolabeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (EasyTag Express protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Met/Cys-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) for 3 h. To examine secretion efficiency of selected constructs, COS-1 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected with 15 μg of apoB and MTP plasmids at the mass ratio described above. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated in 35-mm dishes. Twenty-four h after plating, cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 10 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys and chased with media containing an excess of cold amino acids for either 0 or 3 h (17Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB protein from media and cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-apoB antibody (Roche Applied Science or Academy Biomedical, Houston, TX) and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (16Shelness G.S.

Dried gels were exposed to Bio-Max MS film in combination with a Bio-Max TranScreen-LE intensifying screen (Kodak) at –70 °C. Radioactive band intensities were quantified using a Amersham Biosciences 445 SI PhosphorImager.Flotation and Density Gradient Analysis of Lipoproteins—COS-1 cells were transfected with the specified apoB truncation mutants and radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 4 h. After addition of protease inhibitors, media was adjusted to a density of 1.25 g/ml KBr in a final volume of 3 ml and transferred to TLA100.3 polyallomer Quick-Seal tubes (Beckman). The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a TL-100 centrifuge for 18 h at 15 °C. The top 1- (d < 1.25 g/ml) and bottom 2-ml (d > 1.25 g/ml) fractions were recovered by tube slicing. ApoB was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Density values for the truncated apoB mutants were obtained by transfecting two, 150-mm dishes of COS-1 cells with the indicated apoB construct and MTP, as described above. Media were pooled, concentrated, and the d < 1.25 g/ml lipoprotein fraction was obtained. The density of lipoproteins formed by the truncated apoB proteins was determined by isopycnic gradient centrifugation (18Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Metabolic Radiolabeling of ApoB and Associated Lipids and Purification of Lipoprotein Particles—COS-1 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected, as described above, with MTP or alkaline phosphatase. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in Met/Cys-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Labeling was performed in media composed of four parts serum-free Met/Cys-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, one part serum-free complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 10 μCi/ml [3H]oleate, and 20 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys. The media from two dishes was combined and protease inhibitors were added (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and a 0.75-ml bed volume of nickel-nitrilotriacetic (NTA)-agarose resin (Qiagen) was added followed by incubation with slow inversion for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The slurry was applied to a 15-ml disposable polypropylene column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed 4 times with 10 ml of column buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 5 mm imidazole, followed by four, 10-ml washes with column buffer lacking imidazole. The apoB was eluted from the column with 0.75 ml of column buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The elution step was repeated three times and the eluates were pooled and buffer exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugal dialysis (Centricon 30, Millipore). Affinity purified material was adjusted to 1.25 g/ml of KBr and centrifuged in a TL100.3 rotor, as described above, to obtain a d < 1.25 g/ml lipoprotein fraction. Lipoprotein fractions were exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugal dialysis.Lipid Composition of Affinity Purified Lipoproteins—Lipids were extracted from affinity purified lipoproteins by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). Samples were adjusted to 0.5 ml with phosphate-buffered saline and 1.88 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2), 10 μl of a mixture of 5 mg/ml egg yolk lecithin, triolein, dioleoyl glycerol, and cholesteryl oleate (in chloroform) and 0.626 ml of chloroform was added, followed by vortexing. Samples were acidified with 0.626 ml of 0.05% sulfuric acid and vortexed again. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, the upper phases were removed by aspiration. The lower phases were dried at 45 °C under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform, and applied to a polyester-backed silica gel TLC plate (PE SIL G, Whatman). Plates were first developed with chloroform: methanol:acetic acid:water (65:45:12:6) by running the solvent front ∼⅓ up the length of the plate, then air-dried and finally developed with hexane:ether:acetic acid (80:20:1). Lipid standards were visualized by incubation in iodine vapor and areas containing phosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, and cholesteryl ester were cut and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments, in which the entire length of the TLC plate was cut and counted, revealed that these were the only radiolabeled lipid species present above background. Radiolabeled lipid composition values were converted to particle composition, using the constants and computational techniques described Carraway et al. (20Carraway M. Herscovitz H. Zannis V. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9737-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of the Initiating Domain of ApoB—A series of COOH-terminal His6-tagged truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 1) and expressed in COS cells with and without cotransfection of the 97-kDa MTP subunit. With the exception of apoB34, all tested apoB truncation mutants were secreted into media similarly with and without MTP coexpression (Fig. 2). However, density gradient analyses revealed that, in the absence of MTP coexpression, none of the apoB constructs were lipidated, as they were either absent from media (apoB34) or recovered exclusively in the d > 1.25 g/ml lipid-poor bottom (B) fraction (Fig. 3). Cotransfection with MTP converted apoB34 to a secreted form that floated in the d < 1.25 g/ml top (T) fraction (lane 31). About 30–50% of apoB20.1, -20.5, -21, -23, and -25 was recovered from media as buoyant lipoproteins when coexpressed with MTP (e.g. for apoB23 compare lanes 21 and 22 to 23 and 24). Based on these data, it appears that the MTP responsiveness of apoB secretion is lost upon truncation to apoB25 (Fig. 2). However, when lipoprotein formation was considered independently of apoB secretion (Fig. 3), a robust response to MTP was observed for forms of apoB as small as apoB20.1. ApoB19.5 also underwent MTP-dependent conversion to a lipoprotein form, although with reduced efficiency. Further truncation of apoB19.5 by 22 amino acids to form apoB19 completely abolished lipoprotein particle assembly (Fig. 3, lane 3).Fig. 2MTP-independent secretion of apoB truncation mutants. COS cells were transfected with the indicated apoB truncation mutant without (–) or with (+) MTP coexpression.

Metabolic radiolabeling analysis in transfected COS cells revealed that ∼20–25% of newly synthesized apoB20.1, -20.5, and -25 (10-min pulse) was secreted during a 3-h chase (Fig. 4). Although the secretion efficiencies of the exact sized constructs used in the present study have not been examined elsewhere, Yao et al. (12Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G.

Hence, the secretion efficiency in COS cells of constructs terminating near the initiating boundary of the apoB are similar to those observed previously in a hepatoma-derived cell line.Fig. 4Secretion efficiency of apoB truncation mutants. COS cells cotransfected with MTP and the indicated truncation mutants were subjected to metabolic pulse-chase analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each bar represents the mean percentage of newly synthesized radiolabeled protein (10-min pulse) secreted into media during a 3-h chase ± S.D.

As shown in Fig. 5, each form of apoB gave rise to a relatively discreet particle population that was recovered in 2–3 density fractions. As expected, the peak densities were inversely proportional to the length of the translation product. Furthermore, the density of apoB25 and -34 was similar to that observed in transfected hepatoma cells (12Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol.

Even as the truncations approached the region where lipoprotein assembly is abolished, a homogenous set of particles was produced, suggesting that each construct underwent specific biosynthetic processing to yield a captured static intermediate in the lipoprotein assembly pathway. Although we observed a small amount of apoB19.5 that floated at d < 1.25 g/ml when coexpressed with MTP (Fig. 2), we were unable to recover a sufficient amount to perform density gradient analysis. However, based on the trend observed for the other constructs, we assume that its density is at or just below 1.25 g/ml.Fig. 5Truncation mutants form lipoprotein particles with discrete densities. The indicated apoB truncation mutants and MTP were cotransfected into COS cells and radiolabeled for 3 h with [35S]Met/Cys. The apoB was isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography and the lipoproteins were floated at d < 1.25 g/ml as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The top 1 ml was isolated from each tube and subjected to isopycnic gradient centrifugation (18Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Twelve, 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of each tube and their densities were determined gravitometrically. Samples were then concentrated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Lipids Associated with Truncated Forms of ApoB—The TLC profiles of [3H]oleate-radiolabeled lipids associated with apoB34, -28.8, -25, -20.5, -20.1, and -19.5 are shown in Fig. 6. Of particular note is that use of COS cells with and without MTP cotransfection allows each construct to serve as its own control. In the absence of MTP coexpression, apoB constructs were associated with only trace amounts of lipid (open circles); however, cotransfection with MTP gave rise to reproducible compositional profiles that reflect the relative amounts and types of lipids associated with each protein. Initial inspection of the lipid profiles for each construct indicates that TG is the predominant lipid, and that even apoB19.5 fails to form a phospholipid-rich lipoprotein. For apoB20.1, -20.5, -25, -28.8, and -34, peak TG disintegrations/min ranged from ∼50,000 to ∼190,000, whereas phosphatidylcholine disintegrations/min ranged only from ∼30,000 to 70,000. Although the apoB19.5 values were much lower (phosphatidylcholine peak of ∼800 disintegrations/min and TG peak of ∼1,200 disintegrations/min), the values were clearly above the background control and the duplicate determinations were virtually identical. As the total purified apoB-containing lipoprotein fraction was analyzed for lipid content, the absolute value of lipid recovered from the TLC plates reflects the total number of lipid molecules recruited by each form of apoB, the relative abundance of lipids within the particle, and the different levels of apoB expresson. As only the relative composition of lipids associated with each particle is relevant for the current analyses (20Carraway M. Herscovitz H. Zannis V. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9737-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the lipid values were not adjusted for apoB content.Fig. 6Compositional profiles of apoB truncation mutants. COS-1 cells were transfected with the designated apoB constructs without MTP (open circles) or with MTP (black squares), and then radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys and [3H]oleate for 24 h. ApoB was affinity purified by Ni-NTA binding, and the lipoprotein particles were separated by centrifugation at d = 1.25 g/ml as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The top 1 ml was isolated by tube slicing, concentrated, and the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to TLC to separate the lipid species, and the radioactivity in corresponding regions of the TLC plate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), diglyceride (DG), TG, and cholesteryl ester (CE) are represented in fractions 2, 5, 7, and 8, respectively. Data points represent the average of duplicate experiments. Error bars, where visible, depict the positive data range. The radioactivity recovered in the four lipid classes associated with each purified apoB-containing lipoprotein was used to calculate the percent radiolabeled lipid composition (Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several criteria suggest that the lipids associated with each form of apoB reflect the composition of their respective lipoprotein particles as they emerge from the cell. First, none of the truncated apoB constructs expressed without MTP were capable of associating with sufficient lipid to form a buoyant particle (Fig. 3). Furthermore, when apoB20.5-containing lipoprotein particles generated from unlabeled cells were added to conditioned media containing [3H]oleate-radiolabeled apoB20.5, no radioactive lipid exchange was observed (data not shown). Finally, apoB20.5 particles added to COS cells undergoing radiolabeling with [3H]oleate for 24 h did not acquire more than background radiolabeled lipid (data not shown). Hence, we conclude that the lipids associated with each form of apoB analyzed in Fig. 6 are a reflection of intracellular processing events.Utilizing the density of the secreted lipoproteins and their relative lipid:mass ratios, the number of lipid molecules per particle was calculated using the computational methods described by Carraway et al. (20Carraway M. Herscovitz H. Zannis V. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9737-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For all particles analyzed, phosphatidylcholine and TG were the predominant lipid species (Table I). Furthermore, in all of the particles, the number of surface lipids never exceeded core lipids, even for apoB19.5. Particle size and total volume increased proportionally with apoB length (Table II); however, the fractional volume occupied by the hydrophobic core lipids rose sharply between apoB19.5 and apoB20.5 (Fig. 7).Table IRadioactive lipid composition of lipoproteins secreted lipoproteinsB19.5B20.1B20.5B25B28.8B34Percent radiolabeled lipidsPL37.032.034.724.829.718.8Diacylglycerol7.44.74.45.85.35.7TG52.362.057.367.462.866.9Cholesteryl ester3.31.43.61.92.28.7Lipid molecules per particlePL201929304436Diacylglycerol54591014TG2635457485118Cholesteryl ester2143420Surface and core lipid stoichiometrySurfaceaPL + diglycerol.

Human meprin (N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid hydrolase, PPH, EC 3.4.24.18) a zinc-metalloendopeptidase of the astacin family is an oligomeric protein complex of α- and β-subunits and is expressed abundantly in the intestine and kidney as well as in leukocytes of the lamina propria and in cancer cells. In transfected cells intracellular proteolytic removal of the membrane anchor results in the secretion of the meprin α-subunit. In rats and mice, the β-subunit exists in a membrane-anchored form. In contrast, human meprinβ is constitutively converted into a secretable form. We now show that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates an increased release of hmeprinβ from transfected COS-1 cells, whereas hmeprinα secretion is not influenced. This stimulatory effect is inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting that activation of PKC mediates PMA-induced hmeprinβ shedding. The use of different protease inhibitors shows that two different metalloprotease activities are responsible for the constitutive and the PMA-stimulated hmeprinβ shedding. We identified tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM17) as the protease that mediates the PMA-induced release. We also demonstrate that hmeprinβ is phosphorylated by PMA treatment on Ser687 within a PKC consensus sequence in the cytosolic domain of the protein.

The cleaved α-subunit is constitutively secreted into the medium when expressed alone and is largely retained at the cell surface in the presence of the β-subunit. Whereas mouse meprinβ is localized only at the cell surface (5Gorbea C.M. Marchand P. Jiang W. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that the soluble form of hmeprinβ is released from transfected cells by cleavage in front of the epidermal growth factor-like domain.

In contrast to the α-subunit and the homologous mouse meprinβ subunit, human meprinβ has potential regulatory elements in the cytosolic domain including two phosphorylation sites (Ser687 and Ser688) in PKC consensus sequences (18Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 920-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 43Liu J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We have now analyzed the regulation of hmeprinβ secretion. Our results provide evidence that hmeprinβ cleavage at the cell surface can be markedly enhanced by PMA via the PKC pathway and that the constitutive and inducible release is mediated by two different metalloprotease activities. Furthermore, we provide evidence that tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM) is the sheddase responsible for the PMA-induced hmeprinβ release. We also find that PMA induces phosphorylation of hmeprinβ and we have identified Ser687 as the main phosphorylation site. This phosphorylation step is not directly involved in the PMA-induced shedding of hmeprinβ. It does, however, provide the potential for a coupling between signaling pathways and meprin activity. The potential of regulated shedding of hmeprinβ in contrast to the constitutive secretion of hmeprinα from the cell surface suggests different biological roles for the two meprin subunits in man.

Two PCR rounds were performed with the following primers (Ser687 mutant): upper primer, 5′-AGCGTATGTCCAATCAGC-3′; PPHβArgL, 5′-TGGTCGATTTGATCTCATCCTTTCACG-3′; and PPHβArgU, 5′-TCGTGAAAGGATGAGATCAAATCGACC-3′; lower primer: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG-3′. In a second round these two PCR products were combined and amplified using the upper and lower primer. Finally the mutated fragment was cut with StuI and NotI and ligated back into the corresponding sites of pPPHβ. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The Ser688 mutation and the Ser687-Ser688 mutation were indentically done with the following primers: PHβAlaL, 5′-TGGTCGATTTGCGCTCATCCTTTCACG-3′ and PPHβAlaU, 5′-GAAAGGATGAGCGCAAATCGACC-3′ and PPHβArg/AlaL, 5′-TGGTCGATTTGCTCTCATCCTTTCACG-3′ and PPHβArg/AlaU, 5′-TCGTGAAAGGATGAGAGCAAATCGACC-3′. Western Blot Analysis—COS-1 cells transfected with hmeprinβ were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 30 min before analyzing the effects of potential protease inhibitors on hmeprinβ shedding. After incubation of cells for 6 h in the presence of the inhibitors, the media and cells were collected. The cells were lysed in 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 in homogenization buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) containing complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). Aliquots of the media and cells were removed and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked in TBST containing 5% blocking agent NIF833 (Amersham Biosciences), followed by incubation with hmeprinβ antibody raised against its intervening region in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. After four washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:30000) in blocking solution. The ECL plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the guidelines to detect horseradish peroxidase activity. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 6-cm dishes 24 h before transfection with DEAE-dextran (45Kimmel A.R. Berger S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture (1 μg of recombinant DNA dissolved in 50 μl of DEAE-dextran stock solution (10 mg/ml H2O) and 950 μl of NaCl/Pi was added to previously washed COS-1 cells. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before adding 4 ml of the complete culture medium containing 100 μm chloroquine and subsequent incubation for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with medium containing 10% (v/v) Me2SO followed by a 2.5-min incubation at 37 °C. Cells were grown in complete medium for 2 days before labeling. TACE(–/–) cells kindly provided by R. Black (Immunex) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 without sucrose, supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were transfected with LipofectAMINE exactly as described by the supplier. Metabolic Labeling of COS-1 and TACE(–/–) Cells—Cells were washed twice with NaCl/Pi, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in methionine-free medium, and labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice with methionine-free medium, incubation was done for the indicated times with chase medium (complete medium with 10 mm l-methionine). Cells were harvested and the medium was collected and filtered (0.2 μm) before immunoprecipitation. In experiments where PMA and/or the kinase inhibitor staurosporine were applied, labeled cells were treated for 30 min in chase medium containing 10 ng/ml PMA (100 ng/ml PMA in the case of TACE(–/–) cells, respectively) alone or together with staurosporine (20 nm), followed by the indicated chase times. In untreated cells addition of Me2SO served as control. Labeling with [32P]phosphate was done after starving the cells for 2 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free medium before addition of 0.4 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for another 3 h in the presence of 10 ng/ml PMA. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE—Immunoprecipitation was conducted as described previously (18Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 920-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In [32P]phosphate-labeled cells, lysis was performed in the presence of 10 mm NaF, 20 nm calyculin, and 1 mm Na3VO4 to inhibit phosphatases, followed by centrifugation in a Microspin column P-30 (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated nucleotides before immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Electrophoresis, fixation, and fluorography were carried out as described before (19Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glycosidase Treatments—After immunoprecipitation the samples were treated with endoglycosidase H essentially as described before (18Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 920-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and prepared for electrophoresis. For N-glycosidase F and combined O-glycosidase/neuraminidase/N-glycosidase F treatment the immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled in 25 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% SDS. The samples were diluted in 100 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm EDTA and divided into equal aliquots. N-Glycans were digested by treatment with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F for 24 h at 37 °C. Combined digestion of O-linked oligosaccharides and N-glycans was obtained by treatment with 2 units of neuraminidase, 2.5 units of O-glycosidase, and 1 unit of N-glycosidase F for 24 h at 37 °C. Densitometric Measurements and Molecular Weight Determination— Densitometric measurements were carried out with Lumi Analyst version 3.0 from Roche. Fluorographic signals were scanned densitometrically with the Lumi Imager F1 from Roche using Roche's Lumi Analyst software version 3.0. Total protein amount (100%) was calculated by adding hmeprin signal from cell extracts and corresponding media. Up-regulation of Hmeprinβ Shedding by PMA—Expression and secretion of hmeprinα and -β were analyzed in transfected COS-1 cells using a pulse-chase protocol (Fig. 1,Fig. 1). The cell-associated fraction of hmeprinα consisted of two bands with apparent molecular masses of 100 and 90 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1–6). The 100-kDa band represents the uncleaved, and the 90-kDa band the cleaved form of hmeprinα as demonstrated previously (14Grünberg J. Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 46Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Grünberg J. Jiang W. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A 95-kDa form was detected in filtered medium after 1 h of chase (Fig. 1A, lane 7). Treatment with PMA had no effect on hmeprinα secretion (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 10) as demonstrated also by densitometric analysis of the fluorographic signals (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on secretion of human meprin. COS-1 cells, transiently transfected with hmeprinα (A and B) or hmeprinβ (C and D) were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 1 h, treated with (+) or without (–) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) for 30 min and chased in complete culture medium for the indicated times. Immunoprecipitated proteins were submitted to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorography. Representative fluorographs shown in A and C were densitometrically scanned (B and D). COS-1 cells incubated in the presence (▪) and absence (♦) of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml). The amount of immunoprecipitable medium forms was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Signals from cell extracts and the corresponding media were added and set as 100% of total protein before the distribution of the medium forms were calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In COS-1 cells expressing hmeprinβ the cell fraction consisted of two bands with apparent molecular masses of 105 and 95 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 1–6). Treatment with PMA resulted in an enhanced secretion of the major species of hmeprinβ of 95 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 10 and 12), which was matched by a corresponding decrease of cell-associated protein. PMA-induced stimulation of hmeprinβ secretion was verified by densitometric analysis (Fig. 1D). In untreated COS-1 cells most of the synthesized hmeprinβ remained associated with the cellular membrane and only a minor fraction was secreted. After 3 h of chase the amount of hmeprinβ secreted into the medium was ∼6.5-fold higher in PMA-treated cells compared with untreated cells Role of Metalloproteases in Secretion of Hmeprinβ—To characterize the enzymes responsible for constitutive and PMA-induced shedding of hmeprinβ, we have analyzed the effects of several protease inhibitors on the shedding of hmeprinβ in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2). The possibility of autocatalytic cleavage can be ruled out; in transfected cells hmeprinβ is expressed as a zymogen and therefore enzymatically inactive. Besides the general metalloprotease inhibitors EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, or dithiothreitol (data not shown) shedding was also inhibited by the MMP- and ADAM-targeting hydroxamate inhibitors RO111-3456 (a derivative of RO31-970), BB94, and TAPI (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). The natural tissue inhibitors of MMPs, TIMP1, TIMP2, and TIMP3 had no effect on hmeprinβ release (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). The activity of the TIMPs was ascertained in a MMP-2 control assay (data not shown). The inhibition of hmeprinβ shedding by RO111-3456, BB-94, and TAPI was accompanied by an accumulation of the mature cell-associated form of hmeprinβ (105 kDa) (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). These results practically exclude an involvement of MMPs in the constitutive shedding of hmeprinβ. The hydroxamate-type metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI (47Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar) also inhibited hmeprinβ release. To test a possible involvement of TACE in hmeprinβ shedding, TACE(–/–) cells were transfected with hmeprinβ cDNA. These transfected TACE(–/–) cells still secreted hmeprinβ (Fig. 2B, lane 1) but this secretion was unaffected by PMA treatment (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This and the inhibition of hmeprinβ secretion in TACE(–/–) cells by TAPI (Fig. 2B, lane 3) indicates that TACE function is required for PMA inducible shedding but not for the constitutive hmeprinβ shedding. The constitutive shedding is mediated by a yet unknown metalloprotease. In contrast to unstimulated conditions where TIMP3 had no effect on hmeprinβ release, the stimulatory effect of PMA in secretion of hmeprinβ was inhibited by TIMP3 (Fig. 2C, lane 4) (48Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Kocherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). As TIMP3 has also been shown to inhibit TACE, these data support the involvement of TACE in the PMA-induced shedding of hmeprinβ. PMA Treatment Does Not Affect the Ratio of Intracellular Cleavage of Human Meprinβ—To study the effect(s) of PMA treatment on proteolytic processing and secretion of the meprin β-subunit, pulse-chase experiments in the presence or absence of PMA followed by subsequent digestion with different endoglycosidases were carried out. The two 105- and 95-kDa forms were detected after a pulse of 1 h with [35S]methionine (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). The 95-kDa band was sensitive to Endo H treatment and shifted to 78 kDa (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that this was the high mannose form of hmeprinβ. The 105-kDa band was partially resistant to Endo H digestion and represents a complex glycosylated form of hmeprinβ that still contains some high-mannose glycans. After digestion with N-glycosidase F we observed three bands with molecular masses of 83, 78, and 70 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). These represent uncleaved and cleaved forms of hmeprinβ with differing glycosylation status. Complete deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F/neuraminidase/O-glycosidase yielded two forms at 78 and 68 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). The same molecular weight pattern was observed after PMA treatment of these cells. After3hof chase secreted hmeprinβ was detectable in the culture medium (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 10). This secreted form did not contain O-glycans as seen by the insensitivity to O-glycosidase digestion (Fig. 3B, lanes 15 and 16). To analyze the ratio of cleaved and uncle"

The translocase is signal-assembled, i.e. a receptor complex containing cpTatC and Hcf106 binds the precursor protein, and upon membrane energization, Tha4 is recruited to the precursor-receptor complex to effect translocation. We developed a two-step complementation assay to examine the implied central role of Tha4 in translocation. The first step results in the inactivation of endogenous Tha4 with specific antibodies. The second step involves integrating exogenous Tha4 and presenting the system with precursor protein. We verified this approach by confirming the results obtained recently with the Escherichia coli Tha4 ortholog TatA, i.e. that the carboxyl terminus is dispensable and the amphipathic helix essential for transport. We then investigated a conserved Tha4 transmembrane glutamate in detail.Substitution of glutamate 10 with alanine, glutamine, and even aspartate largely eliminated the ability of Tha4 to complement transport, whereas a conservative substitution elsewhere in the transmembrane domain was without effect. Chemical cross-linking assays showed that the mutated Tha4s failed to be recruited to the receptor complex under transport conditions, indicating a role for the transmembrane glutamate in translocase assembly. This assay promises an avenue into understanding the role of Tha4 in both the assembly and translocation steps of the Tat translocase.

The cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts possesses parallel systems for transporting soluble proteins across the bilayer, namely the Sec system and the Tat 1The abbreviations used are: Tat, twin arginine transport; PI, preimmune; IB, import buffer; DT17 or DT23, precursor form of the 17- or 23 kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II containing a modified, truncated transit peptide; mOE17 or mOE23, mature form of the 17- or 23-kDa subunits of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II, respectively; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: Tat, twin arginine transport; PI, preimmune; IB, import buffer; DT17 or DT23, precursor form of the 17- or 23 kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II containing a modified, truncated transit peptide; mOE17 or mOE23, mature form of the 17- or 23-kDa subunits of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II, respectively; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. system. Both systems employ hydrophobic signal peptides on the transported precursor proteins. However, Tat system signal peptides have consensus and essential twin arginine residues on the amino-flanking side of the hydrophobic core, hence the name Tat for twin arginine translocation. These two systems also differ in their components and mechanism of action. The Sec system minimally employs a SecY/E integral membrane complex that serves as a protein-conducting channel and SecA, an ATP-driven motor that “pushes” proteins in unfolded conformation through the channel (1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The Sec system has been classified as possessing a “signal- gated” translocase because precursor binding to the machinery opens the channel (see Ref. 2Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar for review). The Tat system appears to employ, minimally, three integral membrane protein components, Tha4, Hcf106, and cpTatC, in thylakoids and TatA, TatB, and TatC, respectively, in bacteria (3Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Importantly, Tat systems transport proteins in a folded conformation, require neither cis-soluble factors nor NTPs, and rely entirely on the ΔμH+ for transport (ΔpH in the case of thylakoids). Tat systems have been classified as possessing signal-assembled translocases (see Ref. 2Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar for review). The evidence for this is clearest in the thylakoid system. The three known components exist as subcomplexes in the membrane (5Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Precursors bind to a receptor complex consisting of cpTatC and Hcf106 (5Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Upon establishment of the pH gradient, Tha4 is recruited to the precursor-bound receptor complex forming the putative translocase, whereupon the precursor is transported to the lumen (6Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The translocase then dissociates into starting complexes. It is thought that such a mechanism allows the translocase to form-fit the translocating precursor and thereby allows a large protein to cross the membrane without permitting uncontrolled ion leakage. One model envisions that Tha4 (TatA) oligomerizes to form a flexible and dynamic channel through which the substrate passes. Indeed, in thylakoids Tha4 is present in 8-fold excess over both cpTatC and the estimated number of translocation sites (7Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli TatA (Tha4 ortholog) is present in 40-fold excess over TatC (8Sargent F. Gohlke U. De Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ability to introduce altered or tagged forms of Tha4 into the system would facilitate studies of the role of Tha4 in translocation. For example, it would permit the investigation of some interesting Tha4 signature motifs that may be important in recruitment or translocation steps. In addition, it would allow a functional comparison between the domains of Tha4 and Hcf106, which are very similar in structure and sequence. Hcf106 and Tha4 are each anchored to the membrane by amino-proximal transmembrane domains and expose predicted amphipathic helices and acidic carboxyl termini to the chloroplast stroma. Hcf106 and Tha4 have the highest sequence similarity in the amino proximal regions, especially in the transmembrane domain. A transmembrane proline (Pro)-glutamate (Glu) motif is conserved among all Hcf106 and Tha4 proteins, as is a glycine (Gly)-Pro motif between the transmembrane helix and the amphipathic helix (3Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity, Tha4 and Hcf106 appear to perform very different functions. Hcf106 participates in the first step of the reaction, precursor binding; Tha4 participates in later steps of the reaction that result in translocation. An assay that would simultaneously replace endogenous Tha4 and assay for steps of the transport reaction could yield considerable insight into the operation of the system. Our initial strategy for biochemical complementation of Tha4, using thylakoids isolated from maize tha4 null mutant plants, was to sequentially integrate Tha4 and then query the membrane for transport of a Tat pathway substrate. Initial results showed that biochemical complementation of Tha4 is feasible. 2V. Fincher, C. Dabney-Smith, and K. Cline, submitted for publication.2V. Fincher, C. Dabney-Smith, and K. Cline, submitted for publication. However, the limited availability of mutant thylakoids and a reduced capability of mutant membranes to generate and maintain a pH gradient prompted us to examine an alternative approach. Here we have developed an in vitro complementation assay with pea thylakoids that inactivates endogenous Tha4 with antibodies. Subsequent integration of in vitro translated Tha4 restores transport. To verify the validity of this approach, we examined Tha4 carboxyl-terminal truncations for activity. In agreement with findings from the E. coli Tat system (9Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we were able to show that the nonconserved carboxyl-terminal region is not required for function, whereas the amphipathic helix is essential. We further examined the necessity of the conserved transmembrane glutamate. Our results show that Tha4s, with a variety of substitutions, which include a charge-conserved aspartate and a structurally conserved glutamine, were unable to support transport. Moreover we showed that mutated proteins were unable to assemble with the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex to form the translocase. Thus, in addition to providing a rapid assay for substituting endogenous Tha4 with engineered Tha4, our results provide insights into the molecular basis for ΔpH-induced assembly of the thylakoid Tat translocase. Generation of cDNA mpsTha4 and Variants—Pea mTha4 and the mTha4E10Q variant in pGEM4Z under the control of the SP6 promoter were as described previously 2V. Fincher, C. Dabney-Smith, and K. Cline, submitted for publication. (10Fincher V. Protein Translocation on the Delta pH-dependent Pathway of Chloroplasts. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida, Gainesville2001Google Scholar). Other mutations of Tha4 employed the mTha4-pGEM4Z plasmid as template and the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations included substitutions of glutamate 10 by alanine (E10A) and aspartate (E10D) and substitution of the transmembrane leucine 20 with isoleucine (L20I). Internal stop codons were inserted with QuikChange for the generation of deletions Tha4ΔC29 and Tha4ΔC54. The Tha4ΔC29 mutation removed 29 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, resulting in a protein 53 amino acids long ending with the amino acids... KEFETELK-Stop. The Tha4ΔC54 mutation removed 54 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, resulting in a protein 28 amino acids long ending with... VFGPKKLP-Stop. The domain swaps of mTha4 (full-length 82 amino acids, 8.9 kDa) and mHcf106 (full-length 176 amino acids, 19 kDa) were generated by splicing by overlap extension -PCR (11Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). One fusion, called T6, consisted of the transmembrane domain of mTha4 (amino acids 1–22) and the stromal domain of mHcf106 (amino acids 23–176) to yield a protein of 175 residues with a molecular mass of 19 kDa containing the amino acid sequence VAAL/VFFGPKGL at the splice site. The second fusion, called 6T, consisted of the transmembrane domain of mHcf106 (amino acids 1–22) and the stromal domain of mTha4 (amino acids 23–82) to yield a protein of 83 residues with a molecular mass of 8.9 kDa containing the amino acids sequence VALL/VFGPKKLP at the splice site. All clones were verified by sequencing in both directions using ABI Prism Dye Terminator cycle sequencing protocols (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an Applied Biosystems model 373 Stretch DNA sequencer by the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research DNA Sequencing Core Facility. Preparation of Chloroplasts, Lysates, Thylakoids, and Stroma—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 9–10-day-old pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Laxton's Progress 9) seedlings (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were resuspended to 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml in import buffer (IB) (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol) and kept on ice until used. Chloroplast lysates were prepared from pelleted, intact chloroplasts by osmotic lysis at 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 at 0 °C and subsequent adjustment to 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml with IB containing 10 mm MgCl2 (13Cline K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoids were obtained from lysates by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 8 min followed by washing with IB, 10 mm MgCl2 and resuspension of the pellet to 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml with IB, 10 mm MgCl2. Stromal extract, equivalent to chloroplasts at 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml, was obtained from the supernatant of lysate centrifugation by further centrifugation (100,000 × g) for 20 min to remove envelope membranes (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Preparation of Radiolabeled mpsTha4 and Precursors—In vitro transcription plasmids for precursors DT17 and DT23 have been described previously (14Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Tha4 and precursors were translated in a wheat germ extract from capped RNA in the presence of [3H]leucine. Tha4 translation products were diluted with an equal volume of 60 mm leucine in 2× IB (100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 660 mm sorbitol) and 1× IB, 0.5× wheat germ, and 30 mm leucine to give the desired dilutions before its addition to thylakoids, as indicated in the figure legends. Precursor translation products were diluted with an equal volume of 2× IB, 60 mm leucine and 2 volumes of stromal extract for a total dilution of 1:4 before their addition to transport reactions. Biochemical Complementation of Transport by Exogenous Tha4 — Thylakoids were pretreated with IgGs as described previously (15Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J.

Briefly, thylakoids were incubated with either preimmune (PI) IgG or anti-Tha4 (α-Tha4) IgG for 45 min at 0 °C and then washed with 2 volumes of IB, 10 mm MgCl2. A typical preincubation contained 300 μg of chlorophyll and 75 μg of IgG in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.1 m sorbitol. Thylakoids were then recovered by centrifugation, washed with IB, 10 mm MgCl2, resuspended in IB, 10 mm MgCl2, and treated with protein A (5 μg/25 μg of chlorophyll) to clamp the bound IgG. Pretreated thylakoids were incubated with in vitro translated [3H]Tha4, mutated [3H]Tha4, mock translation mix (no mRNA added to the translation), or the α-Tha4 antigen, Tha4sd, for 15 min at 0 °C in the dark. Transport assays were initiated by the addition of precursor in stromal extract and transfer to light at temperatures listed in the figure legends. Typical assays contained 25 μl of thylakoids equivalent to 25 μg of chlorophyll, 25 μl of diluted [3H]Tha4 component, and 25 μl of precursor protein in stromal extract (total assay volume 75 μl). Reactions were terminated after 20 min by transfer to 0 °C and recovery of the thylakoids by centrifugation. Recovered thylakoids were resuspended in 300 μl of IB and divided into two aliquots. Thylakoids in one aliquot were recovered by centrifugation and washed with IB containing 5 mm EDTA. Thylakoids in the other aliquot were treated with thermolysin at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for 40 min at 4 °C. Proteolysis was terminated by adding an equal volume of IB containing 14 mm EDTA. Thylakoids were then recovered by centrifugation and were washed with IB containing 5 mm EDTA. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorography. Tha4 Recruitment—Tha4 assembly with the cpTatC-Hcf106 complex was determined by the chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation procedure of Mori and Cline (6Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, reaction mixtures containing thylakoids equivalent to 100 μg of chlorophyll (at 1 mg chlorophyll/ml) in transport buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, 5.0 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C with 50 μl of [3H]Tha4 or mutated [3H]Tha4 in the light. Nigericin was added during the preincubation (after 5 min) to 0.5 μm to dissipate the ΔpH as indicated. Unlabeled precursor (DT23) was then added to a final concentration of 1 μm from a freshly prepared 50 μm stock solution in 8 m urea, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, and the reactions were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in the light. Then the cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was added to 1 mm final concentration, and incubation was continued for an additional 5 min at 25 °C in the light. Cross-linking was then terminated with the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl and incubation for 5 min at 25 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions was performed as described previously with either PI or α-Hcf106 IgG covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (6Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were eluted from the IgG-protein A-Sepharose beads with 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, reduced with β-mercaptoethanol (5% final concentration), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.

Chlorophyll was determined according to Arnon (16Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reagents used are commercially available In Vitro Integrated Tha4 Can Restore Transport to Anti-Tha4-treated Membranes—Pretreatment of thylakoids with antibodies against Tha4 (α-Tha4) does not affect precursor binding to the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex but rather inhibits the subsequent translocation step (5Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have also demonstrated that physiological quantities of Tha4 can be integrated into isolated thylakoids (10Fincher V. Protein Translocation on the Delta pH-dependent Pathway of Chloroplasts. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida, Gainesville2001Google Scholar). These data suggested the possibility that exogenous Tha4 could complement a Tha4 deficiency or Tha4 inactivated with antibodies. i.e. that transport capability to α-Tha4-treated membranes could be restored by integration of exogenous Tha4. An initial attempt to “biochemically complement” antibody-treated membranes was successful (data not shown). However, because exogenous Tha4 can interact with the Tha4 antibody, it was important to rule out competitive release of the antibody, which would free endogenous Tha4 to participate in the transport reaction. An experiment to test for competitive release of antibody is shown in Fig. 1. Thylakoid membranes treated with PI or α-Tha4 IgGs were washed and then incubated with or without the Tha4 antigen Tha4sd, i.e. the stromal domain of Tha4, before addition of the precursor DT23 at various temperatures. As seen in Fig. 1, lanes 2–5, DT23 is increasingly transported across the PI IgG-treated membranes with increases in temperature from 0 to 25 °C. There was no transport across α-Tha4-treated membranes at either 0 or 25 °C (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7) unless 8 μm Tha4sd was also included in the assay mixture (lanes 8–11). The amount of transport in the presence of Tha4 antigen was significant at 10 °C and above. Thus, exogenous Tha4 antigen can promote release of α-Tha4, resulting in transport of the precursor. To stabilize the antibody-antigen complex, protein A was added to “clamp” the bound IgG (Fig. 1, lanes 12–15). Under these conditions, very little transport of DT23 occurred between the temperatures of 0 and 15 °C. It should be noted that 8 μm antigen is 30–50 times the concentration of Tha4 translation product included in our assays and thus represents a “worst case” scenario for competitive release of bound antibody. As a result of the above experiment, we chose to conduct assays at 10–15 °C and to include routinely an 8 μm antigen control to verify that endogenous Tha4 was not released during the assay. The results of such a biochemical complementation assay are shown in Fig. 2. Two different precursors, DT23 (Fig. 2A) and DT17 (Fig. 2B), were used in these assays. DT23 and DT17 are modified forms of the OE23 and OE17 precursors, respectively (14Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They were chosen because they are very efficiently transported by the thylakoid Tat system, even at reduced temperatures (17Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were pretreated with PI IgG or α-Tha4 IgG, washed, and then treated with protein A and either mock translation mixture (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4 and 8) and Tha4sd antigen (lane 4) or varying amounts of in vitro translated mTha4 (lanes 5–7). Alternatively thylakoids were pretreated with buffer (Fig. 2, lane 8) before treatment with protein A and mock translation mixture. After 15 min on ice, the treated membranes were incubated with precursor in a transport assay. Inclusion of exogenous Tha4 enhanced transport of either DT23 or DT17 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7). A higher concentration of in vitro translated Tha4 (undiluted translation product) resulted in diminished translocation of the precursor, suggesting that the wheat germ used for in vitro translation contains inhibitory components (not shown). The amount of exogenous Tha4 recovered with membranes is obscured in the DT17 assays because of very close migration with mOE17 (Fig. 2B). However, the Tha4 is clearly visible in the DT23 assay (Fig. 2A). For this reason, DT23 was used as a substrate in most subsequent assays. Transport did not occur in assays treated with mock translation mixture and was minimal in the presence of the Tha4 antigen (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). We occasionally observed a higher level of transport in the Tha4-complemented assays than in the mock- or PI IgG-treated assays, suggesting that Tha4 may be limiting in the transport reaction. However, this higher level of transport requires further study. In a separate experiment, we showed that exogenous Tha4 had no effect on transport of a Sec-pathway substrate, iOE33 (data not shown). The Predicted Amphipathic Helix Is Important for Tha4 Function, but the Carboxyl Terminus is Largely Dispensable— Plant Tha4 proteins are highly conserved in the transmembrane and amphipathic helical domains but divergent in their carboxyl termini. Orthologous bacterial TatA proteins have similar conserved and divergent domains. A recent study of the E. coli Tat system demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of TatA could be deleted without seriously impairing transport capability but that truncation of the amphipathic helix eliminated transport (9Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As proof of the concept of our method, we prepared truncated Tha4 proteins and assayed them in the complementation assay. As seen in Fig. 3, removal of the carboxyl terminus up to the amphipathic helix (Tha4ΔC29) reduced but did not eliminate the complementation activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 16–19; compare with wild-type Tha4, lanes 8–11). However, further deletion, which removed the amphipathic helix, eliminated the ability of the truncated protein (Tha4ΔC54) to complement transport (Fig. 3B, lanes 12–15). Taken together with the fact that Tha4sd (Tha4 lacking the transmembrane domain) is nonfunctional, these results indicate that the essential regions of Tha4 are its amphipathic helix and transmembrane domain. The fact that these results are consistent with the results of E. coli TatA truncation analysis (9Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) supports the validity of our complementation assay procedure. A Chimeral Tha4:Hcf106 Protein Is Partially Active in Complementing Tha4 Deficiency—Tha4 is structurally similar to Hcf106 and moderately conserved in the transmembrane domain and amphipathic helix. For example, pea Tha4 and Hcf106 transmembrane domains are 65% identical, and pea Tha4 and Hcf106 amphipathic helical domains are 41% identical. E. coli TatA and TatB are conserved in these domains (17 and 30%, respectively) but much less so than Tha4 and Hcf106. Recently, it was shown that a chimeric protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of TatB and the transmembrane domain of TatA was able to partially substitute for a TatA deletion in vivo, whereas the complementary fusion was not active (9Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As a second comparison between the thylakoid system and the E. coli system, we constructed similar chimeric proteins consisting of a fusion between the transmembrane domain of Tha4 and the stromal domain of Hcf106 (T6 construct) and a fusion between the transmembrane domain of Hcf106 and the stromal domain of Tha4 (6T construct). The 6T chimera complemented transport of α-Tha4-treated membranes (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10) although not as efficiently as wild-type Tha4 (lanes 7 and 8). The complementary fusion protein (T6) was unable to substitute for Tha4 (Fig. 4, lanes 13 and 14). Hcf106 showed no ability to complement Tha4 deficiency (Fig. 4, lanes 11 and 12). These results are interesting because they are reciprocal rather than analogous to those of the E. coli Tat system. A Conserved Transmembrane Glutamate Is Required for Tha4 Function—One unique feature of Tha4 is an invariantly conserved transmembrane proline-glutamate. It has been suggested that the glutamate is essential for Tha4 function and possibly participates in sensing the pH gradient or transducing it into translocation work (3Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the transmembrane charge, the glutamate residue (Glu10) was changed to aspartate (E10D), glutamine (E10Q), or alanine (E10A). In addition, to assess whether mutagenesis within the transmembrane domain was benign, a transmembrane leucine was changed to isoleucine (L20I), which is found in the same position in other plant Tha4 proteins (3Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the results of complementation assays with the different variants. The Tha4L20I variant was able to complement transport (Fig. 5, lanes 13–16) as effectively as wild-type Tha4 (lanes 8–11), indicating that mutagenesis of a residue not strictly conserved did not affect Tha4 activity. Replacing Glu10 with aspartate resulted in a minor amount of transport (Fig. 5, lanes 17–20), although this was similar to that of the competitive control (lanes 6 and 7, Tha4 antigen). The E10A (Fig. 5, lanes 21–24) and E10Q (lanes 25–28) variants showed no ability to promote precursor transport. We have also tested the Arabidopsis Tha4 and the Tha4 E10Q variant in this complementation assay. Essentially the same result was obtained. This is relevant because the Arabidopsis proteins are poorly recognized by our α-Tha4 IgGs. 3C. Dabney-Smith and K. Cline, unpublished results. In addition, complementation assays with maize tha4 membranes also showed the E10Q variant to be inactive.2 These data indicate that the transmembrane Glu10 is required for Tha4 activity. One potential trivial explanation for the failure of the glutamate variants to complement would be that they fail to integrate into the membrane. To examine this possibility, membranes recovered from integration assays were subjected to alkaline extractions and protease treatment (Fig. 6). Wild-type Tha4 is resistant to extraction with 0.2 m Na2CO3 (Fig. 6, lane 4) but is largely extracted by 0.1 m NaOH (lane 3).2 In addition, protease treatment of integrated Tha4 produces an ∼2.5–3-kDa degradation product presumed to represent the embedded transmembrane domain (Fig. 6, lane 5).

EC 4.1.2.13) fulfills an important function in the reversible Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and the Calvin cycle. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol condensation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Two different types of FBPA, termed class I and II (FBPA I and FBPA II), with different enzymatic mechanisms have so far been discovered. Whereas class I enzymes utilize the ϵ-amino group of the active site lysine to form a Schiff base with the substrate, the FBPAs II use divalent metal ions to stabilize the intermediate (1Lebherz H.G. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The classical FBPA I is mainly found in eukaryotes (e.g. animals, higher plants, protozoa, algae, and yeast) and is only identified in a few bacteria. FBPA II is in contrast mainly used by bacteria (2Thomson G.J. Howlett G.J. Ashcroft A.E. Berry A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although both classes of enzymes adopt the (βα)8-(TIM)-barrel fold, their insignificant overall sequence similarity casts doubts on whether they share a common ancestor. However, more recent analyses based on sequence, structure, and functional information suggest that both FBPA classes share a common evolutionary origin (3Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol.

The recently identified archaeal FBPA (FBPA IA) represents a third type of aldolase. Archaeal organisms appear to rely solely on the archaeal class I enzyme for FBPA activity (5Siebers B.

Although these enzymes use the Schiff base mechanism, they do not show any significant overall sequence similarity to classical FBPA I. Some bacterial genomes contain FBPA IA homologs (6Galperin M.Y. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 259-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to FBPA II, the typical bacterial FBPA (e.g. Escherichia coli) (2Thomson G.J. Howlett G.J. Ashcroft A.E. Berry A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). So far no eukaryotic homologs of the archaeal class I enzymes are known. Biochemical analyses of archaeal FBPA from Thermoproteus tenax and Pyrococcus furiosus reveal that this enzyme, like the classical FBPA I, catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as well as fructose 1-phosphate, but the clear preference for FBP indicates that this compound is the physiological substrate (5Siebers B.

Contrary to the classical tetrameric FBPAs I, the archaeal type enzymes form higher oligomerization states (homo-octamers, decamers, or even higher oligomers) with subunit molecular masses of 30–38 kDa (2Thomson G.J. Howlett G.J. Ashcroft A.E. Berry A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Siebers B. Brinkmann H. Dorr C. Tjaden B. Lilie H. van der Oost J. Verhees C.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), no information is yet available about the three-dimensional structure of archaeal FBPAs, which could help to unravel its evolutionary status. Here, we describe the first crystal structure of an archaeal FBPA I from the hyperthermophile T. tenax. Using the structure we explore the hypothesis of the remote evolutionary relationship to classical FBPA I as suggested by the common Schiff base reaction mechanism, structural predictions of the common TIM barrel fold, and the location of functional residues (3Copley R.R.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and purified using the same protocol as for the native protein. Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was concentrated to 3 mg/ml as determined by the Bradford assay (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Orthorhombic crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Two μl of protein solution (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C (9% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0). Monoclinic crystals were grown under similar conditions, but with the addition of 1–8% (v/v) of glycerol, sucrose, ethylene glycol, or 2–25 mm lithium citrate to the mother liquor. The complex structure was obtained by co-crystallization using the same conditions as for the native monoclinic crystals, but with the addition of 100 mm DHAP to the reservoir solution. For data collection, crystals were transferred to the cryosolution (9% (v/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 100 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol), and cooled directly in the nitrogen cryostream (11Teng T.Y. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 387-391Crossref Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K from a native orthorhombic crystal and from monoclinic crystals on the EMBL beam lines BW7B and X13. Selenium-methionine-substituted protein crystals were obtained in the same way as crystals of the native protein. Single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data, at the peak of a fluorescence scan, were collected from a monoclinic crystal at beam line BW7A (12Pohl E. Gonzalez A. Hermes C. van Silfhout R.G. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2001; 8: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All diffraction data were integrated and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—SAD data in the resolution range 20 to 3.7 Å were of sufficient quality to identify the positions of 40 of 50 selenium atoms using SHELXD (14Sheldrick G.M. Fortier S. Direct Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998: 401-411Crossref Google Scholar). Ten selenium atoms are missing because of the disordered N-terminal methionines in all 10 subunits. Positions and B-factors were further refined and SAD phases were calculated to a resolution of 2.5 Å in the CCP4 program MLPHARE (15Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). These initial phases have a figure of merit of 0.34 in the resolution range from 20 to 2.5 Å. Further phase improvement and extension to 1.9 Å using solvent flattening and 10-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was carried out in the program RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). This resulted in a figure of merit of 0.45 for the entire resolution range (0.65 to 2.5 Å). Two hundred forty-nine of 263 residues of one monomer were automatically built by ARP/wARP 6.0 (17Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and crystallographic refinement. Refinement was carried out using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, bulk solvent correction, anisotropic scaling, and with each monomer defined as a TLS group in the modeling of anisotropy in the program REFMAC (19Winn M.D. Isupov M.N.

The structure of the liganded protein was solved using the structure of the unliganded protein as an initial model, followed by model building in O and refinement in REFMAC. The refinement procedure was carried out as described for the structure of unliganded Tt-FBPA. The structure of the orthorhombic crystal form was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), using the model of the decameric Tt-FBPA obtained from the monoclinic crystals.

Initial phases were significantly improved by 10-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, which resulted in an interpretable electron density map. The model was refined at 1.9-Å resolution yielding an Rcryst of 14.9% and an Rfree (28Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar) of 17.9% and is of excellent quality with 95.1% of the residues in the most favored part of the Ramachandran plot (29Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) and 4.9% in the additionally favored region (see Table I for further statistics). The electron density map allowed the tracing of 2502 of 2630 residues that correspond to residues 3–252 for all 10 subunits of the homodecamer (residues 3–254 for monomer E). As there was no observable electron density for residues 1–2 in any of the 10 subunits or for residues 253–263 in 9 of the subunits (255–263 for monomer E), these parts of the protein are presumably disordered in the crystal. In addition, a trapped intermediate of Tt-FBPA with the substrate DHAP covalently bound to the active site lysine has been solved at 2.1-Å resolution. The substrate was unambiguously identified as bound in all 10 subunits. The structure of Tt-FBPA was also solved from a second crystal form and refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å. This orthorhombic crystal form of Tt-FBPA contains one homodecamer in the asymmetric unit, which indicates that the decamer formation is not an artifact of crystal packing. Models obtained from the two different crystal forms are very similar and superimpose well with r.m.s. deviations between the Cα atoms of 0.6 Å for the decamers, 0.5 Å for the pentamers, and 0.3 Å for the monomers. Consequently, the more accurately determined structures from the monoclinic crystal form are used in the subsequent analysis and comparisons.Table ISummary of the x-ray data collection and refinement statisticsUnliganded (P21)Unliganded (P212121)Se-peak (P21)Liganded (P21)Wavelength (Å)0.845/0.803aData collected from two crystals on beamlines BW7B and X130.8450.976420.845Resolution (Å)40–1.9020–2.3920–2.2740–2.10I/σ(I)bThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the last resolution shell14.5 (2.4)13.3 (2.7)22.2 (4.1)13.6 (2.3)RsymbThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the last resolution shell,cRsym = Σ|I|〈I〉|/ΣI0.085 (0.365)0.121 (0.372)0.061 (0.301)0.071 (0.272)CompletenessbThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the last resolution shell0.945 (0.870)0.936 (0.690)0.995 (0.988)0.902 (0.593)Reflections in working set183,520106,518125,363Reflections in test set472327353203Protein residues250225222502Rcryst0.1490.2320.160Rfree0.1790.2630.187R.m.s. deviation bonds (Å)dRoot mean square deviations from ideal values0.0120.0130.013R.m.s. deviation angles (°)dRoot mean square deviations from ideal values1.31.31.3Average B-factor, protein (Å2)21.832.724.1a Data collected from two crystals on beamlines BW7B and X13b The numbers in parentheses correspond to the last resolution shellc Rsym = Σ|I|〈I〉|/ΣId Root mean square deviations from ideal values Open table in a new tab Tt-FBPA Structure—The Tt-FBPA molecule forms a homodecamer where each monomer adopts the familiar fold of a parallel (βα)8-(TIM)-barrel. The protein complex has an overall doughnut shape with a diameter of about 100 Å and a height of 75 Å (Fig. 1). The decamer shows a 52-point group symmetry with one 5-fold axis going through both pentamers. Two identical pentamers meet each other with the N termini of the (βα)8 barrels to form the decamer. Each monomer from one pentamer interacts with only one monomer from the second pentamer in a symmetrical interface. Only five residues, engaged in both hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges, participate in the decamer formation. Lys-136 and Glu-99 from one monomer create a network of salt bridges with the same residues from another monomer. In addition, there are van der Waal contacts between Phe-137, Val-102, and the hydrophobic parts of Lys-136 and Asp-138. This results in a rather small decamer interface of only 240 Å2 of buried surface area per monomer, which is 2.1% of the total accessible surface area (calculated using the protein-protein interaction server) (30Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The relatively small decamer interface (1200 Å2 in total) is consistent with the results from gel filtration and ultracentrifugation, which showed that the protein in solution exists in equilibrium between two different multimeric forms (5Siebers B. Brinkmann H. Dorr C. Tjaden B. Lilie H. van der Oost J. Verhees C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28710-28718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of the weak interactions between the pentamers, we suggest that the two different forms observed in solution are pentameric and decameric, respectively. Pentamer formation occurs through one comparatively large interface. Helices α4, α5, and α6 plus the loops β4-α4, β5-α5, and α6-β7 from one monomer and helices α2 and α3 plus loops β1-α1 and β3-α3 from an adjacent monomer form the pentamer interface (see Fig. 2 for secondary structure assignment). Loop β3-α3 contains two small anti-parallel β-strands and is responsible for a large part of the pentamer interface. With 68% non-polar atoms, the pentamer interface is mostly of hydrophobic nature. Each monomer has 2950 Å2 of buried surface area (26% of the total accessible surface area), which makes the pentamer a highly compact structure. A remarkable feature of the pentamer formation is the circular stacking of phenylalanine, tryptophan, and lysine residues. The side chains of Phe-119, Trp-121, and Lys-122 point toward the center of the pentamer where they engage in hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, each Trp stacks with a Phe and a Lys from a neighboring subunit. In this way, the stacking continues all the way around on the inner side of the pentamer and performs a full circle (Fig. 3). The distances between the atoms involved are 4–5 Å, which is typical for hydrophobic contacts. This optimization of the subunit contacts within the pentamer probably leads to an overall stabilization of the structure of the enzyme. Stacking within a large aromatic patch has in the case of CYP119, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, from Sulfolobus sulfataricus recently been shown to be an important determinant for protein thermostability (31Puchkaev A.V. Koo L.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The observed stacking in Tt-FBPA could thus be important in assuring stability of the protein at elevated temperatures. However, as the residues engaged in the circular stacking are not conserved in any other thermophilic FBPA IA, it is likely that this interaction is not common to other archaeal FBPAs and thus represents a T. tenax-specific determinant for thermoadaptation. Overall Comparison with TIM Barrel Enzymes—The TIM barrel fold is the most common fold among proteins (3Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Because of the wide range of reactions catalyzed and the low sequence identity often observed between them, it is not clear whether all share a common evolutionary ancestor (3Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 32Farber G.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although a common fold is often used to argue for homology between proteins, even in the absence of sequence similarity, the low complexity of the (βα)8 barrel might imply that it has arisen multiple times during evolution. At least 21 superfamilies have been described that may represent individual convergencies although many of them have been suggested to share a common ancestor (3Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 32Farber G.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The FBPA IA family was identified as a divergent group, comprising members from almost all sequenced archaeal organisms, some eubacteria but no eukaryotes (5Siebers B. Brinkmann H. Dorr C. Tjaden B. Lilie H. van der Oost J. Verhees C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28710-28718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Galperin M.Y. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 259-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the FBPA IA family are clearly identified as homologs, but the overall sequence identity can be as low as 20%. No significant overall sequence similarity could be observed with proteins from other TIM barrel superfamilies. To detect more remote phylogenetic relationships of the FBPA IA to the various superfamilies of TIM barrel proteins, we have performed a detailed structural comparison of the Tt-FBPA structure with representatives of selected TIM barrel superfamilies. Comparison to the Classical FBPA I—The classical FBPA I and the archaeal FBPA I adopt the same fold and catalyze identical reactions but share no overall sequence identity. It was thus of particular interest to see if a detailed structural comparison could unravel their evolutionary relationship. The structure of the Tt-FBPA subunit and the subunit of a human FBPA I (33Dalby A. Dauter Z. Littlechild J.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) superimpose with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.9 Å and a sequence identity of 13% for the 154 of 250 residues that are found to be structurally equivalent (all structural comparisons between pairs of TIM barrels were performed with STAMP) (22Russell R.B. Barton G.J. Proteins. 1992; 14: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tt-FBPA does not, from an overall structural perspective, seem more similar to the classical FBPA I than to other TIM barrels of different enzymatic functions. However, two unusual structural features are observed in both types of FBPAs. The first is the presence of an additional N-terminal helix, which precedes the first β-strand of the barrel. As seen for the classical FBPA I (7Gamblin S.J. Cooper B. Millar J.R. Davies G.J. Littlechild J.A. Watson H.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and for the KDPG aldolase (34Mavridis I.M. Hatada M.H. Tulinsky A. Lebioda L. J. Mol.

Similarly, agonist-dependent endocytosis of heptahelical receptors in coated pits employs the clathrin adaptor β-arrestin proteins. In mice fed a high fat diet, we found that homozygous deficiency of β-arrestin2 increased total and LDL plus intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 23 and 53%, respectively (p < 0.05), but had no effect on high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. We therefore tested whether β-arrestins could affect the constitutive endocytosis of the LDLR. When overexpressed in cells, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 each associated with the LDLR, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation, and augmented LDLR endocytosis by ∼70%, as judged by uptake of fluorescent LDL. However, physiologic expression levels of only β-arrestin2, and not β-arrestin1, enhanced endogenous LDLR endocytosis (by 65%) in stably transfected β-arrestin1/β-arrestin2 double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Concordantly, when RNA interference was used to suppress expression of β-arrestin2, but not β-arrestin1, LDLR endocytosis was reduced. Moreover, β-arrestin2–/– MEFs demonstrated LDLR endocytosis that was 50% less than cognate wild type MEFs. In fusion protein pull-down assays, β-arrestin2 bound to the LDLR cytoplasmic tail stoichiometrically, and binding was abolished by mutation of LDLR Tyr807 to Ala. Mutation of LDLR cytoplasmic tail Ser833 to Asp enhanced both the affinity of LDLR fusion protein binding to β-arrestin2, and the efficiency of LDLR endocytosis in cells expressing β-arrestin2 physiologically. We conclude that β-arrestin2 can bind to and enhance endocytosis of the LDLR, both in vitro and in vivo, and may thereby influence lipoprotein metabolism.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4306) Google Scholar). Approximately 75% of plasma LDL clearance occurs through endocytosis of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), predominately in the liver (2Kesaniemi Y.A. Witztum J.L. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The well characterized endocytosis of the LDLR through clathrin-coated pits depends upon association of the 50-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of the LDLR with components of the cellular endocytic machinery. Although mutagenesis studies of the LDLR have delineated cytoplasmic tail domain residues necessary for LDLR endocytosis (3Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteins with which the LDLR cytoplasmic tail interacts have only recently been identified. The clathrin heavy chain terminal domain itself can interact with peptides from the LDLR cytoplasmic tail but with relatively low affinity (5Kibbey R.G. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein also binds to the LDLR cytoplasmic domain, whereas the C-terminal domain of ARH binds to both clathrin and AP-2 (6He G.

Thus, ARH appears to link the LDLR to the endocytic machinery, in a process that seems to be required for endocytosis of the LDLR in hepatocytes and lymphocytes (6He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P.

Whether other adaptor-type proteins may be involved in LDLR endocytosis remains to be determined.Candidate clathrin adaptor proteins for the LDLR could include the β-arrestins, which play important roles in the endocytosis of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors. β-Arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were initially characterized as ubiquitously expressed proteins involved in heptahelical G protein-coupled receptor desensitization (8Attramadal H.

Recent data generated in β-arrestin-deficient cells suggest that particular receptors can interact preferentially with specific β-arrestin isoforms (14Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A.

Derived from matings between β-arrestin2+/– founder mice, the β-arrestin2–/– and +/+ mice used in this study (n = 30) were littermates and were hybrids of the C57Bl/6J and 129/SvJ genetic backgrounds. Serum cholesterol measurements were performed on ∼200-μl blood samples, obtained from tail cuts performed under methoxyflurane anesthesia. Blood samples were first obtained after 4 weeks on a Paigen diet (by weight: 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% cholic acid (19Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P. Mitchell D. Williams R. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), Dyets, Inc., #615038). After initial blood sampling, mice were fed a normal, low fat diet (Purina Breeder Chow), and blood was sampled again after 8 weeks. Thus, our serum lipid studies constitute a dietary crossover study. The mice were supplied with only water for 12 h prior to blood sampling (19Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P. Mitchell D. Williams R. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar).Blood was allowed to clot for 2 h at room temperature. The thrombus was pelleted at 4 °C, and serum was removed. All mice were bled on the same day, and each batch of 30 samples (high and low fat diet) was assayed simultaneously. Lipid analyses were performed by the Duke University Medical Center Endomet Laboratory, which is standardized for human lipoprotein analyses by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LDL cholesterol was measured with the Liquid Select™ LDL Direct Assay (Equal Diagnostics), and HDL cholesterol was measured with the Roche Applied Science direct HDL-cholesterol method. In pilot studies with mouse plasma divided into aliquots, we found that lipoprotein cholesterol results from these assays correlated very closely with those obtained by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractionation using a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and the Infinity™ Cholesterol Reagent kit (Sigma); however, LDL cholesterol determined by the LDL Direct assay corresponded to LDL plus IDL cholesterol determined by FPLC fractionation. Plasma lipoprotein fractionation by FPLC was performed on 100-μl samples of mouse plasma as described previously (20Knouff C. Hinsdale M.E. Mezdour H. Altenburg M.K. Watanabe M. Quarfordt S.H. Sullivan P.M. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Plasmid Constructs—The LDLR cDNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (21Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). This construct was epitope-tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG™ octapeptide, as described previously (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). From the first amino acid of the mature LDLR (Ala) onward (21Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), the remainder of the LDLR sequence was left intact. The resulting construct was subcloned into pcDNA I (Invitrogen). This FLAG-LDLR construct behaved identically to the native LDLR in LDL uptake experiments (data not shown), and is referred to as “LDLR” throughout the text. To create S833D and S833A mutations in the full-length LDLR, we employed two sets of complementary 46-mer oligonucleotides, which included nucleotides 2545–2583 of the human LDLR sequence (containing a 5′-XhoI site) (21Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) as well as 3′ EcoRI and XbaI sites. In these oligonucleotides, nucleotides 2560–2562 were mutated to either GCC (Ala) or GAC (Asp). After annealing, these oligonucleotides were ligated into a XhoI/XbaI-cut LDLR/pcDNA I construct.A GST fusion protein encompassing the 50 amino acids of the LDLR cytoplasmic tail (LDLRct) was created by cassette PCR of the human LDLR, and subcloning the PCR fragment into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) with BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′). To create S833D, Y807A, and S833D/Y807A mutations in the GST/LDLRct construct, we used subcloning and cassette PCR similar to that for the wild type construct, but with oligodeoxynucleotides encoding the indicated mutations. Fidelity of PCR-amplified and synthetic oligonucleotide-generated DNA sequences was verified by dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids encoding native rat β-arrestin1 and rat β-arrestin2 (23Freedman N.J.

FLAG-tagged constructs encoding rat β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (24Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen).Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO ldlA cells, which lack functional LDLRs, were generously provided by Monty Krieger and grown as described before (25Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE®, in Opti-MEM™ medium (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultivated and transfected as described (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from either wild type, β-arrestin2–/–, or β-arrestin1–/–/β-arrestin2–/– mice were created as described by Kohout et al. (14Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar), and grown in DMEM/10% FBS/100 U/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin. To compare MEFs expressing no β-arrestin isoform with genetically identical MEFs expressing only β-arrestin1 or only β-arrestin2, we used stable transfection in a β-arrestin1–/–/β-arrestin2–/– cell line. These cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE® (Invitrogen) and either pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen), FLAG-tagged β-arrestin1/pcDNA3.1/Hygro, or FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2/pcDNA3.1/Hygro. Stably transfected lines were selected with and maintained in growth medium containing hygromycin at 250 μg/ml and screened by immunoblotting for β-arrestins. HEK 293 cells were transfected with siRNAs specific for β-arrestin1, β-arrestin2, or neither β-arrestin isoform, exactly as described (26Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and split into assay dishes 72 h later.Immunoprecipitations—The day after transfection, ldlA cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes in Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient newborn calf serum (LPDS medium). The following day, LPDS medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5% LPDS lacking or containing LDL at 200 μg of protein/ml, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and proteins were cross-linked with the reducible cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce), as described (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells were then scraped into ice-cold 500 mm NaCl/50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 (25 °C) with protease inhibitors (buffer A) (23Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and then disrupted by using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Membranes from disrupted cells were pelleted (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and washed in buffer A. Solubilized membranes were then processed for immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG™ IgG, as described (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were heated in Laemmli buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, to reduce intermolecular cross-links before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, which were performed as described previously (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—To assay endogenous β-arrestin expression in MEFs, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-Cl/2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (buffer B), and the membrane fraction was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Liver samples were obtained from C57Bl/6J mice sacrificed under pentobarbital anesthesia. Fresh liver was perfused with Ringer's Lactate, then minced and homogenized with a small Polytron™ (Brinkman) in buffer B. Insoluble debris was pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. As throughout this report, protein concentrations of liver and cell supernatant fractions were assayed by a modified Lowry method, with IgG as the standard (23Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Forty μg of each specimen was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described (23Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).LDL Uptake Assays—Either 16 h after transfection and 24 h before assay (ldlA cells, 293 cells), or 48 h before assay (MEFs and siRNA-treated 293 cells), cells were split and seeded at equal densities (∼50% confluence, 2.7–4.7 × 104 cells/cm2) into 6-well dishes, in growth medium containing 10% LPDS (in lieu of fetal bovine serum) (27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). For LDLR-transfected 293 cells, 10% LPDS growth medium was supplemented with 10 μg of cholesterol and 0.1 μg of 25-hydroxycholesterol per milliliter, to down-regulate endogenous LDLRs (3Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For siRNA-transfected 293 cells, 10% LPDS growth medium was supplemented with 1 μm lovastatin. On the day of assay, separate aliquots of cells were processed for cell surface LDLR assay (see below) at 4 °C, and LDL uptake (endocytosis) assays at 37 °C. LPDS growth medium was replaced with cognate medium containing 5% LPDS and LDL labeled with the fluorescent dye 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI-LDL), at a concentration of 3–5 μg of protein/ml (“labeling medium,” for “total uptake”). Labeling medium containing unlabeled LDL at 500 μg of protein/ml was used to assess nonspecific uptake of the DiI-LDL. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 5 h (27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). LDL uptake assays were then terminated by trypsinizing cells, washing twice with PBS, and fixing with 3.6% formaldehyde in PBS. Cellular uptake of LDL was assessed by flow cytometry for cellular DiI fluorescence (28Innerarity T. Pitas R. Mahley R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Specific ([total]–[nonspecific]) uptake of DiI-LDL was divided by the relative cell surface LDLR number (see below), to obtain the Internalization Index for LDLRs in each cell line (3Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The values for internalization index were then normalized to that obtained for the control cells within each experiment, to facilitate averaging results across independent experiments. For DiI-LDL uptake, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was <5%, and mean nonspecific uptake constituted 25% of mean total uptake.Cell Surface LDLR Assessment—For cells transfected with the N-terminal FLAG™-tagged LDLR construct, cell surface LDLRs were quantitated by cell surface immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, as described (22Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For MEFs, which expressed only endogenous LDLRs, cell surface receptor number was assessed at 4 °C by ligand binding, with DiI-LDL (27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Cells were first detached in PBS/EDTA (Versene, Invitrogen), pelleted, and washed in ice-cold minimal essential medium. Next, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold DiI-LDL labeling medium lacking (“total binding”) or containing unlabeled LDL at 500 μg of protein/ml (“nonspecific binding”), and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, cells were pelleted and washed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline (with 2.5 mm CaCl2), then fixed in this solution with 3.6% formaldehyde. Specific cell surface DiI-LDL binding was then assessed as described above and was used to estimate the relative cell surface LDLR number within each experiment. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was <7%, and mean nonspecific binding constituted 35–60% of mean total binding. Within a given experiment, cells were used only if cell surface LDLR density was within 30% (transfected cells) to 50% (MEFs) of control cells.LDL and LPDS Preparation—LDL (1.019 < d < 1.055) from normal human plasma and newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.21 g/ml) were prepared by vertical spin density gradient ultracentrifugation, as described (27Goldstein J.L.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). LDL purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS 3–20% gradient gel electrophoresis. DiI-LDL was either purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc., or prepared as described (28Innerarity T. Pitas R. Mahley R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Angiotensin II Receptor Internalization—Fibroblasts in 35-mm wells were incubated with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/1% bovine serum albumin/20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing either vehicle (“naïve”) or 100 nm angiotensin II for 30 min (37 °C), and then washed with 40 mm sodium acetate/150 mm NaCl, pH 5.0 (10 min, 25 °C) to remove cell surface-bound angiotensin II (30Haddad G. Amiri F. Garcia R. Regul. Pept. 1997; 68: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C in serum-free medium containing 1 nm [125I]sarile (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), to assess cell surface angiotensin II receptor binding in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 500 nm angiotensin II (31Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed thrice, solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquoted to gamma counting and Lowry protein assay (31Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Specific binding (total–nonspecific) was used to assess receptor internalization, as: 100 × ([125I]sarile bound to angiotensin II-challenged cells)/([125I]sarile bound to naïve cells). Total binding in each well constituted <10% of the CPM used in each binding assay well, and nonspecific binding averaged 40 ± 10% of total binding.Fusion Protein Production—GST and the GST/LDLRct proteins were made in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 by standard methods (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor2001Google Scholar). After elution from glutathione-agarose with reduced glutathione, fusion proteins were concentrated and dialyzed in Centriprep 10 units (Amicon). Purity of the preparations was ∼90%, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.β-Arrestin2 Purification—The FLAG™-tagged rat β-arrestin2 cDNA (24Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D.

Spodoptera frugiperda-9 cells infected with the β-arrestin2FL baculovirus were harvested 72 h after infection and lysed in buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Insoluble debris was pelleted, and the supernatant was mixed with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C, 16 h. Beads were loaded into a column and washed extensively with buffer C. β-Arrestin2FL was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, into a 0.1 volume of 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.5. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Purity of the preparation was ∼95%.In Vitro Binding of β-Arrestin2 to the LDLRct—[35S]β-arrestin2 was synthesized by in vitro translation, using the TnT® Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (11 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the rat β-arrestin2 expression plasmid (23Freedman N.J.

https://openalex.org/W2025386369,"Antizyme-1 (AZ1) is a protein that negatively regulates polyamine synthesis by inhibiting the key synthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase and targeting it for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Recent work shows that antizyme protein translocates to the nucleus during mouse development (Gritli-Linde, A., Nilssom, J., Bohlooly, Y. M., Heby, O., and Linde, A. (2001) Dev. Dyn. 220, 259-275). However, the significance and mechanism of this phenomenon remain unclear. In this study, we expressed AZ1 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to study its localization in a living cell. We found that EGFP-AZ1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and that treatment with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) induced nuclear accumulation of EGFP-AZ1 in Chinese hamster ovary and NIH3T3 cells. Two independent nuclear export signal (NES) sequences, each containing essential hydrophobic residues, were identified in the 50 N-terminal amino acid residues and in the central part of AZ1. The activity of the second NES was inhibited by an N-terminal adjacent region and was only revealed in N-terminal truncated constructs. Both NESs were active when fused to an artificial nuclear protein SV40-NLS-EGFP-EGFP. The ability of AZ1 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm suggests that it has a novel function in the nucleus.

For AZ1, when cellular polyamine levels are low, the polypeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1-68 is produced and translation is terminated at the following UGA codon (11Matsufuji S.

When cellular polyamine levels are high, +1 frameshifting occurs after the 68th codon is decoded, resulting in the full-length antizyme protein (amino acid residues 1-227).

J. 1998; 329: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the N-terminal region of the translation product from the first AUG contains a putative mitochondrial targeting signal and thus the distribution of AZ1 may depend on this region (15Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear whether the short polypeptides (residues 1-68 and 34-68) exert their specific functions. Gritli-Linde et al. (16Gritli-Linde A. Nilssom J. Bohlooly Y.M. Heby O. Linde A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 259-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently revealed nuclear localization of AZ and ODC during mouse development using systematic expression analysis at the mRNA and protein levels.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46533-46543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that the transcription factor Smad1 interacts with both AZ1 and proteasome subunit HsN3 and that this ternary complex enters the nucleus in response to bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor activation (18Lin Y.

These findings have led to speculation that a specific mechanism is responsible for shuttling AZ1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we show the subcellular localization of AZ1 in living cells using fusion proteins of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and AZ1. We found that in the presence of leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor for chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), also known as exportin-1-dependent nucleus export (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 20Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), AZ1 that fused to EGFP (EGFP-AZ1) accumulates in the nucleus, whereas in the absence of LMB, EGFP-AZ1 remains primarily in the cytoplasm. We then used deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the nuclear export signal (NES) sequences in AZ1. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—To generate an AZ1 construct fused with EGFP at the N terminus, an XhoI/EcoRI DNA fragment encoding EGFP and an EcoRI/XbaI DNA fragment encoding an in-frame mutant form of rat AZ1 (AZ1ΔT) were amplified by PCR from pd2EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and pGEM4Z/ΔT205 (11Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 1360-1370Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (416) Google Scholar), respectively. These fragments were inserted in tandem into a pd2EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) at the XhoI and XbaI restriction sites, resulting in pEGFP-AZ1. Deletion mutants were prepared by replacing the EcoRI/XbaI fragment of pEGFP-AZ1 with partial EcoRI/XbaI fragments of AZ1ΔT amplified by PCR. To generate plasmid pCMV-Myc-AZ1, an EcoRI/KpnI DNA fragment encoding AZ1ΔT, was amplified as above and inserted into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). To generate pEGFP-EGFP vectors, two EGFP fragments (XhoI/HindIII and HindIII/EcoRI) were amplified by PCR and the EcoRI/XbaI fragments of AZ1ΔT and their mutants were inserted into pd2EGFPN1. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to SV40 large T-antigen NLS (PKKKRKV) (21Kalderon D. Roberts B. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) was fused to the N terminus of pEGFP-EGFPAZ1 using BglII/HindIII sites (pNLS-EGFP-EGFP-AZ1). Drosophila AZΔT (D-AZΔT) cDNA was provided to us by Drs. J. F. Atkins and I. P. Ivanov. pEGFP-D-AZ was prepared by replacing the EcoRI/XbaI cDNA fragment of AZ1 in pEGFP-AZ1 with an EcoRI/XbaI fragment of D-AZ1ΔT amplified by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to generate a series of mutations in the NLS fragments. The wild-type NLS was changed to PAKKRKV (m1NLS), PKKARKV (m2NLS), or PAAKRKV (m3NLS). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing with an ABI PRISM 3700 sequencer and Big Dye™ terminator cycle-sequencing FS reaction kit (ABI). Cell Culture—Mouse NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 4% newborn calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. All of the cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfection and LMB Treatment—Plasmid DNA for transfection was purified using a Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded onto 35-mm sterile polystyrene dishes or glass bottom dishes (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) and transiently transfected at 50-70% confluency with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with fresh growth medium and processed for fluorescence microscopy. When indicated, LMB was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml for 2.5 h. Fluorescent Microscopy—EGFP fusion proteins in living cells were visualized using an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Polaroid PDMC Ie digital camera. Nuclear DNA was stained with 100 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min under culture conditions. After staining, cells were washed twice with fresh medium and incubated for 1 h before observation. For immunocytochemical detection of Myc-tagged protein, cells were seeded on glass-bottom plates for transfection. After expression, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 4 h and permeabilized on ice using pre-chilled methanol (-20 °C) for 10 min. Aldehyde groups were quenched by incubating the cells with 10 mm glycine (pH 8.5) at room temperature for 5 min. Fixed cells were incubated with 3% pre-immune goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h and then with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% pre-immune goat serum) at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight. Myc-tagged protein was detected using monoclonal anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor-545 fluorescence probes (Molecular Probes). Subcellular Distribution of EGFP-AZ1 and Its Nuclear Accumulation with LMB—To examine the subcellular localization of AZ1 in living cells, NIH3T3 and CHO cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors of EGFP-AZ1 or EGFP alone and analyzed by a fluorescence microscopy. Approximately 60% of the cells expressed EGFP-AZ1, and 80-90% of these cells exhibited the fluorescence localized primarily in the cytoplasm in the absence of LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (Fig. 1, -LMB) (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 20Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The addition of LMB-induced nuclear accumulation of EGFP-AZ1 in both cell lines (Fig. 1). This was observed in at least 70% EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). In almost all of the cells transfected with non-fused EGFP, fluorescence was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, irrespective of LMB treatment (Fig. 1). To confirm the subcellular localization of AZ1 not fused with EGFP but tagged with a small epitope, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with vectors expressing Myc-tagged AZ1 (Myc-AZ1) and examined immunohistochemically. As shown in Fig. 2, Myc-AZ1 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and LMB treatment induced accumulation of Myc-AZ1 in the nucleus. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts followed by immunostaining with monoclonal anti-EGFP or anti-Myc antibodies demonstrated that EGFP-AZ1 and Myc-AZ1 proteins were expressed in the cells and that no proteolytic fragments containing EGFP were present (data not shown). These results indicate that AZ1 protein is subject to shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that nuclear export is mediated by a CRM1-dependent pathway (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 22Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S.

Cells were scored as follows: predominantly nuclear (N), evenly distributed in cytoplasm, and nucleus (NC), predominantly cytoplasmic (C). For each condition, at least 200 cells were scored from random fields. Error ranges are indicated by bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2Localization of Myc-AZ1 in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected in duplicate with expression vector encoding Myc-tagged AZ1 protein (Myc-AZ1). Half of the culture was treated with 5 ng/ml LMB for 5 h. Localization of Myc-AZ1 in the cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against Myc epitope tags and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies. Hoechst was used to stain nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AZ1 Contains Two Nuclear Export Signals—We attempted to determine which region is important for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of AZ1. We first divided AZ1 into the N-terminal portion (amino acid residues 1-68) and the remaining portion (amino acid residues 69-227). These portions were fused with EGFP and introduced into cultured cells. In CHO cells, the fusion protein containing the N-terminal portion (EGFP-AZ11-68) was localized mainly in the cytoplasm in the absence of LMB (Fig. 3A). LMB treatment prevented the exclusion of EGFP-AZ11-68 from the nucleus, resulting in an even fluorescence distribution between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. EGFP-AZ169-227 was distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus almost evenly in the absence of LMB. LMB induced nuclear accumulation of EGFP AZ169-227 (Fig. 3A). The results of quantitative analysis of at least 200 fluorescent-positive cells are shown in Fig. 3B. >70% of cells showed cytoplasmic distribution of EGFP-AZ11-68 in the absence of LMB. LMB caused a shift to nucleocytoplasmic or even nuclear distribution. LMB also induced nuclear accumulation of EGFP-AZ169-227 in >50% of cells. These results suggest that AZ1 contains two NES sequences. N-terminal NES—EGFP-AZ169-227 as well as mutants with smaller N-terminal deletions, such as EGFP-AZ110-227 and EGFP-AZ134-227, were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the absence of LMB (Fig. 4A). All of the C-terminal deletion mutants containing the first 50 amino acid residues, such as EGFP-AZ11-134, EGFP-AZ11-68 EGFP-AZ11-64, EGFPAZ11-60, EGFP-AZ11-58, and EGFP-AZ11-50, were primarily distributed in the cytoplasm in the absence of LMB and became evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus after LMB treatment (Fig. 4B). In contrast, mutants with further deletions from the C terminus, such as EGFP-AZ11-45, EGFPAZ11-40, EGFP-AZ11-33, and EGFP-AZ11-20, were distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus irrespective of LMB treatment (Fig. 4B). Thus, truncation of only nine amino acids from the N terminus of AZ1 resulted in diffuse distribution of the fusion protein, whereas 50 N-terminal amino acid residues were necessary for cytoplasmic distribution on the EGFP fusion protein. Therefore, we refer to amino acid residues 1-50 of AZ1 as NES1. It has been reported that CRM1 binds to cargo proteins at the leucine-rich NES region (20Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The first 10 residues of AZ1 are conserved among vertebrates, and positions of hydrophobic residues are similar to previously identified leucine-rich NES sequences (Fig. 5). To investigate the contribution of these hydrophobic residues, we generated another series of mutant constructs by replacing the hydrophobic residues of NES1 with alanine (Fig. 6, A and B). When substitutions were introduced into EGFP-AZ11-68, NES activity was affected to varying degrees (Fig. 6A). L6A and V2A resulted in diffuse distribution in the majority of cells. A combination of I9A/L10A or L28A/L36A/L37A, however, changed subcellular distribution only slightly. The same sets of mutations were also tested in the full-length constructs (EGFP-AZ11-227). In this context, only the L6A mutation, either alone or in combination with other mutations, resulted in the disappearance of cytoplasmic distribution. Therefore, Leu-6 appears to be the most important residue for NES1 function. The difference in the results for EGFP-AZ11-68 and EGFP-AZ11-227 may be due to partial activity of the second NES as discussed below.Fig. 6Mutational analysis of NES1. A, hydrophobic residues of full-length AZ1 indicated by asterisks and numbers were replaced with alanine (independently or simultaneously). B, amino acid residues of AZ1-(1-68) indicated by asterisks were replaced independently or simultaneously with alanine. Cellular localization of each fusion protein was determined as for Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Second NES—In contrast to N-terminal truncated mutants losing nuclear exclusion, two longer truncations, namely EGFP-AZ1110-227 and EGFP-AZ1114-227, exhibited nuclear exclusion (Fig. 4A). In the absence of LMB, these fusion proteins were localized in the cytoplasm almost exclusively. Furthermore, shorter AZ1 regions containing residues 114-134 exhibited cytoplasmic distribution when fused with EGFP (EGFPAZ1110-150 and EGFP-AZ1114-134, in Fig. 4A) in the absence of LMB. For these constructs, LMB treatment induced diffuse distribution. This finding suggests that amino acid residues 114-134 contain a second NES (NES2) and that the N-adjacent region (residue 69-109) carries a regulatory element to NES2. The NES2 region also contains hydrophobic amino acid residues that are conserved among vertebrates and were present in the Drosophila sequence but show little similarity with the consensus sequences of the previously identified NES (Fig. 5). The contribution of the hydrophobic residues to NES2 activity was tested in EGFP-AZ1114-227 as described for NES1. Mutation at once of one or two hydrophobic residues, L116A, I118A, L122A, and L116A/L118A, had no effect on nuclear export. However, a combination of three mutations, L116A/I118A/L122A, or four mutations, L116A/I118A/T121A/L122A, abolished nuclear exclusion (Fig. 7A). Therefore, the hydrophobic residues also appear to be important for NES2 activity. The same combinations of mutations were introduced next to the full-length EGFP-AZ11-227. Both EGFP-AZ11-227 (L116A/I118A/L122A) and EGFP-AZ11-227 (L116A/I118A/T121A/L122A) were distributed mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7B). Observation of >200 cells revealed that the distribution of this mutant was identical to that of EGFP-AZ1 (wild type) both in the presence and absence of LMB (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the presence of a functional NES1 region in these mutants. For further testing of NES2 in the absence of NES1, we introduced substitutional mutations into both NES1 (L6A) and NES2 (L116A/I118A/L122A) regions of EGFP-AZ11-227. However, the fusion products formed aggregates in the cells and results were inconclusive. NES1 and NES2 Exhibit Activity to Export a Large Karyophilic Reporter Protein—The results thus far suggest that AZ1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that two NESs are responsible for this extranuclear transport. However, some of the constructs examined were small enough to diffuse freely through the nuclear envelope pores. Therefore, we constructed larger reporter proteins composed of two EGFPs connected in tandem ((EGFP)2). CHO cells were transfected with (EGFP)2 full-length AZ1 fusion constructs. (EGFP)2-AZ1 fusion protein was distributed in the cytoplasm in 80% LMB-untreated cells and both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm evenly in >90% LMB-treated cells (data not shown). To better investigate the nuclear export activity of AZ1 NESs, we introduced next a NLS from SV40 T-antigen and its mutant sequences at the N terminus of the (EGFP)2 reporter. The mutants of the SV40-NLS bear one (m1NLS and m2NLS) or two (m3NLS) lysine to alanine substitutions and are expected to have diminished NLS activity (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8B, (EGFP)2-AZ1 with the wild-type SV40 NLS was found predominantly in the nucleus and two mutants, m2NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1 and m3NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1 in the cytoplasm, in the absence of LMB. The other mutant, m1NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1, showed an intermediate distribution. In the presence of LMB, the distribution of the fusion proteins was shifted toward the nuclear direction for all of the constructs. These results demonstrate that nuclear import with the wild-type SV40-NLS seems to outbalance the export by the NESs of AZ1 and that m2NLS directs a desirable level of nuclear localization for measuring the activities of AZ1 NESs. We then measured the distribution of m2NLS-(EGFP)2 fusion protein with several mutants of AZ1. m2NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ11-50, which carries the NES1 region, and m2NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1114-227, which carries NES2 region, were observed predominantly in the cytoplasm as m2NLS-(EGFP)2 full-length AZ1 in the absence of LMB and showed diffuse or nuclear distribution in the presence of LMB. On the other hand, two constructs carrying mutations in NES1 (m2NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1L6A) or NES2 (m2NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1135-227) were not excluded from the nucleus and LMB had little effect on their distribution. Finally, non-fused m2NLS-(EGFP)2 reporter was efficiently accumulated in the nucleus irrespective of the presence of LMB. These results indicate that both NES1 and NES2 are functional when fused with a reporter protein that is 1) sufficiently large to avoid entering or exiting the nucleus by means of diffusion and 2) localized in the nucleus as a result of the attached NLS. In addition, this confirms the previous conclusions with the simple EGFP reporter that NES1, particularly Leu-6, is necessary for nuclear export of the full-length AZ1 and that either NES1 or NES2 is sufficient when attached to a reporter. NES1 Is Not Conserved in Drosophila AZ—As shown in Fig. 5, the N-terminal 12 amino acid residues of AZ1 are identical among all of the vertebrates and this region contains a cluster of hydrophobic residues sharing a similarity to known NES sequences. However, this region is not conserved in Drosophila AZ (D-AZ). On the other hand, the hydrophobic residues in the NES2 region (amino acids 114-134) are conserved among vertebrates as well as Drosophila. We investigated subcellular distribution of fusion protein of EGFP and the full-length D-AZ in CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 9, A and B, EGFP-D-AZ showed either nucleocytoplasmic or nuclear distribution and treatment with LMB promoted nuclear accumulation. This pattern is very similar to those seen for the AZ1 mutants having small N-terminal truncations (EGFP-AZ110-227 and EGFP-AZ134-227 in Fig. 4A). Because the CRM1-mediated nuclear export system is conserved between mammals and Drosophila (26Fasken M.B. Saunder R. Rosenberg M. Brighty D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1878-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is probable that NES1 is not present in D-AZ. It is also suggested that the NES2-like region of D-AZ is functional, but its activity is diminished in the full-length peptide. Characterization of AZ1 NES Regions—We demonstrated that AZ1 protein shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in mammalian cultured cells using LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Two NES regions, one at the N terminus (NES1) and the other in the central region of AZ1 (NES2), were identified. In the N-terminal region, 10 amino acid residues are conserved among vertebrates and the position of the hydrophobic residues match the known consensus sequences of CRM-dependent NESs (Fig. 5). Deletion of this region or mutation of a single hydrophobic residue (leucine 6 to alanine) abolished the cytosolic distribution of the fusion protein (Fig. 6A). Attachment of this 10 amino acid region to EGFP, however, was not sufficient to result in nuclear exclusion. A 50-residue N-terminal segment was necessary (Fig. 4B). Mutations of hydrophobic residues within residues 11-50 did not affect nuclear export (Fig. 6, A and B). The necessity of an extended segment for NES function is not typical of leucine-rich NESs (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 27Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) but is similar to the NES of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (28Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). NES2 is located within amino acid residues 114-134 where a cluster of hydrophobic residues also exists but does not share any similarities with known NESs. However, the sequence is conserved not only among vertebrates but also in Drosophila (Fig. 5). Point mutational analysis revealed that the hydrophobic residues within this segment, such as Leu-116, Ile-118, and Leu-122, are also important for its function (Fig. 7A). A striking feature of this signal is that it is not evident in full-length AZ1 (Fig. 7B). NES2 activity was only demonstrated clearly in 5′-truncation constructs, such as EGFP-AZ1110-227 and EGFPAZ1114-227, or constructs with a short segment, such as AZ1110-150 and AZ1114-134 (Fig. 4A and 8B). It is most likely that the N-terminal adjacent region (residues 69-109) contains an element(s) that masks or counteracts NES2 activity. However, a closer look at the effects of LMB on the distribution pattern of NES1 mutants such as EGFP-AZ110-227, EGFPAZ134-227 (Fig. 4A), and m2NLS-(EGFP)2-AZ1L6A (Fig. 8B) as well as NES1-lacking Drosophila AZ fused with EGFP (Fig. 9) indicate that NES2 is partially active in the presence of the putative negative element. Interestingly, this putative negative element does not inhibit NES1 (compare AZ11-68 and AZ11-134 in Fig. 4B). We attempted to further characterize the putative negative element with mutational analysis, but some of the key constructs such as EGFP-AZ169-134, EGFP-AZ169-110, and EGFP-AZ1L6A/L116A/I118A/L122A merely aggregated in the cells; thus, the results were inconclusive. Multiple Forms of AZ1 and NESs—There are two possible initiator AUG codons in the coding region of AZ1 mRNA. It has been shown that the second AUG at codon 34 is more often used but the translation product from first AUG codon (the fulllength product) is also present in vivo. Based on our observations, it is clear that the full-length AZ1 will be effectively exported from the nucleus. The product from the second AUG may be excluded from the nucleus but only weakly as it contains NES2 and the putative negative element but not NES1. It is also possible that NES2 is usually masked, but interaction between AZ1 and another protein induces a conformational change of AZ1 to activate NES2. Alternatively, NES2 may function in shorter variants of AZ1 generated by limited proteolysis (28Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). How Does AZ1 Enter the Nucleus?—Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins can enter the nucleus either by simple diffusion or by active transport mechanisms. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) creates aqueous channels ∼9 nm in diameter, which allow the diffusion of small proteins with relative molecular masses of 40-60 kDa (29Pante N. Abei U. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 19: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar, 30Davis L.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 865-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). EGFP-AZ1 has a molecular mass of ∼54 kDa and can probably enter the nucleus by simple diffusion. However, the strong nuclear accumulation of EGFP fused with full-length AZ1 was observed in the presence of LMB, suggesting that AZ1 probably includes an NLS. In the presence of LMB, N-terminal deletions up to residue 113 predominantly accumulated in the nucleus. In contrast, EGFPAZ1135-227 was evenly distributed both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 4A). None of the C-terminal truncated constructs exhibited nuclear localization in the presence of LMB. These results suggest that an NLS is located within the C-terminal half of AZ1, partially overlapping NES2. However, we were unable to further characterize this NLS by mutational analysis, partly because of aggregation of fusion proteins. In addition, no sequences within this region showed any homology with previously known NLS sequences (31Dingwall C. Sharnick S.V. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1982; 30: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 32Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some nuclear proteins are known to enter the nucleus by binding to importin α or β via an atypical non-basic sequence (33Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34Jullien D. Gorckich D. Laemmli U.K. Adachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alternatively, binding to another nuclear protein may target a protein to the nucleus (35Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4114-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It is possible that AZ1 enters the nucleus via one of these mechanisms. Putative Function of AZ1 in the Nucleus—Gritli-Linde et al. (16Gritli-Linde A. Nilssom J. Bohlooly Y.M. Heby O. Linde A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 259-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that antizyme protein is present in the nucleus during mouse development. They also discovered that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to the nuclear accumulation of ODC and suggested that AZ1 is translocated into the nucleus and involved in the degradation of ODC. Our results support the nuclear translocation of AZ1 and provide evidence that AZ1 not only enters the nucleus but also is exported from the nucleus. Consequently, AZ1 may bind to ODC in the nucleus and escort it during cytoplasmic translocation, possibly followed by targeting ODC for the cytoplasmic 26 S proteasomes. Wang et al. (17Gruendler C.

AZ1 may regulate other molecules such as signal transducers or cell cycle regulatory proteins in the nucleus. Because NES1 seems to exert stronger activity than NES2, NES-facilitated nuclear egress is most probably related to functions of the full-length AZ1 (residues 1-227), which is a minor translation product from AZ1 mRNA compared with the product from the second AUG (residues 33-227) (15Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, more active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, either with or without ODC, might be a specific role of the full-length AZ1. Most mammalian cells express another family member, AZ2. AZ2 is evolutionally more conserved than AZ1 (36Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its role is unknown. AZ2 does not have any regions corresponding to the N terminus of AZ1, which includes NES1. However, we found that AZ2 also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, 2N. Murai and S. Matsufuji, manuscript in preparation. thus opening the possibility to clarify its novel function. It is noteworthy that an antizyme fraction was also found in the mitochondrial preparation and that a putative mitochondrion targeting signal (MTS) at the N terminus, which partially overlaps with NES1, is implicated in the mitochondrial localization (15Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Gandre S. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Mitochondrion. 2003; 2: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In our experiments, possible interplay between MTS and NES1, are not addressed, but attaching reporter proteins at the N terminus should inactivate the MTS. Both NES1 and the putative MTS should be present in the short, non-frameshifting translation product between the first AUG and the frameshift site (residues 1-68). This product must be routinely synthesized in the cells irrespective of the cellular polyamine concentration (11Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 1360-1370Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether it has any physiological function. The short product, however, would enter the nucleus by diffusion, and if bound to other nuclear molecules such as signal transducers or cell cycle proteins, it would effectively bring them to the cytoplasm as a result of its NES1 activity. Our results suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of AZ1 and particularly the nuclear export is a potential regulatory point. We thank Drs. J. F. Atkins and I. P.

https://openalex.org/W2119931220,"SRm160 (the SR-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa) functions as a splicing coactivator and 3'-end cleavage-stimulatory factor. It is also a component of the splicing-dependent exon-junction complex (EJC), which has been implicated in coupling of pre-mRNA splicing with mRNA turnover and mRNA export. We have investigated whether the association of SRm160 with the EJC is important for efficient 3'-end cleavage. The EJC components RNPS1, REF, UAP56, and Y14 interact with SRm160. However, when these factors were tethered to transcripts, only SRm160 and RNPS1 stimulated 3'-end cleavage. Whereas SRm160 stimulated cleavage to a similar extent in the presence or absence of an active intron, stimulation of 3'-end cleavage by tethered RNPS1 is dependent on an active intron. Assembly of an EJC adjacent to the cleavage and polyadenylation signal in vitro did not significantly affect cleavage efficiency. These results suggest that SRm160 stimulates cleavage independently of its association with EJC components and that the cleavage-stimulatory activity of RNPS1 may be an indirect consequence of its ability to stimulate splicing. Using RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans, we determined whether interactions between SRm160 and the cleavage machinery are important in a whole organism context. Simultaneous RNAi of SRm160 and the cleavage factor CstF-50 (Cleavage stimulation factor 50-kDa subunit) resulted in late embryonic developmental arrest. In contrast, RNAi of CstF-50 in combination with RNPS1 or REFs did not result in an apparent phenotype. Our combined results provide evidence for an evolutionarily conserved interaction between SRm160 and the 3'-end cleavage machinery that functions independently of EJC formation."
https://openalex.org/W2125007056,"Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) is known to play an important role in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling, which rapidly becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon HGF stimulation. In this study, we found that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 in the cells derived from Src/Yes/Fyn null mouse embryos was ∼40% lower than that in their wild type counterparts upon HGF stimulation. Increased expression of wild-type Src enhanced HGF-induced phosphorylation of Gab1, and, in contrast, expression of the Src kinase-deficient mutant or treatment of the specific Src inhibitor PP1 suppressed it. Expression of a constitutively active Src mutant (Y527F) or oncogenic v-Src led to a prominent increase in Gab1 phosphorylation independent of HGF stimulation. Moreover, Src interacted with Gab1 via both its Src homology 2 and 3 domains and was capable of phosphorylating purified Gab1 in vitro. Finally, the increased phosphorylation of Gab1 by Src selectively potentiated HGF-induced activation of ERK and AKT. Taken together, our results establish a new role for Src in HGF-induced Gab1 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2042462653,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) are important regulators of endocytic trafficking. Previous studies have shown that mutant human platelet-derived growth factor-β receptors (PDGFR), which contain Phe in place of Tyr at the two p85/p110 PI 3-kinase binding sites (PDGFR-F/F), are defective for both p85 binding and ligand-stimulated degradation. This suggested that p85/p110 regulates PDGFR trafficking. However, more recent work has identified hVPS34, and not p85/p110, as the major PI 3-kinase regulating the movement of receptors through the endosomal system. To reconcile this discrepancy, we hypothesized that YXXM motifs in the PDGFR might play a second role as Tyr-based lysosomal sorting motifs (YXXΦ). To test this, we replaced both YXXM motifs with a motif from LAMP-1, YQTI. This mutant PDGFR (PDGFR-YQTI) still underwent PDGF-stimulated autophosphorylation but did not bind p85. In CHO cells, both wild-type and YQTI receptors showed PDGF-stimulated turnover, whereas F/F receptors did not. In addition, uptake and degradation of cell surface-labeled YXXM and YQTI receptors was fast relative to F/F receptors. We also constructed chimeras containing extracellular and membrane-spanning domains from CD25 (Tac) and cytoplasmic tails containing the YQTI motif, two YXXM motifs, or two mutant FXXM motifs. The YXXM and YQTI chimeras mediated lysosomal delivery of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD25 antibodies, whereas the F/F chimera was defective. Thus, YQTI motifs can target PDGFR for degradation in the absence of p85/p110 binding, and the p85/p110 binding motifs from PDGFR are sufficient to target Tac chimeras to the lysosome. These data suggest that the YXXM motifs in the PDGFR serve two distinct functions: PI 3-kinase recruitment and lysosomal targeting.

The Class IB PI 3-kinase, PI3Kγ, interacts directly with β-arrestin kinase I, leading to an increase in β-adrenergic receptor endocytosis (18Naga Prasad S.V. Laporte S.A. Chamberlain D. Caron M.G. Barak L. Rockman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The role of Class IA PI 3-kinases in the endocytosis of the PDGF-β receptor (PDGFR), a tyrosine kinase receptor that undergoes ligand-stimulated endocytosis and degradation, has been less clear. It was initially suggested that the post-endocytic of the PDGFR to lysosomes required p85/p110 PI 3-kinase. This proposal was based on the findings that degradation of the receptor was inhibited by treating cells with wortmannin or by mutating the two PI 3-kinase-binding sites (Y740 XXM and Y750 XXM) to phenylalanine (19Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies showed that the effects of wortmannin on PDGFR sorting could be mimicked by microinjection of inhibitory antibodies against hVPS34 but not by antibodies against p85/p110α (13Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Microinjection of inhibitory anti-p110β antibodies also had no effect. 2J. M. Backer, unpublished observations. Given the apparent role of hVPS34 as the major endosomal PI 3-kinase, the requirement for p85 binding motifs during PDGFR sorting has remained unexplained. We have tested the hypothesis that the PI 3-kinase binding motifs in the PDGFR serve a second function as endocytic sorting motifs for internalized PDGFRs. This hypothesis is based on the similarity between the consensus sequence for binding to p85 SH2 domain (YXXM) versus the consensus sequence for Tyr-based sorting (YXXΦ). Of receptors that use YXXM internalization motifs, CD63 and CTLA-4 in fact contain the motif YEVM and YVKM, respectively (20Metzelaar M.J. Wijngaard P.L. Peters P.J. Sixma J.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 144-151PubMed Google Scholar). We find that replacement of the PI 3-kinase binding motifs in the PDGFR with an unrelated sorting motif from LAMP-1 (YQTI) produces a receptor that cannot bind PI 3-kinase but undergoes normal ligand-stimulated degradation. Moreover, the YXXM motif from the PDGFR functions as an endocytosis motif in an exogenous context. Our data support the hypothesis of a dual role for YXXM motifs in receptor signaling and endocytic trafficking. Cell Culture and Transfections—Two CHO-derived lines, GRC LR-73 cells (22Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and TRV cells (23McGraw T.E. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), were cultured as described. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE-Plus (Invitrogen) and selected by culture in G418. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—The wild-type human PDGF-β receptor cDNA was obtained from Dr. D. Bottaro, EntreMed, Inc., Rockville, MD. The wild-type sequence was mutated to GF740 MDMSKAESVDFMPM (PDGFR-F/F) or GY740 QTISKDESVGYQTI (PDGFRYQTI) (bolded residues indicate mutations) using standard 4-primer PCR techniques. The Tac-YQTI construct (24Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), containing the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains from Tac and the C-terminal of LAMP-1 (RSHAGYQTI), was provided by Dr. M. Marcks, University of Pennsylvania. To make Tac-PDGFR chimeras, the residues DGGYMDMSKDESVDYVPM or DGGFMDMSKDESVDFVPM were introduced in place of the LAMP-1 sequence using standard 4-primer PCR techniques. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Western Blots—Samples were blotted with antiphosphotyrosine (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85α. PDGF Uptake and Degradation—Quiescent TRV cells expressing WT or mutant PDGFRs were incubated with 50,000 cpm/ml 125I-PDGF (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in F12 medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS at 4 °C and warmed in F12, 1% BSA at 37 °C. After various times the medium was removed, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts in the supernatant were counted and expressed as a percentage of initial 125I-PDGF bound. Untransfected control cells showed minimal PDGF degradation (data not shown). Metabolic Labeling and Turnover Studies—TRV cells expressing the WT or mutant PDGFRs were labeled overnight in serum-free medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were washed in PBS and incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Calbiochem). After 2 h the cells were washed in cold PBS, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFRβ antibody (Calbiochem). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography using Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PDGF-stimulated degradation was determined as the difference between unstimulated and PDGF-stimulated degradation, expressed as a percentage of the initial labeled receptors. Degradation of Receptors Labeled with Anti-PDGF Receptor Antibodies—Anti-PDGFRβ antibodies (Calbiochem) were iodinated using Chloramine T and desalted by chromatography on Sepharose G25. Labeled antibodies were more than 98% trichloroacetic acid precipitable. Quiescent TRV cells expressing wild-type or mutant PDGFRs were incubated with labeled antibodies in medium containing 1% BSA for 90 min on ice, washed, and then warmed to 37 °C in F12 medium, 1% BSA containing 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Calbiochem). At various times the medium was removed and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Soluble radioactivity was counted and expressed as a percentage of initial cell-associated radioactivity. Degradation of Biotinylated Receptors—TRV cells expressing wild-type or YQTI PDGFRs were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) on ice (25Rosenwald A.G. Machamer C.E. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3581-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cells were either lysed directly or after warming to 37 °C for 1 h in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml PDGF. Receptors were immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized with avidin-HRP and ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were quantitated by densitometry using NIH Image software. Immunofluorescence Studies—GRC LR-73 cells stably expressing Tac-YQTI, Tac-PDGFR, or Tac-PDGFR-F/F chimeras were incubated overnight in medium containing 100 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin and then for an additional 4 h at 37 °C with FITC-labeled anti-CD25 antibody (Ancel). Fixed cells were imaged with a Nikon E-400 upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon 60× 1.4 N.A. plan-apo oil immersion, infinity-corrected objective. When indicated, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and stained with anti-LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 antibodies (provided by Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo, Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Images were acquired with a Cohu 4910 camera and NIH Image 1.62 analysis software and assembled using Adobe PhotoShop. Replacement of YXXM Motifs in the PDGF Receptor with GYQTI blocks p85 Binding without Affecting Autophosphorylation or Internalization—Mutation of Tyr740 and Tyr751 to phenylalanine abolishes p85 binding to activated PDGFRs and inhibits post-endocytic sorting (19Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); autophosphorylation at other tyrosine residues is not affected (26Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that YXXM motifs in the PDGFR act as tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motifs, we created mutant receptors in which the Y740MDM and Y751VPM motifs were both replaced with the sorting motif from LAMP-1, GYQTI. In TRV cells stably expressing the WT-PDGFR or the double YQTI mutant (PDGFRYQTI), both WT and YQTI mutant receptors underwent PDGF-stimulated autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A). However, only the WT receptor showed significant association with p85 (Fig. 1B). The preservation of tyrosine autophosphorylation in the PDGFR mutants is important, as defects in receptor tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation can affect endocytic behavior (27Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Schlessinger J. Hopkins R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Mutation of the p85 binding sites in the PDGFR (PDGFRF/F) affects post-endocytic trafficking but not internalization (19Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the degradation of 125I-labeled PDGF by the cells expressing wild-type, PDGFR-YQTI, and PDGFR-F/F receptors, a process that reflects both receptor internalization and post-endocytic sorting of ligands to the lysosome. As expected, release of degraded 125I-PDGF was identical for all three lines (Fig. 2). Potential differences in post-endocytic processing of the receptors is not reflected in this measurement, since PDGF dissociates from its receptor in the acidic early endosome. PDGF-YQTI Receptors Undergo Normal PDGF-stimulated Degradation—To evaluate the post-endocytic sorting of internalized wild-type and mutant receptors, the stable lines were labeled overnight with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased for 2 h in the absence or presence of PDGF. As previously shown (19Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), PDGF increases the degradation rate of WT receptors, whereas the PDGFR-F/F mutants show a loss of PDGF-stimulated degradation (Fig. 3A). However, PDGF-stimulated degradation in the PDGFR-YQTI cells was in fact greater than that in cells expressing wild-type receptors. We also evaluated the kinetics of cell surface PDGFR turnover by labeling cells with 125I-labeled anti-receptor antibodies at 4 °C followed by incubation at 37 °C in the presence of PDGF. Wild-type and YQTI receptors were degraded at similar rates, whereas degradation of PDGFR-F/F was significantly slower (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that the rates of degradation in this experiment reflect basal plus PDGF-stimulated turnover of cell surface receptors, as opposed to Fig. 3A, which measures PDGF-stimulated degradation of total cell receptors. To directly measure the effect of PDGF on the degradation of cell surface receptors, we biotinylated the cells at 4 °C followed by incubation in the absence or presence of PDGF for 1 h and analysis by immunoprecipitation and avidin-HRP blotting. In cells expressing wild-type or YQTI receptors, PDGF-stimulated degradation was similar, with only 30–40% of receptors remaining after 1 h of PDGF stimulation. In contrast, more than 85% of F/F receptors remained in cells stimulated with PDGF for 1 h (Fig. 3C). Thus, using three different approaches, we have shown that the PDGFR-YQTI receptors are degraded in a manner that is indistinguishable from wild-type receptors, despite their inability to bind p85/p110 PI 3-kinases. YXXM Motifs Function as Endocytic Motifs in Chimeric Receptors—The ability of the YQTI motif to supplant the YXXM motif in the PDGFR suggests that YXXM motifs may function as tyrosine-based sorting motifs. In this case, YXXM motifs might be able to function as endocytic motifs in another context. We therefore transfected cells with chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains from CD25 (Tac) and an intracellular tail containing the 740–754 domain on the PDGF receptor, which contains both YXXM motifs. Both wild-type (Tac-PDGFR) and mutant (Tac-PDGFR-F/F) chimeras were constructed. For comparison, we used a previously described Tac-YQTI chimera that is sorted from the cell surface to lysosomes (24Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To measure delivery of the receptors to lysosomes, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-Tac antibodies for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors. The distribution of both Tac-YQTI and Tac-PDGFR chimeras were similar (Fig. 4A) and co-localized with a lysosomal marker (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the distribution of the Tac-PDGFR-F/F chimera showed minimal lysosomal accumulation and persistent cell surface labeling (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that the YXXM motifs can function as lysosomal sorting motifs in an exogenous context. Moreover, the Tyr-to-Phe mutation that blocks PDGF receptor degradation also disrupts lysosomal delivery of the Tac chimeras. These data reconcile the apparent requirement for p85 binding during PDGFR sorting (19Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol.

Aasland R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4175-4183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that post-endocytic sorting of the PDGFR does not require binding to p85/p110 PI 3-kinase but instead requires an appropriate tyrosine-based sorting motif. Thus, the LAMP-1 YQTI motif functions in the context of the PDGFR, and the PDGF YXXM motif functions in the context of the Tac chimera system. Our data suggest that the p85 binding sites in the PDGFRs serve a dual role in signaling and post-endocytic processing. We do not yet know the intracellular receptor for the PDGFR YXXM motif. We could detect binding between the intracellular tail of the PDGFR and the μ-subunits from AP-2 and, to a lesser extent, AP-3 adapters in two-hybrid studies (data not shown). However, this binding was not blocked by mutation of Tyr740 and Tyr751 to phenylalanine. Thus, additional sorting motifs in the receptor may also be involved in post-endocytic sorting. This is consistent with the finding that Tyr579 in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor is important for ligand-induced internalization (29Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4917-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to the sorting of the PDGFR, a Tyr-to-Phe substitution within the YXXM motif is not tolerated. Aromatic substitutions are tolerated in some endocytic motifs although not in lysosomal acid phosphatase and a truncated mannose 6-phosphate receptor (30Peters C. Braun M. Weber B. Wendland M. Schmidt B. Pohlmann R. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4917-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of cell surface receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases is important for their internalization and subsequent degradation (32Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 33Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For the EGF and PDGF receptors, recruitment of Cbl, which has ubiquitin-ligase activity, leads to receptor ubiquitination and endocytosis (34Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S.

A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination of an internalization-defective EGF receptor or a truncated PDGFR lacking the intracellular domain is sufficient to drive endocytosis and degradation (37Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cbl-/- fibroblasts, EGFR internalization is normal whereas degradation is impaired (39Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Lakku Reddi A. Ghosh A.K. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N. Donoghue S. Rogers R.A. Bowtell D. Naramura M. Gu H. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). Although these studies point to Cbl-mediated ubiquitination as an important regulator of endocytic sorting, it is unlikely that this accounts for the phenotype of the PDGFR Phe740/Phe751 mutant. Cbl binds to the PDGFR via an N-terminal kinase-binding domain, which contains an atypical SH2 domain (40Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although the preferred phosphotyrosine motif for the N terminus of Cbl was predicted to be D(N/D)X(pY) (41Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain complexed with the Zap-70 binding peptide suggests that Cbl binds to the motif NX(pY)XXEΦ (40Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Neither sequence is consistent with the DGGYMDMSKDESVDYVPML sequence in the PDGFR. Although recruitment of Cbl to the PDGFR can also occur via the APS adapter protein, APS binds to Y1021 in the PDGFR but not to Tyr740/Tyr751 (43Yokouchi M. Wakioka T. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Ohtsuka S. Sasaki A. Ohtsubo M. Valius M. Inoue A. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the YXXM motif in the PDGFR appears to serve two distinct functions during receptor signaling versus receptor targeting, it most likely does not do both at the same time. Structural studies on μ-subunit/YXXM motif interactions suggest that a phosphotyrosine residue should not be tolerated (44Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E.M. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, during the initial phase of receptor activation, binding of p85 SH2 domains to phosphorylated YXXM motifs could preclude interactions with the cellular sorting machinery. Once PDGF dissociates in the acidic environment of the endosome, the balance between ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation and phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation would shift, leading to a loss of p85 binding. Alternatively, recent data suggest that receptor dephosphorylation occurs when the receptor reaches membrane-associated PTP2A in the endoplasmic reticulum (45Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In either case, this would facilitate the sorting of the internalized receptor toward the degradative pathway. This is consistent the finding that the epidermal growth factor receptor undergoes endosomal dephosphorylation prior to degradation (28Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This model is related to one proposed for the CTLA-4 receptor in T-cells, where the phosphorylation of a YVKM motif determines whether the receptor binds to the Syp tyrosine phosphatase or to AP-2 adapters (42Shiratori T. Miyatake S. Ohno H. Nakaseko C. Isono K. Bonifacino J.S. Saito T. Immunity. 1997; 6: 583-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, in the case of CTLA-4, tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr165 prevents endocytosis of the receptor. This is not the case for the PDGFR. Our data shows that p85 binding motifs in the PDGFR act as tyrosine-based sorting motifs for the lysosomal delivery of internalized receptors. Dephosphorylation of tyrosine-based motifs may serve as a switch between receptor signaling and degradation, thereby providing a synergistic mechanism for the termination of receptor-mediated signals.

Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health) for two-hybrid constructs for the μ1, μ2, and μ3 adapters, and Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) for antibodies to LAMP-1 and LAMP-2."

To address this issue, we transfected macrophages with chimeric proteins containing the cytoplasmic tails and transmembrane regions of the LDL receptor or LRP and the ectodomain of CD2, which can bind non-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). Macrophages expressing receptors containing the LDL receptor domains were able to bind but not internalize SRBCs. In contrast, macrophages expressing receptors containing the cytoplasmic tail of LRP were able to bind and internalize SRBCs. Chimeras in which the LRP cytoplasmic tail was mutated in two di-leucine motifs and a tyrosine in an NPXYXXL motif were able to endocytose anti-CD2 antibody and bind SRBCs, but SRBC phagocytosis was decreased by 70%. Thus, the phagocytic-like functions of LRP, but not those of the LDL receptor, can be explained by the ability of the LRP cytoplasmic tail to trigger phagocytosis. These findings have important implications for atherogenesis and apoptotic cell clearance and for a fundamental cell biological understanding of how the LDL receptor and LRP function in internalization processes.

These findings have important implications for atherogenesis and apoptotic cell clearance and for a fundamental cell biological understanding of how the LDL receptor and LRP function in internalization processes. The ability of macrophages to internalize large particles by the process known as phagocytosis represents a key property of this cell type (1Greenberg S. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 681-701Google Scholar). A variety of macrophage receptors have been demonstrated to mediate phagocytosis, including receptors that bind to the IgG-Fc domain, mannose residues, and complement after these molecules have opsonized cells. The process of phagocytosis involves a cascade of signaling reactions that orchestrate changes in the actin cytoskeleton and the delivery of internal membranes to the engulfing regions of the macrophage plasma membrane. These signaling reactions are coordinated by the recruitment of actin- and membrane-related signal transduction molecules, including tyrosine kinases, by the cytoplasmic tails of these phagocytic receptors (1Greenberg S. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 681-701Google Scholar). Indeed, the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors mentioned above can trigger phagocytosis in chimeric receptors containing ectodomains from non-phagocytic receptors (2Kruskal B.A. Sastry K.

Moreover, work from a number of laboratories has shown that the LDL receptor itself mediates the uptake of large LDL aggregates (9Sakr S.W. Eddy R.J. Barth H. Wang F. Greenberg S. Maxfield F.R.

The internalization of matrix-retained LDL by LRP and aggregated LDL by the LDL receptor are thought to contribute to the critical event of foam cell formation during atherogenesis (16Tabas I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both of these processes can be distinguished from receptor-mediated endocytosis by their increased susceptibility to inhibitors of actin polymerization, actin signaling molecules (e.g. Rac1 and Cdc42), myosin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases (9Sakr S.W.

Despite these findings and the physiological importance of LRP- and LDL receptor-mediated phagocytic-like processes, there has been no direct proof that either receptor can directly mediate phagocytosis. With this background, the goal of the current study was to apply a rigorous cell biological test to the question of whether LRP and the LDL receptor can function like known phagocytic receptors, such as IgG-Fc receptors and the mannose receptor. As alluded to above, the test is based upon the idea that phagocytic receptors contain amino acid sequences in their cytoplasmic tail, or tail plus transmembrane region, that are able to direct the uptake of large particles (e.g. red blood cells (RBCs)) using their own or heterologous ectodomains (2Kruskal B.A. Sastry K.

Our data show that whereas the LDL receptor fails this critical test, the cytoplasmic tail of LRP can, in fact, direct RBC phagocytosis in chimeric receptor model. These findings have important implications for mechanisms of foam cell formation and apoptotic cell clearance and for a fundamental cell biological understanding of how these two important members of the LDL receptor family function in internalization processes.

Organic solvents as well as all other reagents were from Fisher Scientific. Cell Culture—RAW-LR5 macrophages were derived from RAW 264.7 cells as described (20Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell types were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 125I-LDL Degradation Experiments—Aggregated 125I-LDL was prepared by vortexing 250 μg/ml 125I-LDL at the highest setting for 30 s. RAW-LR5 macrophages were plated at ∼50% confluency and incubated the next day with 20 μg/ml vortex-aggregated 125I-LDL for 24 h. The media were assayed for 125I-LDL degradation as described (9Sakr S.W. Eddy R.J. Barth H. Wang F. Greenberg S. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37649-37658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the macrophages were incubated with the lipoproteins for 5 h and then chased in medium without labeled LDL for an additional 19 h. Chimeric Receptor Construction—First, a CD2 ectodomain construct flanked by HindIII and BamH1 sites was prepared by PCR from CD2 cDNA (see Fig. 2). Next, the following five constructs were prepared by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from RAW-LR5 macrophages: (a) cytoplasmic tail of the LDL receptor flanked by MluI and NotI, (b) cytoplasmic tail plus transmembrane domain of the LDL receptor flanked by BamH1 and NotI, (c) cytoplasmic tail of LRP flanked by MluI and NotI, (d) cytoplasmic tail plus transmembrane domain of LRP flanked by BamHI and NotI, and (e) cytoplasmic tail plus transmembrane domains of γ-chain (γ:γ) flanked by BamH1 and NotI. In addition, a separate construct containing the cytoplasmic tail plus transmembrane domain of LRP was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to effect alanine substitutions for both di-leucine sequences and for the tyrosine in the NPVY sequence, as indicated in Fig. 2. Using PCR, a construct containing the transmembrane domain and the mutated tail flanked by BamH1 and NotI was made. To create CD2:CD7:LDLR, we began with the construct with CD16:CD7:lck in pCDM8 (4Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CD16 was replaced with CD2 using the HindIII and BamHI sites to obtain CD2:CD7:lck, and lck was then replaced with the LDLR cytoplasmic tail construct using the MluI and NotI sites. To construct CD2:LDLR:LDLR, the CD7:lck was replaced with LDLR:LDLR using the BamHI and NotI sites. The same strategy was used to create the three LRP containing constructs and CD2:γ:γ, using the fragments listed above. Transient Transfection of RAW-LR5 Macrophages—RAW-LR5 macrophages were transiently transfected with the constructs described above in pCDM8 using Superfect transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, on day 1, the macrophages were plated in wells in 12-well dishes so that they were ∼70% confluent on day 2. At that time, the cells were transfected using 2.5 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Superfect per well for 3–4 h. The transfection mix was then removed, and cells from each well were replated onto three round coverslips in wells of 24-well dishes. The transfected macrophages were assayed for CD2 expression, antibody endocytosis, and SRBC binding and internalization on day 3. Assays for CD2 Expression, Endocytosis, and SRBC Binding and Internalization—After washing five times in BWD buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm dextrose, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), 2 × 106 SRBCs in 300 μl were added to each well of transfected macrophages and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. To assay cell surface CD2 expression, the cells were incubated on ice with 1:400 mouse anti-CD2 antibody for 30 min, followed by 1:400 Alexa-594 goat anti-mouse IgG. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and viewed by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX 70 inverted microscope equipped with an RS-Photometrics Cool Snap CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Images were acquired using Roper Scientific RS Image software. To assay endocytosis by the chimeric receptors, which also served as the assay for CD2 expression in macrophages transfected with the LRP-containing constructs, the cells were incubated with 1:20 phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD2 antibody for 30 min at 37 °C, and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and viewed using an LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with Zeiss LSM Image 5 Image Browser software. To assay SRBC binding and internalization, the macrophages were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and viewed by phase microscopy. In certain experiments, simultaneous staining for cellular CD2 and SRBCs was done as follows: after incubation with SRBCs, the macrophages were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and then incubated for 5 min with BWD buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were then rinsed and incubated with both 1:20 PE-labeled anti-CD2 antibody and 1:400 rabbit antiserum to SRBCs, followed by incubation with 1:400 Cy-2-labeled goat anti rabbit IgG. To assay phagocytosis, non-internalized SRBCs were removed by hypotonic lysis using 0.2% NaCl. The macrophages were then fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and viewed by phase microscopy using the Olympus IX 70 inverted microscope described above. Phagocytic index was assessed by averaging the number of internalized SRBCs in macrophages with at least one internalized SRBC. Statistics—All bar graph values are given as means ± S.E.

Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we studied the ability of RAW-LR5 macrophages to internalize and degrade large, vortexed-induced aggregates of 125I-LDL. LDL aggregates are abundant in atherosclerotic lesions and likely contribute to macrophage foam cell formation during atherogenesis (16Tabas I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, these macrophages internalize and degrade vortex-aggregated 125I-LDL. Most importantly, aggregated 125I-LDL was up-regulated by sterol depletion and markedly suppressed by sterol loading to a degree almost identical to that seen with the standard LDL receptor ligand, monomeric LDL (Fig. 1A and inset). Therefore, RAW-LR5 macrophages, like other macrophages (11Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Suits A.G. Chait A.

Lipidol. 2002; 13: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), internalize and degrade large aggregates of LDL by a mechanism that is strongly dependent on the LDL receptor. We next sought to determine if the degradation of aggregated 125I-LDL by RAW-LR5 macrophages was susceptible to inhibitors of actin polymerization and other processes that are often used to distinguish phagocytosis from receptor-mediated endocytosis. We utilized four such inhibitors: cytochalasin D (actin); LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase); BDM (myosin); and genistein (tyrosine kinases) (9Sakr S.W. Eddy R.J. Barth H. Wang F. Greenberg S. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37649-37658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, each of the four inhibitors decreased the degradation of aggregated 125I-LDL to a substantially greater degree than that of monomeric 125I-LDL, which is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, RAW-LR5 macrophages internalize and degrade aggregated LDL by a process that is largely dependent on the LDL receptor and on a variety of cellular processes that are often associated with phagocytosis. The Cytoplasmic Tail and Transmembrane Regions of the LDL Receptor Are Not Sufficient to Mediate the Phagocytosis of Sheep Red Blood Cells—In view of the above data, we sought to determine if the LDL receptor had a key structure-function property of known phagocytic receptors, namely, the ability of its cytoplasmic tail with or without its transmembrane region to direct the internalization of large particles using a chimeric receptor system (2Kruskal B.A. Sastry K.

To carry out these experiments, we took advantage of an experimental system described by Allen and co-workers (5Hutchinson M.J. Harrison P.T. Floto R.A. Allen J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this system, chimeric receptors containing the ectodomain of the T cell surface protein CD2, which binds the LFA molecule of non-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), are expressed in macrophages (5Hutchinson M.J. Harrison P.T. Floto R.A. Allen J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These CD2-expressing macrophages, unlike control macrophages, can bind these SRBCs. Most importantly, when the chimeric CD2 molecule contains the cytoplasmic tail of a bona fide phagocytic receptor, like that of FcγRII, the transfected macrophages can phagocytose non-opsonized SRBCs (5Hutchinson M.J. Harrison P.T. Floto R.A. Allen J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this context, we created two constructs containing the CD2 ectodomain and the LDL receptor cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 2, first two constructs). The transmembrane region of the first construct (CD2:CD7:LDLR) contained the CD7 transmembrane domain, which was used previously in similar phagocytosis experiments (4Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The transmembrane region of the second construct (CD2:LDLR:LDLR) contained the transmembrane domain of the LDL receptor itself. As a positive control, we also created a CD construct (CD2:γ:γ) in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were from γ-chain (Fig. 2, sixth construct), a molecule that mediates the phagocytosis of FcγRI and RIII. RAW-LR5 macrophages were transiently transfected with these constructs and assayed for the following: expression of cell surface CD2 via binding of anti-CD2 antibody to fixed cells, followed by Alexa-594-labeled secondary antibody; cell surface binding and internalization (phagocytosis) of SRBCs by phase microscopy before and after hypotonic lysis of the SRBCs, respectively; and internalization of fluorescently labeled monomeric anti-CD2 antibody (endocytosis) via confocal microscopy. To validate the experimental system, we first showed that CD2-expressing macrophages transfected with CD2:γ:γ were able to both bind and phagocytose SRBCs (Fig. 3A, third row of images). Internalization of the SRBCs was confirmed by showing that they were not labeled by an anti-SRBC antibody under non-permeabilization conditions but were labeled in permeabilized macrophages (data not shown). In stark contrast, macrophages expressing CD2:CD7:LDLR or CD2:LDLR:LDLR, while showing excellent SRBC binding, were completely unable to internalize the SRBCs (Fig. 3A, first and second row of images). Mock-transfected macrophages were unable to bind or internalize SRBCs (Table I). When the data were quantified for a large number of cells (three groups of cells of 1000 each) and corrected for transfection efficiency, all three chimeric receptors were able to direct SRBC binding to a similar degree (37–47% of transfected cells), but only CD2:γ:γ was able to direct SRBC internalization (35.5% of transfected cells; see Table I and Fig. 3B). For those CD2:γ:γ-transfected macrophage internalizing at least one SRBC, the average number of SRBCs per macrophages was 3.4 ± 0.4 (Table I and Fig. 3C). To prove the functionality of the two LDL receptor-containing chimeric receptors, we showed that both were able to mediate the endocytosis of a monomeric ligand (Fig. 3, last column of images). Thus, neither the LDL receptor cytoplasmic tail nor the combination of the transmembrane region and tail is able to trigger the phagocytosis of bound SRBCs.Table ITransfection efficiency, SRBC binding, and SRBC internalization in macrophages transfected with chimeric receptors containing the CD2 ectodomain and the transmembrane and/or cytosolic tail domains of CD7, γ-chain, the LDL receptor, and LRP Transfection efficiency was determined by the percentage of macrophages expressing CD2 as assessed by cell-surface anti-CD2 antibody staining in the LDLR- and γ-chain-containing constructs or by internalization of anti-CD2 antibody in the LRP-containing constructs. For SRBC binding and internalization, the data listed under “% of transfected cell” were estimated by adjusting the denominator based on the transfection efficiency data: [(# per 1000 cells) ÷ (transfection efficiency)] × 10.

https://openalex.org/W1967237219,"Mammalian GATA transcription factors are expressed in various tissues in a temporally regulated manner. The prototypic member, GATA-1, is required for normal erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cell development. This family of DNA-binding proteins recognizes a consensus (A/T)GATA(A/G) motif and possesses homologous DNA binding domains consisting of two zinc fingers. The C-terminal finger of GATA-1 recognizes the consensus motif with nanomolar affinities, whereas the N-terminal finger shows a binding preference for a GATC motif, albeit with much reduced affinity (K d ≈ μm). The N-terminal finger of GATA-2 also shows a preference for an AGATCT binding site, with an increased affinity attributed to N- and C-terminal flanking basic residues (K d ≈ nm). To understand the differences in the binding specificities of the N- and C-terminal zinc fingers of GATA-1, we have constructed a series of swapped domain peptides. We show that the specificity for AGATAA over AGATCT arises from the C-terminal non-finger basic domain. Thus, the N-terminal finger binds preferentially to AGATAA once appended to the C-terminal arm of the C-terminal finger. We further show that this specificity arises from the highly conserved QTRNRK residues. The converse is, however, untrue in the case of the C-terminal finger; swapping of QTRNRK with the corresponding LVSKRA does not switch the DNA binding specificity from AGATAA to AGATCT. These results highlight the important role of residues adjacent to the CXXCX 17CNAC zinc finger motif (i.e. non-finger residues) in the specific recognition of DNA residues.

Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The C-terminal finger and flanking basic arm are both necessary and sufficient for binding to the GATA recognition sequence, (A/T)GATA(A/G) (3Martin D.I. Orkin S.H.

A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Even though the single N-terminal finger does not bind DNA independently with high affinity, it does stabilize GATA-1 interactions with some sites crucial for gene expression (3Martin D.I. Orkin S.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent reports, however, indicate that the N-terminal finger binds DNA with an affinity much lower than that observed for the C-terminal finger with binding occurring preferentially to GATC motifs (9Newton A. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite the similarities between the C- and N-terminal fingers (Fig. 1, peptides CC11 and NN4, respectively), the N-terminal finger does not recognize the AGATAA consensus motif, indicating that the flanking or poorly conserved linker residues may play a key role in DNA recognition. A role for the flanking residues has been pointed out in the case of the N-terminal finger of GATA-2 (10Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Like the N-terminal finger of GATA-1, this homologous finger shows a binding preference for GATC motifs. However, because of the additional basic region at the N terminus a higher binding affinity has been reported for this finger. Solution NMR studies of the complex formed between the C-terminal finger of cGATA-1 and the AGATAA DNA sequence highlight the role that the C-terminal basic arm plays in the high affinity recognition process (11Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Briefly, the C-terminal basic arm residues wrap around and lie in the minor groove forming specific contacts with the phosphates of bases C-13, T-25, and C-26 and the sugar portion of bases C-13, T-23, A-24, T-25, and C-26. The residues involved in these interactions all belong to the basic QTRNRK motif (residues Gln-209 to Lys-214 of cGATA-1). 1The abbreviations used are: c, chicken; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; dsDNA, double stranded DNA. The importance of these basic linker residues for the high affinity interactions of the C-terminal finger of GATA-1 with DNA has been further emphasized in a recent solution structure of the fungal AREA-DNA complex (12Starich M.R. Wikström M. Arst H.N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The basic C-terminal arm of AREA, which lacks the QTRNRK motif, wraps around the DNA. However, rather than lying in the minor groove, the arm runs parallel to the sugar phosphate backbone along the edge of the minor groove. It has been proposed that this accounts for the ∼1000-fold difference in affinity noted for the C-terminal finger of GATA-1 and the AREA single finger (12Starich M.R. Wikström M. Arst H.N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Do these different modes of C-terminal arm binding influence the DNA binding specificity of the GATA zinc fingers? To address this issue and understand the different specificities observed for the homologous N- and C-terminal fingers of the GATA proteins, we have constructed a series of swapped domain peptides. We show that replacement of the C-terminal arms of the N-terminal zinc fingers of GATA-1 and -2 with the corresponding C-terminal arm of the C-terminal finger of GATA-1 results in affinities and specificities similar to those noted for the native C-terminal finger. Furthermore, we show that replacement of the LVSKRA residues (residues Leu-155 to Ala-160 of cGATA-1) in the basic arm of the N-terminal zinc finger with the corresponding QTRNRK residues from the basic arm of the C-terminal finger are sufficient for the selective recognition of the GATA motif. Replacement of the QTRNRK residues with LVSKRA in the C-terminal zinc finger does not result in the loss of specificity for the GATAA motif; rather equal specificities are noted for both GATC and GATA motifs. These results highlight the role of the flanking residues in modulating the affinity and specificity of the GATA zinc fingers toward DNA. PCR primers used for the amplification and modification of cGATA-1 (2Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and cGATA-2 (10Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) N-terminal and C-terminal fingers were prepared. Primer pairs for the expression of His6-tagged peptides generate PCR products containing 5′ NdeI and 3′ BamHI sites used for cloning into a pET28a(+) vector (Novagen). Swapped domain GATA-1 constructs were prepared making use of DraIII sites at the junction of the C-terminal finger and the C-terminal basic arm (residues His-195 to Val-197) and primers containing DraIII sites for the corresponding junction at the N-terminal finger (residue Asn-141). In the case of the N-finger of GATA-2 fused to the C-terminal basic arm of GATA-1, primers matching His-445 of GATA-2 with His-138 of GATA-1 in the N-finger C-terminal arm construct were generated and used for the fusion construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of the LVSKRA and QTRNRK sequences were performed sequentially (i.e. SKRA ↔ RNRK followed by LV ↔ QT) with the appropriate primers and the Quick-Change (Stratagene) protocol. A similar approach was used for mutations of the α-helical zinc finger recognition region. GST fusion proteins were constructed by insertion of the digested GATA PCR products into pGEX-5X1 (Amersham Biosciences) restricted with EcoRI and SalI. These vectors, used to express the various peptides described in this study (Fig. 1), were verified by DNA sequencing. GST-GATA-1 and GST-GATA-2 N-finger Fusion Proteins—The GST N-terminal fusions to cGATA-1 N-finger/C-terminal arm (peptide NC1) and cGATA-2 N-finger (peptide G19) were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (Novagen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 50 μm Zn(OAc)2 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Approximately 30 g of wet cells (from a 4-liter culture) were lysed in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm Zn(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A by sonication. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and loaded on a Q-Sepharose® Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through and rinse were combined and loaded on an S-Sepharose® Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). A 0.1 to 1.0 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm Zn(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used to elute the GST-GATA peptides. Fractions containing DNA binding activity, as monitored by EMSA, were pooled and further purified on a glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Fractions containing DNA binding activity were pooled and stored at -80 °C in 500-μl aliquots. GST fusion proteins were found to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). GATA-1 and GATA-2 Zinc Finger His 6 Peptides—The various histidine-tagged peptides were expressed in BL21 (DE3) STAR E. coli (Invitrogen) in LB broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μm Zn(OAc)2. Expression, following induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was carried out at 30 °C overnight to yield ∼40 g of wet cells (from a 10-liter culture). Purifications on Q- and SSepharose® Fast Flow columns were first carried out, as described above. Peptides were further purified on Hi-Trap Chelating HP (Amersham Biosciences) columns loaded with Ni2+. All peptides, except for NN5, which expressed poorly, were found to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Following purification, the peptides were dialyzed exhaustively against degassed (i) 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 14.3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, (ii) water, and (iii) 0.005% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. They were lyophilized to yield 80-120 mg of a dried powder; lower yields were obtained in the case of peptide NN5. Peptides were reconstituted with Zn2+ as described (11Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and stored in 20-μl aliquots at -80 °C. Experiments were usually performed right after zinc reconstitution as prolonged storage usually led to losses in the DNA binding activity. Binding site selection experiments were performed as described (13Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) using the GST N-terminal fusions to cGATA-1 N-finger/C-terminal arm (peptide NC1) and cGATA-2 N-finger (peptide G19). PCR amplification of the bound oligomers was carried out using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2 with annealing temperatures of 70 °C. These conditions yielded a single DNA product having the expected size. All PCR products were purified on 5% acrylamide gels in Tris borate EDTA buffer. Three selection cycles using binding conditions described (8Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol.

The final selection was carried out in the presence of an additional 50 mm NaCl. For each protein-DNA oligomer combination ∼100 selected clones were sequenced. Radioactively labeled DNA probes were designed based on the selection experiments. The twelve double stranded probes used had the sequence, TACAGGAGNNNNNNGGGTTGCG, with the sequences of the degenerate bases N described in Table III and subsequent figures. DNA binding experiments used to determine the dissociation constants were carried out as described (8Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol.

EMSA, used to assay the relative affinity of the various peptides (Fig. 1), were carried out in 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris, and 0.5 mm EDTA. In these experiments sufficient protein was added in a manner such that losses in the sample well were non-existent.

Published results have indicated that the N-terminal zinc finger of cGATA-2 binds to DNA with nanomolar affinities (10Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that selection experiments with this peptide were feasible. However, unlike GATA-2, the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 does not bind with high affinity to DNA (8Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Newton A. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the basic C-terminal arm of the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 is required for high affinity binding to DNA (3Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether the C-terminal arm could confer high affinity DNA binding to the N-terminal zinc finger, the basic arm of the N-terminal finger was exchanged for that of the C-terminal finger (peptide GST-NC1) for site selection experiments. Surprisingly, in addition to an increased binding affinity, changes in the DNA binding specificities were also observed. Three rounds of selection with this N-terminal finger/C-terminal arm construct show a distinct preference for AGATAA sites (Table I). Using both sets of initial random DNA oligomers, greater than 75% of the clones sequenced show that an AGATAA binding sequence is selected, followed by CGATAA (11%) and AGATAG (8%). This strong preference for a GATA motif reflects the binding preferences noted for the full-length cGATA-1 (13Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal zinc finger (4Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Whyatt D.J. deBoer E. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4993-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and contrasts the reported GATC specificities of the N-terminal zinc finger (9Newton A. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4993-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) suggesting a role for the C-terminal arm of the cGATA-1 DNA binding domain. It would have been instructive to carry out binding site selection experiments with the N-terminal finger of GATA-1, thus allowing for a direct comparison with the data in Table I. These experiments were not feasible. This peptide has a lower affinity for DNA than the N-terminal finger of GATA-2 (8Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Newton A. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and in our hands the latter peptide leads to a poorer definition of the sequence specificity (see below). Despite the lack of a direct comparison, data presented in Table III and Fig. 2 clearly demonstrate the role of the C-terminal arm in determining binding specificity.Table IBinding site selection for the N-terminal finger of GATA-1 fused to the C-terminal arm of GATA-1 (peptide NC1) Summary of the binding selection experiments after three rounds of selection.

These data differ from site selection experiments on the full-length cGATA-2 where a distinct preference for AGATAA and AGATCT is reported (13Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), reflecting the binding properties of the C-terminal finger of GATA-2. Binding studies on the N-terminal finger of GATA-2 have shown that this peptide has a preference for the GATC motif, binding with a K d of 5 nm to AGATCT and a K d of 28 nm to AGATAA (10Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Even though this difference in affinity is reflected partially in the selection experiments, in which AGATC is selected over AGATA in a 2.2:1 ratio (data not shown), an AGATCT site is not exclusively selected. This higher affinity for GATC motifs was further confirmed in a series of experiments in which the relative binding of the GATA-2 N-terminal finger for various DNA sites was determined (Fig. 2B). Unlike the fusion of the N-terminal fingers of GATA-1 and -2 to the C-terminal arm of GATA-1 (see below), it was not possible to determine the absolute binding affinities using a Scatchard analysis. This problem, essentially because of the micromolar affinities of interaction, was noted for many of the N-terminal finger constructs; it is for this reason that relative binding assays were performed. As in the case of the GATA-2 N-terminal finger, the GATA-1 N-terminal finger binds preferentially to GATC motifs (Fig. 2A). This specificity, noted previously by Newton et al. (9Newton A. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), indicates that the replacement of the basic arm of the N-terminal finger with that of the C-terminal finger (peptide NC1) is responsible for the altered DNA specificity.Table IIBinding site selection for the N-terminal finger of GATA-2 (peptide G19) Summary of the binding selection experiments after three rounds of selection. Nucleotides labeled S represent G, C, whereas V represents A, G, C. In the first experiment only two instances of the palindromic site, AGATCT, were noted. Unlike GATA-1 (Table I), a large number of selected sequences had double GAT sites. In the first experiment, 48 of the 107 sequences had double GAT sites, and consensus sequences for the oligomer-defined GAT are shown. The second selection experiment had 21 double sites.Start = NNNNNGATNNNNStart = NNNNNNNNNNNNOligomer selectedFrequencyOligomer selectedFrequencyAGATV68/107AGATN103/123GGATV24/107GGATV10/123CGATV15/107CGATS7/123TGATN0/107TGATN3/123 Open table in a new tab To confirm the role of the C-terminal basic arm of GATA-1 in the exclusive selection of a GATA motif, we measured the affinities of peptide NC1 for a series of GATA and GATC DNA oligomers (Table III). The majority of the sequences selected, namely AGATAA, CGATAA, and AGATAG (Table I), are bound with affinities of 3-5 nm, suggesting that the selection experiments are carried out under conditions such that only high affinity (K d < 10 nm) interactions are observed. The frequency of the sequences selected does not mirror the experimentally determined binding affinities. For example, peptide NC1 binds to a TGATAA motif with a K d of 3.2 nm, yet such a motif is selected with a frequency of less than 2% in one of the selection experiments. Furthermore, peptide NC1 shows a 10-fold lower affinity for the CGATAG motif even though a single clone containing this sequence was obtained (Table I). It is clear, nevertheless, that a distinct preference for the GATA motif exists with affinities similar to those observed for the binding of the C-terminal finger to AGATAA (4Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and other high affinity sites (8Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To further determine the role of the C-terminal arm in establishing a high affinity preference toward GATA motifs, a GATA-2 N-terminal zinc finger/GATA-1 C-terminal arm peptide (G20) was prepared. Unlike the GATA-2 N-finger (see this work and Ref. 11Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), this peptide shows a distinct high affinity preference for GATA motifs (Table III), in a manner similar to the analogous peptide NC1. Overall, these results demonstrate that fusion of the C-terminal basic arm of GATA-1 to the N-terminal zinc fingers of GATA-1 or -2 alters their binding specificity from GATC to that observed for the full-length protein or C-terminal zinc finger. Moreover, the binding affinities are similar to values noted for both the C-terminal zinc finger and the full-length GATA-1 (4Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Conserved QTRNRK C-terminal Arm Residues Are Sufficient to Alter the Specificity of the N-terminal Zinc Finger—Structural studies of the complex formed between the C-terminal zinc finger of cGATA-1 and the AGATAA DNA sequence show that the C-terminal basic arm forms a number of contacts with the sugar and phosphate backbone of bases T-23, A-24, and T-25 (i.e. equivalent to the ATA in AGATAAA) (11Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The highly conserved non-zinc finger QTRNRK residues (i.e. Gln-209 to Lys-214) are involved in this interaction. A BLAST analysis of the C-terminal arm of GATA-1, spanning residues Gln-196 to Arg-223, shows that the QTRNRK sequence is conserved as QTR-RK in the GATA-1 and -4 families or as QTRNRin the GATA-2 and -3 families. This conservation may account, in part, for the GATA motif binding specificity of the various members of the GATA-1, -2, and -3 (13Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 14Whyatt D.J. deBoer E. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4993-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and possibly -4 families, because the specificity of the full-length protein is usually determined by the specificity of the C-terminal zinc finger. Interestingly, the corresponding residues on the N-terminal zinc finger arm, namely LVSKRA spanning Leu-155 to Ala-160 of cGATA-1, are conserved in GATA-1 but not as conserved among the other GATA members. To evaluate the contribution of the QTRNRK residues on the C-terminal arm toward the DNA binding specificity, a number of constructs were designed (Fig. 1) such that (i) the basic LVSKRA residues of the arm of the N-terminal finger were replaced with QTRNRK (peptide NN6), and (ii) the QTRNRK residues of the arm of peptide NC1 were replaced with LVSKRA (peptide NC3). These constructs were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis in two steps, involving the interconversion of RNRK and SKRA, generating peptides NN5 and NC2 respectively, followed by the interconversion of the remaining QT and LV (peptides NN6 and NC3). Because of technical considerations resulting from the low DNA binding affinities observed for many of these peptides, single point binding analyses were carried out. To ensure that data were reproducible, assays were carried out in triplicate. Furthermore, experiments were designed such that the binding of a single peptide to various DNA binding sites was compared, rather than comparing the binding of different peptides to particular DNA sequences. This avoids the problem associated with the differential recovery of binding activity for the various peptides. Peptide NN5 binds preferentially to AGATCT and AGATCA motifs, albe"

Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Vol. 4. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1996: 137-164Google Scholar). PSII contains multiple protein subunits, most of which are hydrophobic and traverse the membrane. Intrinsic PSII proteins ligate the antenna and the reaction center chlorophylls, as well as other cofactors that take part in the oxidation/reduction reactions (2Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosyn. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These intrinsic subunits include the chlorophyll a-binding proteins, CP47 and CP43, the α and β subunits of cytochrome b 559, and the polypeptides known as D1 and D2. D1 and D2 form the heterodimeric core of PSII (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N.

A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The catalytic site of the oxygen-evolving complex contains a cluster of four manganese atoms. As water is oxidized, the manganese cluster cycles through five oxidation states, called the S n states (6Joliot P. Kok B. Govindjee Bioenergetics of Photosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1975: 388-412Google Scholar). Water oxidation is initiated by excitation of the primary chlorophyll donor, P680.P680* transfers an electron to pheophytin, which in turn reduces a bound plastoquinone, called QA. QA- reduces a second quinone, QB. QB acts as a two-electron and two-proton acceptor. On the donor side of PSII, P680+ oxidizes a redox active tyrosine, Z, which in turn oxidizes the catalytic site. Redox tyrosine YD and a chlorophyll, ChlZ, are alternate electron donors to P680+. Four sequential photooxidations are required for oxygen production (reviewed in Ref. 1Britt R.D. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Vol. 4. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht1996: 137-164Google Scholar). PSII contains several extrinsic subunits, which are bound to the inner lumenal surface of the reaction center (reviewed in Ref. 7Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The extrinsic subunits of PSII play key roles in enzymatic activity and stability, but the mechanism of these effects is still unknown. The largest extrinsic subunit is called the manganese stabilizing protein (MSP), and this subunit is found in plants, cyanobacteria, and eukaryotic algae. MSP can be removed from the reaction center with high concentrations of CaCl2 or with low concentrations of urea (8Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 252-260Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 9Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 375-378Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After its removal by these methods, the steady-state rate of oxygen evolution is decreased, and two manganese atoms are easily lost as Mn2+ (10Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Loss of manganese inactivates the enzyme; these MSP-dependent deactivation reactions can be prevented by addition of high concentrations of chloride to the preparation (10Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An Escherichia coli-expressed version of spinach MSP is able to functionally reconstitute oxygen evolution in spinach PSII, from which the native subunit has been removed (12Seidler A. Michel H.

B. 2002; 106: 8485-8488Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggest that MSP is a prolate ellipsoid in solution. Axial ratios of 4.2 (15Zubrzycki I.Z. Frankel L.K. Russo P.S. Bricker T.M.

However, FT-IR studies of MSP in solution have suggested some variability in its secondary structure content (19Lydakis-Simantiris N. Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Barry B.A. Yocum C.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as have protein mapping studies of MSP from different organisms (22Tohri A. Suzuki T. Okuyama S. Kamino K. Motoki A. Hirano M. Ohta H. Shen J.-R. Yamamoto Y. Enami I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results, as well as the high temperature stability of MSP, have been explained by the suggestion that MSP is an intrinsically disordered protein and that this intrinsic disorder is important in facilitating assembly (19Lydakis-Simantiris N. Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Barry B.A. Yocum C.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because MSP can be removed from PSII, expressed in E. coli, and then reconstituted to the enzyme, isotope editing was employed to study its functional role in PSII (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D.

MSP was isotopically edited via expression in an E. coli strain grown on 13C-labeled glucose. 13C-Labeled MSP was purified and bound to PSII. As the only 13C-labeled PSII subunit, MSP could then be detected with vibrational spectroscopy, which is sensitive to isotopic composition. Using this approach, FT-IR experiments showed that a substantial change in MSP secondary structure occurred with reconstitution (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with cross-linking studies, which also suggest a change in MSP structure upon PSII binding (24Enami I. Kamo M. Ohta H. Takahashi S. Miura T. Kusayanagi M. Tanabe S.

Difference FT-IR spectroscopy and isotope editing were also employed to identify MSP structural changes that occur during the S1 to S2 transition (23Hutchison R.S. Steenhuis J.J. Yocum C.F.

At 200 K, all transitions in the PSII photocycle are blocked, except the S1 to S2 transition, and electron transfer from QA to QB is also inhibited (see Ref. 25Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys.

This S state transition corresponds to a manganese oxidation reaction (see Ref. 28Roelofs T.A. Liang W. Latimer M.L. Cinco R.M. Rompel A. Andrews J.C. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Klein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3335-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, it is possible to obtain a S2QA--minus-S1QA FT-IR spectrum at 200 K by continuous illumination (see Ref. 29Steenhuis J.J. Hutchison R.S. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14609-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and references therein). A different S2QA--minus-S1QA FT-IR spectrum was obtained by laser flash illumination (see Refs. 30Noguchi T. Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 65-66Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Noguchi T. Tomo T. Kato C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Hillier W. Babcock G.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6035-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and references therein). Possible reasons for these spectral differences have been discussed (34Barry B.A. Photosyn. Res. 2000; 65: 197-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 35Halverson K.M. Barry B.A. Biophys.

J. 2003; 85: 2581-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A S2QB--minus-S1QB spectrum has also been reported (36Halverson K.M. Barry B.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2581-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 37Zhang H. Fischer G. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5511-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In our previous work, S2QA--minus-S1QA data were acquired under continuous illumination from natural abundance 12C-MSP- and 13C-MSP-reconstituted PSII. A comparison was performed by construction of a double difference, isotope-edited spectrum at 200 K (23Hutchison R.S. Steenhuis J.J. Yocum C.F. Razeghifard R.M. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31987-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). That analysis led to the conclusion that one or more carboxylic acid side chains in MSP contribute to the isotope-edited spectrum (23Hutchison R.S. Steenhuis J.J. Yocum C.F. Razeghifard R.M. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31987-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These assignments were substantiated by comparison to 13C-labeled model compounds. Thus, it was concluded that one or more aspartic or glutamic acid residues deprotonate upon conversion of the S1 state to the S2 state. To acquire more information about the role of amino acid residues in MSP, this article reports selective 13C labeling of aspartic acid/asparagine or glutamic acid/glutamine. GC/MS analysis of labeled MSP was consistent with little scrambling of label into other amino acid residues. Selectively labeled MSP was then reconstituted to PSII, and difference FT-IR spectroscopy was used to probe the S1 to S2 transition at two different temperatures, with both continuous and flash illumination. These experiments show that aspargine, glutamine, and glutamate residues in MSP are perturbed by photooxidation of manganese. Labeling and Purification of MSP—Selective labeling either of aspartic acid/asparagine or glutamine/glutamic acid residues in MSP was performed via expression in E. coli. MSP was produced from a psbO-containing expression plasmid by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, as previously described (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Hutchison R.S. Steenhuis J.J. Yocum C.F. Razeghifard R.M. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31987-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The host strain for expression was a non-auxotropic strain, BL21(DE3) pLysS(F– ompT rB – mB –). Selective labeling was obtained by growth in a defined media, containing an excess of the 13C-labeled amino acid of choice. This media contained the following components per liter (38Griffey R.H. Redfield A.G. Loomis R.E. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar): 0.5 g of MgSO4, 13.2 mg of CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mg of FeSO4·7H2O, 50 mg of nicotinic acid, 50 mg of thiamin, 2 g of sodium acetate, 1 g of ammonium chloride, 10 g of potassium phosphate dibasic, 2 g of succinic acid, 400 mg of alanine, 400 mg of glutamine, 125 mg of guanosine, 125 mg of uracil, 125 mg of cytosine, 50 mg of thymine, 400 mg of arginine, 50 mg of cystine, 400 mg of glycine, 135 mg of histidine-HCl-H2O, 100 mg of isoleucine, 100 mg of leucine, 100 mg of lysine, 250 mg of methionine, 100 mg of proline, 1.6 g of serine, 200 mg of threonine, 50 mg of tryptophan, 100 mg of tyrosine, 100 mg of valine, 50 mg of phenylalanine, and 0.1 mg of biotin. For the selective 13C labeling of aspartic acid/asparagine residues in MSP, 500 mg of l-[4-13C]aspartic acid (Isotec, 99% 13C) were added to 1 liter of the media, along with 800 mg of glutamic acid. For the selective labeling of glutamic acid/glutamine residues in MSP, 800 mg of l-[5-13C]glutamic acid (Isotec, 99% 13C), along with 250 mg of aspartic acid, were added to 1 liter of media. After gentle heating to dissolve all the reagents, the media was filter sterilized. To each liter of sterilized defined media was added 10 ml of 20% glucose (for a final concentration of 0.2%), 1 ml of chloramphenicol (25 mg/ml), and 1 ml of ampicillin (50 mg/ml). One-hundred milliliters of this media was inoculated and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a rotary shaker. The following morning, 20 ml of the cell culture was added to the remaining media, and the 37 °C incubation continued until the A 600 was ∼0.5. This took about 3 h. At this time, 0.2 ml of 0.2 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce MSP production. In addition, a 100-ml solution of 10% lactose was added; lactose was found to improve the labeling efficiency (39Ramesh V. Frederick R.O. Syed S.E.H. Gibson C.F. Yang J. Roberts G.C.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After induction, the cells were grown for an additional 4 h and harvested. Natural abundance and globally 13C-labeled MSP were prepared by expression in minimal media, containing either 0.2% 12C- or 0.2% [13C]glucose as the carbon source, as described (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies, containing MSP, were isolated, and MSP was solubilized and purified by previously described methods (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Betts S.D. Hachigian T.M. Pichersky E. Yocum C.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Isotope incorporation into MSP was measured using previously employed procedures (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Hutchison R.S. Steenhuis J.J. Yocum C.F. Razeghifard R.M. Barry B.A. J. Biol.

Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was hydrolyzed under anaerobic conditions (42Patterson B.W. Carraro F. Wolfe R.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resulting amino acids were derivatized with tert-butyldimethylsilyl groups via reaction with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and were subjected to GC/MS. The derivatized amino acids were identified by retention time, which was confirmed using a set of derivatized standards. The extent of labeling in the M-57 fragment was monitored. This fragmentation involves loss of a t-butyl radical and is quite facile; often the molecular ion was not observed. A number of amino acids were monitored for 13C labeling including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, glycine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, methionine, serine, threonine, lysine, and phenylalanine. The amount of isotope incorporation was determined by comparison to a natural abundance MSP sample, which was subjected to the same procedure. All GC/MS analyses were done in triplicate. PSII Preparations—PSII membranes were isolated from market spinach (43Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 44Anderson L.B.

This material was treated to remove native MSP, as well as the 18- and 24-kDa extrinsic proteins, while retaining manganese (see method in Ref. 21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and references therein). Either natural abundance, globally 13C-, [13C]Asp/Asn- or [13C]Glu/Gln-labeled MSP was rebound to PSII according to established procedures (see Ref. 21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and references therein). These PSII membranes were used directly for FT-IR spectroscopy at 277 K and were in a sucrose buffer containing 0.4 m sucrose, 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 60 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2. PSII complexes, for FT-IR spectroscopy at 200 K, were purified from the membranes via detergent solubilization and ion-exchange chromatography (45MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The final buffer contained 25% glycerol, 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, 7.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.26 m NaCl. Oxygen evolution assays were employed to verify reconstitution. The samples contained 10–15 μg/ml Chl, 20 mm calcium chloride, 0.33 mm recrystallized 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, 1 mm potassium ferricyanide, 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 60 mm NaCl, and 400 mm sucrose. A Clark-type O2 electrode was employed (YSI 5300, YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) (46Barry B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As isolated, the oxygen evolution rates for PSII membranes and PSII complexes were >750 and >1000 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl·h)–1, respectively. The oxygen evolution rates for all MSP reconstituted PSII membranes were between 250 and 500 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl·h)–1. This range of oxygen evolution rates is typical for this type of PSII sample (see Refs. 11Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Hutchison R.S.

The oxygen evolution rates for all MSP-reconstituted PSII complexes were indistinguishable and were between 400 and 600 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl·h)–1. FT-IR Spectroscopy at 200 K—Infrared spectra at 200 K were recorded on a Nicolet 60-SXR FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT/B detector and a KBr beamsplitter (25Steenhuis J.J.

Data were recorded under 10 min of illumination, and 2500 mirror scans were added together for each double-sided interferogram. The mirror velocity was 1.57 cm s–1, a Happ-Genzel apodization function was used, and the spectral resolution was 8 cm–1. A PSII sample (3 μl) was placed on a 25-mm germanium window and was concentrated in the dark under a stream of nitrogen for 5 min at 4 °C. Each sample also contained 20 equivalents of potassium ferricyanide. The germanium window was sandwiched with a CaF2 window and placed in the spectrometer. The sample was precooled to 200 K. Upon warming again to 277 K, the sample was preilluminated for 30 s and then allowed to reach the dark-adapted state over an additional 2 min. This procedure equalizes the contributions of the slowly decaying radical, Yd·, and any slowly decaying ChlZ+ to each spectrum (48MacDonald G.M. Bixby K.A. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The temperature control apparatus and illumination conditions have been described previously (25Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 6652-6660Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 47Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 51Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 4-8Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The temperature was continuously monitored and was 200 ± 0.3 K. Red and heat filters were employed. The amide I absorbance for each sample was between 0.2 and 0.6, and all spectra were normalized to an amide II absorbance of 0.5. The normalization corrects for differences in protein concentration and path length. Dark-minus-dark spectra were recorded before illumination at 200 K. FT-IR Spectroscopy at 277 K—Infrared spectra at 277 K were recorded on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) IFS-66v/S FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector and a Harrick (Ossining, NY) temperature controller (35Halverson K.M.

J. 2003; 85: 2581-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A Happ-Genzel apodization function and four levels of zero filling were used. The spectral resolution was 8 cm–1. Both the actinic and pre-flashes were provided by a frequency doubled, 532-nm output from a Surelight III Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Santa Clara, CA). The pulse width was ∼7 ns, and the pulse energy was 20–30 mJ cm–2. A PSII sample (2 μl), containing 10 eq of ferricyanide and 2 eq of 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, was placed on a 25-mm CaF2 window and was concentrated in the dark under a stream of nitrogen for 7 min at 4 °C. The window was sandwiched with another CaF2 window, placed in the spectrometer, and cooled to 277 K. A germanium filter was used to block the light from the internal laser of the spectrometer. The sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min after which it was given a preflash. After an additional 60 min of dark adaptation, an actinic flash was applied, and 200 mirror scans (∼30 s of data) were summed for each double-sided interferogram. The spectra taken after the flash were ratioed to data taken immediately before the flash. Dark-minus-dark spectra were recorded before each actinic flash. In each sample, the amide I absorbances were between 0.6 and 0.9, and each spectrum was normalized to an amide II absorbance of 0.5. A total of 18 data sets were collected for each sample type. Isotopic Labeling—To probe the role of acidic amino acid residues in MSP, aspartic acid/asparagine and glutamic acid/glutamine were selectively labeled. To accomplish this, a strain of E. coli (BL21/DE3), in which the expression of MSP had been previously optimized, was employed. Cultures were grown in defined media containing each essential amino acid, nucleotide, mineral, and vitamin. Ammonium chloride and glucose were employed as additional nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Labeled amino acids were present in the media throughout the growth of the culture and during MSP induction. Following purification (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Betts S.D. Hachigian T.M. Pichersky E. Yocum C.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), MSP was hydrolyzed and derivatized. The derivatized amino acids were subjected to GC/MS analysis. Acid hydrolysis is expected to deaminate glutamine and asparagine, and the detection of Asn and Gln is difficult with this method (42Patterson B.W. Carraro F. Wolfe R.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, both Asn and Gln are expected to be labeled from 13C-labeled aspartate and glutamate, respectively (52Arnstein H.R.V. Amino Acid and Protein Biosynthesis II, International Review of Biochemistry. 1978; 18 (University Park Press, Baltimore)Google Scholar). MSP was also globally labeled with 13C by methods previously described (21Hutchison R.S. Betts S.D. Yocum C.F.

Previously, we showed that oltipraz promoted CCAAT/enhancer binding proteinβ (C/EBPβ) activation, which leads to the induction of glutathione S-transferase. Given that oltipraz activates C/EBPβ for gene transactivation and that the putative C/EBP binding site is located in the CYP1A1 promoter region, this study investigated the effect of oltipraz on CYP1A1 induction by 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). 3-MC induced CYP1A1 in H4IIE cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Gel shift analysis showed that 3-MC increased the band intensity of protein binding to the XRE. Immunocompetition analysis verified the specificity of AhR-XRE binding. Oltipraz (30 μm) induced CYP1A1 and the CYP1A1 promoter-luciferase gene and increased AhR DNA binding activity, which was 10–20% of those in 3-MC (100 nm)-treated cells. However, AhR-XRE binding was not increased after 10 μm oltipraz treatment. Oltipraz (10 μm) significantly inhibited CYP1A1 and CYP1A1-luciferase gene induction by 3-MC with no increase in AhR DNA binding. Oltipraz enhanced protein binding to the C/EBP binding site in the gene promoter and the binding complex comprised of C/EBPβ and partly C/EBPδ. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant C/EBP significantly abolished the ability of oltipraz to suppress 3-MC-inducible CYP1A1 and the CYP1A1 reporter gene expression. Consistently, C/EBPβ overexpression blocked CYP1A1 reporter gene induction by 3-MC. These results provide evidence that oltipraz suppresses 3-MC induction of CYP1A1 gene expression and that activation of C/EBPβ by oltipraz contributes to suppression of 3-MC-inducible AhR-mediated CYP1A1 expression.

The substrates and inducers of CYP1A1 include 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) (3Thomas P.E. Reik L.M. Ryan D.E. Levin W. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 480–481: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The induction of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) by oltipraz is associated with cancer chemopreventive and cytoprotective effects (14Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kang K.W. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K.

The members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, which have roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, and regulation of tissue-specific genes, including C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (18Cho M.K. Kim S.G. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30843-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We recently found that activation of C/EBPβ and its binding to the C/EBP-response element play a critical role in the induction of the GSTA2 gene (11Kang K.W. Cho I.J. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Kang K.W. Park E.Y. Kim S.G. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oltipraz and flavonoid compounds promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mediated nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ, which leads to the induction of the GST gene by activating binding to the C/EBP binding site present in the GSTA2 gene. Signals activated by oxidative stress stimulate transduction of NF-E2-related factor-2 activity and activation of ARE (16Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 21Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, the pathways involving both C/EBP and NF-E2-related factor-2 are essential and distinct for the phase II enzyme induction.Oltipraz affects activities and the expression of cytochrome P450s. This agent inhibited CYP1A1 activity in vivo and in vitro (22Langouet S. Maheo K. Berthou F. Morel F. Lagadic-Gossman D. Glaise D. Coles B. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that oltipraz increased the expression of CYP1A in the rat liver, kidney, and lung following its inhibition of metabolic activity (23De Sousa G. Langouet S. Nicolas F. Lorenzon G. Placidi M. Rahmani R. Guillouzo A. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1996; 12: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Ferrec E.L. Ilyin G. Maheo K. Bardiau C. Courtois A. Guillouzo A. Morel F. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 21: 49-55Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Ferrec E.L. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Rauch C. Bardiau C. Maheo K. Massiere F. Le Vee M. Guillouzo A. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24780-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that oltipraz is an inducer of the XRE-containing 5′-flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene (25Ferrec E.L. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Rauch C. Bardiau C. Maheo K. Massiere F. Le Vee M. Guillouzo A. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24780-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The proteins that bind to the XRE in the gene promoter have been found to be relevant to a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. C/EBPα showed overlapping DNA binding specificity to that of the AhR (26Carrier F. Chang C-Y. Duh J-L. Nebert D.W. Puga A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1767-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other studies provided evidence that several common transcriptional factors bind to the AhRE motif of the murine Cyp1a1 gene, indicated by competition studies with an excess of AhRE3, mutated AhRE3, and C/EBPα oligonucleotides (27Vasiliou V. Shertzer H.G. Liu R.M. Sainsbury M. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In view of the fact that oltipraz activates C/EBPβ for gene transactivation and that the C/EBP protein is involved in the formation of the transcription complexes binding to the XRE, we investigated whether oltipraz alters AhR-mediated CYP1A1 induction by 3-MC and whether activating C/EBPβ inhibits AhR-bound XRE-mediated transcription of the gene. We now report that oltipraz suppresses 3-MC-inducible CYP1A1 expression and that activating C/EBPβ binding to the putative C/EBP binding site in the CYP1A1 gene promoter, which is promoted by oltipraz, is responsible for the inhibition of 3-MC-inducible AhR-mediated CYP1A1 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Arlington Heights, IL). Anti-CYP1A1/2 antibody was supplied from Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc. (Oxford, MI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. laboratory (San Francisco, CA). Anti-AhR, anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ, and anti-C/EBPδ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). These antibodies specifically recognized their respective transcription factors without any cross-reactivity. Oltipraz was kindly provided by Aventis Pharma France (Virty-sur-Seine, France). 3-Methylcholanthrene and other reagents in the molecular studies were supplied from Sigma Chemical.Cell Culture—H4IIE cells, a rat hepatocyte-derived cell line, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.Immunoblot Analysis—H4IIE cells were incubated with 1 nm to 10 μm 3-MC and/or 10–30 μm oltipraz for the indicated time period. After washing the cells twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were scraped and sonicated for disruption. Microsomal fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation. The microsomal fractions were stored at –70 °C until use. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses were performed according to previously published procedures (28Kang K.W. Novak R.F. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1017-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Microsomal proteins were separated by 7.5% gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The nitrocellulose paper was incubated with anti-CYP1A1/2 antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed using ECL® chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Equal loading of proteins was verified by Coomassie staining. Changes in the levels of CYP1A1 were determined via scanning densitometry. At least three separate experiments were performed with different lysates to confirm changes in the protein levels.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially according to the previously published method (29Schreiber E. Harshman K. Kemler I. Malipiero U. Schaffner W. Fontana A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells in dishes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped, transferred to microtubes, and allowed to swell after the addition of 100 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were incubated for 10 min in ice and centrifuged at 7200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets containing crude nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then incubated for 30 min in ice. The samples were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 10 min to obtain supernatants containing nuclear fractions. Nuclear fractions were stored at –70 °C until use.Gel Retardation Assay—Double-stranded DNA probes containing the consensus C/EBP binding oligonucleotide, the rat CYP1A1 XRE oligonucleotide, and the putative CYP1A1 C/EBP binding oligonucleotide were used for gel shift analyses after end-labeling of each probe with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The sequences of C/EBP consensus, CYP1A1 XRE and putative CYP1A1 C/EBP binding oligonucleotides were 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′, 5′-GGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGAGCC-3′ (30Backlund M. Johansson I. Mkrtchian S. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31755-31763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and 5′-TGTAGCTTGCCTAAGGTGA-3′, respectively. The reaction mixtures included 4 μl of 5 × binding buffer containing 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml poly dI-dC, and 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 15 μg of nuclear extracts, and sterile water in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min. DNA binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min after the addition of 1 μl of probe (106 cpm). Specificity of binding was determined by competition experiments, which were carried out by adding a 20-fold excess of unlabeled XRE, C/EBP, or SP-1 oligonucleotide to the reaction mixture before the DNA binding reaction. For the supershift assay, antibodies (1 μg each) were added to the reaction mixture, and additionally incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Samples were loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels at 100 V. The gels were removed, fixed, and dried, followed by autoradiography.Plasmid Construction—Firefly luciferase reporter gene construct, pGL-CYP1A1-1195 was generated by ligation of the 1195-bp promoter region of the rat CYP1A1 gene with the coding region of luciferase. Briefly, rat genomic DNA was prepared by using Wizard® SV genomic DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). The flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene was generated by PCR amplification using specific primers. The amplified fragment was inserted into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subcloned into the MluI/BglII sites of the pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). C/EBP-specific dominant-negative expression (AC/EBP) plasmid was a gift from Dr. C. Vinson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (31Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). pCDNA-C/EBPβ, which encodes C/EBPβ, was produced by PCR amplification of the coding region of the C/EBPβ gene using rat genomic DNA as a template (32Jover R. Bort R. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Castell J.V. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1799-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the amplified DNA was then cloned into pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA sequences of the pGL-CYP1A1-1195 and pCDNA-C/EBPβ constructs were verified by sequence analysis using an ABI7700 DNA cycle sequencer.CYP1A1 Promoter Luciferase Assay—The CYP1A1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out according to previously published methods with some modifications (11Kang K.W. Cho I.J. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (7 × 105 cells/well) were replated in 6-well plates overnight, serum-starved for 6 h, and transiently transfected with the CYP1A1 promoter-luciferase construct (1 μg each) and pRL-SV plasmid (5 ng each, Renilla luciferase expression for normalization) (Promega, Madison, WI) using LipofectAMINE Plus® Reagent for 3 h (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfected cells were incubated in the medium containing 1% fetal calf serum for 13 h, and then exposed to 30 nm 3-MC in the presence or absence of oltipraz (10 μm) for 18 h or 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using a luminometer (Luminoskan®, Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing CYP1A1 promoter-driven firefly luciferase activity to that of Renilla luciferase. For some experiments, cells were co-transfected with pCMV-AC/EBP or pCDNA-C/EBPβ plasmid (1 μg each) in addition to CYP1A1 promoter-luciferase construct (1 μg), whereas pCMV500 or pCDNA3.1(+) (1 μg each) empty vector was used for mock-transfection.AC/EBP or C/EBPβ Plasmid Transfection—H4IIE cells were transfected with the AC/EBP or pCDNA-C/EBPβ plasmid using LipofectAMINE plus® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as described previously (11Kang K.W. Cho I.J. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were re-plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 7 × 105 cells in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected by addition of 1 ml of minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 1 μg of each plasmid and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE, and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 3 h. After addition of 1 ml of MEM containing 1% fetal calf serum, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Control cells were transfected with an equal amount of pCMV500 or pCDNA3.1(+) (i.e. mock-transfection).Statistical Analysis—Scanning densitometry of the immunoblots was performed with Image Scan & Analysis System (Alpha-Innotech Corp, San Leandro, CA). The area of each lane was integrated using the software AlphaEase™ version 5.5, followed by background subtraction. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were used to assess significant differences among treatment groups. For each significant effect of treatment, the Newman-Keuls test was used for comparisons of multiple group means. The criterion for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 or p < 0.01. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTSCYP1A1 Induction by 3-MC—Western blot analysis was performed to confirm that 3-MC induced CYP1A1 in H4IIE cells. CYP1A1 was induced 24 h after 3-MC treatment at the concentration of 1 nm or above in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). CYP1A1 induction plateaued at 1 μm. Because 10–100 nm 3-MC significantly induced CYP1A1, the concentrations were chosen in subsequent experiments. A time course study showed that 3-MC at the concentration of 100 nm induced CYP1A1 with the maximal induction being observed at 6 h or later (Fig. 1B).We determined whether 3-MC induced ligand-activated AhR binding to the XRE. Gel shift analysis showed that 3-MC increased the band intensity of protein binding to the XRE consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 1C). The band intensity of AhR binding to the XRE substantially increased from 3 to 6 h, followed by returning to control level at 12 h. The specificity of AhR binding to the XRE (6 h) was verified by immunocompetition analysis using an anti-AhR antibody (Fig. 1C). Competition experiments using a 20-fold excess of unlabeled XRE or SP-1 oligonucleotide confirmed the specificity of protein binding to the XRE (Fig. 1C).Effect of Oltipraz on CYP1A1 Expression—Previous studies have shown that oltipraz (e.g. at 50–100 μm) induces CYP1A1 and activates transcription of the CYP1A1 gene through the AhR-XRE pathway (25Ferrec E.L. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Rauch C. Bardiau C. Maheo K. Massiere F. Le Vee M. Guillouzo A. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24780-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We compared the extent of CYP1A1 induction by oltipraz with that by 3-MC. The relative CYP1A1 protein level in H4IIE cells treated with 30 μm oltipraz was ∼25% of that induced by 100 nm 3-MC (Fig. 2A). Oltipraz at the concentration of 10 μm was minimally active. Next, we tested whether oltipraz was capable of activating AhR binding to the XRE. Gel shift assay showed that oltipraz (30 μm, 3 h) increased protein binding to the XRE, which was much weaker than that induced by 3-MC (100 nm, 3 h)(Fig. 2B). AhR binding activity to a radiolabeled XRE oligonucleotide maximally increased 3 h after treatment of H4IIE cells with 30 μm oltipraz and returned toward that of control at 6 h or later time point (Fig. 2B). Oltipraz at the concentration of 10 μm did not activate AhR binding to the XRE (Fig. 2B). An increase in the band intensity of protein DNA binding by 30 μm oltipraz (3 h) was specific to the XRE, as evidenced by competition experiments using a 20-fold excess unlabeled XRE or SP-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2The effects of oltipraz on the expression of CYP1A1 and the AhR binding to the XRE. A, expression of CYP1A1. The levels of CYP1A1 protein were determined by immunoblot analyses in H4IIE cells treated with 100 nm 3-MC or 10–30 μm oltipraz for 24 h. Data represent the mean ± S.D. with three separate experiments (significant as compared with 3-MC; **, p < 0.01; the level of CYP1A1 in cells treated with 3-MC is 100%). B, gel shift analysis of AhR-XRE complex. The band intensity of AhR-XRE binding in cells treated with oltipraz (10–30 μm, 3 h) was compared with that in 3-MC-treated cells (100 nm, 3 h). Nuclear extracts were also prepared from cells incubated with 10–30 μm oltipraz for 3–12 h and subjected to gel shift analyses. The specificity of protein binding to the XRE was verified as described in the legend to Fig. 1C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the effect of oltipraz on transactivation of the CYP1A1 gene by using the CYP1A1 promoter reporter gene assay. H4IIE cells were transfected with a reporter vector pGL-CYP1A1-1195, which contained the luciferase structural gene and the –1.2-kb rat CYP1A1 promoter (Fig. 3A). Exposure of H4IIE cells, transiently transfected with the plasmid, to 10 or 30 μm oltipraz resulted in increases in luciferase activity, which was 15 and 25% of that induced by 100 nm 3-MC, respectively (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Induction of CYP1A1 promoter-luciferase activity by 3-MC or oltipraz. A, scheme showing the XRE and NRE sites present in the chimeric gene construct pGL-CYP1A1-1195 that contained the promoter region of CYP1A1 and the coding region of luciferase. NRE, negative regulatory element. B, luciferase activity was measured in H4IIE cells transiently transfected with pGL-CYP1A1-1195. Dual luciferase reporter assay was performed with the lysates obtained from cells co-transfected with the CYP1A1-luciferase gene construct (firefly luciferase) and pRL-SV (Renilla luciferase)(a ratio of 200:1) after exposure to 3-MC (100 nm) or oltipraz (10–30 μm) for 18 h. Activation of the reporter gene was calculated as a relative change to Renilla luciferase activity. Data represented the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments (significant as compared with control; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05; vehicle-treated control is 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of 3-MC-Inducible CYP1A1 Expression by Oltipraz—We previously showed that oltipraz promotes activation of C/EBPβ, which contributes to GSTA2 induction via activating C/EBPβ binding to the C/EBP binding site present within the XRE in the GSTA2 gene (11Kang K.W. Cho I.J. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because the putative C/EBP binding site is located in proximity to the XRE in the promoter region of the CYP1A1 gene, we were interested in whether oltipraz might affect 3-MC-inducible CYP1A1 expression via activation of C/EBP protein(s). We determined the extents of CYP1A1 induction in H4IIE cells treated with 10–100 nm 3-MC in combination with 10 μm oltipraz. Western blot analysis revealed that oltipraz (10 μm) significantly blocked the induction of CYP1A1 by 10 or 30 nm 3-MC, whereas CYP1A1 induction by 100 nm 3-MC was not significantly decreased by concomitant treatment with oltipraz (Fig. 4A). To verify the inhibition by oltipraz of 3-MC induction of CYP1A1, luciferase reporter gene analyses were performed. The luciferase induction by 3-MC (30 nm) in pGL-CYP1A1-1195-transfected cells was markedly decreased by 10 μm oltipraz treatment (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrated that oltipraz was capable of suppressing 3-MC induction of the CYP1A1 gene.Fig. 4The effect of oltipraz on the induction of CYP1A1 by 3-MC. A, inhibition of 3-MC-inducible CYP1A1 expression by oltipraz. The expression of CYP1A1 was measured in cells treated with 10–100 nm 3-MC in the presence or absence of 10 μm oltipraz for 24 h. Western blot analysis was performed, as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. Relative levels of CYP1A1 protein were assessed by scanning densitometry of immunoblots. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments (significant as compared with 100 nm 3-MC; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05; significant as compared with the respective treatment with 3-MC alone; ††, p < 0.01; CYP1A1 level in cells treated with 100 nm 3-MC is 100%). B, inhibition of 3-MC-inducible pGL-CYP1A1-1195 gene activation by oltipraz. Cells were co-transfected with pGL-CYP1A1-1195/pRL-SV (200:1), and then the luciferase activity was measured 18 h after oltipraz (10 μm), 3-MC (30 nm) or 3-MC + oltipraz. The experimental value for luciferase activity was expressed as the relative luciferase unit of cell lysates and represented the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments (significant as compared with 3-MC alone; **, p < 0.01; CYP1A1 level in cells treated with 30 nm 3-MC is 100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we assessed whether oltipraz altered the extent of ligand-activated AhR binding to the XRE by gel shift analysis. AhR binding to the XRE in cells treated with 30 nm 3-MC was completely abolished by concomitant treatment with oltipraz (10 μm, 6 h)(Fig. 5).Fig. 5The effect of oltipraz on 3-MC-inducible AhR binding to the XRE. Gel shift analysis was performed with the nuclear fraction prepared from cells treated with oltipraz (10 μm), 3-MC (30 nm) or 3-MC + oltipraz for 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W2160310308,"Activation of the disease resistance response in a host plant frequently requires the interaction of a plant resistance gene product with a corresponding, pathogenderived signal encoded by an avirulence gene. The products of resistance genes from diverse plant species show remarkable structural similarity. However, due to the general paucity of information on pathogen avirulence genes the recognition process remains in most cases poorly understood. NIP1, a small protein secreted by the fungal barley pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis, is one of only a few fungal avirulence proteins identified and characterized to date. The defense-activating activity of NIP1 is mediated by barley resistance gene Rrs1. In addition, a role of the protein in fungal virulence is suggested by its nonspecific toxicity in leaf tissues of host and non-host cereals as well as its resistance gene-independent stimulatory effect on the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Four naturally occurring NIP1 isoforms are characterized by single amino acid alterations that affect the different activities in a similar way. As a step toward unraveling the signal perception/transduction mechanism, the solution structure of NIP1 was determined. The protein structure is characterized by a novel fold. It consists of two parts containing β-sheets of two and three anti-parallel strands, respectively. Five intramolecular disulfide bonds, comprising a novel disulfide bond pattern, stabilize these parts and their position with respect to each other. A comparative analysis of the protein structure with the properties of the NIP1 isoforms suggests two loop regions to be crucial for the resistance-triggering activity of NIP1.

Plant disease resistance frequently results from the specific interaction of disease resistance (R) genes with corresponding pathogen avirulence (Avr) genes. When an R gene product recognizes the matching microbial Avr-dependent signal, plant defense reactions are activated to arrest further pathogen development. In recent years, many R genes have been characterized from various plant species, their products forming five classes of proteins with common structural motifs such as leucine-rich repeat domains, nucleotide-binding sites, leucinezipper domains or domains similar to the cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (1Dangl J.L. Jones J.D.G. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies on the signal transduction components that play a role in plant disease resistance have uncovered remarkable similarities with innate immunity pathways in insects and mammals (2Cohn J. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Originating from very diverse pathogens the products of Avr genes, with the exception of the Xanthomonas AvrBs3 gene family, lack such structural similarities. However, the increasing number of AVR proteins for which an impact on virulence has been demonstrated (3van't Slot K.A.E. Knogge W. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2002; 21: 229-271Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggests a common genuine function. In the broader sense, these proteins are produced by pathogens to allow or optimize development on the host. Their secondary role as specific signals in plant resistance triggering thus appears to be a function of the recognition capability of the plant. This is best described by the “guard hypothesis,” which assumes that AVR proteins target host proteins to modulate critical plant activities. These host targets are “guarded” by R proteins, which initiate defense reactions when their “guardees” are disturbed by AVR proteins (1Dangl J.L. Jones J.D.G. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar, 4van der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 454-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Currently, the tomato Pto kinase (4van der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 454-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and the RIN4 protein of Arabidopsis thaliana (5Mackey D. Holt B.F. Wiig A. Dangl J.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) best exemplify this scenario. According to the model, Pto is part of a general host defense-signaling pathway. The R protein Prf recognizes the interaction of Pto with bacterial AvrPto, which suppresses this pathway. RIN4 is a negative regulator of basal defense responses, an activity that is enhanced upon interaction with bacterial AvrB or AvrRpm1. RIN4 integrity is guarded by the A. thaliana RPM1 protein, which hence “recognizes” two different AVR proteins targeting the same plant factor. More than 40 Avr genes from bacterial, but only very few from fungal, plant pathogens have been characterized. Most bacterial AVR proteins that are transferred into host cells via the bacterial type III secretion system (6Galán J.E. Collmer A. Science. 1999; 284: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) and the product of the Avr-Pita from the rice pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (7Jia Y. McAdams S.A. Bryan G.T. Hershey H.P. Valent B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4004-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) have intracellular targets. In contrast, the AVR proteins from the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum and from the barley pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis function extracellularly as elicitors of plant defense reactions (8Laugé R. de Wit P.J.G.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 24: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). High affinity binding sites for two of the AVR proteins, AVR9 from C. fulvum (9Kooman-Gersmann M. Honée G. Bonnema G. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 929-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NIP1 from R. secalis, 1K. A. E. van't Slot and W. Knogge, unpublished results. have been identified, although on membranes of both resistant and susceptible host plants as well as of related non-host species. In addition, the tomato Cf-9 protein that recognizes AVR9 without direct physical interaction (10Luderer R. Rivas S. Nürnberger T. van den Mattei B. van der Hooven H.W. Hoorn R.A.L Romeis T. Wehrfritz J.M. Blume B. Nennstiel D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was recently found to be part of a membrane-associated protein complex (11Rivas S. Romeis T. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism of AVR protein perception and signal transduction into the host cell is still not fully understood. The NIP1 gene of R. secalis encodes an 82-amino acid protein, which upon cleavage of a signal peptide yields a 60-amino acid mature protein that contains 10 cysteine residues (12Rohe M. Gierlich A. Hermann H. Hahn M. Schmidt B. Rosahl S. Knogge W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4168-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in five intramolecular disulfide bonds (13Gierlich A. van't Slot K.A.E. Li V.M. Marie C. Hermann H. Knogge W. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Application of NIP1 to leaves of barley lines carrying the R gene, Rrs1, but not of lines lacking this gene, results in the induction of defense reactions (14Hahn M. Jüngling S. Knogge W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, NIP1 has a virulence-associated function; independent of the plant genotype it stimulates the formation of necrotic lesions, a process that appears to be based on an indirect stimulation of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity (15Wevelsiep L. Kogel K.-H. Knogge W. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1991; 39: 471-482Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Wevelsiep L. Rüpping E. Knogge W. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All fungal races avirulent on Rrs1-barley carry and express the NIP1 gene. In contrast, virulent races either lack the gene or carry alleles containing point mutations that translate into single amino acid alterations (12Rohe M. Gierlich A. Hermann H. Hahn M. Schmidt B. Rosahl S. Knogge W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4168-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To date four isoforms of NIP1 (denominated types I-IV) have been characterized that differ significantly in their biological activities (17Fiegen M. Knogge W. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2002; 61: 299-302Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Understanding the effect of the amino acid differences between the four types of NIP1 on their function is an important step toward the elucidation of resistance triggering. To obtain more insight into the structure-function relationships, the three-dimensional structure of NIP1, type I, was solved using NMR spectroscopy. The resulting structure shows a novel protein fold that consists of two parts comprising β-sheets. By integrating the structural information with the results from binding and biological activity studies using the four NIP1 isoforms, a model is presented for NIP1 perception in the interaction between R. secalis and its host plant, barley. Sample Preparation—For 15N labeling of the protein, Escherichia coli strain BL21 carrying the pQE30-NIP1 vector (13Gierlich A. van't Slot K.A.E. Li V.M. Marie C. Hermann H. Knogge W. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was grown in 5 liters of minimal medium (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) consisting of M9 salts, 20% glucose, Fe2+ (5 ng liter-1) and thiamine (500 ng liter-1). 15NH4Cl (ARL, Groningen, The Netherlands) was used as the sole nitrogen source. When bacterial cultures reached an A 600 of 0.5, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and cells were harvested after incubation for 6 h at 37 °C. Following the protein isolation protocol described previously (13Gierlich A. van't Slot K.A.E. Li V.M. Marie C. Hermann H. Knogge W. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), 7.2 mg of [15N]NIP1 were obtained from inclusion bodies. The 15N incorporation was shown to be 97% with MALDI-TOF MS. 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; COSY, correlation spectroscopy; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; GHSQC, gradient-selected HSQC; NIP1, necrosis-inducing protein 1; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; GuCl, guanidine HCl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. The elicitor activity of the labeled protein did not differ from that of unlabeled NIP1 (data not shown). Disulfide Bond Assignments—Native NIP1, type I (80 μg; molecular mass = 6433.3 Da), was dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3) containing 6 m guanidine HCl (GuCl) to facilitate the accessibility of the five disulfide bridges (19Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Partial reduction was performed with a 5 molar excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), a reagent that has proven to be an excellent reducing agent for disulfides at acidic pH (19Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This reaction mixture was incubated at various temperatures for 15 min, directly followed by the addition of 4-5 μl of 0.1 m 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate, which resulted in cyanylation of the free sulfhydryl groups. An alternative alkylation reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, was used to achieve a better HPLC separation of singly reduced peptides. The partially reduced NIP1 mixture was separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Delta Pak C18 column (150 × 3.9 mm, 300 Å, 5 μm, Waters Corp., Milford, MA) using 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as eluting solvent. After purification the masses of the corresponding peptides were determined by MALDITOF MS. The singly reduced peptides were freeze-dried and subjected to chemical cleavage by adding 16 μl of 1 m aqueous NH4OH (pH 10) containing 1.5 m GuCl. After 1 h at ambient temperature the samples were air-dried in a Speed Vac system. The remaining cystines were completely reduced by adding 4 μl of TCEP at pH 3. The resulting peptide fragments were further analyzed by mass spectrometry to assign the disulfide bonds (19Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Wu J. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Molecular masses were determined by MALDI-TOF MS on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE-RP. A saturated matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnnamic acid, Aldrich) was freshly prepared in acetonitrile/water/TFA (50/50/1, v/v/v). One μl of each peptide sample was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution on the MALDI target plate. External calibration was performed with a tryptic digest of the C116S mutant of 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.2) using fragments with calculated [M + H]+ of 1099.6 Da and 2086.2 Da, bovine insulin (5734.6 Da) and bovine cytochrome c (12230.9 Da). NMR Experiments—The NMR experiments were performed on Bruker DMX 600 and Varian Inova 500 and 600 spectrometers equipped with a pulsed-field gradient unit and triple resonance probe. The concentration of the NIP1 sample was 2 mm. The spectra were acquired at 25 °C and pH 6.0 (pH meter reading). Three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY (80 and 150 ms mixing time), 15N-edited TOCSY (30 ms mixing time), 15N HMQC-NOESY-GHSQC (150 ms mixing time), two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, 1H COSY (H2O and D2O), 1H NOESY (H2O and D2O, 80 and 150 ms mixing time), and 1H TOCSY (H2O and D2O, 25 ms mixing time) spectra were used for the assignments. The spectra were processed using the NMRPipe program (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) on Silicon Graphics workstations. The data were interpreted using the program XEASY (23Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Resonances were assigned following the standard strategy (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Spectra were calibrated relative to tetramethylsilane (25Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). 3 J NH-Hα coupling constants were determined in three-dimensional HNHA (26Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), two-dimensional HMQC-J (27Kay L.E. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 110-126Google Scholar), and three two-dimensional MJ-HMQC (28Xia Y.L. Kong X.M. Ip N. Zhu G. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) spectra, 3 J N-Hα coupling constants from a three-dimensional HNHB experiment. Two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY experiments were analyzed as well. In the HMQC-J and the MJ-HMQC spectra the coupling constants were determined from the in-phase doublets in the 15N dimension using the fitting procedure INFIT (29Szyperski T. Guntert P. Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 552-560Google Scholar). Steady-state 1H-15N NOE values, R1 and R2 15N relaxation times, were determined using gradient enhanced sensitivity pulse sequences (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired on a 500 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer. Two pairs of NOE experiments were recorded with (NOE) and without (NONOE) the use of 1H saturation applied before the start of the experiment, respectively. Series of R1, with time delays of 15, 45, 105, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1300, 2000 ms, and R2, with time delays of 8.2, 24.6, 41, 57.5, 73.9, 90.3, 121.3, 172.4, 238, 320 ms, experiments were collected. NOE spectra were acquired using 2048 × 170 complex points. The R1 and R2 spectra were obtained using 2048 × 300 complex points. The relaxation parameters were determined from the peak heights. Data were analyzed using the Modelfree software (31Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and reduced spectral density mapping (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Slowly exchanging amide protons were determined from the NH resonances from the fingerprint region cross peaks present in a TOCSY, COSY, and NOESY, recorded at 298 K of a NIP1 sample that was fully protonated and lyophilized. The spectra were recorded after dissolving the sample in D2O within the first 12 h of exchange. These slow exchanging amides are thought to arise from strong hydrogen bonds within the structure. Structure Calculation—Quantitative distance constraints were obtained from the three-dimensional 15N NOESY HSQC (80 ms mixing time), HMQC-NOESY-GHSQC (150 ms mixing time), and the two-dimensional NOESY (D2O, 80 ms mixing time). Distances (upper limits) were calibrated using the program DYANA (32Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Since DYANA only calibrates upper limits, lower limits were introduced at a later stage. Interstrand dNN and sequential dαN and dαα distances (taken from the thus far calculated structures) were used for the calibration of the HMQC-NOESY-GHSQC, three-dimensional NOESY HSQC, and NOESY spectrum, respectively. Lower limits were set by shortening the distances r by 20%. Stereo-specific assignments and angle restraints for NIP1 were obtained from a quantitative analysis of the various J-coupling spectra. Structures were calculated using 34 ϕ and 11 φ angle constraints and 740 distance constraints. The slowly exchanging amide protons resulted in 28 H-bonds. Constraints for the disulfide bridges were added according to the experiment described above. During the structure calculations, 24 lower limits of 4 Å were included, corresponding to NOEs not present in the spectra. Resonance Assignments and Coordinates—The complete proton and nitrogen resonance assignments have been deposited in the BioMagnetic Resonance Bank data base (accession code 5199). Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1KG1). Assignment of Disulfide Bonds—NIP1 contains five intramolecular disulfide bridges (13Gierlich A. van't Slot K.A.E. Li V.M. Marie C. Hermann H. Knogge W. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Determination of its disulfide bridge structure was performed according to the methods described earlier (19Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Native NIP1 was partially reduced using the water-soluble reagent TCEP. The reactions were performed in 6 m GuCl to facilitate the accessibility of the five disulfide bridges. In contrast to results reported previously (19Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33van den Hooven H.W. van den Burg H.A. Vossen P. Boeren S. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3458-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the disulfide bonds did not appear to be equally accessible to TCEP in 6 m GuCl. One disulfide bond opened significantly easier than the remaining four. After HPLC separation of the reaction mixture (Fig. 1A), four singly reduced peptides were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Mass spectroscopy proved the other fragments to have more than one disulfide bond reduced. The fifth singly reduced NIP1 peptide could not be detected, also not by using the alkylation reagent N-ethylmaleimide as an alternative for the cyanylation reaction (33van den Hooven H.W. van den Burg H.A. Vossen P. Boeren S. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3458-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mass determination always resulted in the identification of two of the three expected mass peaks (Table I). β-Elimination, a common side reaction (34Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), was less frequently observed than reported by others (19Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interpretation of the results led to the disulfide pattern presented in Fig. 1B.Table IExpected and observed (in italics) m/z values for peptide fragments resulting from the indicated singly reduced/cleaved disulfide bridges Fragments smaller than 1000 m / z were not detected due to the settings of the MALDI-TOF MS mass gate. itz, iminothiazolidine derivative of N-terminal cysteine in cleavage products.Reduction of disulfide pairN terminus to 1st Cysitz-1st Cys to 2nd Cysitz-2nd Cys to C terminusβ-Elimination N terminusβ-Elimination C terminusCys3-Cys19289.31699.04537.11911.36158.01698.14541.41910.4Cys8-Cys26925.11848.13752.22696.15522.33757.72698.7Cys9-Cys421027.23444.92052.24396.15420.63445.22052.2Cys32-Cys533310.82261.5957.05495.33136.6Cys33-Cys603412.92964.3148.16300.23034.43415.52961.2 Open table in a new tab NMR Results and Structure Determination—The quality of the data obtained in the NMR experiment is exemplified in Fig. 2, which presents the 15N, 1H HSQC spectrum of 2.0 mm NIP1 recorded at pH 6 and 298 K. The spectrum shows a very good dispersion for all backbone amide 15N-H cross-peaks, indicative of a well structured protein. From NOESY spectra, the assigned H-bonds, the assigned disulfide bridge information and the torsion angle measurements, 785 restraints were derived, leading to 13.1 restraints per residue (Fig. 3). On the basis of these restraints, 100 structures were calculated using the program DYANA (32Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). The 25 structures with the lowest target function and no distance violations larger than 0.5 Å were selected. Fig. 4A shows a superposition of the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C′) of residues 3-11, 14-45, and 51-60. The structure of NIP1 reveals two “omains” or parts (Fig. 4B).Fig. 3Histogram showing the number of NOE-derived distance constraints per residue. The bars represent intraresidue (black), sequential (dark gray), medium range (light gray), and long range (white) NOEs restraints. From the 740 NOEs, 232 are intraresidue, 241 sequential, and 54 medium range (between 2 and 5 residues apart in the sequence). Furthermore, 213 long range NOEs (5 or more residues apart) were identified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Solution structure of NIP1.

All structures are in good agreement with the experimental restraints. No structures showed consistent (>60% of all structures) NOE structure violations larger than 0.2 Å or dihedral angle restraints larger than 3°. Ramachandran analysis of the ensemble showed that 97% of the residues lie in the allowed regions. From the relaxation measurements, R1 and R2 rates and NOE values were determined and subsequently used to calculate spectral densities, employing the reduced spectral density mapping method (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 presents the spectral densities, which were calculated at zero, ωN and ωH (50.7 and 500 MHz, respectively). From a comparison of the χ2 values of the “isotropic” and “anisotropic” Modelfree analyses followed that the dynamics of NIP1 can be described with an isotropic model. The overall rotational correlation time τc derived from the mean value of the R2/R1 ratio was determined to be 4.8 ns. The reduced spectral density mapping indicates that the dynamic properties are quite similar for most residues in the protein (Fig. 5). The behavior of residues with spectral density values strongly different from the average can be explained by increased internal flexibility or conformational exchange (see below).Table IISummary of restraint violations and quality analysis for 25 NIP1 structuresDYANA target function (Å2)1.52±0.32Distance restraints violationsUpper distance limit violations, average maximum (Å)0.43±0.10Lower distance limit violations, average maximum (Å)0.28±0.08Dihedral angle restraints violationsAverage maximum (°)0.04±0.02Van der Waals distance restraints violationsAverage maximum (Å)0.14±0.04Ramachandran analysisMost favored regions (%)67.4Additionally allowed regions (%)29.5Generally allowed regions (%)0.9Disallowed regions (%)2.2Root mean square deviations of atomic coordinatesBackbone and heavy side-chain, all residues (Å)1.753Backbone, all residues (Å)1.157Backbone and heavy side-chain, residues 3—11, 14—45, 51—60 (Å)1.273Backbone, idem (Å)0.660 Open table in a new tab The NIP1 Structure—NIP1 has a well defined structure predominantly formed by β-strands (Figs. 4, A and B). It consists of two parts that have a well defined mutual orientation. The five intramolecular disulfide bonds play a major role in the NIP1 fold, providing a high level of stability. This was illustrated by circular dichroism measurements, which showed that most of the secondary structure elements are preserved even at 100 °C. 3V. Li and W. Knogge, unpublished results. The disulfide bond pattern determined with the “partial reduction procedure” was confirmed by the NMR measurements. A closer look at the NIP1 structure reveals that if the N-terminal two residues and β5 were discarded, the structure can be considered as a tandem repeat of similar structural parts. Each part contains four cysteines in structurally equivalent positions (Cys8, Cys9, Cys19, and Cys26 in the first, and Cys32, Cys33, Cys42, and Cys53 in the second part). The first and fourth cysteines of each domain form a disulfide bond, whereas the second cysteine of the first (Cys9) and the third cysteine of the second part (Cys42) form a disulfide bond between the parts. The remaining two cysteines (Cys19 and Cys33) form disulfides with the cysteines at the N and C termini (Cys3 and Cys60, respectively), and it can readily be imagined how longer structures can be formed as tandem repeats of these structural motifs. 4A.

https://openalex.org/W2042969084,"Hemoglobin from the leech Macrobdella decora belongs to the class of giant extracellular hexagonal bilayer globin structures found in annelid and vestimentiferan worms. These complexes consist of 144 heme-bearing subunits, exhibit a characteristic quaternary structure (2 × (6 × (3 × 4))), and contain tetramers as basic substructures that express cooperative oxygen binding and thus provide a structural basis for a hierarchy in allosteric interactions. A thorough analysis of the isolated tetramer indicates that it functions as a trimer of cooperatively interacting subunits and a non-cooperative monomer rather than as four interacting subunits. A thermodynamic analysis of the whole molecule favors the application of a nested Monod-Wyman-Changeux model with six cooperatively interacting 12-mer allosteric units. In contrast to the isolated tetramers, all subunits of the tetramers seem to be coupled cooperatively within the oligomerized 144-mer. Thus, besides hemocyanins and GroEL, the hexagonal bilayer hemoglobins represent another class of proteins in which the hierarchical quaternary structure provides the basis for nested interaction in their functional properties. Hemoglobin from the leech Macrobdella decora belongs to the class of giant extracellular hexagonal bilayer globin structures found in annelid and vestimentiferan worms. These complexes consist of 144 heme-bearing subunits, exhibit a characteristic quaternary structure (2 × (6 × (3 × 4))), and contain tetramers as basic substructures that express cooperative oxygen binding and thus provide a structural basis for a hierarchy in allosteric interactions. A thorough analysis of the isolated tetramer indicates that it functions as a trimer of cooperatively interacting subunits and a non-cooperative monomer rather than as four interacting subunits. A thermodynamic analysis of the whole molecule favors the application of a nested Monod-Wyman-Changeux model with six cooperatively interacting 12-mer allosteric units. In contrast to the isolated tetramers, all subunits of the tetramers seem to be coupled cooperatively within the oligomerized 144-mer. Thus, besides hemocyanins and GroEL, the hexagonal bilayer hemoglobins represent another class of proteins in which the hierarchical quaternary structure provides the basis for nested interaction in their functional properties. In contrast to vertebrate animals that possess tetrameric hemoglobins in red blood cells and monomeric myoglobin in muscle cells, many invertebrates have extracellular hemoglobins with enormously high molecular weights. Based on electron microscopic and structural analyses, the extracellular hemoglobins of annelids exhibit unique structures that constitute the summit of complexity for oxygen-binding hemes. These proteins exhibit variable heterotropic and homotropic interactions: Bohr effects and cooperativity between the heme groups, respectively, that modulate oxygen transport for a given difference in oxygen tensions at the sites of oxygen loading (gills) and unloading (metabolizing tissues). They consist of hexagonal bilayer (HBL) 1The abbreviations used are: HBL, hexagonal bilayer; MWC, Monod-Wyman-Changeux; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. molecules composed of two superimposed rings that each contain six dodecamers, each comprising three tetramers (12 oxygen-binding heme groups) as well as a number of heme-free “linker” chains that tether the structure (1Fushitani K.

The hierarchical arrangement of the leech hemoglobin can thus be written as 2 × (6 × (3 × 4)). This quaternary structure is supported by a recent x-ray structure resolution of the HBL hemoglobin from the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (6Royer W.E.J. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc.

Cooperativity between the heme groups of leech Macrobdella decora Hb is low (maximum Hill coefficient (n H) of ∼3) compared with the large number of heme groups, and both the cooperativity coefficient and the oxygen affinity (Bohr factor (ϕ) of –0.4) are pH-sensitive (8Weber R.E.

No conclusive information is available with regard to the influence of hierarchical structure on the expression of cooperative and allosteric interactions in annelid hemoglobins. This is in part because of differences in the functional criteria considered in different studies (O2 affinity, cooperativity, Bohr effect, cation and temperature effects, etc.), the specific physicochemical conditions (pH, effector concentration, temperature, etc.), the species used for study, and the point of reference (whole blood or purified Hb) (5Weber R.E.

Furthermore, decreasing Bohr factors (ϕ = –0.38, –0.30, and 0, respectively) and Hill coefficients at half-saturation (n 50 = 3.1, 1.4, and 1.0, respectively) were observed (8Weber R.E. Malte H.

Solutions of native hemoglobin and its tetrameric dissociation product were prepared from pond leech M. decora as previously described (8Weber R.E. Malte H. Braswell E.H. Oliver R.W. Green B.N.

Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in the presence of Tris/BisTris buffers at 25 °C and pH 7.26. MWC Model—The oxygen binding curves of leech hemoglobin were analyzed according to the MWC model using the following binding polynomial (Equation 1) (18Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990Google Scholar). PMWC,q=(1+Krx)q+lo(1+Ktx)q=Prq+loPtq(Eq. 1) Thus, the molecule can adopt two different conformations (t and r) that are characterized by binding constants Kt and Kr. The size of the allosteric unit is q. The oxygen saturation curve (Θ) is obtained as Θ = ∂ ln P/q∂ ln x, where x is the ligand activity. Mindful of the finding that the dodecameric substructures of L. terrestris Hb consist of trimers (abc chains) plus monomers (d chains) that form abcd complexes and that this assembly has been confirmed by electron microscopic investigations (19de Haas F. Kuchumov A. Taveau J.-C. Boisset N. Vinogradov S.N. Lamy J.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure at a resolution of 5.5 Å (6Royer W.E.J. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the binding data were further analyzed using an alternative model. This model is based on a cooperative structure consisting of m trimers and loosely associated m monomers that do not participate in conformational transitions. For the analysis of the isolated tetramer, m = 1. The m trimers are described by the MWC polynomial P MWC,3m analogous to Equation 1, and the m monomers by the corresponding binding polynomial PM (Equation 2). PM=1+KMxPm(3+1)=Pr3mPMm+loPr3mPMm=PMWC,3mPMmΘ=xmKMPMm-1PMWC,3m+PMm3m(PR3m-1KR+loKTPT3m-1)m(3+1)PMmPMWC,3m=14ΘM+34ΘMWC,3m(Eq. 2) Thus, in this model, q = 3m. This model is referred to as the 3 + 1 model. Because the tetramer of M. decora HBL dissociates into monomers and dimers, the tetramer was also analyzed based on a 2 + 2 variant of Equation 2 (Equation 3). Θ=12ΘM+12ΘMWC,2(Eq. 3) Nested MWC Model—For analysis of the whole 144-mer molecule, the nested MWC model (15Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was additionally applied in the following form (Equation 4). Pnest=PRs+ΛPTs=(PrRw+lRPtRw)s+Λ(PrTw+lTPtTw)sΛ=L(+lR)s(+lT)sPαβ=1+Kα,βxαβ=rR,tR,rT,tT(Eq. 4) In this model, a number of w subunits form an allosteric unit according to the MWC model and can adopt two basic conformations (r and t). However, when these allosteric units again assemble into a larger structure, consisting of s copies of the w-sized allosteric units, additional constraints are imposed on the conformations. The s × w structure can again be considered as a (large) allosteric unit with size q = s × w, which can adopt two conformations (R and T). When the (s × w)-mer is in the R-state, the nested w-mer allosteric units can adopt the two conformations rR and tR. When the (s × w)-mer is in the T-state, two other conformations (rT and tT) are available. Thus, the conformation of the (s × w)-mer defines the conformation of the nested w-mers in a hierarchical manner. The equilibrium between unliganded Ro and To states is given by Lo = [To ]/[Ro ]. The allosteric equilibrium constants lR and lT correspond to lR = [tRo ]/[rRo ] and lT = [tTo ]/[rTo ]. The hierarchical cooperative model for three cooperatively linked tetramers (s = 3, w = 4) is shown in Fig. 1. It should be borne in mind that the largest allosteric unit is not necessarily the whole molecule. The largest allosteric unit might be smaller if further oligomerization of these allosteric units to the final structure does not induce functional coupling. To avoid confusion, we should point out the difference between the Hill coefficient n H and q, which is the size of the allosteric unit in a concerted model for cooperativity based on the MWC model. In such a model, it is assumed that, under equilibrium conditions, a number of q subunits always adopt the same conformation. Thus, the parameter q of an MWC model describes exactly how many subunits are coupled when the MWC model is assumed. All subunits in this allosteric unit have the same affinity for ligands. An allosteric unit undergoes conformational transitions in a concerted manner, so combinations of different conformations within this allosteric unit can exist only transiently. Whether this scenario results in a low or high cooperativity as quantified by a high or low Hill coefficient depends also on the difference in the affinity for the ligand when the allosteric unit is in different conformations and on the equilibrium constant between these conformations. Thus, the number q describes only how many subunits are coupled such that they always adopt the same conformations, whereas the Hill coefficient, as a measure of cooperativity, depends on both the size of the allosteric unit and all relevant equilibrium constants. The Hill coefficient can never exceed the number of interacting sites, which is the size of the allosteric unit in a concerted model (n H < q). Thus, the Hill coefficient represents a lower limit for the size of the allosteric unit (18Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990Google Scholar). For each of the possible models, the relevant equations for the dependence of oxygen saturation (Θ) on the oxygen partial pressure were fitted to the data. For the analysis based on the MWC model, three parameters were determined: the two binding constants Kt and Kr and the allosteric equilibrium constant lo. In some cases, the size of the allosteric unit (q) was also optimized. The nested MWC model is described by seven parameters, i.e. four binding constants (KtT, KrT, KtR , and KrR) and three allosteric equilibrium constants (lT, lR , and Lo). The fitting routine was based on a nonlinear regression analysis (Levenberg-Marquardt-routine) incorporated into the program Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The iterations stopped when the change in the sum of the square of residuals was <0.0001. Analysis of the Oxygen Binding of Isolated Tetramers—A representative binding curve of the isolated tetramer is shown in Fig. 2A. The p 50 is ∼3 torr. The tetramer obviously shows cooperative oxygen binding (Fig. 2B). The affinity constants for the first and last binding step can be estimated by extrapolation of the upper and lower asymptotes of the Hill plots, resulting in K 1 and Kn values of ∼0.31 and 1 torr–1, respectively. Fig. 2C shows the variation of the Hill coefficient with the degree of oxygenation. The maximum value of ∼2 occurs near 80% saturation. In a more detailed analysis, the two-state MWC model was applied. When no constraints were included, a q value of ∼13 was obtained for the number of interacting oxygen-binding sites in the allosteric unit (Table I). This is obviously incorrect for isolated tetramers. The size of the allosteric unit for the tetramers was therefore fixed (q = 4). The fit revealed a strong interdependence between the values for Kr and lo , which is reflected in the large errors for these two parameters.Table IAllosteric parameters for tetramers and 144-mers analyzed by the MWC modelIsolated tetramer144-merMWC q freeMWC q = 4MWC trimer + monomerMWC q freeMWC q = 12Km1.3 ± 0.2log lo6.40 ± 0.177.0 ± 5.33.1 ± 0.96.1 ± 0.17.5 ± 0.2Kt0.29 ± 0.0170.26 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.020.044 ± 0.0010.056 ± 0.002Kr1.19 ± 0.0521.4 ± 58.93.1 ± 2.01.12 ± 0.030.88 ± 0.03q13.7 ± 0.74 (fixed)3 (fixed)8.3 ± 0.212 (fixed)r 20.999950.99910.999660.999880.99928 Open table in a new tab An alternative approach was followed based on subunit analysis and information on the structure of Lumbricus Hb (1Fushitani K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10275-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that each tetramer consists of a cooperative trimer and an ionically linked monomer that can readily be dissociated and does not contribute to cooperativity. A conformation-independent affinity is assigned to the monomer on the assumption that it does not form part of the allosteric unit (Equation 2). This model gives a better fit than the MWC model as judged from the r 2 values (Table I). Furthermore, the errors in the parameters are significantly lower. Thus, the purified tetramers seem to function as a cooperative trimer and a non-cooperative monomer instead of four cooperatively linked subunits. One might consider alternative models for describing the tetramer, such as a 2 × 2 nested MWC model (Equation 3). However, the regression coefficient remained lower than that obtained for the 3 + 1 model (Table I). The parameters were not well defined: pairs of binding constants were very similar, so the nested MWC model is basically reduced to a simple MWC or three-state model with q = 2 during the numerical optimization. Thus, the data indicate that a nested MWC model is not suitable for the isolated tetramer. Analysis of the 144-mer—The whole leech hemoglobin molecules show lower affinity and higher cooperativity than the tetramers. The maximum Hill coefficient (n H) is ∼5 and occurs near the p 50 (Fig. 3). Thus, the allosteric unit within the intact 144-mer structure contains more than five interacting oxygen-binding sites. Based on the Hill plot, the affinity constant for binding of the last oxygen molecule is almost similar in the 144-mer molecule and tetrameric subunits: Kn = 1.2 and 1 torr–1, respectively. In contrast, the affinity of the first oxygen molecule is markedly lower in the 144-mer (K 1 = 0.04 torr–1) than in the isolated tetramer (K 1 = 0.31 torr–1). How can these phenomena be explained on the basis of the structure, and which type of cooperative interactions might occur upon assembly of the tetramers? (a) In the simplest case, the two-state MWC model is applicable. One might expect that the association of tetramers to form the 144-mer leads to formation of larger allosteric units. Furthermore, it is possible that, because of the formation of the larger structure, the uncoupled monomer, which is not part of the allosteric unit in the isolated tetramer, becomes functionally coupled. Indeed, the two-state MWC model is applicable to the binding data of the 144-mer. The best fit was obtained with a value of q = 8.3 ± 0.2 for the size of the allosteric unit (Table I). Thus, in the framework of the MWC model, two tetramers are coupled to form an allosteric unit. This implies that the 144-mer is composed of 144/8 = 18 non-interacting allosteric units, each containing eight interacting subunits. Bearing in mind the information about the structural hierarchy (2 × (6 × (3 × 4))), this result can hardly be rationalized. (b) Possibly the four subunits of the basic tetramer retain their allosteric properties also in the 144-mer. To take this possibility into account, the MWC model was extended to allow for a tetrameric structure, which consists of an interacting trimer and a non-interacting monomer (Equation 2). For the analysis of the 144-mer, m of these 3 + 1 tetramers might be coupled. In this case, the nonlinear regression yielded m = 1.8≈2. Thus, the cooperative properties in this model again indicate an octameric structure, i.e. the functional coupling of two 3 + 1 tetramers, which is unlikely (as case a). (c) As a further alternative, we applied the nested MWC model for cooperativity (Equation 3), respecting the hierarchy in the structure of 144-mer leech hemoglobin. The simplest approach is to consider the tetramers as the basic allosteric unit (s = 4) and the dodecamer as the allosteric unit at the next level because the structural information indicates that three tetramers are coupled. The cooperative molecule in this model therefore consists of three cooperatively interacting tetramers, whose four subunits also interact cooperatively (Fig. 1). This model provided a better fit to the data than a nonhierarchical MWC model. However, we cannot exclude additional functional coupling at a higher structural level such as between the 12-mers within the 144-mer. In this scenario, the basic allosteric unit is assumed to be a 12-mer, six copies of which are coupled to form the 72-mer half-molecule (Table II). In this case, the regression coefficient was slightly higher, which favors this variant of the nested MWC model. However, the difference is small, so the 3 × 4 model cannot be entirely excluded as a possible mechanism. When the data were analyzed based on a 12 × 12 model, the values for the parameters were similar to those found for the 6 × 12 model. The linear regression coefficient was slightly lower in the 12 × 12 model, which again favors the 6 × 12 model.Table IIAllosteric parameters for intact Hb analyzed using the nested MWC modelw = 4, s = 3w = 12, s = 6w = 12, s = 12log lR1.9 ± 157.1 ± 0.27.0 ± 0.2log Lo5.8 ± 112 ± 0.23.0 ± 0.3log lT1.0 ± 2.210.0 ± 0.58.8 ± 0.7KtT0.008 ± 0.060.035 ± 0.0020.041 ± 0.0022KrT0.19 ± 0.351.41 ± 0.21.11 ± 0.2KtR0.38 ± 4.60.065 ± 0.0020.063 ± 0.002KrR1.9 ± 210.83 ± 0.040.81 ± 0.05r 20.9999640.9999670.999957 Open table in a new tab The 144-mer Hb from the leech M. decora has been extensively investigated structurally and functionally (3de Haas F.

However, cooperative oxygen binding is not well defined by a cooperative model especially when the hierarchical structure is respected. When oxygen binding curves of 144-mer HBL from M. decora were analyzed on the basis of the MWC model, the size of the allosteric unit was found to be 7–16 depending on the experimental conditions and weighting of the data points in the fitting procedure (8Weber R.E.

Furthermore, the binding constant for the high affinity R conformation changes with pH, which does not agree with a concerted model like the MWC model (21Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the simple MWC model needs to be extended by including further conformations. Similar observations were made for other extracellular respiratory proteins, which often show hierarchically arranged oligomeric structures (4Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond J.S. Wall J.S. Weber R.E.

In a number of cases, the simplest concerted model of cooperativity, the MWC model, cannot adequately describe the oxygen binding properties of these molecules (8Weber R.E. Malte H. Braswell E.H.

Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An extension of the MWC model that takes into account the structural hierarchy is the nested MWC model (14Decker H. Robert C.H. Gill S.J. Linzen B. Inverted Oxygen Carriers. Springer Verlag, Berlin1986: 383-388Google Scholar, 15Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which was applied here to describe the cooperative binding properties of leech HBL. The fact that leech hemoglobin molecules do not dissociate into the 72- or 12-mer substructures (halves and one twelfths of the intact HBL molecules, respectively), but form tetramers upon removal of Ca2+ ions, suggests that the tetramers may play an important role in the cooperative interactions. Therefore, the oxygen binding properties of the isolated tetramer were analyzed and compared with the properties of tetramers embedded in the 144-mer structure. Isolated Tetramers—The MWC model provides a good description of the binding curve of the isolated tetramers. However, the cooperative “trimer + monomer” model used for the analysis provides the better fit of the MWC model to the data among those parameter sets, which yield reasonable values for the size of the allosteric unit (q ≤ 4). This result also explains why the Hill plot is not symmetrical. The non-symmetric Hill plot appears to be attributable to the superimposition of non-cooperative oxygen binding to the monomer, which dominates at low oxygen pressure, and cooperative binding to the trimer, which dominates at higher oxygen pressure. Thus, the maximum Hill coefficient is found at ∼80% saturation, and n 50 < n max. When the Hill coefficient is calculated for the cooperative trimer and plotted against the saturation of the trimer, a symmetric distribution is found as expected (data not shown). In the framework of this model, the value for K 1 as determined from the Hill plot largely corresponds to that for oxygen binding to the monomers (K 1 ≈ Km /4). It should be noted that the 3 + 1 tetrameric structure seems to be common in oligochetes and polychetes, whereas achete (leech) hemoglobins seem to dissociate into monomers and disulfide-bonded dimers (4Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond J.S. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradow S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Weber R.E. Malte H. Braswell E.H. Oliver R.W. Green B.N. Sharma P.K. Kuchumov A. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 703-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the observation that the Hill coefficient for oxygen binding of isolated tetramers of leech hemoglobin has a value of ∼2 indicates that the allosteric unit is larger than a dimer. Indeed, when an MWC model foreseeing a dimeric allosteric unit plus two uncoupled monomers (Equation 3) is fitted to the data, the regression coefficient is lower for the 2 + 2 model than for the 3 + 1 model (r 2 = 0.9993 and 0.99966, respectively). Furthermore, the values for lo and Kr are very large, indicating that the model has to be stretched to its physical limit (q = n H) to describe the data. Thus, the oxygen binding data are consistent with structural evidence for the 3 + 1 tetramers (6Royer W.E.J. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), indicating that the hierarchy in functional coupling in the oligomeric structure does not necessarily reflect the dissociation products of HBLs. Intact 144-mer Molecules—The MWC model also provides a good description of oxygen binding of the whole 144-mer molecules. However, the number of interacting subunits (q = 8.3) seems to be inconsistent with three-dimensional reconstructions for Lumbricus Hb, which show three tightly coupled tetramers (6Royer W.E.J. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One might be tempted to interpret q = 8.3 as an indication that the size of the allosteric unit is q = 9 with three interacting trimers and the three remaining monomers being loosely attached, as found for the isolated tetramer. However, when such a model is applied (Equation 2), the model is compatible with the data only when the number of interacting subunits is about six (q = 3m ≈ 3 × 2). The only way to restore three trimers as an allosteric unit is to assume that the loosely associated monomers do not bind oxygen at all. However, because no indications for a loss of function were observed in the analysis of the isolated tetramer, this hypothesis can be discarded. Based on the three-dimensional reconstructions, which show a structural hierarchy (2 × (6 × (3 × 4))), one would expect multiples of tetramers, 12-mers, 72-mers, or the 144-mers as allosteric units. Furthermore, the hierarchy in the quaternary structure favors the nested MWC model over the simple MWC model. The nested MWC model moreover provides better agreement between the model and data. The structure of 144-mer leech hemoglobin might be interpreted in terms of two possible functional hierarchies. In one model, the basic allosteric units are tetramers that are further functionally coupled (s × 4) into larger allosteric units. Alternatively, the dodecamers form the smallest basic allosteric unit, 6 or 12 of which are functionally coupled to form the half-molecule and the native molecule, respectively (6 × 12 or 12 × 12). The results for these two models slightly favor the 6 × 12 model due to the higher regression coefficient compared with the 3 × 4 and 12 × 12 models. Are there any additional similarities in the hierarchy of the functional properties when respiratory proteins from arthropods and annelids are compared? The oxygen binding data of the 12-mer lobster hemocyanin could be described in terms of a 2 × 6 model, and those of the 24-mer spider and scorpion hemocyanins in terms of a 2 × 12 model (21Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, in each case, the half-molecules correspond to the basic allosteric unit. When the oxygen binding of the isolated half-molecules was investigated, it turned out that these could well be described by the simple MWC model. Furthermore, the binding affinities of the two conformations in the MWC model correspond to the binding affinities of the R-state of the nested MWC model, which describes the oxygen binding behavior of the whole complex (21Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Makino N. Ohnaka H.

Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Can such a pattern also be found when the binding properties of the tetrameric leech globins are compared with those of the intact 144-mer hemoglobin? Because the binding constant for the R-state in the tetramer is not very well defined, the following strategy was performed. The binding data for the tetramer were reanalyzed with values for Kr corresponding either to KrT or KrR as found for the 144-mer molecules. The results as obtained for the s × 12 model are shown in Table III. The results indicate that it is more likely that the isolated tetramers behave like the T-state of the nested MWC model. This is based on two criteria: the linear regression coefficient is larger, and the value for Kt (given in Table III) is more similar to the corresponding low affinity conformation. When Kr = KrR , one would expect Kt ≈ KtR ; and when Kr = KrT , one would expect Kt ≈ KtT. The values obtained in the reanalysis show that this criterion is met for the T-state (Kt = 0.049 ± 0.006 and KtT = 0.035 ± 0.002 torr–1) rather than for the R-state (Kt = 0.013 ± 0.006 and KtR = 0.065 ± 0.002 torr–1). Both for the 12 × 12 and 6 × 12 models, the Kt value for the tetramer and the KtT value for the 144-mer are similar. However, the agreement between data and model for the tetramer with fixed Kr values is slightly better with the 6 × 12 model than with the 12 × 12 model (Table III).Table IIIAllosteric parameters for the isolated tetramer with fixed values for KrKr = KrR (6 × 12)Kr = KrT (6 × 12)Kr = KrT (12 × 12)Km1.7 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.2log lo1.53 ± 0.022.15 ± 0.021.86 ± 0.02Kt0.013 ± 0.0070.049 ± 0.0060.035 ± 0.007Kr0.83 (fixed)1.41 (fixed)1.11 (fixed)r 20.999390.999560.99950 Open table in a new tab In the analysis of the ATPase activity of GroEL based on the nested MWC model (27Hellmann N. Decker H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1599: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and in the analysis of the oxygen binding data of 12-mer lobster hemocyanin and 24-mer spider and scorpion hemocyanins (21Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a typical pattern for the parameter values describing the nested MWC mode was found: viz. KtT < KtR < KrR < KrT and Lo ≪ lR < lT. The same pattern was found when the 6 × 12 and 12 × 12 models were applied to leech HBL. This represents an additional similarity in functional properties for different hierarchical proteins. Data on the pH dependence of the oxygen binding behavior of leech HBL further support the validity of the nested MWC model for this respiratory protein. The conformational distribution for the 144-mer depicted in Fig. 4 shows that, at pH 7.26 and low oxygen saturation, the apparent oxygen binding constant corresponds to binding to conformation tT. Indeed, K 1 (the value determined from extrapolation of the Hill plot) is similar to KtT (0.04 and 0.035 torr–1, respectively). In contrast, at high oxygen saturation, the apparent binding constant as given by Kn is an average of conformations KrR and KrT (Kn = 1.2, KrR = 0.83, and KrT = 1.41 torr–1 at pH 7.26). The change in Kn with pH as observed for leech HBL (Kn = 0.7 torr–1 at pH 7.08) (8Weber R.E. Malte H. Braswell E.H. Oliver R.W. Green B.N. Sharma P.K. Kuchumov A. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 703-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) indicates that protons favor the low affinity conformations. At low oxygen saturation, the conformation with the lowest affinity already dominates at pH 7.26, so no significant effect of pH on K 1 can be observed (K 1 = 0.06 torr–1 at pH 7.08) (8Weber R.E. Malte H. Braswell E.H. Oliver R.W. Green B.N. Sharma P.K. Kuchumov A. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 703-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, at high oxygen saturation, the fraction of conformation rR probably dominates at pH 7.08, so Kn is similar to KrR. Thus, the hierarchical nested MWC model can explain the pH dependence of oxygen binding reported for leech HBL. As shown in Fig. 4, all conformations postulated by the nested MWC model are adopted by leech HBL within the physiologically relevant pO2 range (1–15 torr). Thus, the different conformations available to this hemoglobin in the framework of the nested MWC model might be important in adapting its oxygen-transporting functions in the blood to changes in environmental and physicochemical properties. Conclusion—Analyses of the oxygen binding data of isolated tetramers and the whole 144-mer molecules of leech HBL indicate that the association of basic tetramers in the native structures creates a hierarchy of cooperativity. The nested MWC model neatly describes the cooperative binding properties. Furthermore, typical values for the oxygen binding parameters and the allosteric equilibrium constants are obtained for the 6 × 12 and 12 × 12 models. The Hb from the leech provides an example of a large multisubunit protein whose quaternary structure shows clear hierarchies to which allosteric equilibria could be assigned. Other examples are the respiratory hemocyanins and the chaperonin GroEL (16Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Hellmann N. Decker H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1599: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This hierarchy in allosteric equilibria allows different effectors to modulate the binding behavior at different structural levels. In addition, the range of cooperative interaction is broadened. Thus, proteins exploiting the nesting principle gain functional plasticity."

Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days and photographed.RESULTSGalactose Induction of GAL Gene Expression Is Inhibited under Iron-deficient Conditions—We initially sought to find if changes in iron conditions affect copper uptake. Because Ctr1p undergoes Mac1p-dependent turnover in response to increasing copper concentrations (24Eng Ooi C. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 25Yonkovich J. McKenndry R. Shi X. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23981-23984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we used yeast strain ZY60, which does not express Mac1p. This strain allowed us to eliminate copper-triggered Ctr1p degradation. ZY60 strain with the p414GAL-CTR1myc tag was grown in standard laboratory medium (an iron-normal condition) and in medium containing the iron chelator, BPS, to cause iron deficiency (28Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 1231-1239Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). GAL1-driven Ctr1-Myc expression was induced by growth on galactose and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (9E10). As shown in Fig. 1A, left panel, the Ctr1-Myc level was much lower in the BPS-treated samples than in the controls. Under the same conditions, no changes in phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) level were detected, indicating that the BPS effect was specific to CTR1 expression. Therefore, GAL1-driven CTR1 expression appears to be inhibited when iron is limited.We were concerned that the observed effect of BPS might be caused by changes other than iron limitation. We reasoned that iron addition should ameliorate the change in CTR1 expression. To find if we were correct, we first treated cells with BPS and then with Fe3+ salt. The data in Fig. 1A, right panel, show that the addition of exogenous Fe3+ ions to the BPS-treated cells raised the Ctr1-Myc level in a dose-dependent fashion. We also compared GAL promoter-driven CTR1 expression (from p414GAL-CTR1myc) in the wild type (WT) and fet3Δ or aft1Δ mutants (13Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Kaplan S.D. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 28Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 1231-1239Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). AFT1 encodes an iron-sensing transcription factor that activates the transcription of FET3 and other genes in iron-transporting pathways (28Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 1231-1239Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, these mutants would be expected to be relatively iron-starved compared with the wild type. The data in Fig. 1B show that the Ctr1-Myc levels were much lower in the two mutants than in the wild type. When the mutants were grown in Fe3+-supplemented medium the Ctr1-Myc levels increased significantly. In contrast, the PGK level remained constant under the same conditions. These results show that GAL1-driven CTR1 expression is indeed repressed under iron-deficient conditions.To address a concern that GAL1 promoter activity might be inhibited by iron limitation, we repeated the above experiment using a single copy plasmid pCTR1myc (provided by Andy Dancis) in which CTR1-myc expression is under the control of the wild type CTR1 promoter (24Eng Ooi C. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We initially detected a modest reduction in Ctr1-Myc level in BPS-treated cells with respect to control cells (data not shown). However, this result was not reproducible. These results led us to suspect that iron deficiency might instead inhibit galactose induction of the GAL1 promoter. To explore this possibility we used strain SH26, in which SWE1 is under the control of the GAL promoter and GAL-SWE1 is integrated into the genome. SWE1 encodes a protein kinase that is involved in the cell cycle (30Sia R.A. Herald H.A. Lew D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and there is currently no indication that SWE1 function is affected by iron. The cells were grown in galactose medium either in the absence or presence of BPS; Swe1p was detected by Western blotting with anti-Swe1 antibody. As presented in Fig. 1C, left panel, Swe1 level was dramatically reduced in the BPS-treated cells in comparison to that of the control cells. Furthermore, deletion of the chromosomal AFT1 gene in the SH26 strain background also resulted in a marked reduction in SWE1 expression (middle panel), which was corrected by Fe3+ supplementation (right panel). Based on these results, we concluded that the galactose induction of the GAL1 promoter is defective when iron is deficient.Iron-deficient Mutants Show Defective Utilization of Galactose for Growth—The data in Fig. 1 indicate that the expression of galactose-metabolizing genes is likely reduced under iron-deficient conditions, so one could infer that the ability of iron-deficient cells to metabolize galactose would be reduced accordingly. We compared the growth of wild type (WT) and aft1Δ and fet3Δ cells on medium containing either glucose or galactose with or without Fe3+ salt. For controls we used an isogenic gal7Δ mutant. GAL7 encodes an uridyltransferase for metabolizing galactose (31Johnson M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deficiencies in human uridyltransferase activity cause the disease galactosemia (26Segal S. Berry G.T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

TIG (Trends Genet.). 1998; 14: 98-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, left panel, the wild type, aft1Δ, fet3Δ, and gal7Δ strains grew equally well on glucose medium. On galactose medium, the aft1Δ and fet3Δ cells exhibited an obvious slow growth, the gal7Δ mutant did not grow at all, and the wild type grew normally (middle panel), indicating that the naturally iron-deficient aft1Δ and fet3Δ mutants are indeed defective in their ability to metabolize galactose. When high levels of exogenous Fe3+ ions were present, both the aft1Δ and fet3Δ mutants, but not the gal7Δ, were able to grow on galactose medium (right panel), suggesting that the defect of aft1Δ and fet3Δ cells to metabolize galactose is probably because of a lack of iron.Fig. 2Naturally iron-deficient cells are defective in galactose metabolism. Isogenic strains BY4741 (WT), BY4741aft1Δ, BY4741fet3Δ, and BY4741gal7Δ were streaked onto agar containing synthetic complete medium with glucose (GLUCOSE), or galactose (GALACTOSE), or galactose and exogenous iron salt at 10 μm concentration (GALACTOSE+Fe). Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days and then photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have shown that galactose metabolism was altered by iron deficiency. We found that galactose-dependent induction of GAL promoter-driven gene expression was inhibited when iron was lacking and that iron-deficient cells had a diminished ability to grow on galactose medium. These two defects were corrected by iron replacement, demonstrating a requirement of iron for normal galactose metabolism. Therefore, iron homeostasis and galactose metabolism are connected with one other.The physiology of galactose metabolism is well understood at the molecular level (for reviews, see Refs. 31Johnson M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 32Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar and references therein). Galactose is converted into glucose-6 phosphate (Glu-6-P) through the highly conserved Leloir pathway (33Leloir L.F. Arch. Biochem. 1951; 33: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The conversion is catalyzed by galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, and uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, these enzymes are encoded by GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10, respectively. The expression of these GAL genes is galactose-inducible. The induction requires DNA binding by the transcriptional activator Gal4p. When glucose is present, the DNA binding of Gal4p is prevented by Gal80p, resulting in transcriptional repression of the GAL genes. Current thinking indicates that when cells are grown on galactose, an unidentified inducer molecule prevents Gal80p from inhibiting Gal4p function, thereby allowing expression of GAL genes. The inducer molecule has not been identified, but it was once believed to be a galactose metabolite that interacts with Gal3p (34Broach J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).How does iron deficiency inhibit the galactose induction of GAL gene expression? Because the uridyltransferase Gal7p is a Zn2+ and Fe2+ metalloprotein and the metal ions are apparently required for the transferase activity (35Ruzick F.J. Wedekind J.E. Kim J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5610-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is possible that the activity of this galactose-metabolizing enzyme is reduced under iron-deficient conditions. This possibility is consistent with our observation that iron application rescued the growth of naturally iron-deficient cells on galactose medium (Fig. 2). However, if this were true, how could reduction in Gal7p activity inhibit GAL gene induction by galactose? One has to assume that galactose induction of the GAL gene is dependent on galactose metabolism itself as previously hypothesized (34Broach J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that Gal7p might be involved in the production of an inducer molecule, perhaps UDP-Gal. We made this assumption because Gal7p catalyzes the production of UDP-Gal in the galactose metabolism pathway (33Leloir L.F. Arch. Biochem. 1951; 33: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To examine this assumption, we induced GAL-driven CTR1-MYC expression with galactose in the wild type and gal7Δ strains and treated cells with BPS. We found that CTR1-MYC expression was drastically reduced in the gal7Δ strain in comparison to the wild type (Fig. 3). This result offers further evidence that galactose induction of GAL gene expression is dependent on galactose metabolism. Furthermore, in the gal7Δ strain the CTR1-MYC expression was still repressed by BPS treatment as in the wild type, suggesting that a lack of iron might affect factor(s) other than Gal7p in terms of GAL gene expression. We also tested whether UDP-Gal is able to induce the GAL expression in the absence of galactose in intact cells and spheroplasts and found that GAL-driven CTR1-MYC expression was not induced (data not shown).Fig. 3The deletion effect of GAL7 on GAL gene expression. The p414GAL-CTR1myc plasmid was transformed into BY4741 (WT) and BY4741gal7Δ (gal7Δ) strains. Cells were grown in SC-TRP medium containing 2% raffinose until an A 600 of 1.0 was reached. The galactose was added to a final concentration of 0.5% with or without BPS at a concentration of 200 μm. The cells were induced for 3 h. Ctr1-Myc and PGK were detected as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additionally, an earlier study showed that galactose induction of GAL gene expression was affected by mitochondria function with respect to the IMP1 gene, which encodes an inner membrane peptidase (36Algeri A.A. Bianchi L. Viola A.M. Puglisi P.P. Marmiroli N. Genetics. 1981; 97: 27-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The wild type IMP1 strain could grow on and ferment galactose only in respiratory-deficient conditions. The strains carrying recessive allele imp1 of the IMP1 could also grow on and ferment galactose but only under respiratory-sufficient conditions (36Algeri A.A. Bianchi L. Viola A.M. Puglisi P.P. Marmiroli N. Genetics. 1981; 97: 27-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because a lack of iron leads to respiratory deficiency (1Karlin K.D. Science. 1993; 261: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), the iron deficiency-related inhibition of GAL gene induction could be because of defective mitochondria function. However, the strains used in this study all carry IMP1. When iron is lacking, one would expect the GAL gene to be induced by galactose and the naturally iron-deficient cells to be able to grow on galactose medium, which is not what we observed. Therefore, the effect of iron deficiency on GAL gene induction might not be wholly linked to mitochondria dysfunction. A recent genome-wide microarray that compared glucose- and galactose-grown wild type and GAL gene deletion mutants found that expression of iron and copper transporter genes was altered (38Ideker T. Thorsson V. Ranish J.A. Christmas R. Buhler J. Eng J.K. Bumgarner R. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Hood L. Science. 2001; 292: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). This profile suggests that there might be coordination between sugar metabolism and metal ion homeostasis, at least with respect to iron and copper. Also, iron might influence galactose metabolism through a mechanism that has yet to be discovered.The discovery that iron deficiency impairs the ability of a cell to metabolize galactose might have direct clinical applications. A study reported (3Looker A.C. Dallman P.R. Carroll M.D. Gunter E.W. Johnson C.L. JAMA. 1997; 277: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that even in the United States, 3% of toddlers and 2–5% of teenage girls are sufficiently iron-deficient to develop anemia. Those individuals who lack sufficient iron might also suffer a secondary defect in galactose metabolism. The finding might also help to explain why an infant needs more iron than an adult to support his rapid growth (3Looker A.C. Dallman P.R. Carroll M.D. Gunter E.W. Johnson C.L. JAMA. 1997; 277: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because galactose is formed by the hydrolysis of lactose-rich breast milk. Because copper deficiency can result in iron deficiency, copper homeostasis might indirectly influence galactose metabolism as well. Future studies are warranted to determine the molecular mechanisms that link metal ions to galactose metabolism. This work has provided an opening into the exploration of the impact of metal ion homeostasis on the genetic foundations of sugar metabolism.A clear implication of this fortuitous finding concerns the use of GAL promoters to direct gene expression in studying iron homeostasis. Because GAL gene promoters show high levels of inducibility, they are widely used to direct gene expression (31Johnson M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such promoters have been used in several studies to express FET3, FTR1, AFT1, AFT2, and other factors important in iron homeostasis (29Blaiseau, P-L., Lesuisse, E., and Camadro, J.-M. J. Biol. Chem., 276, 34221–34226Google Scholar, 39Spizzo T. Byersdorfer C. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; : 547-556PubMed Google Scholar, 40Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

In light of the data reported here, the use of GAL-driven expression systems to investigate Fe homeostasis should be carefully controlled and interpreted with caution. Iron acts as an enzyme cofactor and protein structural component in living organisms. It is indispensable for an array of metabolic functions, including cellular energy production and DNA synthesis (1Karlin K.D. Science. 1993; 261: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 2Cammack R. Wrigglesworth J.M. Baum H. Ponka P. Schulman H.M. Woodworth R.C. Iron Transport and Storage. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1990: 17-39Google Scholar). Iron-deficient anemia is known to impair immune function and cognitive development (3Looker A.C. Dallman P.R. Carroll M.D. Gunter E.W. Johnson C.L.

Normal iron homeostasis requires the presence of copper, which is also an essential nutrient. High-affinity iron uptake in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Cu2+-dependent because Fet3p, a component of the high-affinity iron transporter complex, is a Cu2+-dependent ferrous oxidase (13Askwith C.

https://openalex.org/W2027982782,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases are key proteins involved in plant and protozoal Ca2+ signaling. These unique molecules include a calcium regulatory calmodulin-like domain (CLD), which binds to another small regulatory domain named the junction domain (JD). Both CLD and JD are part of the same polypeptide as the protein kinase domain. The CLD consists of N- and C-terminal lobes, each having two helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs. In this study, fluorescence resonance energy transfer using a series of Trp and Cys site-directed mutants was undertaken to probe the relative motions of the two lobes of CLD between the apo- and Ca2+-saturated forms, as well as bound to a peptide encoding the JD sequence. Using an IAEDANS-modified Cys, a total of 15 Trp → Cys distances were measured in these three states from the five donor-acceptor combinations F334W-Cys436, L371W-Cys436, L403W-Cys436, F334W-L403C, and L371W-L403C. Consistent with recently reported NMR diffusion measurements and with 1H,15N heteronuclear correlation NMR spectra, the distances derived from fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in apoCLD indicate partial unfolding and a subsequent contraction on binding Ca2+, which is maintained on addition of the JD peptide. Interpretation of the distances suggests that the Ca2+-saturated form is open with the two lobes sitting side-by-side although highly flexible. The transition to the JD-CLD state appears to be accompanied by a rotation of the N- and C-terminal domains with respect to each other inducing a slightly more closed overall complex.

The CDPK response is calcium-dependent but calmodulin (CaM)-independent, presumably because of the presence of an internal Ca2+-regulatory region (calmodulin-like domain, or CLD) near the C terminus of CDPK. The CLD is very similar (>40% identity) to the ubiquitous calcium-regulatory protein CaM. The target for the CLD is another short domain found in CDPK entitled the junction domain (JD), which connects the CLD with the N-terminal protein kinase domain (4Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C. McCaffery C.

In the present report, we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, also known as Förster resonance energy transfer, to provide relatively long-range distance information in the CLD (12Lakowicz J.R.

Measurements are reported for the global positioning of residues Phe344, Leu371, and Leu403 located in the N-terminal domain with respect to the native C-terminal Cys436 residue on binding Ca2+ and JD peptide. Selectively mutating the N-terminal residues to Trp and labeling the Cys with IAEDANS allowed us to obtain interdomain FRET measurements.

M. Weljie and H. J. Vogel, submitted for publication.15N CLD was expressed using a MOPS-based minimal medium as described previously (18Kohno T. Kusunoki H. Sato K. Wakamatsu K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and purified in the same manner. The calcium-dependent hydrophobic chromatography relies on the capacity of the protein to expose a hydrophobic surface in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Vogel H.J. Lindahl L. Thulin E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 241-246Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were introduced based on the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene), where complementary forward and reverse primers encompassing the mutation were used with the pT7-7 wild-type plasmid to generate vectors containing the CLD mutant genes. The forward primers (5′–3′) used were as follows: F344W, GGTGGACTGAAAGAGTTATGGAAGATGATTGACACAGAC; L371W, GCGAGTAGGATCTGAATGGATGGAGTCTGAAATCAAGG; L403W, GCTGCCACTGTTCATTGGAATAAGCTGGAGAGAG; C436S, GAGATACAACAAGCTAGCAAGGACTTTGGTTTAG; L403C, GCTGCCACTGTTCATTGCAATAAGCTGGAGAGAG. Single Trp mutants, F344W, L371W, and L403W, as well as two triple mutants, CSF344W (F344W, L403C,C436S) and CSL371W (L371W,L403C,C436S), were expressed and purified in the same manner as WT-CLD. Because WT-CLD does not contain any Trp residues, these could be introduced as single mutants measuring the distance to the native Cys436 residue of CLD. Triple mutants were required to convert Cys436 to Ser and subsequently introduce both Cys and Trp residues at other locations. The purity of the WT- or mutant CLD proteins was assessed by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE and was over 95%. Peptides encompassing the CLD binding portion of the junction domain of soybean CDPK-α and an N-terminal Cys (Ac-CAVLSRLKQFSAXNKLKKMALRVIA-CO2, where X is norleucine) were synthesized by the peptide synthesis facility, Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Canada, headed by Dr. Gilles Lajoie.IAEDANS Labeling and Fluorescence—Protein was dissolved in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm KCl, pH 8.5) to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and subsequently dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, sodium acetate, and EDTA were added to final concentrations of 25, 6, 2, and 5 mm, respectively. Samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C or overnight at 17 °C, and buffer was exchanged into fluorescence buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm KCl, pH 7.4) using a PD-10 column (Bio-Rad). A 5-fold molar excess of IAEDANS compared with protein was then added from a 1 mm stock solution (pH 8.0) and incubated in darkness for 4 h at 37 °C. The solution was buffer exchanged back into fluorescence buffer to remove excess free IAEDANS. The extent of IAEDANS labeling was assessed by comparing the UV-visible absorbance of IAEDANS at A 450 with the combined absorption of IAEDANS and protein at A 276.Samples used in fluorescence measurements were 5 μm in protein and contained either 4 mm EDTA (apo) or 2 mm (Ca2+ and JD-CLD), and JD-CLD samples also contained 12 μm peptide in a final volume of 2 ml. Measurements were acquired at 25 °C on a Jobin SPEX Fluorolog 3–21 fluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, with a bandpass of 2.5 nm. Emission spectra were acquired from 290 to 575 nm, with a 5 nm band-pass and 0.1 s integration time.FRET Measurements—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency was calculated according to the following relationship (20Wang C.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Lakey J.H. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), E=1-FDA-FD(1-fA)FDfA(Eq. 1) where E is the calculated efficiency, F DA is the emission of the donor (Trp) in the presence of the acceptor (IAEDANS), F D is the donor emission with no label present, and f A is fractional occupancy of the acceptor site (or degree of IAEDANS labeling). Thus for each measurement two sets of data were required, labeled and unlabeled, and the fluorescence was normalized to protein concentration. These efficiency values were then used to calculate the D-A separation using the following relationship, R=(E-1-1)1/6R0(Eq. 2) where R is the D-A separation, and R 0 is the Förster critical distance (12Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368-423Google Scholar). The value for R 0 is dependent on the particular D-A combination, and is typically calculated as R0=(Jκ2Q0n-4)16×9.7×103Ao(Eq. 3) where J is the overlap integral (cm3m-1), Q 0 is the donor quantum yield, n is the refractive index of the solution, and κ is the orientation factor. The values for J, Q 0, n, and κ were taken from the literature (21Lakey J.H. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Lakey J.H. Duche D. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the largest source of error is the assumption that κ is based on the isotropic rotation of both donor and acceptor moieties (giving a value of two-thirds), however, the error in most cases is not unreasonable if relative distances are being sought as in this study (23dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), although the exact value of κ varies for each D-A pair and this assumption may lead to an underestimation of the distance. In this case, NMR structural and relaxation data of a slightly different CLD construct have shown that both the N- and C-terminal lobes exhibit significant chemical exchange, 3A. M. Weljie, S. M. Gagné, and H. J. Vogel, manuscript in preparation. a situation unlikely to produce highly anisotropic orientations especially between D-A combinations between the two lobes. Lackowicz and co-workers (17Zhao X. Kobayashi T. Gryczynski Z. Gryczynski I. Lakowicz J. Wade R. Collins J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Lakowicz J.R. Gryczynski I. Cheung H.C. Wang C.K. Johnson M.L. Joshi N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9149-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have also shown experimentally using anisotropy measurements that this assumption produces negligible error in similar studies of the related TnC protein, and Cheung and co-workers (13Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Xing J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Dong W.J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8686-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have confirmed this result with complexed TnC. It is also important to note that in steady-state FRET measurements, the range of validity for R is ±50% of R 0 (23dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this case, the value of R 0 was 22.7 Å, and hence 11 > R > 33 Å was not considered accurate. The reported measurements and errors for distances are average results from duplicate experiments except for F344W, which was repeated in triplicate.NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR experiments were prepared in a 90/10% H2O/D2O bufferless solution, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2. The pH was adjusted with KOD and DCl, and the final pH was not adjusted for isotope effects. All calcium samples also included 10 mm CaCl2. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired on a 500 MHz 1H field Bruker Avance DRX spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance 5 mm TXI Cryoprobe with a z axis gradient channel. All spectra were referenced with respect to a 1H chemical shift of 0 ppm for the most upfield resonance of 5–5-dimethylsilapentanesulfonate and processed with NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11386) Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification and Labeling—Purification of all mutant proteins was achieved with yields and purity characteristic of WT-CLD. The successful use of Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic chromatography in all instances indicated that the general functional properties of the mutant proteins were not significantly affected. Circular dichroism spectra of the mutant proteins closely resembled those of the wild-type protein, exhibiting a typical α-helical pattern (not shown). For both sites chosen for labeling, Cys436 and L403C, typical yields for labeling reproducibly ranged from 70 to 90%, suggesting significant labeling of a single site. As a result, five possible donor-acceptor pairs (D-A) were identified, three interdomain, F344W-Cys436 (F344W), L371W-Cys436 (L371W), and L403W-Cys436 (L403W), and two N-terminal intradomain, (C436S,F344W)-L403C (CSF344W) and (C436S,L371W)-L403C (CSL371W) (Fig. 1).Spectral Properties of Labeled Proteins— Fig. 2A presents a representative absorption spectrum of Ca2+-saturated F344W and WT-CLD labeled with IAEDANS normalized for the protein concentration. The broad, low peak centered at 350 nm is near the absorption maximum of IAEDANS, which also demonstrates significant absorption around 260 nm. The difference between the two spectra is attributable to the presence of the Trp residue in F344W, as indicated by the increased absorbance between 260 and 300 nm. In Fig. 2B, representative fluorescence emission spectra of labeled and unlabeled L403W, as well as labeled WT-CLD proteins, are presented that demonstrate the resonance energy transfer present in the sample. Labeled wild-type protein demonstrates some IAEDANS fluorescence centered near 460 nm (f A), however, the presence of the single Trp residue in L403W causes an increase in the observed emission intensity (F AD) due to energy transfer. Concomitantly, Trp fluorescence in the protein without IAEDANS present (F D) is centered at 350 nm and is significantly more intense than when both acceptor and donor are present (F DA).Fig. 2A, absorption spectra of wild-type and F344W CLD labeled with IAEDANS. B, fluorescence emission spectra of L403W labeled and unlabeled with IAEDANS and labeled with wild-type protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the apo form, the Trp fluorescence emission maximum wavelength for the three Trp mutants ranged from 336 (F344W) to 350 nm (L403W), and for IAEDANS fluorescence the emission maximum varied between 469 and 475 nm (Fig. 3A). Similar, but slightly blue-shifted ranges were observed for the Ca2+ form with Trp fluorescence emission maximum between 330 (SCF344W) and 343 nm (L371W) and IAEDANS emission peaking between 458 and 461 nm. The Trp emission maximum in the JD peptide-bound forms was once again increasingly blue-shifted, with the peak maximum between 322 (SCF344W) and 338 nm (L371W); however, the IAEDANS emission, ranging from 456 to 465 nm, did not demonstrate significant shifts. The observed blue-shifts roughly correlate with the expected transition from a partially unfolded to an increasingly compact shape (11Weljie A.M. Yamniuk A.P. Yoshino H. Izumi Y. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Normalized fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type CLD and all mutants used in this study, labeled with IAEDANS in the apo form (A), the Ca2+-saturated form (B), and with JD peptide present (C) (JD-CLD). Note that although the data cannot be compared quantitatively in this form (without an indication of unlabeled fluorescence), a qualitative idea of the amount of energy transfer can be obtained by contrasting the intensity of the Trp emission peak (near 340 nm) with that of the IAEDANS emission peak (near 470 nm). All spectra were collected with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurements— Table I presents the calculated energy transfer efficiencies (E) and expected distances (R) for the apo-, Ca2+-, and JD-bound forms of CLD using the method described under “Materials and Methods.” In the apo form, the interdomain distances are larger than the intradomain separations. The largest D-A distance was between L371W and Cys436 (>33 Å), greater than the limit of the experimental system (27Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), and the smallest separation observed was between CSF344W-L403C, 18.7 ± 0.5 Å. The addition of Ca2+ to the CLD induced several significant shifts in the distance between D-A pairs. With the exception of F344W-Cys436, which increased beyond 33 Å, all distances decreased to less than 20 Å (Table I). The largest detectable change occurs between L371W and Cys436, which collapses by more than 13 Å down to 20.0 ± 0.5 Å. Interestingly, the smallest distance calculated in the Ca2+ form was the interdomain, L403W-Cys436 at 17.8 ± 1.0 Å; however, both intradomain measurements are within experimental uncertainty of this distance. These measurements are consistent with a Ca2+-induced collapse as observed by NMR diffusion measurements (11Weljie A.M. Yamniuk A.P. Yoshino H. Izumi Y. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and provide further evidence that the N- and C-terminal domains are not independent. Fig. 4 demonstrates the significant change that occurs in the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of CLD between the apo- (Fig. 4A) and Ca2+-saturated (Fig. 4B) forms. The apoCLD spectrum shows significant peak overlap and poor resonance dispersion characteristic of unfolded or partially folded protein, whereas the Ca2+-CLD spectrum indicates that the protein is folded. As a result, the dramatic changes in the observed FRET distances on addition of Ca2+ is most likely because of Ca2+-induced folding. Interpretation of the physical meaning of these distances with respect to the domain orientations is further extended under “Discussion.”Table IFluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements FRET transfer efficiencies and measured distances in the apo- and Ca2+-saturated forms, as well as with JD peptide, and distances obtained from the JD-CLD NMR structure are shown.F344W-Cys436L371W-Cys436L403W-Cys436CSF344W-L403CCSL371W-L403CE aCalculated energy transfer efficienciesRbMeasured distancesERERERER%Å%Å%Å%Å%Åapo-CLD36 ± 925.1 ± 1.54 ± 1>3335 ± 725.2 ± 1.376 ± 318.7 ± 0.544 ± 423.6 ± 0.6Ca2+-CLD6 ± 7>3368 ± 420.0 ± 0.581 ± 517.8 ± 1.076 ± 818.7 ± 1.380 ± 518.0 ± 0.9JD-CLD33 ± 1826.2 ± 4.566 ± 1220.3 ± 1.860 ± 721.2 ± 1.189 ± 515.9 ± 1.591 ± 115.5 ± 0.4JD-CLD (NMR)29.1 ± 2.520.7 ± 3.721.0 ± 3.815.1 ± 0.811.1 ± 2.3a Calculated energy transfer efficienciesb Measured distances Open table in a new tab Fig. 41H,15N HSQC NMR spectra of apo- (A) and Ca2+-saturated (B) CLD.

M. Weljie and H. J. Vogel, submitted for publication. The intradomain distances decreased and again became the shortest observed, at 15.9 ± 1.5 Å (CSF344W-L403C) and 15.5 ± 0.4 Å (CSL371W-L403C). The F344W-Cys436 distance remains the largest at 26.2 ± 4.5 Å, although the uncertainty in the measurement was also the largest. The distance for L371W-Cys436 remained nearly constant at 20.3 ± 1.8 Å, whereas the L403W-Cys436 distance increased slightly to 21.2 ± 1.1 Å. In terms of the intradomain distances, it is not clear whether these changes reflect intradomain reorientations resulting from binding JD peptide or a restructuring of the C-terminal domain only, as indicated by NMR spectroscopy. 2A. M. Weljie and H. J. Vogel, submitted for publication. Nevertheless, it is clear that the two domains remain proximal and that the N-terminal domain also experiences some type of restructuring as evidenced by the shortening of the intradomain distances. This latter result was not evident previously from NMR data.DISCUSSIONEffect of Conformational Averaging—The approach used in the current study for obtaining spatial interdomain information has been employed extensively recently to characterize proteins involved in cardiac muscle contraction (13Dong W.J.
