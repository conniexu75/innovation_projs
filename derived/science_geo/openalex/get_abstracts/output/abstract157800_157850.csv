https://openalex.org/W2163594803,"In this study we investigate the mechanism of intracellular pH change and its role in malignant transformation using the E7 oncogene of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16). Infecting NIH3T3 cells with recombinant retroviruses expressing the HPV16 E7 or a transformation deficient mutant we show that alkalinization is transformation specific. In NIH3T3 cells in which transformation can be turned on and followed by induction of the HPV16 E7 oncogene expression, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic alkalinization is an early event and was driven by stimulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity via an increase in the affinity of the intracellular NHE-1 proton regulatory site. Annulment of the E7-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization by specific inhibition of the NHE-1, acidification of culture medium, or clamping the pHi to nontransformed levels prevented the development of later transformed phenotypes such as increased growth rate, serum-independent growth, anchorage-independent growth, and glycolytic metabolism. These findings were verified in human keratinocytes (HPKIA), the natural host of HPV. Results from both NIH3T3 and HPKIA cells show that alkalinization acts on pathways that are independent of the E2F-mediated transcriptional activation of cell cycle regulator genes. Moreover, we show that the transformation-dependent increase in proliferation is independent of the concomitant stimulation of glycolysis. Finally, treatment of nude mice with the specific inhibitor of NHE-1, DMA, delayed the development of HPV16-keratinocyte tumors. Our data confirm that activation of the NHE-1 and resulting cellular alkalinization is a key mechanism in oncogenic transformation and is necessary for the development and maintenance of the transformed phenotype."

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-characterized metazoan in which the expression of all genes can be monitored by oligonucleotide arrays. We used such arrays to quantitate the expression of C. elegans genes throughout the development of this organism. The results provide an estimate of the number of expressed genes in the nematode, reveal relations between gene function and gene expression that can guide analysis of uncharacterized worm genes, and demonstrate a shift in expression from evolutionarily conserved genes to worm-specific genes over the course of development."
https://openalex.org/W2001317930,"Recent studies have identified factors responsible for angiogenesis within developing tumors, but mediators of vessel formation at sites of trauma, injury, and wound healing are not clearly established. Here we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) released by platelets during blood clotting is a potent, specific, and selective endothelial cell chemoattractant that accounts for most of the strong endothelial cell chemotactic activity of blood serum, an activity that is markedly diminished in plasma. Preincubation of endothelial cells with pertussis toxin inhibited this effect of S1P, demonstrating the involvement of a Galphai-coupled receptor. After S1P-induced migration, endothelial cells proliferated avidly and differentiated forming multicellular structures suggestive of early blood vessel formation. S1P was strikingly effective in enhancing the ability of fibroblast growth factor to induce angiogenesis in the avascular mouse cornea. Our results show that blood coagulation initiates endothelial cell angiogenic responses through the release of S1P, a potent endothelial cell chemoattractant that exerts its effects by activating a receptor-dependent process."

These minimal sized binders are very robust and bind the antigen with high affinity in a monomeric state. We evaluated the feasibility to produce soluble, functional bispecific and bivalent antibodies in Escherichia coli with camel single-domain antibody fragments as building blocks. Two single-domain antibody fragments were tethered by the structural upper hinge of a natural antibody to generate bispecific molecules. This linker was chosen for its protease resistance in serum and its natural flexibility to reorient the upstream and downstream located domains. The expression levels, ease of purification, and the solubility of the recombinant proteins were comparable with those of the constituent monomers. The individual moieties fully retain the binding capacity and the binding characteristics within the recombinant bispecific constructs. The easy generation steps and the biophysical properties of these bispecific and bivalent constructs based on camel single-domain antibody fragments makes them particularly attractive for use in therapeutic or diagnostic programs.

For example, the immune activation or the cellular targeting of cytotoxic T-cells to mediate killing of tumor cells often benefit from the availability of bispecific antigen binders. Originally, bispecific antibodies were generated by fusing two carefully selected hybridomas (1Milstein C. Cuello A., C. Nature ( Lond. ). 1983; 305: 537Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The disadvantages of this approach are the low yield of functional bispecific protein due to the frequent association between the noncognate antibody chains and the presence of the Fc1 part that might lead to illegitimate targeting to cells containing Fc receptors. The latter inconvenience is easily avoided by building smaller bispecific antigen-binding fragments obtained by tethering scFv fragments (2Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The scFv fragments, formed by genetic engineering and expressed inEscherichia coli, contain only the VH and VL domains joined by a synthetic linker of about 15 amino acids. Multiple strategies were employed to connect different scFvs, e.g. chemical cross-linking with C-terminal cysteine residues (3Brinkmann U. Chowdhury P.S. Roscoe D.M. Pastan I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 182: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), adding naturally associating helices from a four-helix bundle (4Pack P. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), adding leucine zippers (5De Kruif J. Logtenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7630-7634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), adding a CH3 domain with either a knob or hole at the interacting surfaces (6Zhu Z. Presta L.G. Zapata G. Carter P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or by connecting CH1 and CL domains to the respective scFv fragments (7Muller K.M. Arndt K.M. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However the stability of these innovative bispecific constructs remains questionable. Bridging scFvs with a third polypeptide linker to form a bispecific unit has met with limited success, since such constructs contain three linkers known to be susceptible to proteolysis and leading to aggregation. An alternative was provided by the coexpression of two hybrid scFvs made by the VH of a first antibody and the VL gene of a second antibody with a shortened linker of 0–5 amino acids and vice versa (8Holliger P. Prospero T. Winter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6444-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Two polypeptide chains are then forced to dimerize, since the shortened linker does not allow pairing of the domains within one polypeptide chain. The heterodimers of these two polypeptide chains carry two antigen-binding sites in the same molecule. Unfortunately, also homodimers that are nonfunctional might be formed, and therefore, the functional expression of these so-called diabodies often remains low. Moreover, the aberrant angle between the VH-VL pairs may be detrimental to antigen binding (9Lawrence L.J. Kortt A.A. Iliades E. Tulloch P.A. Hudson P.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is clear that the functional bispecific antibody constructs are in need of minimal size, absence of linker peptides prone to aggregation or susceptible to proteolysis, high expression yields, high solubility, and high stability. Theoretically, the usage of the single-domain antigen-binding sites derived from camel heavy-chain antibodies as the modular unit could generate such constructs (10Riechmann L. Muyldermans S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that serum of Camelidae (camels and llamas) contains an important fraction of functional, heavy-chain immunoglobulins that are naturally devoid of light chains (11Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). These heavy-chain antibodies recognize the antigen by one single domain (referred to as VHH) that can be cloned from the blood lymphocytes of an immunized dromedary (12Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The VHHs are easily produced as recombinant proteins in bacteria and yeast, appear to be quite soluble and robust, and do not have the tendency to aggregate. The affinity of the isolated, single-domain antibody fragments is in the same range as that of scFv fragments. In addition, the VHHs seem to be directed toward epitopes that are nonimmunogenic for conventional antibodies, such as the active site of enzymes, resulting in potent enzyme inhibitors (13Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In this study, we constructed several bispecific (and bivalent) antibodies by genetically linking two distinct VHHs with the natural hinge of llama heavy-chain antibodies and report on their performance. By standard DNA cloning techniques we assembled an expression vector (pKC6) to generate the bispecific proteins VHH1-LH-VHH2, tailed by six histidines. “LH” stands for “long hinge” and is the structural upper hinge of the llama IgG2a (14Vu K.B. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The N-terminal antibody fragment is cloned into the expression vector using the restriction enzymes NcoI andBstEII. The C-terminal fragment is inserted usingPstI and NotI. The amino acid sequences of linker and the three VHHs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The expression of protein is under control of the lacpromotor. The bacterial cells (WK6 E. coli) containing the proper plasmids were grown, and expression of the recombinant proteins was induced (1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). The periplasmic proteins were extracted by osmotic shock (15Skerra A. Plückthun A. Science. 1988; 240: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) and leupeptin), and recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA Superflow, Qiagen). After concentrating on Vivaspin (Vivascience), recombinant protein was loaded on a Superdex 75 (16/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS. Fractions containing the proteins of the expected molecular weight were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C until further use. Samples were analyzed by an SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or in Western blot using an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Serotec) and an anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitrobluetetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate (Sigma). Nmc-A (nonmetallo carbapenemase of class A) and lysozyme were biotinylated by incubating the antigen with a 5× molar excess of biotine-X-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Calbiochem) on ice followed by extensive dialysis against PBS. For ELISA experiments, the antigens (1 μg/ml in PBS) were coated overnight at 4 °C in a 96-well plate (Nunc Maxisorb). After blocking, bispecific proteins were added and detected with an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Serotec) and an anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) withp-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma). The signal was measured at 405 nm. For the sandwich ELISA, bispecific constructs were applied to antigen-coated wells; after washing we added biotinylated Nmc-A or lysozyme. Captured biotinylated protein was detected by extravidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) and substrate, as described above. Binding of the bispecific antibodies to the different antigens in solution was tested on an analytical gel filtration column (Superdex HR 75–10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) used at a flow rate of 0.3 ml of PBS/min. Bispecific antibodies (150 μg/200 μl) were preincubated for 1 h with equimolar amounts of their antigen before loading. A biosensor (IAsys, Fisons) was used to measure the antigen affinity, the bispecificity, and to map the epitope. Lysozyme and Nmc-A were immobilized (13Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) with a coupling efficiency around 1000 arc seconds. After equilibration of the cuvette with PBS, different concentrations of the bivalent or bispecific proteins (final concentration 10–70 nm) were directly added to the sample cuvette (each concentration was measured in duplicate). In the IAsys biosensor, the sample is continuously stirred, and binding is continuously followed. Association and dissociation rate constants were determined with FASTFIT software, K d was calculated as k d/k a. On a lysozyme cuvette, bispecific protein was added; after washing away nonbound protein, either α-amylase or Nmc-A was added, and additional binding was measured. Binding of the bispecific constructs, harboring the lysozyme-specific fragment, into the active site of lysozyme was illustrated in a displacement assay. The lysozyme cuvette was saturated with 1 mm NAG3 to block all accessible active sites of the coupled lysozyme. Bispecific protein was added, and binding was monitored. The enzymatic activity of α-amylase was determined as described previously (13Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The stability of the bispecific protein in PBS (85 μg/ml) or in mouse plasma (20 μg/ml) was evaluated with the biosensor by measuring the residual antigen binding activity after different incubation periods at 37 °C. Aliquots were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE after incubation. We started from camel single-domain antibodies (cAb) currently investigated in our laboratory to illustrate their potential as modular building blocks in bispecific constructs. cAbLys3 binds to, and is a competitive inhibitor of, hen egg white lysozyme with a K d of 50 nm. Its crystal structure in complex with antigen and the third antigen binding loop mimicking the natural substrate of lysozyme was described previously (16Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao-Thi M. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 17Transue T.R. De Genst E. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The inhibitor cAbAMD9 binds to porcine pancreatic α-amylase with a K d of 4 nm(13Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The cAbβLA01 binds the Nmc-A with nanomolar affinity; this fragment was isolated from a phage library (12Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The following five bispecific and bivalent constructs were assembled: cAbLys3-cAbAMD9, cAbAMD9-cAbLys3, cAbβLA01-cAbLys3, cAbLys3-cAbβLA01, and cAbLys3-cAbLys3. The gene segments encoding the bispecific constructs were cloned into an expression vector pKC6 (Fig. 1) between a PelB leader signal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tail for periplasmic transport and for purification of the recombinant protein, respectively. After screening for the presence of recombinant protein in the periplasm and for the best expressing clones, larger scale productions (up to 5 liters) of the bispecific proteins were performed. The recombinant proteins were extracted from the periplasm and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The elution profile of the gel filtration indicates a molecular weight of 37,000 for the recombinant proteins, whereas 15,000 is found for a VHH domain (Fig. 2 A). The SDS-PAGE of the recombinant protein confirmed its apparent molecular weight and indicated a purity above 90% as evaluated by Coomassie staining (Fig.2 B). Our recombinant protein constructs have a good solubility behavior and have no tendency to aggregate even at 3–4 mg/ml. The purified recombinant proteins were obtained in yields in the range of 0.4–0.8 mg/liter culture in shake flasks. This is similar to what is obtained for the single-domain antibody fragments (12Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). It shows that the larger size and the presence of the llama IgG2a upper hinge linking the individual fragments does not hamper secretion and accumulation of soluble recombinant proteins. The purified recombinant proteins were tested for specific antigen recognition in a solid phase ELISA on lysozyme, Nmc-A, or α-amylase. It was concluded that the original antigen specificity of the VHH was retained, independent of its position in the construct. The bispecific proteins should bind both antigens simultaneously, and this was tested in ELISA, by gel filtration and by biosensor measurements. A sandwich ELISA was performed to demonstrate the simultaneous binding of the two fragments present in the bispecific proteins cAbβLA01-cAbLys3 and cAbLys3-cAbβLA01. Biotinylated lysozyme was added after binding of the bispecific proteins on immobilized Nmc-A. Good signals were obtained when the biotinylated lysozyme captured by the bispecific protein was detected with extravidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (data not shown). Background signals were observed whenever an irrelevant protein was coated in the wells of the microtiter plates. cAbβLA01-cAbLys3 or cAbLys3-cAbβLA01 were loaded to a cuvette containing immobilized lysozyme. After removal of the unbound material, the addition of Nmc-A resulted in a further signal increase (Fig.3). The binding of Nmc-A is specific, since no signal increase was observed in the absence of the bispecific construct (Fig. 3, curves a–f). The generality of the bispecificity of our constructs was confirmed with cAbAMD9-cAbLys3 or cAbLys3-cAbAMD9, and α-amylase as second antigen. Superposition of the different sensograms revealed that the position of each antibody fragment in the bispecific protein does not affect the binding capacity of its constituents. The functionality of the bispecific constructs (cAbLys3-cAbβLA01 or cAbβLA01-cAbLys3) was also demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig.4 A). Bispecific antibodies and antigens were applied individually or as mixtures on the column. The binding of lysozyme, Nmc-A, or both antigens to the bispecific protein reduced constantly the retention time in the column, in accordance with the increase of the molecular weight of the complex. The peak fraction of each loading was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm the coelution of the bispecific antibody and the antigen(s) (Fig. 4 B). Some chromatograms showed a peak with a minor tailing, possibly due to incomplete saturation of all binding sites, as no free antigen was seen, or to dissociation of the complex during chromatography. In any case, the elution profiles indicate that >90% of the construct is active in antigen binding in solution. Combined, the ELISA, biosensor, and gel filtration experiments confirm the retention of the antigen specificity of each moiety within the bispecific proteins and the ability to bind both antigens simultaneously. The affinity and kinetic rate constants of each entity in the bispecific protein were compared with those of the single-domain format to evaluate the possible mutual interference between the two subunits. In addition, the binding epitope of the cAbLys3 and cAbAMD9 in the bispecific protein was mapped and compared with the epitope recognized by the original monomeric VHH by testing the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the antigens. The bispecific constructs were measured on a cuvette with immobilized lysozyme or Nmc-A. Native amylase could not be coupled, so the affinities of the cAbAMD9 containing bispecific constructs were not measured. Maximal binding signals of 580, 1300, and 750 arc seconds were obtained on the lysozyme cuvette after adding saturating amounts of cAbLys3, cAbLys3-cAbβLA01, and cAbβLA01- cAbLys3, respectively. Rate constants were determined at five different concentrations of the cAbLys3 and cAbβLA01 containing constructs on a lysozyme, as well as on a Nmc-A cuvette. For the C-terminal cAbLys3 moiety, a lowerk on value (five times lower) is noticed on lysozyme in comparison with cAbLys3 or cAbLys3-cAbβLA01, whereas their k off values are identical within experimental errors (Table I). This leads to a lower affinity of the C-terminal cAbLys3 in comparison with the monomeric cAbLys3. It suggests that the extension at the N-terminal end, or the presence of the hinge itself, interferes with the optimal recognition of the antigen by cAbLys3. However, this impediment was less important for the cAbβLA01. Putting the cAbβLA01 at the C-terminal end of the bispecific construct resulted in a 3-fold lowerk on, but this was compensated by a lowerk off, so that the final affinity remained unchanged (Table I).Table IKinetic rate constants, kon(103m−1 s−1) and koff {s−1), and equilibrium dissociation constant KD of bispecific, bivalent, and their single-domain antibody fragments as determined with IAsys biosensor.ProteinCuvette coupled withk onk offK DcAblys3Lysozyme520.003057cAblys3-cAbβLA01Lysozyme500.002754cAbβLA01-cAblys3Lysozyme120.0026215cAblys3-cAblys3Lysozyme600.000711cAblys3-cAbβLA01β-Lactamase190.000526cAbβLA01-cAblys3β-Lactamase270.000622cAbβLA01β-Lactamase620.001626 Open table in a new tab It is essential to map the exact binding epitopes of the bispecific protein, especially since a lowerk on value is noticed for the C-terminal moiety. This can be tested for the cAbAMD9-cAbLys3, since each entity is an inhibitor of its antigen. A sensitive test is available to measure the inhibition of α-amylase by cAbAMD9 (13Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This test demonstrated that the bispecific constructs harboring cAbAMD9 inhibit the enzymatic activity of α-amylase, both in absence and presence of saturating amounts of lysozyme. The epitope mapping of the cAbLys3 at the C-terminal end of the construct was measured by IAsys in a competition assay where a sample cuvette coated with lysozyme was first saturated with 1 mm NAG3. NAG3binds into the catalytic site of lysozyme and thereby blocks the cAbLys3 epitope (16Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao-Thi M. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 17Transue T.R. De Genst E. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Saturating amounts of NAG3 also abolish the lysozyme recognition by the C-terminal present cAbLys3 in the bispecific proteins, indicating that the cAbLys3 as mono- or bispecific construct shares an identical epitope. Stable bispecific proteins (37 °C, plasma) are required for therapeutic or in vivo diagnostic applications (2Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Segal D.M. Weiner G.J. Weiner L.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 5: 558-562Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The residual binding capacity and bispecificity of cAbAMD9-cAbLys3 after 1.5- to 76-h incubations at 37 °C was tested by biosensor measurements. Samples collected at different time points were analyzed by following the binding on a sample cuvette coupled with lysozyme, and thereafter α-amylase was added, and its capturing was evaluated. The binding ability of the bispecific construct remained maximal (100%) for up to 28 h of incubation at 37 °C. A 2% decrease in binding activity was observed between 28 and 44 h. Prolonged incubation reduced the signal gradually to 75% by 76 h (Fig. 5). In parallel, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to verify the occurrence of proteolysis. For samples stored over 30 h at 37 °C, we noticed the appearance of a minor band with a slight increase in mobility. This small shift in mobility can be attributed to the loss of the histidine tail from the bispecific protein, as demonstrated by Western blot experiments using an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (data not shown). cAbAMD9-cAbLys3 was added to heparinized mouse plasma and incubated at 37 °C for increasing time periods up to 44 h. Biosensor measurements with a sample cuvette coupled with lysozyme proved that the binding capacity, and bispecificity of the bispecific construct remained unchanged under these conditions. Longer incubation times were not tried, because VHH monomers and dimers have an in vivo half-life of less than 2 h. Despite this fast clearance, they managed to target specifically the tumor tissue. 2V. Cortez-Retamozo, M. Lauwereys, H. G. Gholamreza, M. Gobert, K. Conrath, S. Muyldermans, P. De Baetselier, and H. Revets, submitted for publication. Cloning two identical VHH genes in tandem in our expression vector pKC6 generates a bivalent recombinant protein that should possess a higher functional affinity (avidity). The cloning was performed with the cAbLys3 VHH gene. In an ELISA with coated lysozyme the bivalent protein and its single-domain fragment showed a similar binding pattern. Starting from a concentration of 10 μg/ml (which corresponds to 0.5 μm bispecific protein and 1 μmsingle-domain antibody) followed by serial dilutions, it is noted that the half-maximal signal in both cases is reached at about the same mol binding sites per well. The binding was specific, since the signal was reduced to background levels when 1 mm lysozyme was added or in absence of coated lysozyme. In conditions of high antigen density to allow multivalent binding, the k on of the bivalent construct is in the same range as cAbLys3 alone. In contrast, thek off decreases by a factor of 4–5, leading to an avidity enhancement by a factor of 5 (Table I). Bispecific antibodies carry great expectations in tumor diagnosis and therapy (19Bohlen H. Manzke O. Patel B. Moldenhauer G. Dorken B. von Fliedner V. Diehl V. Tesch H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4310-4314PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schumacher J. Klivenyi G. Matys R. Stadler M. Regiert T. Hauser H. Doll J. Maier-Borst W. Zoller M.

The first clinical attempts in human tumor patients used bispecific antibodies from murine origin produced by hybrid hybridomas (1Milstein C. Cuello A., C. Nature ( Lond. ). 1983; 305: 537Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The production and purification of these are extremely cost- and labor-intensive, and their use might induce a strong immune response against the mouse immunoglobulin. Moreover, their large size and presence of the Fc might impair a good tumor targeting (22Colcher D. Pavlinkova G. Beresford G. Booth B.J. Choudhury A. Batra S.K. J. Nucl. Med. 1998; 42: 224-241Google Scholar). Smaller constructs, such as the bispecific scFv fragments obtained by recombinant DNA technology, might circumvent the above shortcomings and might soon replace the hybrid hybridomas (2Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the bispecific constructs based on scFv also face some problems. The variable and unpredictable expression yields observed for different scFvs hamper their widespread use. Moreover, the linker connecting the VH and VL in the scFv (and often that between different scFvs as well) provokes aggregation of the recombinant material. Shortening the linkers to produce diabodies does not always guarantee success, since the linkers can induce an erroneous angle between the VH-VL pair, thus forming less functional molecules (9Lawrence L.J. Kortt A.A. Iliades E. Tulloch P.A. Hudson P.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In principle, the camel single-domain antibodies should be perfect building units for bivalent and bispecific proteins. The camel single-domain antibodies with desired antigen specificity can be selected by phage display (12Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 23van der Linden R. de Geus B. Stok W. Bos W. van Wassenaar D. Verrips T. Frenken L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 240: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). They are very robust and have superior properties such as simple purification, high solubility, and high stability that are beneficial for all kinds of manifold constructs (10Riechmann L. Muyldermans S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of a camel single-domain antibody is ∼15,000, thus the bivalent or bispecific constructs are only ∼30,000. This is half the size of a diabody and five times smaller than an intact antibody. The biodistribution and targeting potential of such minimal sized bispecific constructs might, therefore, exceed all other constructs based on scFvs (10Riechmann L. Muyldermans S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 More important, since the camel single-domain antibodies bind the antigen in a single-domain format, they avoid linker related problems except for the linker connecting the two entities. We intentionally used the structural upper hinge of the llama (or dromedary) IgG2a isotype (14Vu K.B. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) for multiple reasons. The middle hinge containing the cysteines that links the two heavy chains (24Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) is removed to avoid oxidation with unwanted cysteine-containing proteins. The natural flexibility of the immunoglobulin hinge (25Roux K.H. Strelets L. Brekke O.H. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4083-4090PubMed Google Scholar) ensures the independent movement of the connected variable domains in immunoglobulins in the natural antibody. The natural stability of the hinge in serum might also be an advantage. The linker is expected to space the two VHH fragments by ∼70 Å, since it contains a repeated Pro-Xaa motif (Xaa = Lys, Gln, or Glu) also occurring in the Ton B protein of E. coli and in procyclin of trypanosomes, where it adopts a helix that functions as a rigid rod-like spacer (26Evans J.S. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Dorne C.J. Higgins C.F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Roditi I. Schwarz H. Pearson T.W. Beecroft R.P. Liu M.K. Richardson J.P. Buhring H.J. Pleiss J. Bulow R. Williams R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Finally, the hinge allows a good expression, at least in B-cells, and preliminary experiments indicated that it is not immunogenic. The performance of the bispecific and bivalent constructs was assessed with three different single-domain fragments in different combinations and order. Since unique restriction enzyme sites were introduced at the boundary of each VHH, simple cassette mutagenesis allows the exchange of the current VHHs. The bispecific and bivalent molecules were extracted as soluble proteins from the periplasm of E. coliin yields that are comparable with those of the composing monomeric VHHs. We therefore expect that the high quantities required for tumor therapy and diagnosis will be obtained easily. Extremely high expression levels might be attained more successfully in yeast expression systems, since 300 mg of VHH/liter are routinely produced in fermentors (28Frenken L. van der Linden R.H.J. Hermans P.W.J.J. Bos W. Ruuls R.C. de Geus B. Verrips T. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The recombinant, bispecific, and bivalent constructs obtained by linking two camel, single-domain fragments are functional in all respects. This statement is based on the ELISA, biosensor, and gel filtration experiments revealing that the VHH entities within the bispecific constructs recognize the antigen(s), either individually or simultaneously. By various methods we estimated the bispecific protein that actively binds both antigens simultaneously to constitute >90% of the total protein. However, the C-terminal located binder might exhibit on-rates that are slightly reduced, whereas the kinetics of the N-terminal moiety remain unchanged. This can lead to a reduced affinity (∼4 times higher K d in the case of cAbLys3) for the C-terminal moiety of this bispecific construct. This result points toward a more difficult access of the antigen, which is fair to assume, since the hinge connected to the N-terminal of this domain is in the immediate vicinity of the antigen-binding site. Nevertheless, the possible reduced affinity of the second binder within the construct does not interfere with the recognition of the correct epitope. Multiple reports claim to observe a better tumor targeting with bivalent diabodies as compared with the monomeric scFv due to the avidity effects (18Segal D.M. Weiner G.J. Weiner L.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 5: 558-562Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We therefore made a cAbLys3-cAbLys3 bivalent construct and showed that the expression, stability, and solubility are similar to bispecific constructs with single-domain antibodies, which we described in this paper. An increase in functional affinity for our bivalent construct was noted, and the apparent K ddropped by a factor ∼5. The k on rate is equivalent to the single-domain fragment, whereas thek off rate is reduced and responsible for the enhanced binding strength. We believe that the selection of other antigen-specific VHHs that do not show the reduced intrinsic affinity when placed at the C-terminal of the bispecific protein might even increase the avidity effect. Finally, our bifunctional constructs stay intact and active in plasma at 37 °C for a long period of time, again a requirement for good candidates in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. We thank Prof. J. M. Frère (Univesité de Liège) for providing Nmc-A, and Drs. M. A. Ghahroudi and K. B. Vu for making initial constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1985111087,"Leptin plays a key role regulating food intake, body weight and fat mass. These critical parameters are associated with an increased risk for digestive and mammary gland cancer in the Western population. Here we determined whether leptin contributes to the invasive phenotype of colonic and kidney epithelial cells at various stages of the neoplastic progression. First, leptin potently (EC50 = 10-30 ng/ml) induces invasion of collagen gels by premalignant familial adenomatous colonic cells PC/AA/C1 and nontumorigenic MDCK kidney epithelial cells, their src-transformed counterparts, and the human adenocarcinoma colonic cells LoVo and HCT-8/S11. Leptin and its Ob-Rb receptors were consistently identified by RT-PCR and immunoblotting in these cell lines, as well as in human colonic epithelial crypts, polyps, colonic tumor resections, and adjacent mucosa. Leptin-induced invasion was effectively blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of several downstream signaling pathways involved in cell transformation, namely, JAK2 tyrosine kinase (AG490), phosphoinositide PI3'-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002), mTOR kinase (rapamycin), and protein kinases C (GF109203X, Gö6976). Accordingly, leptin induces transient elevation of the PI3'-kinase lipid products in JAK2 immunoprecipitates prepared from parental MDCK cells. The leptin effect on invasion was potentiated by the activated form of the small GTPase RhoA and was abrogated by dominant negative mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and the p110alpha of PI3'-K. Our data indicate that leptin may exert a local and beneficial effect on migration of normal colonic epithelial cells and reparation of the inflamed or wounded digestive mucosa. We also emphasize a new role for leptin, linking the nutritional and body fat status to digestive cancer susceptibility by stimulating the invasive capacity of colonic epithelial cells at early stages of neoplasia. This finding has potential clinical implications for colon cancer progression and management of obesity."

We identified a novel junctional adhesion molecule, named JAM-2, by a selective RNA display method, which allowed identification of transcripts encoding immunoglobulin superfamily molecules regulated during coculture of endothelial cells with tumor cells. The JAM-2 transcript is highly expressed during embryogenesis and is detected in lymph node and Peyer's patches RNA of adult mice. Accordingly, antibodies specific for JAM-2 stain high endothelial venules and lymphatic vessels in lymphoid organs, and vascular structures in the kidney. Using real time video microscopy, we show that JAM-2 is localized within minutes to the newly formed cell-cell contact. The role of the protein in the sealing of cell-cell contact is further suggested by the reduced paracellular permeability of cell monolayer transfected with JAM-2 cDNA, and by the localization of JAM-2 to tight junctional complexes of polarized cells.

Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). The function of endothelial cells lining the vessel walls relies in part on their ability to express different adhesion molecules in a coordinated and regulated way. It has been demonstrated that endothelial cells regulate vascular permeability and leukocyte emigration from the blood into the surrounding tissues. Leukocyte emigration occurs in a multistep adhesion process involving different classes of adhesion molecules, namely selectins, integrins, and cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig Sf)1 (2Butcher E.C.

Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The members of the Ig Sf possess structural domains similar to the variable (V type) or constant (C type) immunoglobulin domains found in T or B cell receptor (5Willams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 6Du Pasquier L. Courtet M. Chretien I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1729-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). JAM (hereafter referred to as JAM-1), a recently described immunoglobulin superfamily molecule with two VH domains, was shown to regulate monocyte transmigration across endothelial cell layers (7Malergue F. Galland F. Martin F. Mansuelle P. Aurrand-Lions M. Naquet P. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L.

The protein specifically localizes to tight junctions of epithelial and endothelial cells, indicating that molecules participating in intercellular junctions may regulate vascular functions (9Telo P. Lostaglio S. Dejana E. Therapie. 1997; 52: 395-398PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dejana E. Zanetti A. Del Maschio A. Haemostasis. 1996; 26 Suppl. 4: 210-219PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the cell surface molecules known to participate specifically in tight junctions include JAM-1, occludin, and the claudins (8Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). JAM-1 and occludin are expressed by both endothelial and epithelial cells, while some members of the claudin family display tissue-specific distribution (7Malergue F. Galland F. Martin F. Mansuelle P. Aurrand-Lions M. Naquet P. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Morita K. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, claudin-5 was found in the tight junctions of endothelial cells (15Morita K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), whereas claudin-11 was present in tight junctions of myelin sheaths in the brain and sertoli cells in the testis (16Morita K. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), reflecting some heterogeneity in the molecular composition of tight junctions found in different cellular system (17Gow A. Southwood C.M. Li J.S. Pariali M. Riordan G.P. Brodie S.E. Danias J. Bronstein J.M. Kachar B. Lazzarini R.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). This suggests that the function of tight junctions and their regulation may involve specific expression of junctional proteins or distinct activation events, which regulate the stability of tight junctions (18Anderson J.M. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Hence, we started to search for novel surface molecules of the Ig Sf, which may be more specific for vascular endothelium than JAM-1. We took advantage of the fact that blood vessels in tumors are often leaky, indicating that the barrier function of angiogenic endothelial cells may be lost, due to regulation of tight junctional molecules in endothelial cells growing in the presence of tumor cells (19Kevil C.G.

Our experimental approach consisted in the coculture of endothelial cell lines with melanoma cells to identify regulated transcripts by differential screening (21Piali L. Fichtel A. Terpe H.-J. Imhof B.A. Gisler R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we developed a method based on the principle of RNA display that allowed the preferential identification of transcripts encoding molecules of the Ig Sf (22Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 23Samaridis J. Colonna M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This method led to the identification of JAM-2, which encoded for a transmembrane protein specifically incorporated in tight junctions, with a structural organization into V-C2 domains. The protein is not found on epithelial cells and is expressed by endothelial and lymphatic cells in vivo. Our results suggest that JAM-2, together with JAM-1, may constitute the prototypes of a novel junctional adhesion molecule family. The murine thymic (tEnd.1) and embryonic (eEnd.2) endothelioma cell lines (24Williams R.L. Risau W. Zerwes H.G. Drexler H. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 1053-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. W. Risau and Dr. B. Engelhardt (Max Planck Institute, Bad Nauheim, Germany). The murine SV40 transformed lymph node endothelial cell line TME was provided by Dr. A. Hamann (25Harder R. Uhlig H. Kashan A. Schutt B. Duijvestijn A. Butcher E.C. Thiele H.G. Hamann A. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The murine squamous cell carcinoma KLN 205, CHO cells, MDCK cells, and myeloma cell line Sp2/0 were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). All cells, except CHO, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO cells were grown in nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's) medium supplemented as above. Adherent cells were detached by washing with PBS and 0.15 mm EDTA, followed by a 5-min incubation in trypsin/EDTA at 37 °C. For co-culture experiments, 5 × 105 tEnd.1 cells were grown together with 2.5 × 104 B16 F10 melanoma cells for 64 h in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. As control, 5 × 105tEnd.1 and 2.5 × 105 B16 F10 cells were grown separately under the same conditions, resulting in confluent monolayers after 64 h. Total RNA was directly extracted in Petri dishes with Trizol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA, employing oligo(dT) (16-mer) primer and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The quality and the quantity of cDNA were checked by running 27 cycles of PCR on 1 μl of cDNA diluted 1:5, using primers specific for the housekeeping hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNA. We then performed the differential PCR with the following degenerated primers: 5′-TAYAGNTGYNNNGCYTCYAA-3′, 5′-TAYCRGTGYNNNGCYTCYAA-3′, and 5′-TAYTAYTGYNNNGCYTCYAA-3′ encoding for the most frequent amino acid sequences encountered in C2 domains: YRCXAS, YQCXAS, and YYCXAS. The PCR conditions were as follows: 2 μl of diluted cDNA, 2.5 μl of 10× Goldstar PCR buffer, 2 μl of MgCl2, 2 μl of degenerated primers (0.3 mm), 0.5 μl of dNTP (0.1 mm), 0.1 μl of [α-33P]dATP (10 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Dübendorf, Switzerland), 15.65 μl of H2O, 0.25 μl of Goldstar Taq polymerase (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium). The parameters for the PCR were as follows: 45 s at 94 °C, 90 s at 50 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C for 40 cycles. Formamide/EDTA loading buffer was added, and samples were denatured for 2 min at 94 °C. The PCR products were then separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed using Kodak OM-Mat. Band intensity was compared, differentially expressed bands were cut from the dried polyacrylamide gel, and fragments were retrieved by boiling and ethanol precipitation as described previously (22Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). The PCR products were then reamplified using increased concentrations of dNTPs (0.2 mm instead of 2 μm) without [33P]ATP. The products of re-amplification were cloned into pGem-T Easy Vector (Promega Corp., Wallisellen, Switzerland). Nucleic acid sequences of two independent clones were determined using the Thermo Sequence fluorescence-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the LI-COR DNA analysis system (MWG-Biotech GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). The QD10 PCR product was identical to three murine ESTs encoding for a new putative Ig superfamily molecule (accession no. AA726206, AA052463, and AA175925). All ESTs were incomplete, and the remaining 5′-coding sequence was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using three primers designed on the basis of the EST sequences (5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR system, Life Technologies, Inc.). The full-length coding sequence for JAM-2 was assembled in the pGemt vector (Promega Corp.) from the cloned 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR product and the EST (accession no. AA726206) using the internal HpaI restriction site. The cDNA encoding JAM-1 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Naquet (CIML, Marseille-Luminy, France). The nucleic acid sequences were determined using the Thermo Sequence fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the LI-COR DNA analysis system (MWG-Biotech). Further sequence analyses were performed via the applications available on the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (Blast, Prosite, Swiss-Prot, and signal peptide prediction). Total mRNA from cells or murine tissues was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) according to manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) mRNA was extracted from 250 μg of total RNA with the Oligotex mRNA purification kit (Qiagen, Zurich, Switzerland). Embryonic poly(A) Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH (P. H Stehelin and Cie AG, Basel, Switzerland). The riboprobes were prepared from pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands) and comprised the sequences encoding for the immunoglobulin domains of JAM-1 and JAM-2, or the full-length coding sequence for β-actin. Hybridization was performed at 62 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide. The blots were washed twice (0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 67 °C) and autoradiographed on Kodak X-Omat at −80 °C. The sequence encoding EGFP was subcloned from pEGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH, P. H. Stehelin and Cie AG) into pcDNA3 usingHindIII and NotI sites, therefore named pcDNA3/EGFP. The 3′ restriction sites, HpaI andScaI, found in the sequence encoding, respectively, the cytoplasmic domain of JAM-2 and JAM-1, were used to fuse the two sequences at the N terminus of the EGFP in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The inserts encoding JAM-2 or JAM-1 were excised from pGemt or pRc/CMV using SacII/HpaI orHindIII/ScaI digestions, respectively. The coding sequences were then cloned in pcDNA3/EGFP vector digested withAgeI, blunted by fill-in, and further digested withHindIII or SacII enzymes. This resulted in fusion sites at amino acid positions DGV291 for JAM-2 and QPS285 for JAM-1. The transfection of CHO cells was performed as described previously (26Ballestrem C. WehrleHaller B. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1649-1658PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants used for permeability assays were selected by growing transfected CHO cells for 2 weeks in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. Resistant colonies were isolated and checked for EGFP fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry (FACScalibur apparatus; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and fluorescence localization by microscopy (Axiovert; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Time-lapse video microscopy was performed using an Axiovert fluorescence microscope and Openlab software for image acquisition. To produce soluble molecules, the sequence encoding extracellular domains of JAM-1 or JAM-2 were amplified by PCR from plasmids containing the full-length coding sequences using, respectively, T7 and 5′-gctctagacacagcatccatgtgtgcagcctc-3′ for JAM-1, or T7 and 5′-gctctagaatagacttccatgtcctgcc-3′ for JAM-2. The reverse primers were modified by XbaI site to clone the PCR products in frame with Flag Tag sequence in pcDNA3 vector, as described previously (27Wiedle G. Johnson-Leger C. Imhof B.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5255-5263PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of PCR-induced errors was confirmed by sequencing the constructs on both strands. 293T cells were then transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation method, and supernatants were collected every 2 days over a period of 10 days. Isolation of the recombinant soluble molecules (namely sJAM-1 or sJAM-2) was achieved on a M2 column (Sigma-Aldrich Co., FlukaChemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland), and purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-PECAM (GC51, rat IgG2a; EA-3, rat IgG1), anti-JAM-1 (H2O2.106.7.4, rat IgG1; (7Malergue F. Galland F. Martin F. Mansuelle P. Aurrand-Lions M.

The panel of CRAM antibodies against murine JAM-2 was generated in the laboratory using standard techniques, and recombinant soluble molecule as immunogen in rats (31Aurrand-Lions M. Galland F. Bazin H. Zakharyev V.M. Imhof B.A. Naquet P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 391-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of purified recombinant soluble JAM-2 molecule (sJAM-2) mixed with Titermax adjuvant (Sigma) was used to immunize male Fischer rats intraperiteonally. Two days after a final intravenous injection of 50 μg of sJAM-2, splenocytes were fused to Sp2/0 cells, and hybridoma were selected in HAT-containing medium. Resistant clones were screened by ELISA for the production of mAbs recognizing specifically sJAM-2. For this purpose, Maxisorb Immunoplates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with M2 antibody diluted at 2 μg/ml in 150 mmNacl, 50 mm borate buffer, pH = 9. Wells were washed, blocked for 1 h with serum-containing medium, and incubated for 1 h with supernatants of transfected 293T cells. After three washes with PBS plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin, hybridoma supernatants were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, bound antibodies were detected using mouse anti-rat peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, Milan AG, La Roche, Switzerland), and ABTS (Sigma). Optical densities at 405 nm were read using a kinetic microplate reader and SoftMAXPro software (Molecular Devices Corp). Positive clones were subcloned twice, rescreened, and tested by cytofluorimetry on CHO cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP alone (mock), JAM-1-EGFP, or JAM-2-EGFP. All CRAM antibodies were of IgG1 or IgG2a isotype except CRAM-25F24, which is of the IgG2b subclass. Antibodies were purified on protein G-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer instructions. CRAM-19H36 mAb was used for immunoprecipitation and CRAM-18F26 for immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using secondary reagents coupled to FITC or Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch) for cytofluorimetry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. For immunohistochemistry, samples were fixed 5 min with cooled (−20 °C) methanol. Samples were rehydrated in PBS, 0.2% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated overnight with the primary antibodies before washing, and revealed with the appropriate secondary reagent coupled to Texas Red. For the analysis of fresh endothelial cells, dissociation of freshly dissected murine tissues was performed using collagenase/dispase digestion, according to established procedures (32Kramer R.H. Bensch K.G. Davison P.M. Karasek M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The dissociated cells were stained for 2 h at 37 °C with diI-acetylated LDL (Molecular Probe Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands) before staining with mAbs to JAM-1 or JAM-2, and goat anti-rat FITC probe. After this step, normal rat serum diluted 1/50 was added for washes and incubations. After wash, cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CD31 (PharMingen) and streptavidin red 670 (Life Technologies AG). JAM-1 or JAM-2 expression was analyzed on cells positive for the two endothelial cell markers: acetylated LDL (FL-2) and CD31 (FL-3). Negative controls were obtained by omitting primary antibody. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (33Aurrand-Lions M. Pierres M. Naquet P. Cell Immunol. 1997; 176: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) using 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) for lysis. After immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the biotinylated proteins were revealed using streptavidin coupled to peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deglycosylations were performed after four washes of the beads in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 10 μl of PBS, 0.5% SDS and boiled for 3 min to ensure denaturation of the proteins before deglycosylation. Thereafter, 90 μl of PBS, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche), and 10 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche) were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer, samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and visualized with streptavidin peroxidase. Permeability was measured using Transwell chambers (6.5-mm diameter; PC filters, 0.4-μm pore size, Costar Corp). In brief, 1 × 104 transfected or nontransfected CHO cells were cultured to confluence on filters previously coated for 30 min with 0.2% gelatin. After 5 days, the medium was changed for prewarmed nutrient/F-12 medium without fetal calf serum (500 μl in the lower chamber and 200 μl in the upper chamber). FITC-dextran (M r 38,900, Sigma) was added in the upper chamber at 1 mg/ml final concentration. After 1 h, chambers were removed and fluorescence was read directly in the lower chamber using Cytofluor II. The mean fluorescence intensity of five independent chambers was calculated and compared using Statview software and t test unpaired comparisons. To normalize experiments, the value of mean fluorescence intensity obtained with wild type CHO cells was taken as 100%. During the coculture of endothelial cells with tumor cells, endothelial properties are modified by transcriptional regulations of adhesion molecules (21Piali L. Fichtel A. Terpe H.-J. Imhof B.A. Gisler R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Such a model is therefore ideal to search for novel regulated adhesion molecules by differential screening method. Due to the lack of specificity of RNA display, we modified the technique to selectively identify transcripts encoding adhesion molecules of the Ig Sf. For this purpose, we used degenerated primers targeting the sequences encoding molecules with C2 domains. This was achieved by the alignment of C2 domains of several Ig Sf adhesion molecules (data not shown) and the identification of a linear amino acid consensus, surrounding the cysteine residue participating to the C2 domain structure: Y-(RQYS)-C-X-A-S-N-X 2-G. Therefore, we used the reverse translation of the most frequent consensus sequences (YRCXAS, YQCXAS, YYCXAS) to design the degenerated primers used for differential display. The level of degeneracy, between 2048 and 4096 different forms, was sufficient to obtain discrete PCR products without the use of a second reverse primer. The display of one representative radioactive reverse transcription-PCR with three different degenerated primers is shown on Fig. 1 A. The comparison of the radioactive PCR products obtained from cDNA prepared from the endothelial cell line alone (lane 1), from the mix of endothelial and tumor cell lines (lane 2), or from the tumor cell line alone (lane 3), allowed the selection of four differentially expressed transcripts. After cloning and sequencing the four PCR products, it appeared that RU9 and QU11 encoded respectively for PAI-1 and RalGDS-like factors. The sequences of the two remaining products, QU14 and QD10, were unknown, but were good candidates as coding for partial sequences of novel Ig Sf transcripts since they presented a partial open reading frame containing the canonical sequence of C2 domain, YYCXAS. Furthermore, the QD10 sequence showed the C2 domain canonical residues Asn and Gly at positions +4 and +7 relative to the targeted cysteine. Sequence comparison of the QD10 PCR product with sequence data bases revealed several identical sequences in the murine EST data base. Unfortunately, none of these comprised the initiating methionine, and so the complete coding 5′ region was obtained by using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach. As shown in Fig.1 B, the cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 310 amino acids of a predicted molecular mass of 34.8 kDa for the core protein. The initiating methionine was followed by a signal peptide (underlined) that may be cleaved between Ala31 and Val32 (34Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). The protein structure was typical of a type I protein comprising one membrane-distal VH and one proximal C2 immunoglobulin domain. As expected, the sequence of the initial QD10 PCR product encoded for the end of the C2 domain (italic nucleic acid sequence). Two putative N-glycosylation (Asn104and Asn192) and four putative cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites (Ser274, Ser281, Tyr293, and Ser297) were identified. Comparison of the protein sequence with nonredundant sequence data bases identified the tight junctional protein, JAM-1 (8Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), as the closest related sequence with 31% identity at the protein level (Fig. 1 C). The transcript corresponding to the QD10 PCR product was therefore named JAM-2. The similarities in the extracellular part of the molecules were largely confined to the residues participating in the structure of the Ig domains (5Willams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar), and to sequences surrounding the cysteines, the tryptophan residues of c strands, or the N-glycosylation site within the C2 domain (NSSF195). Interestingly, two additional cysteines are found within the C2 domain of JAM-2, while they are absent from the JAM-1 sequence. In the cytoplasmic domain, three stretches of homology are identified: the AYRRGYF motif, the SPGK sequence, and the C-terminal parts of the proteins. The tissue distribution of JAM-2 transcript was explored by Northern blotting and compared with JAM-1 (Fig. 2). The JAM-2 transcript was 2 kilobases long, highly expressed in embryonic tissue and in Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, kidney, and testis of adult animals. A putative splice variant of 1.8 kilobases was detected in testis. The expression of the JAM-2 transcript was low in lung, liver, spleen, and thymus. The relative abundance of JAM-1 and JAM-2 were compared during embryogenesis; the mRNA encoding JAM-2 was detectable as early as day 7.5 post coitum, whereas JAM-1 mRNA was not detected during embryogenesis. This suggested that the JAM-2 transcript might be abundantly expressed in tissues undergoing remodeling with restricted expression in specialized compartments in adult tissues. To analyze the expression of JAM-2 in more details, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CRAM) against a soluble form of JAM-2 (sJAM-2). The specificity of CRAM mAbs was addressed by performing ELISA on soluble forms of JAM-1 and JAM-2. All CRAM mAbs recognized specifically sJAM-2 (Fig. 3 A). To further confirm the specificity of the selected mAbs, cytofluorimetric analysis was performed on CHO cells stably transfected with EGFP or chimeric EGFP fusion proteins of JAM-1 or JAM-2 (Fig.3 B). These results confirmed the specificity of the mAbs for JAM-2 (CRAM panel), and the absence of cross-reactivity on JAM-1 transfected cells, which were specifically recognized by the already described H2O2–106 mAb (7Malergue F.

Although its role in apoptosis remains to be determined, BCL10 likely activates NF-κB through the IKK complex in response to upstream stimuli. The N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of BCL10 has been proposed to function as an activation domain that mediates homophilic interactions with an upstream CARD-containing NF-κB activator. To identify upstream signaling partners of BCL10, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and identified CARD9 as a novel CARD-containing protein that interacts selectively with the CARD activation domain of BCL10. When expressed in cells, CARD9 binds to BCL10 and activates NF-κB. Furthermore, endogenous CARD9 is found associated with BCL10 suggesting that both proteins form a pre-existing signaling complex within cells. CARD9 also self-associates and contains extensive coiled-coil motifs that may function as oligomerization domains. We propose here that CARD9 is an upstream activator of BCL10 and NF-κB signaling.

Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Death domains (DDs),1 death effector domains (DEDs), and caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) are protein modules found extensively in proteins that mediate apoptotic signaling (2Hofmann K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These protein module families are similar in structure with each consisting of six or seven antiparallel α-helices that form highly specific homophilic interactions between signaling partners. Whereas DD and DED motifs function primarily in the activation of caspase-8 and -10 by death receptors, CARD domains function in diverse signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis. Examples of CARD-containing proteins include the majority of class I caspases, the ced-4-like proteins Apaf-1 and CARD4 (NOD1), IAP family members cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, RICK kinase, ARC, BCL10, RAIDD, and ASC (2Hofmann K.

NF-κB plays a critical role in the stress response of cells by activating genes that control immune defense mechanisms (8Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is found sequestered in the cytoplasm through interactions with inhibitory IκB proteins. Inhibition is relieved by the phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of IκB proteins by proinflammatory cytokines. Phosphorylation is mediated by the IKK complex, which is comprised of at least three major proteins, two kinases designated IKKα and IKKβ that directly phosphorylate the IκB inhibitory proteins and a noncatalytic subunit called IKKγ that functions to link the IKKs to upstream regulatory molecules (9Zhang S.Q.

BCL10 has a bipartite structure consisting of an N-terminal CARD domain and a C-terminal effector domain that mediates activation of NF-κB. Upstream CARD-containing proteins that bind to BCL10 and activate NF-κB have not yet been identified. We report here the identity and characterization of a CARD-containing protein that binds selectively to BCL10 and activates NF-κB.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify novel CARD-containing proteins, we searched Millennium Pharmaceuticals proprietary database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for clones encoding CARD motifs (2Hofmann K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Full-length sequencing of one of the CARD-encoding ESTs revealed a cDNA that encodes a 536-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62.3 kDa (Fig. 1 A). This protein was designated CARD9 (for CARD protein 9) because it was one of many novel CARD-containing proteins that were identified from our EST search. A search for rodent orthologs also identified a rat cDNA, which encodes a 536-amino acid protein (rCARD9) that is 88% identical in sequence to human CARD9 (Fig. 1 A). A BLAST search of the protein database indicated that human CARD9 was a novel protein with at least two putative functional domains (Fig. 1 B). The N-terminal region of CARD9 (residues 7–98) shares significant similarity with CARD motifs found in many apoptosis proteins, including those found in BCL10 (29% identity, 44% similarity) and RAIDD (28% identity, 40% similarity, Fig. 1 C). The central region of CARD9 (residues 140–420) contains heptad repeats characteristic of coiled-coil structures that function in protein oligomerization (19Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The COILS2 program (20Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) predicts the existence of at least three coiled-coil regions with a probability of greater than 80% (residues 140–230, 243–277, and 332–419) that are interrupted by regions predicted to have low coiled-coil potential. Correspondingly, BLAST analysis of this region showed strong similarity to coiled-coil regions of other proteins, including myosins and plectins. Northern blot analysis was performed and a 2.1-kilobase transcript corresponding to CARD9 was identified in a variety of human adult tissues, including spleen, liver, placenta, lung, PBL, and brain (Fig. 1 D). CARD9 was also expressed abundantly in the HL60 cancer cell line and showed some expression in fetal liver tissue (data not shown).Homophilic interactions between CARD domains have been shown to be selective. For example, the CARD of Apaf-1 binds to caspase-9 CARD but not to other CARD-containing caspases. To identify the binding partner of CARD9, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and screened a panel of CARD domains for their ability to interact with the CARD of CARD9. Transfection of 293T cells with plasmids expressing the CARD of CARD9 fused to the transcriptional activation domain of mouse NF-κB (CARD9·CARD/AD) and the CARD of BCL10 fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast protein GAL4 (BCL10·CARD/BD) activated the mammalian two-hybrid reporter plasmid resulting in a 250-fold increase in relative luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, expression of CARD9·CARD/BD and BCL10·CARD/AD increased luciferase activity 75-fold (Fig. 2 B). Coexpression of CARD9·CARD with other CARD domains failed to activate luciferase expression indicating that the CARD of CARD9 interacts selectively with the CARD of BCL10.Figure 2The CARD domain of CARD9 selectively interacts with the CARD of BCL10 by mammalian two-hybrid analysis.293T cells were transfected with the mammalian two-hybrid reporter construct pFR-Luc (Stratagene) and combinations of plasmids expressing CARD domains fused to either the activation domain of the mouse protein NF-κB or the DNA-binding domain of the yeast protein GAL4. After 24 h, cells were collected and assayed for relative luciferase activity.

Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged CARD9 quantitatively coprecipitated T7-tagged BCL10 (Fig. 3 A). This association was dependent on the N-terminal CARD domain of BCL10 because CARD9 failed to coprecipitate a variant BCL10 with a point mutation (L41R) that disrupts CARD-mediated homodimerization (Fig. 3 B and Ref. 12Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Lin J.H. Poyet J.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17946-17954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, CARD9 self-associated when expressed in cells suggesting that oligomerization may play a role in protein function (Fig. 3 C). We were unable to perform immunoprecipitations with the individual domains of CARD9 because the CARD and coiled-coil domains were either unstable or insoluble when overexpressed. To rule out the possibility that other proteins were necessary for the CARD9-BCL10 interaction, we examined the interaction of radiolabeled CARD9 with GST·BCL10 in vitro and found that CARD9 associated directly with BCL10 (Fig. 3 D). The amount of CARD9 that associated with GST·BCL10 (L41R) was greatly reduced confirming the importance of the BCL10 CARD domain in mediating interactions between these two proteins.Figure 3CARD9 interacts directly with BCL10. A–C, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding T7 epitope-tagged, FLAG epitope-tagged, or Myc epitope-tagged BCL10 or CARD9 as indicated. After 36 h, extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated (IP) with a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope. The immunoprecipitates (lower panel) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated T7 antibody (A) or anti-Myc antibody (B and C). The cellular extracts were also immunoblotted (WB) with anti-FLAG and anti-T7 antibody (upper panel of A), anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody (upper and middle panels of Band C).

The point mutation L41R within the CARD domain abrogates its ability to interact with CARD9. E and F, endogenous interaction of CARD9 with BCL10. Thp1 cell (5 × 106) extracts were collected and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the BCL10 epitope (E and F, lane 2), T7 antibody (E and F, lane 5; HC, heavy chain; LC, light chain), or anti-mouse IgG-agarose (E, lane 3). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were immunoblotted with CARD9 polyclonal antibody (D) or BCL10 monoclonal antibody (E). The cellular extracts were also immunoblotted (WB) with polyclonal CARD9 antibody (E, lane 1) or monoclonal BCL10 antibody (F, lane 1) to detect the endogenous protein expression. Also, BCL10 antibody was incubated with the anti-mouse IgG-agarose and was analyzed by immunoblotting with CARD9 antibody to rule out the possibility of cross-reaction (E, lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Components of signaling pathways are frequently found preassembled together within the cell to ensure a rapid response to upstream stimuli. To examine the interactions between endogenous CARD9 and BCL10, we generated a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes CARD9. Immunoblot analysis of extracts derived from human monocyte Thp1 cells revealed a predominant band of ∼70 kDa corresponding to endogenous CARD9 (Fig. 3 E, lane 1), and a 40-kDa band corresponding to endogenous BCL10 (Fig. 3 F, lane 1). Immunoprecipitation of BCL10 coprecipitated CARD9 indicating that both endogenous proteins are associated with each other within Thp1 cells (Fig. 3 E, lane 2).To determine the cellular localization of CARD9, and to confirm that CARD9 associated intracellularly with BCL10 when the two proteins were coexpressed, we transfected Rat-1 cells with a Myc-tagged vector encoding full-length CARD9 and with an HA-tagged vector encoding full-length BCL10. The expressed proteins were detected using a mixture of a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and a polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the two proteins exhibited distinctly different patterns of cellular localization when either vector was transfected alone. Whereas BCL10 exhibited either a clear pattern of discrete cytoplasmic filaments (Ref. 21Guiet C. Vito P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 A, left panel) or a diffuse whole-cell distribution (Fig. 4 A, center panel), CARD9 displayed a somewhat punctate cytoplasmic or whole-cell distribution (Fig. 4 A, right panel) but was not observed to form filament-like structures. When the two proteins were coexpressed in the same cell however, some of the CARD9 was found to colocalize with the BCL10 filaments (Fig. 4 B). This finding is consistent with the interaction of CARD9 with BCL10 observed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3 A) and suggests that CARD9 is recruited to a cytoplasmic signaling complex with BCL10.Figure 4CARD9 is recruited to BCL10 filaments.Immunolocalization of HA-tagged BCL10 and Myc-tagged CARD9 transfected in Rat-1 cells either alone (A) or together (B), demonstrating the recruitment of CARD9 to BCL10-containing cytoplasmic filaments.

Scale bar = 20 microns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our finding that CARD9 interacts with BCL10 prompted us to determine whether CARD9 can activate NF-κB using a luciferase reporter gene directed by an NF-κB-responsive promoter. Expression of CARD9 in 293T cells induced NF-κB activity by 8-fold compared with empty vector (Fig. 5 A). Activation was specific for NF-κB signaling because CARD9 failed to activate a luciferase reporter gene with AP-1 promoter elements (data not shown). Activation of NF-κB by CARD9 correlated with binding to endogenous BCL10 suggesting that CARD9 forms a CARD9·BCL10 signaling complex within the transfected cells (Fig. 5 B). We next determined the domains of CARD9 that mediate the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5 C). Because individual domains of CARD9 were either unstable or insoluble, we fused the CARD (residues 1–98), coiled-coil (residues 140–418), and C-terminal (residues 99–536) domains of CARD9 to GFP and expressed the fusion proteins in 293T cells. The CARD·GFP fusion activated NF-κB signaling to levels similar to that obtained with CARD9·GFP. The coiled-coil and C-terminal domains when fused to GFP failed to activate reporter gene expression establishing the CARD domain as the NF-κB activating domain of CARD9.Figure 5CARD9 binds to endogenous BCL10 and activates NF-κB.

Plasmids expressing CARD9 were transfected into 293T cells and relative luciferase activities were determined to measure induction of NF-κB activity. B, CARD9 interacts with endogenous BCL10.

Plasmids expressing individual domains fused to GFP were transfected into 293T cells and induction of NF-κB activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The data presented suggest that CARD9 is a specific regulator of BCL10 function. CARD9 could play a role as an upstream signaling molecule that recruits BCL10 through CARD-CARD interactions. The resulting signaling complex may interact directly or indirectly with components of the IKK complex resulting in its activation. One possible mechanism by which BCL10·CARD9 could activate the IKK complex is through oligomerization of IKKγ (10Poyet, J. L., Srinivasula, S. M., Lin, J. H., Fernandes-Alnemri, T., Yamaoka, S., Tsichlis, P. N., and Alnemri, E. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar, 11Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Indeed our data shows that both CARD9 and BCL10 form large oligomeric complexes (filaments) when overexpressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, enforced oligomerization of the C terminus of BCL10 induces NF-κB activation (12Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Lin J.H. Poyet J.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17946-17954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CARD domain of BCL10 functions as an oligomerization domain that transduces the activation signal to the IKK complex through its C-terminal domain. The ability of CARD9 to form a complex with BCL10 via CARD-CARD interactions supports the idea that BCL10 functions as an adaptor between the effector IKK complex and the proximal signaling complexes that interact with CARD9. We do not currently know the nature of the signaling molecules upstream of CARD9, but we predict that they transduce their signals to BCL10 through direct interactions with the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of CARD9. Taken together, these results identify CARD9 as an important mediator of NF-κB signaling through BCL10. Protein modules play an important role in defining the specificity of signal transduction pathways by mediating protein-protein interactions between upstream and downstream signaling components (1Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Death domains (DDs),1 death effector domains (DEDs), and caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) are protein modules found extensively in proteins that mediate apoptotic signaling (2Hofmann K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These protein module families are similar in structure with each consisting of six or seven antiparallel α-helices that form highly specific homophilic interactions between signaling partners. Whereas DD and DED motifs function primarily in the activation of caspase-8 and -10 by death receptors, CARD domains function in diverse signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis. Examples of CARD-containing proteins include the majority of class I caspases, the ced-4-like proteins Apaf-1 and CARD4 (NOD1), IAP family members cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, RICK kinase, ARC, BCL10, RAIDD, and ASC (2Hofmann K.

Because CARD-CARD interactions are highly selective, it is generally accepted that most CARD-containing proteins will segregate with discrete binding partners and modulate intracellular signaling pathways. Besides functioning as mediators of apoptosis, the CARD-containing proteins RICK, CARD4, and BCL10 also induce activation of the NF-κB transcription factor suggesting that CARD·CARD signaling complexes regulate activation of the IKK complex (3Bertin J.

NF-κB plays a critical role in the stress response of cells by activating genes that control immune defense mechanisms (8Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is found sequestered in the cytoplasm through interactions with inhibitory IκB proteins. Inhibition is relieved by the phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of IκB proteins by proinflammatory cytokines. Phosphorylation is mediated by the IKK complex, which is comprised of at least three major proteins, two kinases designated IKKα and IKKβ that directly phosphorylate the IκB inhibitory proteins and a noncatalytic subunit called IKKγ that functions to link the IKKs to upstream regulatory molecules (9Zhang S.Q.

https://openalex.org/W2104921070,"The smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin gene activated during the early stages of embryonic cardiovascular development is switched off in late stage heart tissue and replaced by cardiac and skeletal alpha-actins. SM alpha-actin also appears during vascular development, but becomes the single most abundant protein in adult vascular smooth muscle cells. Tissue-specific expression of SM alpha-actin is thought to be required for the principal force-generating capacity of the vascular smooth muscle cell. We wanted to determine whether SM alpha-actin gene expression actually relates to an actin isoform's function. Analysis of SM alpha-actin null mice indicated that SM alpha-actin is not required for the formation of the cardiovascular system. Also, SM alpha-actin null mice appeared to have no difficulty feeding or reproducing. Survival in the absence of SM alpha-actin may result from other actin isoforms partially substituting for this isoform. In fact, skeletal alpha-actin gene, an actin isoform not usually expressed in vascular smooth muscle, was activated in the aortas of these SM alpha-actin null mice. However, even with a modest increase in skeletal alpha-actin activity, highly compromised vascular contractility, tone, and blood flow were detected in SM alpha-actin-defective mice. This study supports the concept that SM alpha-actin has a central role in regulating vascular contractility and blood pressure homeostasis, but is not required for the formation of the cardiovascular system."

The zinc finger domains are highly conserved between Zic proteins and show a notable homology to those of Gli family proteins. In this study, we investigated the functional properties of Zic proteins and their relationship to the GLI proteins. We first established an optimal binding sequence for Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 proteins by electrophoretic mobility shift assay-based target selection and mutational analysis. The selected sequence was almost identical to the GLI binding sequence. However, the binding affinity was lower than that of GLI. Consistent results were obtained in reporter assays, in which transcriptional activation by Zic proteins was less dependent on the GLI binding sequence than GLI1. Moreover, Zic proteins activated a wide range of promoters irrespective of the presence of a GLI binding sequence. When Zic and GLI proteins were cotransfected into cultured cells, Zic proteins enhanced or suppressed sequence-dependent, GLI-mediated transactivation depending on cell type. Taken together, these results suggest that Zic proteins may act as transcriptional coactivators and that their function may be modulated by the GLI proteins and possibly by other cell type-specific cofactors.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3691-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gli proteins are also known to regulate events in vertebrate development. In particular, it has been reported that Gli and Cubitus interruptus proteins function downstream of the Sonic hedgehog-Patched signaling pathway as transcriptional regulators (24Alexandre C. Jacinto A. Ingham P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2003-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Marigo V. Johnson R.L. Vortkamp A. Tabin C.J. Dev.

For example, in response to the Sonic hedgehog signal, activated Gli proteins bind directly to the enhancer element of a winged helix transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β, the expression of which is critical for floor plate development (27Sasaki H.

A consensus nonamer target site, 5′-TGGGTGGTC-3′ (GLI-BS),1 has been identified for human GLI1 (29Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). A crystallographic study showed that GLI1 bound DNA through the last four fingers via extensive base contacts, which are highly conserved between GLI and Zic families (2Aruga J. Nagai T. Tokuyama T.

Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Tra1 protein can also bind the GLI-BS possibly through the last three zinc fingers, because elimination of the first two fingers had little effect on its binding to DNA (23Zarkower D. Hodgkin H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3691-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GLI3 zinc finger domain (GLI3-ZF) can also bind the GLI-BS (31Vortkamp A. Gessler M. Grzeschik K.-H. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The target has been optimized to an extended 16-nucleotide sequence including the GLI-BS (GLI3-BS).The fact that Zic proteins are nuclear proteins and have zinc finger domains highly similar to those of Gli proteins led us to infer that the Zic proteins might act as transcription factors in a manner similar to that of Gli proteins. However, little is known about the regulation of gene expression by the Zic proteins. The only finding in support of this to date is that the zinc finger domain of Zic1 (Zic1-ZF) can bind the GLI-BS (1Aruga J. Yokota N. Hashimoto M. Furuichi T. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Zic proteins may regulate the expression of target genes by interacting with a GLI-BS-like sequence. Nevertheless, no methodical analysis of the DNA recognition sequence for Zic family proteins has been performed to date. We therefore undertook the task of empirically determining the Zic binding sequence and characterizing its binding properties. Furthermore, we examined transcriptional regulation by Zic proteins and tested whether the Zic proteins affected the GLI-DNA interaction and GLI-mediated transcriptional activation. This study should pave the way for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Zic-mediated transcriptional regulation.

InXenopus, Zic genes play a role in the initial phase of neural and neural crest development (5Nakata K. Nagai T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The zinc finger domain was highly conserved not only in the vertebrate Zicfamily but also in Drosophila odd-paired, which regulates segmentation and midgut development (14Benedyk M.J. Mullen J.R.

All of these findings indicate that Zic genes exert an essential role in multiple aspects of development. In addition to Zic orthologues in other species, the zinc finger domains of the Zic proteins, which consist of five tandemly repeated C2H2 motifs, show a notable homology to those of Gli family proteins (1Aruga J.

Slusarski D.C. Kroll K.L. Holmgren R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans Tra1 (23Zarkower D. Hodgkin H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3691-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gli proteins are also known to regulate events in vertebrate development. In particular, it has been reported that Gli and Cubitus interruptus proteins function downstream of the Sonic hedgehog-Patched signaling pathway as transcriptional regulators (24Alexandre C. Jacinto A. Ingham P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2003-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Marigo V. Johnson R.L. Vortkamp A. Tabin C.J. Dev.

For example, in response to the Sonic hedgehog signal, activated Gli proteins bind directly to the enhancer element of a winged helix transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β, the expression of which is critical for floor plate development (27Sasaki H. Hui C.-c. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,28Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C.-c. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence-specific DNA binding of the GLI proteins has been studied in detail. A consensus nonamer target site, 5′-TGGGTGGTC-3′ (GLI-BS),1 has been identified for human GLI1 (29Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). A crystallographic study showed that GLI1 bound DNA through the last four fingers via extensive base contacts, which are highly conserved between GLI and Zic families (2Aruga J. Nagai T. Tokuyama T. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y. Chapman V.M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1043-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,30Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Tra1 protein can also bind the GLI-BS possibly through the last three zinc fingers, because elimination of the first two fingers had little effect on its binding to DNA (23Zarkower D. Hodgkin H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3691-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GLI3 zinc finger domain (GLI3-ZF) can also bind the GLI-BS (31Vortkamp A. Gessler M. Grzeschik K.-H. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The target has been optimized to an extended 16-nucleotide sequence including the GLI-BS (GLI3-BS). The fact that Zic proteins are nuclear proteins and have zinc finger domains highly similar to those of Gli proteins led us to infer that the Zic proteins might act as transcription factors in a manner similar to that of Gli proteins. However, little is known about the regulation of gene expression by the Zic proteins. The only finding in support of this to date is that the zinc finger domain of Zic1 (Zic1-ZF) can bind the GLI-BS (1Aruga J. Yokota N. Hashimoto M. Furuichi T. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Zic proteins may regulate the expression of target genes by interacting with a GLI-BS-like sequence. Nevertheless, no methodical analysis of the DNA recognition sequence for Zic family proteins has been performed to date. We therefore undertook the task of empirically determining the Zic binding sequence and characterizing its binding properties. Furthermore, we examined transcriptional regulation by Zic proteins and tested whether the Zic proteins affected the GLI-DNA interaction and GLI-mediated transcriptional activation. This study should pave the way for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Zic-mediated transcriptional regulation.

Interaction occurs with ligand-activated ERs in solution and on DNA and is mediated by the unique DAX-1 N-terminal repeat domain. Each of the three repeats contains a leucine-rich receptor-binding motif, known as the LXXLL motif, which is usually found in nuclear receptor coactivators. We have demonstrated that DAX-1 functions as an inhibitor of ER activation in mammalian cells and suggest a mechanism involving two sequential events, occupation of the ligand-induced coactivator-binding surface and subsequent recruitment of corepressors. Accordingly, we propose that DAX-1 itself acts as a corepressor for ERs. Because DAX-1 is coexpressed with ERs in reproductive tissues, these interactions could play significant roles by influencing estrogen signaling pathways. Our results point at functional similarities between DAX-1 and the orphan receptor SHP (NROB2) in that they have acquired features of transcriptional coregulators that are unique for members of the nuclear receptor family.

Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins exist in multiple complexes, possess multiple enzymatic activities, and bridge receptors to chromatin components or to the basal transcription machinery or to both. Multiple candidate proteins exist that are believed to be critical for the proper function of nuclear receptor signaling (1Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

The majority of coregulators bind to the receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD),1which is able to adopt different conformations depending on the ligand status and thereby discriminate between coactivators and corepressors.

Particularly, we have provided evidence that SHP, which consists only of an LBD and thus cannot bind target genes directly, has instead acquired a novel coregulator function by antagonizing the interactions of ERs with associated coactivators (18Johansson L.

We have demonstrated that DAX-1 directly binds to ERα and ERβ via the N-terminal repeat domain that contains LXXLL motifs. Functionally, DAX-1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of liganded ERs by a sequential mechanism, possibly involving the recruitment of corepressors. Accordingly, we propose that DAX-1 itself acts as an ER corepressor.

For GST pull-down assays, GST·DAX-1 fusion proteins bound to Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 35S -labeled receptors in the absence (Me2SO) or presence of 1 μm E2 (17β-estradiol) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For yeast two-hybrid assays, GAL4 plasmids transformed HF7c (MATα) were mated with GAL4AD plasmids transformed Y187 (MATα). All cotransformants were grown in selective media in the absence (Me2SO) or presence of 1 μmE2. Interactions were monitored as relative β-galactosidase activity. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift studies, ∼200 ng of purified GST·DAX-1 R3 or GST·TIF2, respectively, were incubated with 10 ng of purified ERβ (Panvera) in the absence or presence of 1 μm E2. Radiolabeled ERE oligonucleotide was added last, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min on ice. Reactions were loaded on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 2 h in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For coimmunoprecipitation, COS-7 whole cell extracts expressing DAX-1 and FLAG-tagged ERs were incubated with FLAG-M2 affinity matrix (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 μm E2 in IP buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). Beads were subsequently washed using IP buffer lacking Nonidet P-40. Western analysis was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-DAX-1 serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 dilution. Transient transfections were performed as described previously (18Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with appropriate expression and luciferase reporter plasmids as indicated in the figure legends by using Lipofectin (Life Technologies) as instructed by the manufacturer. Cell extracts were prepared after 24-h expression and analyzed for relative luciferase activity. Individual transfections were performed in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. Inspection of the human DAX-1 sequence revealed that each of the three N-terminal repeats contains a leucine-rich motif resembling the NR-box (Fig. 1 A). Whereas the third motif (Box 3) matches the consensus LXXLL core with leucines in critical +1, +4, and +5 positions, the other two motifs contain methionine at the +4 position (Fig. 1 C). Intriguingly, only Box 3 is conserved between species (e.g. mouse and human DAX-1) and has extensive homology (i.e. outside the leucine core) to the SHP-Box1 (Fig. 1, A and C), which we have previously demonstrated to be functional as an ER-binding motif (19Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the DAX-1 repeat region, which functions as a DNA/RNA-binding domain (21Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Lalli E. Ohe K. Hindelang C. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), may additionally mediate binding to ERs. We made several constructs expressing NR-Box-containing DAX-1 fragments fused to GST (Fig. 1 B) and assessed their binding to radiolabeled ERs in pull-down assays (Fig. 2). First, GST·DAX-1 DBD was found to interact with estradiol-bound ERα and ERβ (Fig. 2 A) as well as with various other receptors (data not shown), indicating that the N-terminal repeat region of DAX-1 indeed may serve as receptor-binding domain. Second, because only repeat 3 contains a perfect LXXLL motif, we assessed binding of ERs to the repeat 3 region alone (Fig. 2 B). Both ERs bound equally well, and estradiol enhanced the interactions. Third, to see whether these interactions were mediated by the LXXLL motif, we assessed binding to 14-mer NR-Box peptides fused to GST (Fig. 2 C). For comparison, we analyzed peptide constructs expressing the second LXXLL motif of the p160 coactivator TIF2, which represents a high-affinity ER-binding motif (8Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 19Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and we included a DAX-1-Box1 peptide with the core sequence LXXML (see Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, although liganded ERα apparently displayed a higher affinity for DAX-1-Box3, the two ERs interacted with all peptides including DAX-1-Box1. This indicates that possibly all three NR Boxes in the repeat region may be involved in ER binding. Consistently, mutation of the third LXXLL motif (Fig. 1 B, R3mut) abolished interaction with ERs when analyzed in the context of the isolated repeat 3 as expected but not when analyzed in the context of the three repeat domain or the entire DAX-1 protein (data not shown). To investigate whether DAX-1 can interact with DNA bound and liganded ER dimers in vitro, we performed gel shift experiments using purified proteins (Fig. 3 A). Whereas estradiol in the presence of GST control protein induced a characteristic downshift of the ERβ·DNA complex caused by conformational changes upon ligand binding (lanes 1 and2), addition of GST·DAX-1 R3 (see Fig. 1 B) protein led to a significant upshift (compare lane 4 withlanes 2 and 3) indicating ternary complex formation. For comparison, the LXXLL domain of TIF2 fused to GST (6Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) promoted a ligand-dependent supershift as expected (lane 6). Ternary complex formation was similarly observed with ERα homodimers, with RXR heterodimers and with monomeric SF-1 (data not shown). These data indicate that DAX-1 interaction with other nuclear receptors is not interfering with dimerization and DNA binding but instead resembles coactivator-type interactions with the AF-2 domain via LXXLL motifs. Further evidence for the DAX-1 interaction with ERs was observed in two additional experimental settings. First, in a coimmunoprecipitation assay, whole-cell extracts expressing FLAG-tagged ERs and wild-type DAX-1 were incubated with an αFLAG-affinity matrix and after washing, analyzed for the presence of DAX-1 protein (Fig. 3 B). Overexpressed DAX-1 (lanes 2 and 4) as well as a protein possibly representing endogenous DAX-1 (lanes 1 and3) were specifically coprecipitated only when FLAG·ERs were present but not in their absence (lanes 5 and6). Second, in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3 C), GAL4·DAX-1 strongly interacted with both activation domain (GAD)-tagged ERs but not with GAD alone. Apparent differences between ERα and ERβ with regard to their ligand-independent interaction in two-hybrid assays are not a peculiarity of the DAX-1 interaction but have been observed with SHP as well (19Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To investigate functional consequences of the interactions of DAX-1 with ERs on the activity of estrogen-responsive promoters, we performed transient transfections (Fig. 4). We compared three different DAX-1 expression constructs: (i) wild-type DAX-1, which is known to be a nuclear protein and a potent transcriptional repressor (21Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Lalli E. Ohe K. Hindelang C. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), (ii) the naturally occurring DAX-1 R267P mutation, which is nonrepressing possibly caused by its inability to bind the corepressors N-CoR and Alien (24Lalli E.

Thormeyer D. Renkawitz R. Baniahmad A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7662-7667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and (iii) a GAL4·DAX-1 fusion protein lacking the N-terminal receptor interaction domain but containing the repressor function within the LBD. We observed that DAX-1 WT and surprisingly also DAX-1 R267P inhibited ERα (Fig. 4 A) or ERβ activity (Fig. 4 B), respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. However, the repression-defective DAX-1 variant appeared to be less effective than the wild-type DAX-1, particularly when using higher amounts of ER expression plasmid (data not shown), indicating that active repression may contribute to the inhibitory effects. Inhibition did not occur with GAL4·DAX-1 LBD lacking the N-terminal repeat domain, indicating that the inhibitory effect requires a direct interaction of DAX-1 with ERs and furthermore that the DAX-1 LBD cannot serve as an ER interaction domain. To obtain further evidence for a possible recruitment of corepressors to ERs via DAX-1 as bridging protein, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid experiment in analogy to the experiments described for SF-1 (25Crawford P.A. Dorn C. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2949-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4 C, GAL4·ERα and VP16 activation domain-tagged N-CoR encompassing the DAX-1 interaction domain were cotransfected in the absence or presence of DAX-1. Consistent with the inability of N-CoR to bind to ERs in the presence of agonists (37Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M. Schiff R. Del-Rio A.L. Ricote M. Ngo S. Gemsch J.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we found that VP16·N-CoR in the absence of cotransfected DAX-1 had no effect on estradiol-induced ERα activity. However, VP16·N-CoR could partially restore reporter gene activity in the presence of inhibitory amounts of DAX-1. Because control Western blot analysis shows equal DAX-1 protein levels in both the absence or presence of VP16·N-CoR (Fig. 4 C, lower), this result suggests that DAX-1 may serve as a bridging protein between liganded ERα and the corepressor N-CoR (see Fig. 5). The results presented in this study provide insights into previously uncovered aspects of DAX-1 structure and function and substantially expand the regulatory potential of DAX1. The interactions with ERs may be physiologically relevant because DAX-1 is expressed in multiple estrogen target tissues (9Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S.

Warner, unpublished data. it is quite striking that ERα and ERβ proteins are apparently differentially expressed in distinct cell types of male and female reproductive tissues. For example, in testis ERα seems predominantly expressed in Ley-dig cells, whereas high ERβ expression seems restricted to Sertoli and germ cells. In ovary, ERβ is mainly expressed in granulosa cells, whereas ERα expression is much lower and restricted to interstitial theca cells. Although a comparative analysis of DAX protein expression needs to be accomplished, the known mRNA expression pattern suggests DAX-1 coexpression in all of these cell types (22Zanaria E.

Gene inactivation in mice surprisingly did not affect ovarian development and fertility but instead caused male infertility (28Yu R.N. Ito M. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), a phenotype which intriguingly has been observed in mice lacking ERα (42Eddy E.M. Washburn T.F. Bunch D.O. Goulding E.H. Gladen B.C. Lubahn D.B. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Moreover, developmental studies suggest coexpression of ERs and DAX-1 in testis and ovary during certain stages of embryogenesis (35Ikeda Y. Swain A. Weber T.J. Hentges K.E. Zanaria E. Lalli E. Tamai K.T. Sassone-Corsi P. Lovell-Badge R. Camerino G. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 43Lemmen J.G. Broekhof J.L.M. Kuiper G.G. Gustafsson J.Å. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Possibly, DAX-1 serves as a tissue- or stage-specific ER coregulator involved in modulation of estrogen signaling. Comparatively, much less is known about expression of ERs in adrenal gland, a major site of DAX-1 function in steroidogenesis. However, estrogens are known to affect adrenal development, and ERs have been detected in the cortex of fetal primate glands (44Albrecht E.D. Babischkin J.S. Davies W.A. Leavitt M.G. Pepe G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5953-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as in all cell types of the adult rat gland (45Saunders P.T.K. Maguire S.M. Gaughan J. Millar M.R. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 154: R13-R16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Because DAX-1 expression could be hormonally regulated (29Tamai K.T. Monaco L. Alastalo T.P. Lalli E. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1561-1569PubMed Google Scholar), feedback mechanisms in steroidogenesis involving DAX-1 may principally resemble the recently discovered feedback loop in bile acid biosynthesis involving SHP (46Lu T.T.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results indicate nuclear receptor binding as a novel feature of the DAX-1 repeat domain and thereby it reveals additional functional similarities between DAX-1 and SHP, the only two members of the nuclear receptor family that have acquired characteristics of transcriptional coregulators (18Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Johansson L. Bavner A.

Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chicken DAX-1 homolog apparently lacks the entire mammalian repeat domain but contains in its short N terminus a single ILYSIL motif (49Smith C.A. Clifford V. Western P.S. Wilcox S.A. Bell K.S. Sinclair A.H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This possibly suggests that binding to nuclear receptors is evolutionarily conserved between species whereas binding to DNA is not. Intriguingly, the mechanism we propose here for ERs may provide an alternative explanation for the inhibitory effects of DAX-1 on retinoic acid receptor transcription first reported in the original study (22Zanaria E. Muscatelli F. Bardoni B. Strom T.M. Guioli S. Guo W. Lalli E. Moser C. Walker A.P. McCabe E.R.B. Meitinger T. Monaco A.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Camerino G. Nature. 1994; 372: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that DAX-1 may serve broader functions in nuclear receptor signaling (25Crawford P.A. Dorn C. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2949-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 39Bae D.S. Schaefer M.L. Partan B.W. Muglia L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3921-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 we provide a discussion model by integrating our findings with current theories of DAX-1 mechanisms of action. In this model, DAX-1 is envisaged to mediate functional interactions between upstream coregulator complexes consisting of corepressors or, if ligands exist, coactivators and downstream target genes. These genes may be regulated directly via DAX-1 (21Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) or indirectly via nuclear receptors such as ERs and SF-1. It will be necessary to determine the relative importance of these two alternatives in vivo and to investigate whether these two events occur simultaneously or competitively. Because DAX-1 interacts through LXXLL motifs and possesses an intrinsic silencing function, it is likely that DAX-1 may inhibit receptor activation by a sequential mechanism involving coactivator displacement and subsequent corepressor recruitment. Therefore, DAX-1 itself may be defined as an LXXLL-containing corepressor and shares this feature with SHP. Although DAX-1 is a true orphan receptor, endogenous ligands could possibly convert DAX-1 from a repressor to an activator and thereby possibly activate, for example, estrogen target genes. Indeed, indirect evidence for a role of ligand-activated DAX-1 comes from the recent discovery of a patient with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia carrying a missense mutation in the activation domain helix 12 (50), which is dispensable for corepressor binding but indispensable for coactivator binding to liganded receptors (1Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the DAX-1 helix 12 contains a glutamate residue that is conserved in all ligand-activatable receptors and was suggested to be critical for coactivator LXXLL binding (7Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Future structural information may be required to reveal the presence of a ligand-binding pocket. Until then, it is an exciting possibility that the coregulatory potential of DAX-1 could be hormonally, metabolically, or pharmaceutically regulated, a novel aspect of both receptor and coregulator function.

These findings fit to subsequent results ofin vivo analyses of ephrin-A5 single and ephrin-A5;ephrin-A2 double knockout mice (6Feldheim J. Kim Y.-I. Bergemann A.D. Frisén J. Barbacid M. Flanagan J.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A hint of how ephrin-A functions on retinal axons may be provided by the concept that these ligands are localized, because of their membrane attachment by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 anchor, to so-called rafts (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar, 8Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 9Brown D.A.

Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins are bound to the outer leaflet of the raft membranes (with no direct contact to the cytosol), whereas signaling molecules such as members of the src family are localized to the inner leaflet of rafts. In fact, “activated” GPI-anchored proteins can transduce signals to the cytosol, leading, for example, to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and activation of specific signaling pathways. This signaling might occur through formation of larger raft domains triggered by clustering of GPI-anchored proteins, which allows an interaction of signaling molecules normally separated through direct interactions between raft lipids or through (regulated) association of GPI-anchored molecules with appropriate transmembrane (co) receptors (9Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar, 14Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For example, the GPI-anchored cell adhesion molecule contactin/F11 associates with the transmembrane protein CASPR (15Peles E. Nativ M. Lustig M. Grumet M. Schilling J. Martinez R. Plowman G.D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), representing a coreceptor involved in signal transduction after contactin/F11 stimulation. Other examples of GPI-anchored proteins capable of mediating signals include Thy-1 (16Doherty P. Singh A. Rimon G. Bolsover S.R. Walsh F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 122: 181-189Google Scholar), CNTF (17Economides A.N. Ravetch J.V. Yancopoulos G.D. Stahl N. Science. 1995; 270: 1351-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), GDNF (18Massague J. Nature. 1996; 382: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and neurturin (19Buj-Bello A. Adu J. Pinon L.G. Horton A. Thompson J. Rosenthal A. Chinchetru M. Buchman V.L. Davies A.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Simons and coworkers (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar) have put forward the idea that a fundamental principle guiding the way raft microdomains exert their function in signal transduction is the (regulated) separation of different membrane proteins (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar, 20Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). According to this concept, GPI-anchored molecules and other specific sets of membrane proteins have a strong tendency to associate with these domains, whereas others, such as molecules with a transmembrane domain, rarely appear in these areas. Recently, it was shown that activation of ephrin-A5 results in an increase in adhesion of the ligand-expressing cells and in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of molecules with molecular masses of 75–80 and 60 kDa (21Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghofer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These changes, however, were not specific for an ephrin-A activation and were also seen after incubation of these cells with, for example, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (22Davy A. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we show that binding of the ephA3 receptor to ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 leads to an activation of the integrin system, as seen in a β1-integrin-dependent increase in adhesion of the ephrin-A-expressing cells. Activation of ephrin-As and changes in adhesion correlate well with the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with a molecular mass of 120 kDa, which is observed only after ephrin-A activation. p120 thus might represent a component of a new ephrin-A-dependent signaling pathway functionally linking ephrin-As to integrins. HEK293 cell clones stably expressing chick ephrin-A2 or the long or the short form of mouse ephrin-A5 were established according to standard protocols. In brief, about 2 × 106 HEK293 cells were transfected with 25 μg of the respective pClNeo-based expression plasmids and were selected for about 2 weeks in standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics) containing 400 μg/ml G418 (PAA Laboratories). Then individual clones were isolated, expanded, and analyzed for ephrin-A expression using ephA3-AP staining and later, Western blots. Those cell clones most strongly expressing ephrin-As were further expanded and used in this study. ephA3-AP and AP were produced as described previously (23Monschau B. Kremoser C. Ohta K. Tanaka H.

Antibodies against chicken ephrin-A2 were described by Hornberger et al. (4Hornberger M.R. Dütting D. Ciossek T. Yamada T. Handwerker C. Lang S. Weth F. Huf J. Wessel R. Logan C. Tanaka H.

Monoclonal antibodies to fyn and caveolin-2 were from Transduction Laboratories, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Dianova. About 75% confluent HEK293 cell clones expressing the indicated ephrin-As were starved for 36 h in serum-free RPMI medium, detached from the dishes with prewarmed PUCKS-EDTA (5 mm KCl, 130 mmNaCl, 3 mm NaHCO3, 5 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA), pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min, washed once with serum-free RPMI medium, pelleted again, and resuspended in serum-free RPMI medium containing either 10 nm ephA3-AP or 10 nm AP. Then the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, placed immediately on ice, and washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4. Subsequently the cells were solubilized at 4 °C for 10 min in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 μm aprotinin, 50 microunits of leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4). This lysate was used for Optiprep density gradient ultracentrifugation. The cell lysate was adjusted to 35% (v/v) in Optiprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). 0.96 ml of this solution was overlaid with 3 ml of 30% Optiprep in lysis buffer, 0.5 ml of 10% Optiprep in lysis buffer, 0.4 ml of lysis buffer and was centrifuged at 42 krpm for 16 h at 4 °C in an SW 50.1 rotor. Subsequently, 0.6-ml fractions were taken from the top. The second fraction containing the white blur band between 30 and 10% Optiprep was collected as caveolin fraction, and the last fraction was collected as the soluble fraction (see also Ref. 21Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghofer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The various fractions were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 5 to 10 min at room temperature and then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 15 min and spun down at 14 krpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 80% acetone at room temperature for 10 min and spun down again at 14 krpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and pellets were air-dried for further experiments such as Western blot analysis. The “caveolin” fraction was diluted 1:3 with 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and was then precleared with appropriate amounts of protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C under rotating conditions. Immunoprecipitations were done by incubating the precleared lysate with antibody-conjugated protein G-agarose for at least 4 h at 4 °C under rotating conditions. Subsequently the immunoprecipitate was centrifuged and washed three times with lysis buffer. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were done according to standard protocols. 96-Well microtiter plates were coated with serially diluted (from 20 to 0.625 μg/ml in PBS) laminin or poly-l-lysine overnight at 4 °C and washed once with PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked at room temperature for 1 h using 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The starved cells (36 h) were detached from the dishes with prewarmed PUCKS-EDTA, washed once, and resuspended in serum-free RPMI medium. ephA3-AP or AP was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. Subsequently, about 2 × 105 cells in 100 μl were plated per well (in triplicates) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then the medium was discarded, and remaining cells were washed once with PBS. Subsequently the cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde/0.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were washed three times with H2O and were extracted with 50% ethanol/50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5 (50 μl/well). Absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Data shown in Figs. 1 and 6 were calculated on the basis of two to three independently performed experiments.Figure 6Blocking src family kinases greatly reduces the increase in cell adhesion seen after stimulating ephrin-A2-expressing cells with ephA3-AP. Serum-starved ephrin-A2 expressing cells were treated for 4 h with PP2 or PP3. Then the cells were detached from the culture dishes and plated in the presence of ephA3-AP or AP on dishes coated with increasing concentrations of laminin (0.625–20 μg/ml). 30 min later unbound cells were washed away. The number of adherent cells was determined using a colorimetric assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). y axis, number of adherent cells in arbitrary units. The increase in ephA3-AP mediated adhesiveness of HEK293-ephrin-A2 cells can be inhibited by treating cells with 10 μm PP2 (a selective src family kinase inhibitor) but not with PP3, a very similar but functionally inactive compound to PP2. For details see Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize a possible receptor or signaling function of the GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands, we established a HEK293 cell line stably expressing ephrin-A2. As the ephA system has been shown to be involved for example in the regulation of cell migration (25Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether treatment of these cells with their receptor changes the adhesive properties of these cells to laminin. For an activation we used ephA3-AP or AP (the latter serving as a negative control). ephA3-AP is a fusion protein of the extracellular part of the ephA3 receptor (known to bind strongly to ephrin-A2 (23Monschau B. Kremoser C. Ohta K. Tanaka H. Kaneko T. Yamada T. Handwerker C. Hornberger M.R. Löschinger J. Pasquale E.B. Siever D.A. Verderame M.F. Müller B.K. Bonhoeffer F. Drescher U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)) and alkaline phosphatase. As alkaline phosphatase itself oligomerises, ephA3-AP, too, is in an oligomeric form (24Ciossek T. Monschau B. Kremoser C. Löschinger J. Lang S. Müller B.K. Bonhoeffer F. Drescher U. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and thus might represent the “active” form of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 1 A, incubating HEK293-ephrin-A2 cells with ephA3-AP, but not AP, led to a significant increase in adhesion to laminin but not to poly-l-lysine, which indicates an activation of the integrin system. To confirm that the increase in adhesion is indeed dependent on the presence of ephrin-A ligands, we performed this assay also using the parental cell line HEK293. Here we did not observe any increase in cell adhesion after ephA3-AP treatment (data not shown). To investigate the role of integrins directly, we performed the adhesion assay in the presence of a function-blocking monoclonal antibody to β1-integrin, used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (see “Experimental Procedures”). Here we observed a strong reduction in the ephA3-induced increase in adhesion, whereas a control antibody used at the same concentration did not affect this increase (Fig.1 B). Thus, activation of ephrin-As by their receptors leads to an activation of the integrin system. To understand the signaling function of ephrin-A ligands more closely, we were interested in identifying those proteins that link stimulated ephrin-A ligands to the integrin system. As ephrin-A molecules are GPI-anchored, they possess no direct link to the cytosol and thus might require a “coreceptor” for exerting such a signaling function. GPI-anchored molecules are found in so called rafts, which are believed to represent platforms in which molecules involved in signal transduction are concentrated, thus a coreceptor might colocalize here with ephrin-As. In initial experiments we investigated whether ephrin-A2 is indeed associated with rafts. A criterion for the association of a particular protein with rafts is the presence of that protein in detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains, which can be isolated because of their high lipid content by sucrose gradient centrifugation (26Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Thus ephrin-A2-expressing cells were subjected to an Optiprep (sucrose) step gradient centrifugation, and individual fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies to ephrin-A2 and caveolin-2. Caveolins (27Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) are proteins that are often found associated with these rafts and might function in stabilizing the raft domains (13Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). These analyses showed that ephrin-A2 is contained in the same fractions as caveolin-2, indicating that ephrin-A2 is indeed localized to rafts. Fractions containing soluble proteins neither contained ephrin-A2 nor caveolin-2 (Fig.2, A and C). This purification step considerably increased the sensitivity of our analyses, as the majority of cell proteins was contained in the nonraft fractions (data not shown). To identify proteins that might be components of an ephrin-A2 signaling pathway, we compared the raft fractions from HEK293-ephrin-A2 cells after incubation with either ephA3-AP or with AP. Using Western blot analysis we focused in particular on changes in tyrosine phosphorylation levels using phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibodies. Before activation, cells were serum-starved for 36 h to reduce the considerable level of tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins, which is evident for cells grown under standard conditions with serum. As shown in Fig. 2, we indeed found such changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of proteins contained in the raft fractions after activating ephrin-A2-expressing cells with ephA3-AP but not with AP. In particular, a protein of roughly 120 kDa, which is only slightly tyrosine phosphorylated in the uninduced state, becomes strongly phosphorylated after 30 min, and later, after about 60 min, returns to a close to initial phosphorylation level. This protein was not detected in the fractions containing soluble proteins but in the same fraction as caveolin-2, suggesting that it represents a molecule specifically associated with raft fractions (Fig. 2). Additionally, proteins with a molecular mass of 70–80 kDa, which were highly tyrosine-phosphorylated before induction, became dephosphorylated after ephA3-AP treatment, with an almost complete dephosphorylation after 60 min (for simplicity, this set of proteins will be referred to in the following paragraphs as p80). These proteins also were specifically contained in the raft fraction. Thus, there are (at least) two proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation levels were changed, in opposite directions, after activation of ephrin-A2. However, we can not exclude the possibility that the increase in p120 tyrosine phosphorylation is because of a recruitment of p120 to the raft domains after ephrin-A2 stimulation. Similarly, the down-regulation of p80 phosphorylation might be because of a lower concentration of p80 in rafts after ephrin-A2 activation. In addition, we observed a doublet of two strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, whose phosphorylation pattern did not change after ephA3-AP treatment (Fig. 2). Reprobing filters with an anti-fyn antibody (Fig. 2) resulted in the appearance of a band at exactly the same position as after probing the filter with the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody, suggesting that one of these bands corresponds to the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase fyn (Fig.2 B). This was confirmed in an additional set of experiments. Here the raft fraction of ephA3-AP-stimulated cells was immunoprecipitated using an anti-fyn polyclonal serum and subsequently analyzed in a Western blot using firstly an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and secondly, after stripping of the filter, an anti-fyn monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 D). Also, our analyses indicated that neither the amount nor the phosphorylation level of fyn was changed after activation of ephrin-A2 (Fig. 2, A andC). A rehybridization of the filters with an antibody against caveolin-2, as shown in Fig. 2 B, demonstrated that similar amounts of raft proteins have been loaded. Subsequently, we investigated in more detail the temporal changes that took place in the level of tyrosine phosphorylations of p120 and p80 after treating cells with ephA3-AP. As shown in Fig.3, p120 becomes significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated only after about 15 min, thus with an apparent lag phase of about 10 min. The tyrosine phosphorylation remains at a high level for about 30 min and then decreases, leading to a faint signal 60 min after the start of ephrin-A2 activation. The dephosphorylation of p80 started earlier, that is already 5 min after ephA3-AP treatment, a significant drop in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation is apparent and with time, leads to an almost complete dephosphorylation. The expression level and tyrosine phosphorylation level of fyn was not affected within the time window investigated (Fig.3 C). We also verified that, even after a 60-min incubation with ephA3-AP, the concentration of ephrin-A2 associated with the raft fraction is not changed (Fig. 3 D). When analyzing the temporal changes in cell adhesion after ephrin-A2 activation (Fig. 3 E), we found that the increase in adhesion was observed only after a lag phase of at least 20 min, that is the increase in adhesion is seen clearly only after the increase in p120 tyrosine phosphorylation has occurred. In an attempt to determine the identity of p120, we have probed the cells using ephrin-A5-AP or ephrin-A2-AP, and we have analyzed the raft fraction with selected antibodies. However, results from these experiments ruled out the possibility that p120 corresponds to an ephA receptor or focal adhesion kinase (data not shown). Next we asked whether the changes in phosphorylation observed were specific for ephrin/Eph interactions or whether other proteins such as growth factors also induce these or similar changes in tyrosine phosphorylation. For this purpose, we analyzed a number of different signaling molecules known to affect the tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of cellular proteins, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and bFGF. We also included fetal calf serum (FCS) in our analysis, which contains a large variety of different growth factors. We observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of p80 after FCS treatment; however, none of these factors led to changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of p120 comparable with those caused by ephA3-AP (Fig. 4). We then wanted to know whether the observed changes in tyrosine phosphorylation can be observed also for other ephrin-A ligands. We established HEK293 cells stably expressing either the long or the short splice form of ephrin-A5 (28Flenniken A.M. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Wilkinson D.G. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 382-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and performed the same experiments as described above for ephrin-A2. Indeed, after activation by ephA3-AP, both ligands induced the down-regulation of p80 phosphorylation and the transient up-regulation of p120 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Our next step was to investigate more closely the inter-relationship between ephrin-As and integrins. A number of molecules are known to be involved in the regulation of integrin signaling, and we were interested in whether signaling pathways used in ephrin-A and integrin signaling share common members. We concentrated on src family kinases, which are known to be involved in integrin signaling and are required for an optimal adhesion efficiency but appear not to be essential for these events (29Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar, 30Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin.

We used the pyrazolopyrimidine PP2, which selectively inhibits src family kinases (34Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). This inhibitor and a closely related molecule, PP1, have both been used in a number of investigations to show an involvement of src family kinases in different developmental processes (21Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghofer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 35Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treating the ephrin-A2-expressing cells with 10 μm PP2 alone, thus without stimulation by ephA3-AP, led to only a small reduction in the adhesiveness of these cells (Fig.6). However, the strong increase in adhesion typically seen after ephA3-stimulation (see Figs. 1 and 6) was prevented by PP2, i.e. by blocking src family kinases. The incubation in the presence of 10 μm PP3, which is a structurally closely related but functionally inactive compound to PP2, had no effect on the increase in cell adhesion (Fig. 6). In parallel to these binding assays, we performed Western blot analyses of raft fractions from ephA3-AP-treated cells, which showed that PP2 pretreatment of these cells almost completely abolished the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120, whereas PP3 did not affect this pattern (Fig. 7). In this report we have shown that binding of ephA3 to ephrin-A-expressing cells leads to an activation of the integrin system and an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 120-kDa raft protein. Both the increase in adhesion and in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 can be abolished by inhibiting the function of src family kinases. Besides p120, we identified a set of proteins having a molecular mass of about 80 kDa, whose tyrosine phosphorylation was down-regulated after ephrin-A stimulation. It has been proposed that raft microdomains serve as platforms in the membrane, within which molecules involved in signaling to the cytosol are organized (7Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar, 12Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Both GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands and B-class ephrins, which are transmembrane-anchored, are found in these structures. Whereas A-ligands appear to be constitutively associated with these rafts, the incorporation of B-ligands in these structures might be regulated, as ephrin-Bs without their cytoplasmic tail no longer associate with rafts (37Brückner K. Labrador J.P. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), suggesting an active (regulated) transport of B-ephrins into and out of rafts. Interaction of ephB receptors with their ligands results in the phosphorylation of highly conserved tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the ligands, which then might serve as binding sites for other signaling molecules (37Brückner K.

After stimulation of ephrin-A2-expressing cells with ephA3-AP, we observed an increase in cell adhesion, which could be abolished by using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to β1-integrin, indicating the existence of an ephrin-A-dependent signaling pathway controlling integrin function. The mechanism by which ephrin-As exert this function, e.g. signal into the cytosol, is poorly understood. It is quite possible that a communication between ephrin-As (bound to the outer leaflet of the membrane) and intracellular signaling molecules such as lipidated src family kinases (bound to the inner leaflet of the membranes) is mediated by (conformational changes of) transmembrane proteins. The proteins we have identified on the basis of their presence in raft membranes and their differential tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in response to ephrin/Eph interactions represent candidates for such a role. p120 is only slightly phosphorylated in the unstimulated state but becomes strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated after ephrin-A activation. We cannot exclude the possibility that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 is because of a recruitment of already tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 to the raft domains. However, we think this is unlikely, because the increase in p120 tyrosine phosphorylation can be blocked by inhibiting src family kinases. It remains to be investigated whether a similar modification of p120 can be observed also after clustering of other GPI-anchored proteins expressed at similar levels in HEK293 cells. It is noteworthy that the strong increase in p120 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs only after a lag phase of about 10 min, suggesting the involvement of other signaling components. Possibly the lag phase is correlated with changes in the structure or composition of ephrin-A-containing raft microdomains. Thus treatment with oligomeric ephA3-AP might lead to a clustering of ephrin-A2 and a concomitant fusion of initially smaller raft microdomains, which results, by an unknown mechanism, in an activation of src family kinases, p120 tyrosine phosphorylation, and integrin activation. In good agreement with p120 playing a role in coupling ephrin-A activation to integrin activation, we have shown here (using a specific src family kinase inhibitor) that blocking p120 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with an abolishment of the increase in cell adhesion. In further support, the increase in cell adhesion occurs subsequent to the increase in p120 tyrosine phosphorylation, which thus supports the concept that p120 phosphorylation is involved in the control of cell adhesion rather than its being a consequence. The p80 protein might not be involved in this process, as its dephosphorylation was observed for example also after FCS treatment, which on the other hand does not affect cell adhesion. Interestingly, activation of ephA receptors leads to a suppression of integrin function and to an inhibition of cell spreading and migration (of fibroblast cells) (42Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M.

Therefore, the unexpected picture arises that activation of ephAs and ephrin-As might contribute to the regulation of a similar intracellular signaling pathway but in opposite directions. It appears that interaction between ephA-expressing and ephrin-A-expressing cells results in a decrease in adhesion of the ephA-expressing cells and an increase in adhesion of the ephrin-A-expressing cells. It will be of interest to investigate the behavior of cells expressing both ephrin-As and ephAs simultaneously and to study the responses of an activation of ephAs or ephrin-As or both. The physiological meaning of these regulationsin vivo is not known, but understanding this process might contribute to an understanding of the development of the retinotectal projection, where on subpopulations of retinal axons ephrin-As and ephAs are coexpressed. Recently, in an approach similar to the one used here, Davyet al. (21Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghofer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) identified a number of proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation level increased after binding of ephA5-Fc to an ephrin-A5-expressing cell line. They found most prominently a 75–80-kDa protein, which became highly phosphorylated after ephrin-A2 treatment. However, stimulation with bFGF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same protein, which indicates the activation of a more general, but not ephrin-A-specific, signaling pathway. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of the p70–80 protein we identified was quickly down-regulated after ephrin-A activation and was also not specific for an ephrin-A signaling pathway. Thus, it is unclear whether these two sets of proteins are the same, albeit of a rather similar, molecular weight. Overall, although the approaches of Davy et al. (21Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghofer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and our own group appear to be similar, there are some differences in the experimental set-up, like the use of serum-starved cells, and these might explain the different results observed. A molecular identification of, for example, the 80-kDa protein/s will help answer this puzzle. In contrast, the up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 was specific for the ephrin/ephA receptor interaction within the limits of molecules tested here. Thus, it was not seen after treatment of cells with growth factors such as bFGF, IGF, or EGF or with fetal calf serum, which contains a large variety of different growth factors. A characterization of a 120-kDa protein was not reported by Davy et al. (21Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghofer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The precise role of p120 in the process linking ephrin-A activation to integrin activation is presently unclear, thus further experiments will be directed toward a more detailed characterization of this molecule.

We report here that adding 10−100 nmMARCKS-(151−175) to a subphase containing either PLC-δ or -β inhibits hydrolysis of PIP2 in a monolayer and that this inhibition is due to the strong binding of the peptide to PIP2. Two direct binding measurements, based on centrifugation and fluorescence, show that ≈10 nmPIP2, in the form of vesicles containing 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1% PIP2, binds 50% of MARCKS-(151−175). Both electrophoretic mobility measurements and competition experiments suggest that MARCKS-(151−175) forms an electroneutral complex with ≈4 PIP2. MARCKS-(151−175) binds equally well to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Local electrostatic interactions of PIP2 with MARCKS-(151−175) contribute to the binding energy because increasing the salt concentration from 100 to 500 mm decreases the binding 100-fold. We hypothesize that the effector domain of MARCKS can bind a significant fraction of the PIP2 in the plasma membrane, and release the bound PIP2 upon interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin or phosphorylation by protein kinase C.

For example, PIP2 is the source of three second messengers: diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (reviewed in Refs. 2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar−4). PIP2 also recruits proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) (reviewed in Ref. 5Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Physiol. 1997; 59: 193-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). How can PIP2 play so many different roles? The pool of PIP2 hydrolyzed by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) may be sequestered in cholesterol-enriched lipid “rafts” (11Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), or the enzymes that synthesize PIP2 may be concentrated in specific regions of the plasma membrane (4Tolias K.F. Carpenter C.L. Cockcroft S. Biology of Phosphoinositides. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2000: 109-130Google Scholar). Alternatively, proteins may reversibly bind much of the PIP2 in the plasma membrane, blunting changes in the level of free PIP2 that would otherwise occur. We explore here the hypothesis that myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) not only binds a significant fraction of the PIP2 in the plasma membrane, but also releases it upon binding by Ca2+/calmodulin or phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC). MARCKS (reviewed in Refs. 12Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar and 13Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a ubiquitous PKC (14Newton A.C. Conn P.M. Means A.R. Principles of Molecular Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 207-220Google Scholar) substrate, present at high concentration in many cell types; for example, its concentration in brain is ≈10 μm (13Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Albert K.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), comparable to the concentration of PIP2. It has two conserved regions required for membrane binding: a myristoylated N terminus and a basic effector domain (residues 151−175). The mechanism by which MARCKS binds to the plasma membrane is well understood (reviewed in Refs. 16McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar and 17Arbuzova A. Murray D. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); the N-terminal myristate inserts into the bilayer and the cluster of basic residues in the effector domain interacts electrostatically with acidic lipids. When the effector domain of MARCKS binds to Ca2+/calmodulin or is phosphorylated by PKC, its interaction with acidic lipids is reversed (reviewed in Refs. 12Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McLaughlin S.

Acta. 1998; 1376: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Previous work suggested that the effector domain of MARCKS interacts with PIP2; both MARCKS and its effector domain peptide, MARCKS-(151−175), inhibit the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 in vesicles, and this inhibition is reversed by Ca2+/calmodulin binding or PKC phosphorylation of MARCKS-(151−175) (18Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26187-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the simplest interpretation of these results is that the effector domain binds strongly to PIP2, it is difficult to rule out potential artifacts because MARCKS-(151−175) also aggregates the vesicles. For example, the putative large lateral domains formed in membranes by MARCKS-(151−175) (18Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1500-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) are probably an aggregation-related artifact (20Murray D. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Gambhir A. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3176-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to test our hypothesis more rigorously. First, we investigated whether MARCKS-(151−175) inhibits the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 in phospholipid monolayers, a system that eliminates the possibility of artifacts due to vesicle aggregation. Second, we measured directly the binding of MARCKS-(151−175) to bilayers containing PIP2 using two independent techniques. Next, we conducted competition and electrophoretic mobility experiments to investigate the stoichiometry of the complex formed between MARCKS-(151−175) and PIP2. Finally, we examined the importance of nonspecific electrostatic interactions by comparing the specificity of MARCKS-(151−175) for PI(4,5)P2 versus PI(3,4)P2 and measuring the effect of salt on the binding. The results all support the hypothesis that the effector domain of MARCKS binds with high affinity to PIP2 in membranes; under “Discussion,” we consider the biological implications of this strong interaction. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PS), 1-palmitoyl-2- oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

We measured PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 (reviewed in Ref. 27Rhee S.G. Poulin B. Lee S.B. Sekiya F. Cockcroft S. Biology of Phosphoinositides. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2000: 1-31Google Scholar) in a monolayer as described previously (28Rebecchi M. Boguslavsky V. Boguslavsky L. McLaughlin S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3032-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 60 μl of 55 μm PC/PS/[3H]PIP2 (66.5:33:0.5) in chloroform was carefully deposited onto the surface of a solution containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 15 ml in a 5-cm-diameter Teflon trough. Once the chloroform had evaporated (10 min), we measured the surface pressure of the monolayer (typically 25 mN/m) using a square piece of filter paper and a balance as described previously (30Fromherz P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1975; 46: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). MARCKS-(151−175) was then added to the subphase; the magnetic stir bar at the bottom of the trough mixed MARCKS-(151−175) uniformly in the subphase within ≈1 min. After 3 min, we added PLC-δ1 or PLC-β1 (final concentration ≈ 0.1 nm), mixed the subphase solution for another 3 min, then added 100 μm CaCl2 to the subphase to produce a free concentration of Ca2+ ≈ 2 μm, as measured using a Ca2+ electrode in separate experiments. A free Ca2+ concentration of 2 μm produces significant activation of both PLC-δ and -β on monolayers and other systems (29Boguslavsky V. Rebecchi M. Morris A.J. Jhon D.Y. Rhee S.G. McLaughlin S.

We collected 200-μl aliquots of the subphase at different times after the addition of Ca2+ and measured the radioactivity due to [3H]IP3. Unless specified, all measurements were done at 25 °C with a monolayer consisting of PC/PS/[3H]PIP2 (66.5:33:0.5) at a surface pressure of π ≈ 25 mN/m. We did several control experiments. First, we determined that the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 in the absence of Ca2+ was negligible (data not shown), as expected for the Ca2+-dependent PLC-δ and -β enzymes. Second, we showed that the initial hydrolysis rate (the initial slope of the hydrolysis curves, such as those shown in Fig. 1) was proportional to PLC concentration (data not shown). Third, we confirmed that increasing the surface pressure, π, decreased the hydrolysis rate significantly (28Rebecchi M. Boguslavsky V. Boguslavsky L. McLaughlin S.

Fourth, we determined that the percentage of inhibition of PIP2hydrolysis was independent of PLC concentration; increasing the PLC-δ1 concentration 5-fold did not change the percentage of inhibition produced by 150 nm MARCKS-(151−175) (data not shown). Other studies showed the initial rate of hydrolysis catalyzed by both PLC-δ1 and PLC-β1 depends on the mole fraction of PIP2 (28Rebecchi M. Boguslavsky V. Boguslavsky L. McLaughlin S.

Thus, if MARCKS-(151−175) binds to PIP2, decreasing the free concentration of PIP2 in the monolayer, we expect the initial rate of hydrolysis to decrease. We used multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), and sucrose-loaded LUVs, prepared as described in detail elsewhere (20Murray D. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Gambhir A. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3176-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 36Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). MLVs for the electrophoretic mobility measurements were prepared by drying the lipid mixture on a rotary evaporator, adding a solution containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and gently swirling the solution for several min. LUVs for the fluorescence binding measurements were prepared by drying the lipid mixture on a rotary evaporator, hydrating the lipids in a solution containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, then taking the MLVs through five cycles of freezing and thawing followed by 10 extrusion cycles through a stack of two polycarbonate filters (0.1-μm-diameter pore size) using a Lipex Biomembranes Extruder (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) (37Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Sucrose-loaded LUVs for the centrifugation binding measurements were prepared in a similar manner, except that the lipid film was hydrated in a solution containing 176 mm sucrose, 1 mmMOPS, pH 7.0. After extrusion, the solution outside the sucrose-loaded LUVs was exchanged for 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. We measured the binding of [3H]NEM-MARCKS-(151−175) to sucrose-loaded PC/PIP2 LUVs using the centrifugation technique described previously (36Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose-loaded PC/PIP2 LUVs were mixed with 2 nm [3H]NEM-MARCKS-(151−175) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. We measured the radioactivity of the supernatant and the pellet to calculate the percentage of [3H]NEM-MARCKS-(151−175) bound. We minimized loss of the peptide to the tube in these experiments (and the fluorescence experiments described below) by pre-treating the tube with sonicated PC vesicles, which coats the tube surface with PC; MARCKS-(151−175) binds only weakly to PC vesicles (Fig. 2), but strongly to plastic. Binding measurements were also done at several different salt concentrations (100−500 mm KCl). Because the iso-osmotic sucrose solution corresponding to [KCl] > 200 mm is viscous and difficult to extrude, we used a mixture of sucrose and KCl as an internal solution for the vesicles. To describe the binding of the peptide to lipid vesicles without making assumptions about the absorption mechanism, we use a molar partition coefficient, K, as described previously (38Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 39Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Miller C. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1717-1727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). [P]m/[L] =K [P], where [P]m is the molar concentration of peptide bound to the membrane, [L] is the molar concentration of lipid accessible to the peptide (≈ one-half of the total lipid concentration for these LUVs because the peptide interacts only with the outer leaflet of the bilayer; the vesicles are not permeable to the peptide, which is added to a solution of preformed vesicles), and [P] is the molar concentration of free peptide in the bulk aqueous phase. For most of our binding measurements (e.g., Fig. 2), [L] ≫ [P]m. Defining [P]tot as the sum of bound and free peptide molar concentrations, we get Equation 1.[P]m[P]tot=K[L]1+K[L]Equation 1 We determined the molar partition coefficient, K, for the binding of acrylodan-MARCKS-(151−175) to PC/PIP2 LUVs using a fluorescence technique described in detail elsewhere (20Murray D. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Gambhir A. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3176-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, acrylodan is a polarity-sensitive fluorescent dye with an excitation peak at ≈370 nm and an emission peak at ≈520 nm in water (40Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the acrylodan-labeled peptide binds to a membrane, the fluorophore inserts into the bilayer, shifting the emission peak to ≈455 nm and increasing the fluorescence intensity. We added acrylodan-MARCKS-(151−175) to PC/PIP2 LUVs and measured the fluorescence of the mixture at 455 nm, corrected as described elsewhere (20Murray D. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Gambhir A. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3176-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), to calculate the percentage of bound peptide at a given lipid concentration. We obtained information about the stoichiometry of the peptide-PIP2 complex by examining how the fraction of peptide bound decreases when increasing concentrations of peptide are added to a solution of sucrose-loaded PC/PIP2 LUVs. We used the centrifugation technique with a constant lipid concentration (10,000 nm accessible lipid in the form of sucrose-loaded PC/PIP2 (99.7:0.3) LUVs or 30 nm accessible PIP2) to obtain the results shown in Fig. 3. About 80% of MARCKS-(151−175) is bound when the peptide is present at low concentration (e.g. 2 nm). As the peptide concentration increases, it binds a significant fraction of the accessible PIP2 and the fraction of bound peptide decreases. We performed the experiments with both [3H]NEM-MARCKS-(151−175) and a mixture of [3H]NEM-MARCKS-(151−175) and unlabeled MARCKS-(151−175) and obtained essentially identical results, as expected if the NEM label does not affect the binding. MARCKS-(151−175) binds only weakly to PC vesicles (Fig. 2), so the binding sites in PC/PIP2 LUVs should be PIP2. If we assume that one MARCKS-(151−175) binds to one PIP2, we get Equation 2, where Ka is the apparent association constant for 1:1 binding, [P-PIP2] is the molar concentration of the complex of peptide and PIP2, [P] is the molar concentration of free peptide in the bulk aqueous phase, [PIP2] is the molar concentration of free PIP2, [P]totis the sum of bound and free peptide molar concentrations, and [PIP2]tot is the sum of bound and free PIP2 molar concentrations.P+PIP2⇄KaP­PIP2Ka=[P­PIP2][P][PIP2]Equation 2 [P]tot=[P]+[P­PIP2][PIP2]tot=[PIP2]+[P­PIP2]These three equations were combined into a single quadratic expression that predicts the 1:1 binding curve (shown in Fig. 3 withKa = 2 × 108m−1, as derived from the 1% PIP2 binding data in Fig. 2 A). The electrophoretic mobility (velocity/field) of MLVs was measured as described previously (41Cafiso D. McLaughlin A. McLaughlin S. Winiski A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 342-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and used to calculate the zeta potential, the electrostatic potential at the shear plane, which is located about 0.2 nm from the surface (42McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). A mixture containing MARCKS-(151−175) and a low concentration of MLVs was loaded into a glass electrophoresis tube that had been pre-washed with MARCKS-(151−175) to minimize the loss of the peptide. An electrical field was applied, and the electrophoretic mobility of the vesicles, u, was measured directly using a stopwatch and a microscope. The zeta potential was calculated using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation (42McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 43Hunter R.J. Zeta Potential in Colloid Science. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar). ζ=uη/(ɛrɛ0)Equation 3 ζ is the zeta potential of a vesicle, u is the velocity of the vesicle in a unit electric field, η is the viscosity of the aqueous solution,ɛr is the dielectric constant of the aqueous solution, and ɛ0 is the permittivity of free space. As discussed previously (42McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), the zeta potential is proportional to the surface charge density and thus to the number of charged peptides that absorb to the vesicles. A control experiment showed that MARCKS-(151−175) has a similar effect on the zeta potential of 98:2 PC/dipalmitoyl PI(4,5)P2 and 98:2 PC/native bovine brain PI(4,5)P2 MLVs (data not shown). Fig.1 illustrates the effects of MARCKS-(151−175) on the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2. We deposited a mixture of lipids containing [3H]PIP2 at the air-water surface; added MARCKS-(151−175), PLC, and CaCl2 sequentially to the subphase; collected samples of the subphase at the indicated times; and measured the [3H]IP3 to determine the percentage of [3H]PIP2 hydrolyzed as a function of time (Fig. 1). In the absence of MARCKS-(151−175), PLC-δ1 produces rapid hydrolysis of PIP2 following addition of CaCl2 to the subphase (free [Ca2+] ≈ 2 μm); ≈25% of the PIP2 in the monolayer is hydrolyzed in 5 min (open circles in Fig. 1 A). Similar results were reported previously (28Rebecchi M. Boguslavsky V. Boguslavsky L. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12748-12753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Boguslavsky V.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Addition of low concentrations of MARCKS-(151−175) inhibits this hydrolysis; 50 nm MARCKS-(151−175) produces ≈50% inhibition, and 150 nm produces almost complete inhibition (decrease in initial rate of hydrolysis or slope of line in Fig. 1 A). (The measurements were done at a surface pressure of 25 mN/m to minimize the amount of PLC required. Control experiments at π = 30−35 mN/m, at which the area of a lipid in a monolayer corresponds to that of a lipid in a bilayer (see Footnote 2 in Ref. 28Rebecchi M. Boguslavsky V. Boguslavsky L. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12748-12753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), produced qualitatively similar results (data not shown) to the data shown in Fig.1 A.) Fig. 1 B shows that MARCKS-(151−175) also inhibits hydrolysis of PIP2 catalyzed by PLC-β1, a different isoform of PLC; 10 nmMARCKS-(151−175) produces ≈50% inhibition, and 50 nmproduces almost complete inhibition. The monolayer results (Fig. 1) are consistent with those reported previously using phospholipid vesicles if one notes that higher concentrations of peptide were required to produce inhibition in the vesicle experiments because most of the peptide was bound to the vesicles (18Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2048020247,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and more recently mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been associated with the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning. We examined the interplay between these kinases in a characterized model of ischemic preconditioning in cultured rat neonatal ventricular cardiocytes where ectopic expression of active PKC-delta results in protection. Two members of the MAPK family, p38 and p42/44, were activated transiently during preconditioning by brief simulated ischemia/reoxygenation. Overexpression of active PKC-delta, rather than augmenting, completely abolished this activation. We therefore determined whether a similar process occurred during lethal prolonged simulated ischemia. In contrast to ischemia, brief, lethal-simulated ischemia activated only p38 (2.8+/-0.45 vs. basal, P<0.01), which was attenuated by expression of active PKC-delta or by preconditioning (0.48+/-0.1 vs. ischemia, P<0.01). To determine whether reduced p38 activation was the cause or an effect of protection, we used SB203580, a p38 inhibitor. SB203580 reduced ischemic injury (CK release 38.0+/-3.1%, LDH release 77.3+/-4.0%, and MTT bioreduction 127.1+/-4.8% of control, n=20, P<0.05). To determine whether p38 activation was isoform selective, myocytes were infected with adenoviruses encoding wild-type p38alpha or p38beta. Transfected p38alpha and beta show differential activation (P<0.001) during sustained simulated ischemia, with p38alpha remaining activated (1.48+/-0.36 vs. basal) but p38beta deactivated (0.36+/-0.1 vs. basal, P<0.01). Prior preconditioning prevented the activation of p38alpha (0.65+/-0.11 vs. ischemia, P<0.05). Moreover, cells expressing a dominant negative p38alpha, which prevented ischemic p38 activation, were resistant to lethal simulated ischemia (CK release 82.9+/-3.9% and MTT bioreduction 130.2+/-6.5% of control, n=8, P<0.05). Thus, inhibition of p38alpha activation during ischemia reduces injury and may contribute to preconditioning-induced cardioprotection in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2049940876,"H2O2 treatment on U937 cells leads to the block of glycolytic flux and the inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase by a posttranslational modification (possibly ADP-ribosylation). Glycolysis spontaneously reactivates after 2 h of recovery from oxidative stress; thereafter cells begin to undergo apoptosis. The specific ADP-ribosylation inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide inhibits the stress-induced inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase and the block of glycolysis; concomitantly, it anticipates and increases apoptosis. Exogenous block of glycolysis (i.e., by culture in glucose-free medium or with glucose analogs or after NAD depletion), turns the transient block into a stable one: this results in protection from apoptosis, even when downstream cell metabolism is kept active by the addition of pyruvate. All this evidence indicates that the stress-induced block of glycolysis is not the result of a passive oxidative damage, but rather an active cell reaction programmed via ADP-ribosylation for cell self-defense."
https://openalex.org/W2085777790,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal disorder associated with vast accumulation of copper in tissues, is caused by mutations in a gene encoding a copper-transporting ATPase (Wilson's disease protein, WNDP). Numerous mutations have been identified throughout the WNDP sequence, particularly in the Lys1010–Lys1325 segment; however, the biochemical properties and molecular mechanism of WNDP remain poorly characterized. Here, the Lys1010–Lys1325fragment of WNDP was overexpressed, purified, and shown to form an independently folded ATP-binding domain (ATP-BD). ATP-BD binds the fluorescent ATP analogue trinitrophenyl-ATP with high affinity, and ATP competes with trinitrophenyl-ATP for the binding site; ADP and AMP appear to bind to ATP-BD at the site separate from ATP. Purified ATP-BD hydrolyzes ATP and interacts specifically with the N-terminal copper-binding domain of WNDP (N-WNDP). Strikingly, copper binding to N-WNDP diminishes these interactions, suggesting that the copper-dependent change in domain-domain contact may represent the mechanism of WNDP regulation. In agreement with this hypothesis, N-WNDP induces conformational changes in ATP-BD as evidenced by the altered nucleotide binding properties of ATP-BD in the presence of N-WNDP.

Inborn copper deficiency, known as Menkes disease, leads to a dramatic decrease in the activity of these enzymes, causing severe developmental delays, poor temperature control, and defects of connective and vascular tissues. Recent genetic studies linked this disease to various mutations in the ATP7A gene located on the X chromosome (1Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 2Verga V. Hall B.K. Wang S.R. Johnson S. Higgins J.V. Glover T.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 1133-1138PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP7A gene product, or Menkes disease protein, is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, the primary function of which is to export dietary copper from intestinal cells for further delivery to various tissues. Copper overload is as deleterious to cells as copper deficiency, presumably because of the ability of copper to participate in reactions that generate highly reactive oxygen species (3Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Wilson's disease (WD)1 is an autosomal disorder associated with vast accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and kidneys (4Scheinberg I.H. Sternlieb I. Smith Jr., L.H. Wilson's Disease: Major Problems in Internal Medicine. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1984Google Scholar). The disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that encodes another copper-transporting P-type ATPase (5Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Chernov I. Ross B.M. Kaplan J.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol.

The Wilson's disease protein (WNDP) and Menkes disease protein (MNKP) share over 50% sequence similarity and are likely to have similar mechanistic properties (8Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All P-type ATPases can be divided into five major branches based on their substrate specificity (9Axelsen L.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evolution. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). WNDP and MNKP belong to the P1-(CPx) subfamily of the P-type ATPases (10Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). All members of this subfamily utilize energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport either transition or heavy metals across cell membranes, and all have characteristic metal-binding motifs at the N-terminal portion of the molecule (Fig. 1). In contrast, the P2-ATPases are involved in transport of alkali or alkali earth metals and, as a rule, lack the characteristic metal-binding sites at their N termini. Na+,K+-ATPase is a typical representative of the P2-ATPase subfamily with known nucleotide binding properties, and it has been utilized in this study for comparative purposes. Although mechanistic properties of the P2-ATPases are well studied, very few members of the P1-ATPase subfamily have been functionally characterized (12Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P.

ATP-dependent transport has been recently demonstrated for MNKP (16Voskoboinik I. Brooks H. Smith S. Shen P. Camakaris J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but the detailed molecular mechanism for either MNKP or WNDP remains unknown. Location of the copper-binding sites in the N-terminal domain, separately from the ATP-binding region and the transmembrane cation-translocation pathway (Fig. 1), suggests that the ATP-driven copper transport by WNDP and MNKP is likely to involve cooperation between several protein domains. The results obtained in this work substantiate this hypothesis. At present, purification and reconstitution procedures for either MNKP or WNDP are unavailable, severely limiting the detailed analysis of their structure and function. However, the use of recombinant proteins corresponding to the putative functional domains of WNDP and MNKP proved to be very informative. Recently, we and others produced and biochemically characterized the recombinant N-terminal copper-binding domain of both WNDP and MNKP (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T.

The studies revealed that this 70-kDa domain binds copper specifically in vivo and in vitro with stoichiometry of 5.5–6 copper/domain, suggesting that each of the six GMTCXXC motifs present in this domain participate in copper coordination (17Lutsenko S.

Furthermore, it has been shown that copper binds to Cys residues in the GMTCXXC motif as Cu+1 via novel linear coordination (20DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Ralle M. Cooper M.J. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 13525-13526Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Present studies demonstrate that in addition to its copper binding function the N-terminal domain of WNDP may play an important regulatory role. In the case of WNDP and MNKP, analysis of recombinant domains offers another important advantage: it allows us to assess individually their overall folding and functional characteristics. This information is particularly important if one wants to understand how mutations in certain regions of WNDP and MNKP alter their specific properties. A number of the WD-causing mutations have been identified in the Lys1010–Lys1325 region of WNDP (Fig. 1) (22Shah A.B. Chernov I. Zhang H.T. Ross B.M. Das K. Lutsenko S. Parano E. Pavone L.

For only one of them, His1070 → Gln, there is evidence suggesting that the substitution of His for Gln is associated with the WNDP misfolding in a cell (24Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The specific molecular consequences for most of the other mutations are still unknown. Consequently, the ability to analyze folding and functional properties of normal and mutant domains of WNDP would be very valuable. In this paper we describe several biochemical procedures that can be utilized for these purposes. The WNDP segment including the amino acid residues Lys1010–Lys1325 and the homologous region of MNKP were predicted to act as the ATP-binding domains (ATP-BDs) of these proteins. The suggestion was based on the presence in this region of several highly conserved motifs (Fig. 1) previously shown to be involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis in such P2-type ATPases as Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase. At the same time, the overall homology between the corresponding segments of WNDP (P1-ATPase) and Na+,K+-ATPase or Ca2+-ATPase (P2-ATPases) is only 18–23%, suggesting that the specific nucleotide binding properties and the regulatory mechanisms modulating binding of ATP may differ for the P1- and P2-ATPases. Our analysis of the ATP-binding domain of WNDP supports this hypothesis. In this paper, we provide experimental evidence that the recombinant Lys1010–Lys1325 fragment of WNDP forms an independently folded ATP-BD, which has distinct nucleotide binding properties and measurable ATPase activity, that ATP-BD interacts with the N-terminal copper-binding domain (N-WNDP) in a copper-dependent manner, and that the copper-dependent domain-domain interactions induce conformational changes in ATP-BD. These results shed a light on some steps in molecular mechanism of WNDP and highly homologous MNKP. The aN-WND is a polyclonal antibody (Ab) developed against the peptide GMTCASCVHNIE, which corresponds to the sixth metal-binding repeat Gly572–Glu583 in the N-WNDP. The polyclonal Ab a-ABD was raised against the purified recombinant ATP-BD (for cloning and expression of ATP-BD, please see below). The Ab against the His tag was purchased from Qiagen, anti-maltose-binding protein antibodies were obtained from NeoMarkers. The construct encoding the ATP-binding loop of rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit (residues Lys354–Lys774) was kindly provided to us by Dr. C. Gatto (Oregon Health Sciences University). We will further refer to protein produced using this construct as the M4M5 loop. The plasmid encoding the His-tagged C-terminal domain of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (ABC domain) was a gift from J. P. Adelman's laboratory (Vollum Institute). The putative ATP-BD was expressed as a fusion protein with a His tag at the N-terminal portion of the molecule. To generate the expression construct, the segment of the full-length WNDP cDNA encoding the amino acid residues Lys1010–Lys1325 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers WD-ATP-fwd, 5′-GAATTCCATATGAAGGGAGGCAAG-3′, and WD-ATP-Rew, 5′-GAATTCCATATGCTAGCGTATCCTTCGGAC-3′. The procedure also created theNdeI sites that were used to clone the polymerase chain reaction product into the PET-28b vector (Novagen). (The lack of unwanted mutations in the obtained construct was verified by automatic DNA sequencing.) The construct was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells; the protein expression was induced by treatment of cells with either 0.1 mm IPTG (for purification from soluble cell fraction) or 1 mm IPTG (for purification from inclusion bodies) for 1 h at room temperature. E. coli cells were resuspended in lysis buffer prepared by dissolving 1 Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris, 500 mmNaCl, pH 7.5, and then lysed by passing twice through the French press (American Instrument Co.) at 20,000 p.s.i. To decrease viscosity, lysate was additionally passed two times by syringe through a medium gauge needle. Soluble proteins were separated from the insoluble fraction following centrifugation of the lysate at 30,000 ×g for 20 min. To analyze the distribution of ATP-BD between soluble and insoluble fractions, insoluble protein was resuspended in the lysis buffer to the same volume as soluble protein. Identical aliquots were taken from both fractions and separated by 10% Laemmli gel, and then proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane as described (25Noll M. Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21393-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The amount of ATP-BD in each fraction was determined by staining of the blot with the a-ABD Ab (dilution 1:20,000) followed by densitometry of immunostained bands. The solubility of ATP-BD depended on the level of expression. Following induction with 1 mmIPTG, almost all ATP-BD was quickly deposited into the inclusion bodies. When protein expression was significantly lowered by changing the IPTG concentration from 1.0 to 0.1 mm, the overall amount of produced ATP-BD decreased greatly, but proportionally more protein was found in the soluble fraction. Analysis of the distribution of ATP-BD revealed that at 0.1 mm IPTG ∼20% of the produced ATP-BD was soluble, and only this protein was used for characterization of its functional properties. The expression of the M4M5 loop and the ABC domain and preparation of soluble fractions containing these proteins were carried out as described below for ATP-BD. Purification of the His6-tagged proteins (ATP-BD, M4M5 loop, and ABC domain) by Ni2+ affinity chromatography was carried out at room temperature except where indicated. The soluble fraction of lysate was loaded on Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen); the amount of Ni-NTA-agarose to be used was determined based on the expected yield of purified protein (200 μl slurry/mg for M4M5 loop, 1 ml/mg for ATP-BD). Imidazole was added to the lysate to 50 mm prior to binding. Following a 1-h incubation of the lysate with constant agitation, the resin was applied on a column and washed with at least 30 volumes of wash buffer (50 mmimidazole, 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The target proteins were then eluted in several fractions of elution buffer (200 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). 0.5–2.0 μg of protein were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and protein purity was ascertained by Coomassie staining. For analysis of folding and nucleotide binding properties, the protein was dialyzed twice against 50 mmMOPS pH 7.5 buffer containing either 150 or 500 mmNaCl. The recombinant N-terminal domain of WND tagged to the maltose-binding protein (N-WND-MBP) in its copper-bound and copper-free form was overexpressed and purified as described previously (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The recombinant 42-kDa maltose-binding protein (MBP) was generated using the pMal-c vector (New England BioLabs) and purified using the same protocol (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The ATP-BD folding was analyzed by using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The measurements were performed on a model PTI-QM1 (Photon Technology International) fluorimeter. Emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 405 nm (bandwidth, 2 nm) with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm (bandwidth, 3 nm) for 1.25 μm ATP-BD solution in 50 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl in the absence or presence of 6m guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). The solution ofl-tryptophan in the above buffer at concentration similar to concentration of ATP-BD was used in these experiments as a standard. For experiments in which the effect of nucleotides on the Trp fluorescence was tested, the excitation was set at 295 nm, emission was set at 345 nm, and 800 μl of the same protein solution was titrated with 2-μl aliquots of ATP or AMP to obtain final concentration ranging from 0 to 800 μm. Identical aliquots of buffer were added to control sample to account for a change in the fluorescence because of dilution; the final increase in volume was less than 2%. Fluorescence changes upon binding of TNP-ATP to ATP-BD or the M4M5 loop were measured at room temperature in transparent polystyrene 96-well plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson) using a FLUOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies Inc.). The excitation was set at 390 nm, and the emission was recorded at 538 nm. The reaction was carried out in 50 mm MOPS pH 7.5 buffer containing various NaCl concentration (20–500 mm). The 1-μl aliquots of the TNP-ATP stock solution were added to 100 μl of a 5 μm protein solution for final concentrations ranging from 0 to 40 μm. (The increase in the reaction volume did not exceed 10% and was taken into account.) To determine the background fluorescence, identical TNP-ATP titrations were made in 50 mm MOPS pH 7.5 buffer containing 20–500 mm NaCl. The apparent binding affinities of ATP-BD and M4M5 loop for TNP-ATP were determined after subtracting the background TNP-ATP fluorescence using SigmaPlot software package. For most experiments, NaCl concentration was kept at 20 mm, because both the TNP-ATP affinity and the fluorescence increase upon TNP-ATP binding to ATP-BD were higher at lower salt concentrations. (For example, the K a for TNP-ATP at 20 mmNaCl was 1.89 ± 0.72 μm, whereas at 500 mm the K a was 6.3 μm ± 1.5.) These differences in the TNP-ATP binding parameters are likely to reflect small changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket, because changes in NaCl concentrations do not have noticeable effect on overall protein folding as evidenced by the Trp fluorescence spectra. 2R. Tsivkovskii, B. C. MacArthur, and S. Lutsenko, unpublished data. The effect of N-WNDP on TNP-ATP binding was analyzed as described above using equimolar amounts of ATP-BD and either copper-free or copper-bound N-WNDP in 50 mm MOPS, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer. The background TNP-ATP binding to N-WNDP was similar for copper-free and copper-bound proteins and was subtracted. The displacement of TNP-ATP by nucleotides was analyzed using PTI-QM1 fluorimeter with excitation set at 410 nm and emission set at 545 nm. For these experiments, TNP-ATP at 0.5 μm was mixed with 2.5 μm protein solution in 50 mm MOPS pH 7.5 buffer, containing 500 or 20 mm NaCl and then titrated with ATP, with AMP (0–800 μm) or with the same volumes of buffer as a control. The protein fluorescence before TNP-ATP addition served as a background and was subtracted. The ATPase Activity of ATP-BD was measured using the EnzChek™ Phosphate Assay (Molecular Probes). In this assay, inorganic phosphate released during ATP-hydrolysis is utilized by purine nucleoside phosphorylase to convert the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7 methylpurine riboside to ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine. This leads to a shift in maximum absorbance from 330 nm for the substrate to 360 nm for the product that can be monitored spectrophotometrically. For the ATPase measurements, the purified ATP-BD was dialyzed against the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and then incubated in 10–20 μl of volume with 1 mm ATP at protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by transferring samples on ice, and the amount of released phosphate was determined using the Molecular Probes protocol. The control His tag protein corresponding to the fragment of the WNDP copper-binding domain was expressed in the same strain of cells as ATP-BD and then purified under identical conditions. The elution fractions containing this protein or just buffer were used as negative controls. The domain-domain interactions were evaluated by an optimized quantitative copurification procedure. In preparation for the interaction experiment, a preliminary purification of ATP-BD and the control His tag proteins was carried out to determine the relative molar concentrations of the target proteins in their respective lysates. The amount of each His-tagged protein was quantified by densitometry of the Coomassie-stained gel using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amount of ATP-BD in the soluble portion of the lysate was lower than that of the M4M5 loop and the ABC protein, consequently the soluble lysate from the nontransformed BL21 cells was used to dilute the M4M5 loop and ABC lysates appropriately and bring the concentration of all His tag proteins to the same molar concentration. Miniature affinity chromatography columns were constructed using glass wool, standard 1-ml pipette tips, and 5 μl of Qiagen Ni-NTA agarose resin. The equal amounts of the primary His tag proteins (ATP-BD, M4M5 loop, and ABC) or lysate from nontransformed BL21 were incubated with the Ni-NTA resin. The resin was washed as described in the purification procedure above, and then the secondary proteins (NWND-MBP − Cu, NWND-MBP + Cu, or MBP) were run over the columns. After two additional wash steps with 200 bed volumes of buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in 200 mm imidazole. The presence of proteins in the elution fractions was detected by Western blotting using the appropriate Ab. The anti-MBP Ab was used at a 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 dilution, the a-ABD and a-N-WND were used at 1:20,000 dilution, and protein bands were visualized using Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescence procedure. For domain-domain interaction assay on amylose resin, cells expressing N-WNDP with or without copper (for expression conditions see Ref. 17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) from a 1-liter culture were lysed in 40 ml of PB buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) + 1 tablet of complete protease inhibitor using French press. After clearing lysate by centrifugation aliquots were purified as described (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to determine the amount of lysates needed to obtain identical quantities of copper-free and copper-bound N-WNDP. The level of expression, solubility, and the yield of copper-free and copper-bound N-WNDP were very similar; therefore, similar amount of cell lysates have been used for the interaction experiments. Usually, 50 μl of amylose resin slurry (1:1) was added to 150 μl of lysate diluted till 500 μl with PB buffer, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional stirring. Then resin was washed three times with 500 μl of PB buffer and once with 500 μl of TB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl). Next, 1 μg of ATP-BD in 100 μl of TB buffer was added to the resin and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The unbound ATP-BD was removed, and the resin was washed twice with 500 μl of TB buffer. Finally, all proteins were eluted from the resin with 60 μl of PB buffer containing 10 mm maltose. The elution fractions were analyzed for the presence of N-WND or ATP-BD by immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. To test the effect of N-WND on the nucleotide binding properties of ATP-BD, TNP-ATP at 0.5 μm was mixed with 2.5 μm ATP-BD solution in 50 mm MOPS, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer and then 2.5 μm of either copper-free or copper-bound N-WND-MBP was added to the mixture. The mixture was then titrated with ATP, AMP (0–800 μm) or with the same volumes of buffer as a control using PTI-QM1 fluorimeter with excitation set at 410 nm and emission set at 545 nm. The protein fluorescence before TNP-ATP addition served as a background and was subtracted. The recombinant Lys1010–Lys1325 fragment, corresponding to the putative ATP-BD of WNDP, was produced in E. coli as a His tag fusion protein following induction of protein expression with IPTG (Fig. 2 A). The calculated molecular mass of the ATP-BD His tag fusion, 38 kDa, agreed well with the molecular weight of the expressed protein (Fig. 2). Soluble ATP-BD was purified to about 95% of homogeneity (Fig. 2 B), and the yield of purified protein (200–500 μg from 1 liter of the cell culture), although limited, was sufficient to determine the major functional characteristics of this putative ATP-binding fragment. ATP-BD has a single Trp residue at the position corresponding to Trp1154 of the full-length WNDP (Fig. 1). In general, Trp fluorescence is very sensitive to local environment, a property that can be utilized to monitor protein folding or protein interactions with ligands. To determine whether the purified ATP-BD is folded, the local environment around the Trp1154 residue was examined by comparing the steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum of ATP-BD with the spectrum of free l-tryptophan present at the same molar concentration. As shown in Fig.3, the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) for ATP-BD is 330 nm in contrast to λmax for free l-Trp (348 nm), indicating that the purified ATP-BD is folded and that the tryptophan residue in folded ATP-BD is buried. In agreement with this conclusion, unfolding of ATP-BD with 6 m GuHCl is accompanied by a shift of λmax to 348 nm, which is identical to the maximum of the solvent-exposed tryptophan (Fig. 3). Overall, ATP-BD is relatively resistant to treatment with denaturing reagents: at least 2.0m GuHCl was required to observe some red shift in the λmax, and in the presence of 6 m GuHCl the maximum was fully shifted to 348 nm. Additions of ATP or AMP up to 800 μm produced no modifications in the intensity or position of the λmax for Trp fluorescence, suggesting a lack of changes in the Trp environment (data not shown). To determine whether the recombinant Lys1010–Lys1325 fragment binds nucleotides, an ATP analogue, TNP-ATP, was utilized. TNP-ATP is often employed for characterization of the ATP-binding proteins because of its unique fluorescent properties. TNP-ATP in solution is weakly fluorescent, but upon binding to proteins its fluorescence enhances substantially (27Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2087496358,"Recent observations support the importance of ceramide synthesis de novo in the induction of apoptosis. However, the downstream targets of de novo-synthesized ceramide are unknown. Here we show that palmitate incorporated into ceramide and induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in astrocytes. These effects of palmitate were exacerbated when fatty acid breakdown was uncoupled and were not evident in neurons, which show a very low capacity to take up and metabolize palmitate. Palmitate-induced apoptosis of astrocytes was prevented by L-cycloserine and fumonisin B1, two inhibitors of ceramide synthesis de novo, and by PD098059, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Accordingly, palmitate activated ERK by a process that was dependent on ceramide synthesis de novo and Raf-1, but independent of kinase suppressor of Ras. Other potential targets of ceramide in the control of cell fate, namely, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase B, were not significantly affected in astrocytes exposed to palmitate. Results show that the Raf-1/ERK cascade is the selective downstream target of de novo-synthesized ceramide in the induction of apoptosis in astrocytes and also highlight the importance of ceramide synthesis de novo in apoptosis of astrocytes, which might have pathophysiological relevance."

Several models for electron transfer have been discussed, including a shuttle model in which Adx forms consecutive 1:1 complexes (4Lambeth J.D. Seybert D.W. Lancaster J.R. Salerno J.C. Kamin H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 45: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with AR and cytochrome P450scc and models requiring the formation of an organized 1:1:1 ternary complex (5Kido T. Kimura T.

Common to these models is a complex between AR and Adx during the first steps of electron transfer from the reductase to the cytochrome P450. Recently, the crystal structures of two forms of bovine adrenodoxin (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U.

Biol. 1999; 289: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were determined. These structures revealed the general topology of the two proteins and the molecular environments of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Adx and the FAD moiety of AR. Here, we report the 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of a cross-linked 1:1 complex of full-length Adx and AR. This structure shows the geometry of an electron transfer complex of soluble, freely dissociable proteins from a higher eukaryote for the first time, highlights structural adaptations that accompany the binding of AR to Adx, and permits us to predict electron transport paths in their complex. Recombinant bovine Adx and AR were purified and crystallized as described (10Lapko A. Müller A. Heese O. Ruckpaul K. Heinemann U. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The synthesized Adx differs from the wild-type protein by the exchange of Ser1for glycine and is composed of 128 amino acids, including the N- and C-terminal residues missing in the truncated adrenodoxin, Adx-(4–108), studied earlier (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of AR to Adx has also been described (11Hara T. Kimura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Hara T. Miyata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The native complex is formed at low ionic strength between the two proteins, and the cross-linking was carried out with the water-soluble coupling reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC, purchased from Sigma). The mixture of Adx (1.2 μmol) and AR (300 nmol) was dialyzed for 18–20 h against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, followed by addition of an equal volume of fresh 8 mm EDC solution in distilled water and incubation at 4 °C in the dark with occasional stirring. After 8 h, excess of the reagent was removed on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The colored fraction was pooled and applied on a 2.4 × 10 cm DEAE-Fractogel column and washed with two gradient solutions as follows: 10–50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 3 h; 50–100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 3 h. The peak containing the covalent cross-linked complex of the recombinant Adx and AR was consequently purified on an AD-Sepharose column to remove residual AR and on an ADP-Sepharose column to remove unbound Adx. The cross-linking of AR to Adx with EDC was expected (11Hara T. Kimura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,12Hara T. Miyata T. J. Biochem.

Four x-ray diffraction data sets from three crystals were collected at 100 K on MAR345 imaging plates at beam lines BW7B (EMBL Outstation at DESY, Hamburg) and BW6 (MPG-ASMB, c/o DESY).

Open table in a new tab The structure of the AR·Adx complex was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of AR and Adx-(4–108) as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1cjc and 1ayf). Two complexes per asymmetric unit with a molecular mass of 64,927 Da each were assembled by placing the protein molecules into the unit cell using AMORE (14Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) and rigid-body refinement with the program CNS (15Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S.

Application of a solvent mask, positional and atomic temperature factor refinement, several rounds of manual density fitting, and the addition of 5 sulfate ions and 277 water molecules reduced R to 0.223 and R free to 0.268 (Table I). 1132 residues out of 1176 could be localized within the electron density. Almost all modeled water positions are also occupied in the crystal structures of Adx-(4–108) (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and AR (9Ziegler G.A. Vonrhein C. Hanukoglu I. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The averaged main chain and side chain parameters are equal or better than those in a set of 118 structures used by PROCHECK (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the Ramachandran diagram is free of outliers. The hexagonal crystals used in this analysis are formed by cross-linked 1:1 complexes between AR and Adx, both in their oxidized form. Two complexes related by a noncrystallographic screw rotation are present in the asymmetric unit. Complex I contains residues 5–117 of Adx and 4–460 of AR, and complex II contains residues 5–110 of Adx and 5–460 of AR. Electron density for both complexes clearly reveals the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Adx and the FAD moiety of AR. As in the crystal structure of the free protein (9Ziegler G.A. Vonrhein C. Hanukoglu I. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), no NADP is bound to AR. With the exception of a small domain rearrangement in AR (see below), protein conformation in these independent copies of the complex is generally similar allowing least squares superpositions of the Adx Cα atoms with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.46 Å and of the AR Cα positions with a r.m.s.d. of 0.95 Å. The description of the crystal structure of the AR·Adx complex will focus on complex I, where the C terminus of Adx is ordered up to Ser117, revealing a number of residues neither observed in the structure of Adx-(4–108) (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) nor in that of full-length Adx (8Pikuleva I. Tesh K. Waterman M.R. Kim Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By fitting the globular Adx molecule into a prominent depression on the AR surface, a compact AR·Adx complex is formed (Fig.1). A total of 580 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface are buried between the protein molecules. This AR-Adx interface contains many polar residues. In the complex, Adx contacts both AR domains. In a primary interaction region, polar contacts are formed between residues of the NADP domain of AR and the Adx side chains belonging to the interaction domain (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) of the protein. Further polar interactions take place in a secondary interaction region where the core domain (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) of Adx contacts the FAD domain of AR and the covalent cross-link is formed linking Adx Asp39 with AR Lys27. In a third interaction region, the C-terminal polypeptide stretch of Adx dips into a deep cleft between the two globular domains of AR. Adx residues Asp113 to Arg115 of this region adopt 310-helical conformation. This contact is assumed to be rather loose, since the C-terminal residues of Adx adopt high atomic displacement factors up to 80 Å2 indicating flexibility, and the interaction is not observed in complex II of the crystal where no electron density is seen beyond Ala110 of Adx. Finally, further hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions are observed between residues bridging the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Adx and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD of AR. Two electron density peaks near the AR N terminus were assigned as sulfate ions. Since AR is a membrane-associated protein (18Hanukoglu I.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 779-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 19Ishimura K. Fujita H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 36: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that these sulfate positions mark interaction sites of AR with phospholipids in the membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observed arrangement of hydrophobic (e.g.Trp420) and basic residues (Arg31, Arg70, Arg73, Lys411, Lys429, and Arg456) around the sulfate ions that might interact with lipid or phosphate moieties of the membrane. Both Adx and AR are two-domain proteins. Adx consists of a core domain containing the [2Fe-2S] cluster and a small interaction domain (7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and AR contains a FAD domain and a NADP domain of about equal size (9Ziegler G.A. Vonrhein C. Hanukoglu I. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whereas no significant difference between Adx-(4–108) and Adx as present in the complex is detected, the two AR domains show a slightly different orientation with respect to each other when the complex is compared with free AR (Fig. 2). After superposition of the FAD domains of AR (r.m.s.d. = 0.38 Å), optimal fit of the NADP domains requires a 3.7° rotation (7.2° for complex II). Considering Arg240 and Lys27 of AR as reference contact points with Adx (see below), this domain reorientation results in a narrowing of the distance between these two anchor points by 2.4 Å (4.2 Å in complex II). AR thus has the ability to adapt to the Adx molecule in the binary complex by domain reorientation to various degrees. The AR·Adx complex displays a highly charged surface (Fig.3, top) arising from interacting surfaces that are predominantly acidic (Adx) or basic (AR). Of the 580 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface buried in the complex, 325 Å2 are from hydrophobic side chains. Nearly half of the AR-Adx interface is composed of polar and charged residues engaging in a large number of hydrogen bonds and salt links. Hence, electrostatic interactions may be considered the primary driving force for complex formation in agreement with chemical modification (21Lambeth J.D. Geren L.M. Millet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10025-10029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis experiments (1Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 137-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8932-8935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17126-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of AR and Adx. Electrostatic interactions predominate in the two main interaction sites of the AR·Adx complex. In the primary interaction region (Fig.3, bottom left), arginines 211, 240, and 244 of the NADP domain of AR are involved in numerous salt bridges with Adx carboxylate groups. Aspartates 72, 76, and 79 of the Adx interaction domain are binding partners to AR, whereas the acidic residues Glu73 and Glu74 of Adx are facing away from the interface. The electron density provides no evidence for a covalent cross-link formed at this interaction site. Acidic Adx residues located at the primary AR-Adx interaction region are known also to be involved in cytochrome P450scc binding (1Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 137-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the participation of several of these side chains in contacts to AR, the formation of an organized 1:1:1 complex between AR, Adx, and cytochrome P450scc for electron transport during steroid biosynthesis must be regarded as very unlikely. A secondary interaction region is centered around the Adx residues Asp39 and Asp41 contacting His28and Lys27 of AR, respectively (Fig. 3, bottom right). Again, these contacts are polar and are mainly formed by charged side chains. Asp39 and Asp41are located in the core domain of Adx at a surface region that has been implicated in cytochrome P450cam (CYP101) binding by the homologous putida redoxin (27Pochapsky T.C. Lyons T.A. Kazanis S. Arakaki T. Ratnaswamy G. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). An involvement of Asp39 in redox-partner binding has been suggested earlier (28Müller J.J. Müller A. Rottmann M. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) based on a comparison of the Adx structure with crystal structures of plant-type ferredoxins (29Hurley J.K. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Benning M.M. Thoden J.B. Vanhooke J.L. Holden H.M. Chae Y.K. Xia B. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Martinez-Julvez M. Gomez-Moreno C. Schmeits J.L. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11100-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Covalent cross-linking of Adx and AR with carbodiimide prior to crystallization results in the formation of a peptide bond between the carboxylate function of Asp39 and the primary amino group of Lys27 as clearly revealed by electron density (see Fig.3, bottom right). This finding is unexpected, since the cross-linking procedure employed was reported (11Hara T. Kimura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Hara T. Miyata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to yield a covalent bond linking AR Glu4 and Adx Lys66. Peptide sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis prove that the Glu4-Lys66 cross-link is indeed not formed in the AR·Adx complex. 2E.-Ch. Müller, A. Lapko, A. Otto, J. J. Müller, K. Ruckpaul, and U. Heinemann, unpublished results. The suggested Glu4–Lys66 cross-link is incompatible with the binding mode to AR of Adx reported here. It does not permit contacts between the proteins in the primary interaction region as supported by mutagenesis experiments (1Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 137-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8932-8935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17126-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and renders unlikely a close enough approach of the redox centers for electron transfer. For these reasons we are convinced that the reported complex, and not a complex cross-linked at AR Glu4/Adx Lys66, represents the functional interaction between AR and Adx. Efficient electron transfer between the redox centers requires spatial proximity. The closest approach of atoms belonging to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Adx and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD of AR is 10.3 Å (9.65 Å in complex II), well within the 14-Å threshold reported to define the limit of electron tunneling in a protein medium (30Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). The fractional packing density of protein groups between the redox centers is 0.61 (0.73 in complex II), again within the observed range of densities found in natural multiredox center oxidoreductases of known structure (30Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Thus, from proximity and packing density considerations alone, one may conclude that the geometry of the AR·Adx complex will support electron tunneling between the redox centers. The observed geometry is calculated by ETUNNEL (30Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) to support electron transfer rates of 108 to 109 s−1. This is orders of magnitude above the experimentally determined (4Lambeth J.D. Seybert D.W. Lancaster J.R. Salerno J.C. Kamin H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 45: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) flavin-to-iron transfer rate of 3–4 s−1. By assuming that the covalent cross-link does not force an unnaturally tight AR-Adx interaction, it may thus be concluded that the rate of the redox reaction in which AR and Adx are involved is not limited by electron transfer within the AR·Adx complex. The program HARLEM, analyzing distinct protein structures with respect to tunneling probabilities (31Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), was further used to compute possible electron transfer routes between AR and Adx (Fig.4). According to this analysis, electrons would most likely travel along covalent bonds, requiring two through-space jumps from the FAD isoalloxazine to AR Ile376and from AR Thr377 to Adx Cys52, one of the [2Fe-2S] ligands. However, alternative transfer paths and a possible involvement of water molecules located at the interface region cannot be ruled out. In summary, the 2.3-Å crystal structure of the AR·Adx redox complex suggests modes of electron transfer between a soluble [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin and its cognate reductase. It reveals the importance of electrostatic interactions in complex formation, in agreement with the concept of “electrostatic steering” (1Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 137-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and demonstrates that a slight domain rearrangement in AR is required for a tight AR-Adx interaction.

Bernhardt (Universität des Saarlandes) for numerous helpful discussions. We thank also D. N. Beratan for the electron pathway calculation program HARLEM."
https://openalex.org/W1972073608,"The effective regulation of T cell responses is dependent on opposing signals transmitted through two related cell-surface receptors, CD28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Dimerization of CTLA-4 is required for the formation of high-avidity complexes with B7 ligands and for transmission of signals that attenuate T cell activation. We determined the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of CTLA-4 to 2.0 angstrom resolution. CTLA-4 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and displays a strand topology similar to Valpha domains, with an unusual mode of dimerization that places the B7 binding sites distal to the dimerization interface. This organization allows each CTLA-4 dimer to bind two bivalent B7 molecules and suggests that a periodic arrangement of these components within the immunological synapse may contribute to the regulation of T cell responsiveness."

While mutations in many muscle genes are known to be responsible for various forms of muscular dystrophy, the most common form is caused by mutations in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene that encodes dystrophin (1Hoffman E.P.

BIOS Scientific, Oxford1997: 219-241Google Scholar). Dystrophin is a large, actin-binding protein that is pivotal in assembling a complex of membrane-associated and cytoplasmic proteins, which make up the dystrophin protein complex (DPC)1 (4Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The DPC can be divided into three subcomplexes: the transmembrane dystroglycan complex, the membrane-spanning sarcoglycan complex, and the α-dystrobrevin-syntrophin cytoplasmic complex (5Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 6Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Yamamoto H. Noguchi S. Mizuno Y. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). All of these subcomplexes are thought to act in concert to provide a link between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton (7Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) and thereby provide mechanical support to the muscle membrane (8Menke A. Jockusch H.

While α-dystrobrevin-1 and -2 contain dystrophin and syntrophin binding sites, α-dystrobrevin-3 lacks both of these sites (19Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact function of the individual isoforms remains unclear, but the recent characterization of the α-dystrobrevin knock-out mouse has shed new light on the combined functions of these proteins in skeletal muscle. α-Dystrobrevin-deficient mice have neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities (20Grady R.M. Zhou H. Cunningham J.M. Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2000; 25: 279-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). While NMJs form normally, the postsynaptic apparatus matures abnormally, resulting in destabilized acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters and altered synaptic morphology. α-Dystrobrevin-deficient mice also develop mild muscular dystrophy, similar to that of the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse (21Grady R.M.

Unlike the mdx mouse, however, where the loss of dystrophin results in the loss of other components of the DPC at the sarcolemma (22Ohlendieck K. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), loss of α-dystrobrevin results in neither the perturbation of the DPC nor the disruption of the structural integrity of the muscle membrane (21Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This result implies that other mechanisms, including aberrant cell signal transduction, are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy (21Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 23Bredt D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the α-dystrobrevins have both a structural role at the NMJ and a signaling role in muscle. To further dissect these roles of α-dystrobrevin in skeletal muscle, we have screened for new interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we describe the interaction between α-dystrobrevin and a novel member of the intermediate filament superfamily, which we have named syncoilin. Syncoilin is concentrated at the NMJ of normal skeletal muscle, where it colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with α-dystrobrevin-1. This interaction is likely to be important in maintaining the integrity of the NMJ in normal muscle and provides a link between the DPC and the intermediate filament cytoskeletal network. The H2K myoblast cell line was used to generate a cDNA library for yeast two-hybrid screening (24Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 25Morgan J.E. Beauchamp J.R. Pagel C.N. Peckham M. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Farmer K. Partridge T.A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, H2K myoblasts were differentiated for 6 days into myotubes prior to harvest and generation of poly(A)+ RNA using the Fast Track 2.0 system (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated using methods described in Ref.15Blake D.J.

BstXI/EcoRI adaptors were ligated onto the cDNA ends and subsequently cloned into the BstXI sites of the yeast expression vector pYESTrp2 (Invitrogen). This fuses the cDNAs with the B42 activation domain. The cDNA library was then transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coliXL-1Blue, and purified plasmid DNA was extracted directly from the plated library. The entire α-dystrobrevin-2 coding sequence including the muscle-expressed variable region-3 (vr3) sequence was PCR-amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-GTGAATTCAGAATGATTGAAGATAGTGGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CACTCGAGTGTTAGTTAAGACCTGCAGTA-3′. The amplified PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the yeast bait vector pHybLex/Zeo to generate αDB2:pHybLex. This placed the α-dystrobrevin-2 sequence in frame with the DNA binding domain of the LexA transcriptional activator. A bait strain was created by transforming αDB2:pHybLex into Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain L40 as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Hybrid Hunter; Invitrogen). The bait strain was cotransformed with the H2K cDNA library, and transformants were plated onto minimal yeast medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, uracil and lysine, containing 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 5 mm3-aminotriazole. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days, and yeast colonies that grew on histidine-deficient medium were restreaked onto fresh selective plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as per the manufacturer's instructions. Prey plasmids were isolated from yeast and electroporated into E. coli XL-1Blue electrocompetent cells (Stratagene). The 5′-end of each clone was sequenced using a vector primer. To confirm the interaction in yeast, purified prey plasmids were retransformed with the αDB2:pHybLex bait and with the empty bait vector pHybLex/Zeo and tested for growth on selective plates and β-galactosidase activity. Other control yeast strains used were the positive control strain containing pHybLex/Zeo-FOS2 and pYESTrp-Jun plasmids (Invitrogen) and the negative control containing the empty bait and prey vectors pHybLex/Zeo and pYESTrp2. The H2K cDNA library was plated onto Hybond-N membranes (1 × 106 colonies) and screened by hybridization with the 32P-labeled 5′EcoRI/BamHI fragment of the SNIP4 cDNA clone (see below). Hybridizing clones were isolated, purified, and sequenced using standard methods. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with the entire32P-labeled SNIP4 sequence, generated by anEcoRI digest. The membrane was hybridized overnight and then washed to a stringency of 0.25× SSC (37.5 mm NaCl, 3.75 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C and exposed overnight to film. The entire open reading frame of syncoilin was produced as a thioredoxin fusion protein by subcloning the 1.8-kbEcoRI insert from the SNIP4 cDNA clone into theEcoRI site of pET32c (Novagen). This construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold (Stratagene), and SYNC-trx fusion protein synthesis was induced by overnight growth. SYNC-trx was purified under denaturing conditions using the Talon resin (CLONTECH) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protein was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits using standard protocols. Affinity purification of the SYNC-FP antiserum was performed by coupling the SYNC-trx fusion protein to SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted SYNC-FP antibodies were further preabsorbed against purified thioredoxin coupled to SulfoLink. Affinity-purified and preabsorbed SYNC-FP antiserum was used in all subsequent applications. The specificity of this antibody was determined by preabsorption of SYNC-FP antiserum diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with a 1 mm concentration of the immunizing fusion protein SYNC-trx for 1 h at room temperature. The preabsorbed serum was used to label skeletal muscle quadricep sections as described below.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2715-2724PubMed Google Scholar). The 9E10 monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA). The MANDRA1 anti-dystrophin monoclonal antibody was kindly supplied by Prof. Glenn Morris (30Nguyen T.M. Ginjaar I.B. van Ommen G.J. Morris G.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence studies, rhodamine Red-X-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and Alexa 488 α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) were used. For Western blot analysis, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used. The syncoilin expression construct sync:pCIneo was made by cloning the entire SNIP4 cDNA as an EcoRI fragment into theEcoRI site of pCI-neo (Promega). The Myc-tagged α-dystrobrevin-1 and -2 expression constructs containing the muscle-specific vr3 sequence were generated by digesting the cDNA clones m24 (murine α-dystrobrevin-1 (15Blake D.J.

The vr3 sequence was generated by PCR on reverse-transcribed first strand cDNAs from skeletal muscle and inserted using the restriction enzymesBsu361 and ClaI into the appropriate region of m24 and m32, replacing the Bsu361/ClaI fragment without the vr3 sequence with the vr3-containing sequence. The modified cDNA clones were excised by SpeI–NotI digestion and inserted in the sense orientation into pCI-neo cut withNheI and NotI. The constructs pDp116 (encoding rat Dp116) and β2syn:pCIneo (encoding β2-syntrophin) are described elsewhere. 2M. A. Benson, S. E. Newey, E. Martin-Rendon, R. Hawkes, and D. J. Blake, manuscript in preparation. All expression constructs were prepared in E. coli XL-1Blue and purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Maxikit ready for transfection. 24 h prior to transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded onto coverslips in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well or 2 × 106 cells/15-cm dish. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well or 15 μg of DNA/dish using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells on coverslips were washed twice in PBS, fixed in ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min prior to being processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described below. Cells plated on dishes were washed three times in PBS prior to being processed for immunoprecipitation analysis. Transfected COS-7 cells, H2K myotubes, and flash-frozen mouse skeletal muscle were homogenized in solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Homogenates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, 1–2 mg of soluble protein in a total volume of 1 ml was precleared with 100 μl of anti-rabbit Magnabind beads (Pierce) on a blood mill for 2 h. After removal of the beads using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal), the following antibodies were added and incubated overnight: SYNC-FP (5 μl), α1CT-FP (4 μl), βCT-FP (8 μl), 2166 (5 μl), 2045 (8 μl), and URD40 (10 μl). Control experiments without antibody were set up in parallel. Immune complexes were captured by the addition of anti-rabbit Magnabind beads overnight. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer and eluted in 60 μl of SDS/urea buffer (75 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.8% (w/v) SDS, 4m urea, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and analyzed by Western blotting. Skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and brain were dissected from a normal adult C57 BL/10 mouse, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently homogenized separately in 8 ml of SDS/urea buffer. In addition, skeletal muscle extracts were prepared from five different strains of mice: a C57 normal mouse, a dystrophin-deficientmdx mouse, a utrophin-deficient (utrn−/−) mouse (31Deconinck A.E. Potter A.C. Tinsley J.M. Wood S.J. Vater R. Young C. Metzinger L. Vincent A. Slater C.R. Davies K.E. J.

Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and the tissue treated as above. These mice were all ∼10 weeks old. 25 μg of total protein or 10 μl of each immunoprecipitation experiment was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). After blocking the membranes for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated for 1 h with the following primary antibodies: SYNC-FP (1:500), α1CT-FP (1:1000), βCT-FP (1:250), URD40 (1:250), and 2166 (1:500). Membranes were washed twice in TBS-T and once in blocking buffer prior to incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed extensively in TBS-T and were developed using the BM chemiluminescence substrate system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The Seescan Optical Density System was used to measure the optical density of bands obtained on exposed film. The mean optical density was measured for each band by drawing a standardized box around the band. This value was normalized by subtracting the mean background optical density measured immediately above and below the band. 8-μm cryosections of adult skeletal muscle from normal C57 BL/10 and mdx mice were prepared as described previously (31Deconinck A.E. Potter A.C. Tinsley J.M. Wood S.J. Vater R. Young C. Metzinger L. Vincent A. Slater C.R. Davies K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Sections and transfected COS-7 cells were blocked in 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum PBS for 30 min at room temperature prior to incubation with the primary antibodies. The following antibodies were diluted in PBS: SYNC-FP (1:200), α1CT-FP (1:500), α2-PEP (1:50), α-PAN (1:100), 9E10 (1:200), MANDRA1 (1:200), 2045 (1:200). They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following two 5-min PBS washes, the secondary antibodies (1:200) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies applied to muscle sections also included α-bungarotoxin (1:500). Sections and cells were washed twice in PBS, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and viewed under a Leica DMRE microscope. Photographs were taken with a Leica DMLD camera. The T31 Mouse-Hamster Radiation Hybrid Mapping Panel (Research Genetics) (34Flaherty L. Herron B. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was screened to determine mouse chromosomal localization of the syncoilin gene. The forward primer (5′-ATGAGAAGCCAGCACTGACA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TCGGTGTTGGGAATCGGTTGA-3′) were designed against the SNIP4 cDNA sequence and resulted in a PCR product of 816 base pairs. Ninety-three cell lines were analyzed and scored based on the presence or absence of a PCR product. Data were submitted to the Jackson Laboratory Mapping Panel (available on the World Wide Web) for multipoint analysis. The human chromosomal localization of the syncoilin gene was determined using the G3 Human-Hamster Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics). Eighty-three cell lines were screened by PCR using the forward primer (5′-ATCCATGAGCTTGTATTGCTC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-ACTGGGCAGAGAGTCGC-3′). These primers were designed against the corresponding human sequence (GenBankTM accession numberAL138800) and gave a PCR product of 393 base pairs. Data were submitted to the Stanford Human Genome Center RH Data base (available on the World Wide Web) for analysis. Previously, we have described three α-dystrobrevin isoforms, α-dystrobrevin-1, -2, and -3, in murine skeletal muscle, and these are shown schematically in Fig.1 A (15Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R.

To identify proteins that interact with α-dystrobrevin in skeletal muscle, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the bait construct αDB2:pHybLex, encoding the entire α-dystrobrevin-2 open reading frame including the muscle-expressed vr3 sequence (15Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Attempts to produce a bait containing the full-length α-dystrobrevin-1 sequence resulted in the nonspecific activation of the yeastHIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. The αDB2:pHybLex bait plasmid was screened against a cDNA library generated from mouse H2K myotubes. 1.2 × 106 yeast colonies were screened, and a total of 28 positive clones were identified that activated the lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes. Among the prey plasmids isolated were dystrophin, utrophin, and syntrophin cDNAs, demonstrating the success of this screen in identifying known binding partners for α-dystrobrevin (12Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Dwyer T.M. Froehner S.C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Importantly, no known components of signaling cascades were identified. Rather, we identified three identical cDNA clones, SNIP4, SNIP12, and SNIP88, that showed strong interaction with αDB2:pHybLex in this system. These 2.1-kb clones were found to encode the entire open reading frame of a novel protein that we have called syncoilin. To confirm the syncoilin/α-dystrobrevin-2 interaction in the yeast system, the SNIP4 cDNA was retransformed into the yeast strain L40 together with the bait plasmid αDB2:pHybLex. The resulting cotransformants grew vigorously on medium lacking histidine and also demonstrated β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 B). Cotransformation of SNIP4 with the empty bait vector pHybLex/Zeo confirmed that syncoilin did not nonspecifically activate the yeast reporter genes (Fig. 1 B). Control experiments for the yeast two-hybrid system utilized the transcription factors Fos and Jun as a positive interaction and the empty bait and prey vectors that failed to transactivate the yeast reporter genes (Fig. 1 B). The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone SNIP4 predicts an uninterrupted open reading frame from its 5′-end with a stop codon at position 1422. The fourth predicted amino acid encodes a methionine residue with an accompanying Kozak consensus sequence. To generate additional 5′ sequence of the syncoilin transcript and to confirm that this residue is indeed the first methionine of the syncoilin protein, the H2K cDNA library was rescreened with the 5′ EcoRI/BamHI fragment of SNIP4. This screen identified a single clone that contained an additional 43 nucleotides at its 5′-end compared with the original SNIP4 cDNA clone. Within this additional sequence are two in-frame stop codons, confirming that the start of translation does indeed occur at the methionine present in the SNIP4 sequence. The nucleotide sequence and complete open reading frame of syncoilin is shown in Fig.2 A (GenBankTMaccession number AJ251641). This gives a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 53.6 kDa and pI of 4.5.Figure 2Sequence of mouse syncoilin. A, the cDNA sequence and complete conceptual translation are shown. The predicted molecular mass of syncoilin is 53.6 kDa with a pI of 4.5. This sequence was deposited in the EMBL data base under EMBL accession number AJ251641.

In this work, we report that PARG is cleaved during etoposide-, staurosporine-, and Fas-induced apoptosis in human cells. This cleavage is concomitant with PARP-1 processing and generates two C-terminal fragments of 85 and 74 kDa. In vitro cleavage assays using apoptotic cell extracts showed that a protease of the caspase family is responsible for PARG processing. A complete inhibition of this cleavage was achieved at nanomolar concentrations of the caspase inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, suggesting the involvement of caspase-3-like proteases. Consistently, recombinant caspase-3 efficiently cleaved PARG in vitro, suggesting the involvement of this protease in PARG processing in vivo. Furthermore, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells did not show any PARG cleavage in response to staurosporine treatment. The cleavage sites identified by site-directed mutagenesis are DEID256 ↓ V and the unconventional site MDVD307 ↓ N. Kinetic studies have shown similar maximal velocity (V max) and affinity (K m ) for both full-length PARG and its apoptotic fragments, suggesting that caspase-3 may affect PARG function without altering its enzymatic activity.

Cells display a low basal level of pADPr, which can increase dramatically in response to DNA damaging agents (9Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Jacobson M.K.

This increase in pADPr synthesis is transient and is followed by a rapid degradation by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) (10Malanga M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol.

Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently reported the presence of only the 111-kDa form of PARG, which is localized mostly in the cytoplasm of the cells (21Winstall E. Affar E.B. Shah R. Bourassa S. Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Winstall E. Affar E.B. Shah R. Bourassa S. Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings raise questions about the cellular mechanism of pADPr catabolism and the physiological significance of the 59- and 74-kDa forms of PARG. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an essential mechanism for appropriate embryogenesis, normal cell turnover, and the selection of lymphocytes (23Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar, 24Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by the activation of a cascade of cysteine proteases, named caspases, which trigger the biochemical and morphological changes occurring during cell dismantling. This includes nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (25Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 26Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Caspases cleave a specific set of cellular proteins like the lamins (27Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar) that results in their inactivation. Caspase cleavage can also result in a constitutive activation of proteins such as protein kinase C δ (29Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Cells undergoing apoptosis show a transient synthesis of pADPr (32Negri C. Donzelli M. Bernardi R. Rossi L. Burkle A. Scovassi A.I. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 234: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,33Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol.

Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C.

Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). This cleavage separates its DNA-binding domain from the catalytic domain, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme. Furthermore, we have recently shown that during etoposide (VP-16)-induced apoptosis, a transient pADPr synthesis is concomitant with the cleavage and inactivation of PARP-1 (37Germain M. Affar E.B. D'Amours D. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This suggests a regulation of pADPr metabolism during apoptosis, which could also involve a modulation of PARG activity. In fact, PARG contains potential caspase cleavage sites, raising the possibility that this enzyme could also be cleaved during apoptosis. In this report we show that PARG is cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis. This cleavage releases enzymatically active C-terminal fragments of 85 and 74 kDa in human cells. [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) and [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. VP-16, staurosporine, activated calf thymus DNA, 1,5-isoquinolinediol, and 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitroguanidine (MNNG) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. β-NAD and the protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) and acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (YVAD-CHO), and the colorimetric substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (DEVD-pNA) were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. z-Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-DEVD-fmk) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Anti-Fas antibody was supplied by PanVera Inc. Calf thymus PARP-1 was purified as described previously (38Zahradka P. Ebisuzaki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recombinant human caspase-3, -6, and-7 were purified to homogeneity as previously reported (39Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Human leukemia HL-60 and Jurkat cells, breast carcinoma MCF-7, bovine kidney MDBK, mouse embryo C3H10T1/2, and monkey kidney Cos-7 cells were grown according to American Type Culture Collection instructions. The cells were treated with the apoptotic inducers in a complete growth medium at the indicated concentrations for different lengths of time. The cell permeable irreversible caspases inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk (3 μm) was added to the culture medium 30 min before treatment. After drug treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold HEPES-saline buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose) and lysed in the ice-cold hypotonic buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 μm PMSF, 2 mmdithiothreitol, antiprotease mixture tablet (1 tablet/10 ml)). Aliquots were taken for protein determination (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The remaining cell extract was completed with reducing loading buffer or homogenized in buffer B by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the apoptotic cell extract. DEVDase activity was routinely assayed in the apoptotic cell extract using the substrate DEVD-pNA to verify caspase activation (41Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Zhang G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For fractionation experiments, staurosporine (400 nm) treated and control Jurkat cells were homogenized in buffer B without Triton X-100. Following incubation at 4 °C for 15 min and addition of 140 mm KCl, the homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain S-100 cytosol and pellet. The 1,000 × g and 100,000 × g pellets were resuspended in the same buffer and mixed to form the organelles fraction. S-100 cytosol and organelles fractions were used to determine PARG distribution along with the markers for the different cellular organelles. SDS-PAGE and blotting were done according to Duriez et al. (42Duriez P.J. Desnoyers S. Hoflack J.C. Shah G.M. Morelle B. Bourassa S. Poirier G.G. Talbot B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PARG was detected using the affinity purified polyclonal G-03 antibody directed against the peptide (849AYCGFLRPGVSSEN862) in the conserved C-terminal domain of the protein (22Winstall E. Affar E.B. Shah R. Bourassa S. Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After the peroxidase-based chemiluminescence revelation, the membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 65 °C for 30 min to remove the antibodies (43Kaufmann S.H. Ewing C.M. Shaper J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and reprobed with the monoclonal CII10 antibody, which recognizes full-length PARP-1 and its 89-kDa fragment (35Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Calnexin, a specific marker of endoplasmic reticulum, was detected with an anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies). Cytochrome oxidase (subunit II), a specific marker of mitochondria, was detected with an anti-cytochrome oxidase monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes). Lactate dehydrogenase and 5′-nucleotidase were used as specific markers for cytoplasm and plasma membrane, respectively. Both enzyme activities were determined with kits from Sigma. A bovine PARG cDNA lacking the region coding for the N-terminal 74 amino acids (21Winstall E. Affar E.B. Shah R. Bourassa S. Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used to translate PARG in vitro with the transcription/translation TNT kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation mixture (4 μl) was incubated in a total volume of 12.5 μl for 3 h at 37 °C, either with purified caspases resuspended in buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, and 1.6 mm CHAPS) or with the apoptotic cell extract diluted in buffer B. The reaction was stopped by addition of reducing loading buffer, and the digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amount of radioactivitiy in the bands was electronically quantified on the Instant Image Analyzer (Packard Instrument Company). For the cleavage inhibition assays, the tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD-CHO or YVAD-CHO was added to the apoptotic cell extract at the indicated concentrations. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The human DEID sequence in positions 253–256 was introduced into the corresponding region (positions 254–257) of the bovine protein (replacing the bovine EEVD site) using the primer 5′-CAGGGTGTCAGCAGGACGAGATAGACGTGGTGTCCG-3′. The aspartic acid in position 308 of bovine PARG was mutated to alanine using the primer 5′-GAGTCACCAATGGATGTAGCTAATTCCAAAAATAGTTGTCAGG-3′. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (44Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). pADPr determination was done using the immunodot-blot technique as described previously (45Affar E.B. Duriez P.J. Shah R.G. Sallmann F.R. Bourassa S. Küpper J.H. Bürkle A. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, dihydroxyboronyl Bio-Rex purified pADPr was diluted in 0.4m NaOH containing 10 mm EDTA and loaded on Hybond N+ membrane using a dot-blot manifold system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The presence of pADPr was detected by the anti-pADPr LP96–10 antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and chemiluminescence reaction. Quantification was performed using a cooled CCD camera equipped with a Chemi Imager 4000, and the data were analyzed with the Digital Imaging and Analysis Systems (Alpha Innotech Inc.). Jurkat cells (5 × 109) were sedimented at 1,900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with buffer A. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, antiprotease mixture) and homogenized with 20 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was completed with 10 ml of buffer (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 800 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, antiprotease mixture) and mixed with 5 ml of Red-Agarose preswollen resin (Amicon Corp.) equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, antiprotease mixture). After 1 h of gentle shaking at 4 °C, the mixture was washed with buffer D and with the same buffer containing 600 mm of KCl, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer D containing 1–1.2 m KCl. The active fraction was desalted with four columns of Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed in a 60-ml syringe (3 × 7-cm) using buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, antiprotease mixture) and applied on 5 ml of prepacked Heparin Sepharose (HiTrap Heparin; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. The elution was done with buffer E containing 200–300 mm KCl. The active fraction was adjusted to pH 7.4 and applied on a 1 × 3-cm phosphocellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, antiprotease mixture). After washing with buffer F containing 100–300 mm KCl, the elution was done with the same buffer containing 400–450 mm of KCl. The active fraction was used for DHB-Sepharose-polymer affinity chromatography as described previously (17Thomassin H. Jacobson M.K. Guay J. Verreault A. Aboul-Ela N. Ménard L. Poirier G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4691-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except that the pADPr used for the purification was synthesized without the formic acid resuspension and trichloroacetic acid reprecipitation step, and the elution was done at pH 7.4. Partially purified PARG (550 ng) was cleaved by caspase-3 (200 or 600 ng) in a total volume of 600 μl of buffer C without NaCl. After 3 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by 100 nm of Ac-DEVD-CHO and used for PARG activity determination. Controls consisting of PARG with Ac-DEVD-CHO or PARG alone were also included for incubation and activity analysis. PARG activity was measured essentially as described by Jonsson et al. (12Jonsson G.G. Ménard L. Jacobson E.L. Poirier G.G. Jacobson M.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4240-4243PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed with ice-cold buffer A and homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 using a Dounce homogenizer. The reaction mixture for the assay contained 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm[32P]pADPr. The reaction was started by the addition of the cell extracts or the purified enzyme and stopped after 10 min by the addition of SDS at a 0.1% final concentration. An aliquot of 10,000 cpm was applied on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate. The plate was first developed at room temperature in methanol, dried, and then developed in 0.3 m LiCl, 0.9 n acetic acid. The TLC plate was electronically autoradiographed on the Instant Image Analyzer as described above. The radioactivity in the ADP-ribose spot, and the origin was used to calculate the activity. Full-length or caspase-3-digested purified PARG was used for the determination of the kinetic parameters (K m andV max), using various concentrations of [32P]pADPr (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μm) to establish Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots. An activity zymogram consisting of an SDS-PAGE of PARG in a gel containing32P-automodified PARP-1 was done according to Brochuet al. (46Brochu G. Shah G.M. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After renaturation, the presence of PARG was determined by the disappearance of radioactivity in the bands. Fusion protein between GFP in frame with the N-terminal of 103-kDa PARG (GFP-PARG) or its 74-kDa apoptotic fragment (GFP-74) was generated to determine their cellular distribution. GFP-PARG was obtained by insertion of a 2.68-kilobaseXhoI-EcoRI polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified from pCMV-PARG plasmid (21Winstall E. Affar E.B. Shah R. Bourassa S. Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with primers 5′-CTGCACTCGAGGTATGTGTCAGGATTCAGAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GACGTGAATTCTCGGCCCCCGTCCTTTGT-3′ into a pEGFP-C1 expression vector (CLONTECH). GFP-74 was obtained by insertion of a 2-kilobase XhoI-EcoRI polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified from pCMV-PARG with primers 5′-CTGCACTCGAGGTATGGACACTAAAGGAATCAAGAC-3′ and 5′-GACGTGAATTCTCGGCCCCCGTCCTTTGT-3′ into the GFP expression vector. The resulting plasmids were transiently transfected in Cos-7 cells by a lipofection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression of the fusion proteins was verified 24 h after the transfection by Western blotting on total cell extract with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH). The distribution of PARG in normal cells or in cells undergoing apoptosis following treatment with 1 μm staurosporine was directly monitored with an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss). Images were captured with a CCD camera (DAGE-MTI) coupled to the Metamorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation). Human Jurkat leukemia cells were treated with the topoisomerase II inhibitor VP-16 or the PKC inhibitor staurosporine and analyzed by Western blot for PARG cleavage (Fig. 1, A andB). In untreated cells, PARG was present in two bands of ∼111 kDa corresponding possibly to post-translational modifications or different translation origins. In cells undergoing apoptosis, these bands were cleaved into ∼ 85- and 74-kDa fragments at approximately the same time as PARP-1 cleavage. The two apoptotic fragments are in the C-terminal region of the protein because they are recognized by the anti-peptide antibody. PARG cleavage could be inhibited by the cell permeable caspases inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, suggesting the involvement of caspases in PARG cleavage. PARG was also cleaved into the ∼85- and 74-kDa fragments in HL-60 cells treated with VP-16 (Fig. 1 C) and Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 1 D) or the ligand Trail (data not shown). These results suggest that PARG processing is a general feature of apoptosis. Because pADPr synthesis occurs in apoptotic cells (32Negri C. Donzelli M. Bernardi R. Rossi L. Burkle A. Scovassi A.I. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 234: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), we asked whether PARG cleavage is specific to apoptosis or whether it could also occur during the early pADPr metabolism in response to DNA strand breaks. HL-60 cells were treated with MNNG, and the pADPr level was determined by the immunodot-blot method (Fig.2 A). MNNG treatment induced a transient synthesis of pADPr, which was abolished by the PARP inhibitor 1,5-isoquinolinediol. Western blot analysis of PARG showed that the protein remained unaffected during MNNG treatment (Fig. 2 B), unlike following VP-16 treatment. This indicates that, in living cells, pADPr catabolism does not require PARG cleavage. To determine the nature of the protease responsible for PARG cleavage during apoptosis, in vitro translated bovine PARG was incubated with different amounts of apoptotic HL-60 cell extract (Fig.3 A). Two PARG translation products, corresponding to 103 and 91 kDa were observed in the control. These bands probably correspond to two translation start points from the partial PARG cDNA. Following the addition of the apoptotic cell extract, PARG was cleaved to a 74-kDa fragment in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that an apoptotic protease is responsible for this cleavage. The 85-kDa fragment produced in human cells (Fig. 1) was not observed with bovine PARG. Similar results were obtained with cytosolic extracts from Jurkat cells treated with staurosporine or anti-Fas antibody (data not shown). The small N-terminal fragments derived from the cleavage of the 103- and 91-kDa products were hardly detectable because of their low radioactivity (data not shown). To study the involvement of caspases in PARG cleavage, the specific tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors DEVD-CHO and YVAD-CHO were used (Fig. 3 B). The cleavage of PARG was completely inhibited by 50 nm of DEVD-CHO but only partially inhibited by 500 nm of YVAD-CHO, suggesting that a caspase-3-like activity present in apoptotic HL-60 cells is involved in PARG processing. Similar patterns of inhibition were obtained with cytosolic extracts from Jurkat cells treated with staurosporine or anti-Fas antibody (data not shown). To further determine which caspase is responsible for PARG cleavage, in vitro translated bovine PARG was incubated with caspase-3, -6, and -7. Using 4 ng of purified caspases per assay (∼7 nm), a weak cleavage of PARG was observed with caspase-3. Caspase-6 and -7 did not produce detectable cleavage at this concentration. At 20 ng/assay (∼ 35 nm), PARG was cleaved to a significant degree by caspase-3 and marginally by caspase-7 (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that caspase-3 could be responsible for PARG cleavage in vivo. To test this hypothesis, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells were used to determine whether PARG could be cleaved in the absence of this protease following apoptotic treatment (Fig. 3 D). In this cell line, PARG was not cleaved in response to staurosporine treatment, whereas PARP-1 was almost totally cleaved. In vitrotranslated bovine PARG was cleaved only into a 74-kDa fragment, whereas human PARG was cleaved into 85- and 74-kDa fragments (Figs. 1 and 3). Analysis of the PARG sequence (Fig.4 A) revealed the presence of a potential DEID motif, present only in human PARG, that could generate the 85-kDa fragment. To determine whether the 85-kDa fragment is produced in other mammalian cell types, cell extracts from MDBK (bovine), C3H10T1/2 (mouse), and Jurkat (human) cells were treated with caspase-3 and assayed for PARG cleavage with anti-PARG antibody (F"

At sites of inflammation, neutrophils adherent to other cells or matrix components are exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Although TNFα has been implicated in induction of pro-inflammatory responses, it may also inhibit the intensity of neutrophilic inflammation by promoting apoptosis. Since TNFα is not only an important activator of the stress-induced pathways leading to p38 MAPk and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but also a potent effector of apoptosis, we investigated the effects of TNFα on the JNK pathway in adherent human neutrophils and the potential involvement of this pathway in neutrophil apoptosis. Stimulation with TNFα was found to result in β2integrin-mediated activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Syk, and activation of a three-part MAPk module composed of MEKK1, MKK7, and/or MKK4 and JNK1. JNK activation was attenuated by blocking antibodies to β2 integrins, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein, and tyrphostin A9, a Pyk2-specific inhibitor, and piceatannol, a Syk-specific inhibitor. Exposure of adherent neutrophils to TNFα led to the rapid onset of apoptosis that was demonstrated by augmented annexin V binding and caspase-3 cleavage. TNFα−induced increases in annexin V binding to neutrophils were attenuated by blocking antibodies to β2 integrins, and the caspase-3 cleavage was attenuated by tyrphostin A9. Hence, exposure of adherent neutrophils to TNFα leads to utilization of the JNK-signaling pathways that may contribute to diverse functional responses including induction of apoptosis and subsequent resolution of the inflammatory response.

In turn, exposure to TNFα induces wide ranging biological effects including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and multiple pro-inflammatory effects. TNFα exerts potent effects on neutrophils that have been suggested to contribute to the inflammatory response in sepsis (4Windsor A.C. Walsh C.J. Mullen P.G. Cook D.J. Fisher B.J. Blocher C.R.

Integrin ligation in neutrophils results in reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell spreading across an adhesive surface, and release of O2−and granule constituents.Activation of tyrosine kinases plays a central role in human neutrophil integrin signaling (14Berton G. Lowell C.A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 621-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Studies have linked adherence-associated neutrophil responses in TNFα−stimulated neutrophils to β2 integrin-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase substrates and augmentation of p58c-Fgr and p53/56Lyn kinase activity (19Berton G. Fumagalli L. Laudanna C. Sorio C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Fuortes M. Jin W.W. Nathan C. J.

In addition, neutrophils induced to spread over fibrinogen in the presence of TNFα show integrin-dependent activation of Syk (a non-Src-like cytoplasmic) protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) which associates with p58c-Fgr and p53/56Lyn in co-localized complexes. The TNFα-induced phosphorylation of another tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, has also observed (23Fuortes M. Melchior M. Han H. Lyon G.J. Nathan C. J. Clin.

Studies in adherent neutrophils exposed to TNFα demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 is β2 integrin-dependent and that Pyk2 appears to lie downstream of Lyn, Syk, protein kinase C, and reorganization of the cytoskeleton (30Yan S.R. Novak M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Pyk2 in PC12 cells, which have been stimulated with TNFα, induces JNK activation in a calcium-independent manner (31Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus the altered response of the adherent neutrophil to TNFα may reflect in part differences in tyrosine kinase signaling through β2integrin-mediated mechanisms.Three distinct MAPk families have been described to date that may act downstream of tyrosine kinases. The prototypical p42/p44 ERK MAPk are activated in response to growth factors and chemoattractants, whereas the p38 MAPk and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) families modulate stress-activated responses (32Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Levin D.E. Errede B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Each MAPk cascade requires sequential activation of a MAPk kinase kinase (or equivalent) which can then activate a MAPk kinase, resulting in turn in the phosphorylation and activation of a MAPk (34Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1118-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). In the neutrophil, only the p38 MAPk cascade has been clearly shown to be utilized in response to TNFα stimulation (36Nahas N. Molski T.F.P. Fernandez G.A. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Involvement of the p42/p44 ERK MAPk pathway in response to TNFα is controversial. Activation of a JNK pathway in the neutrophil has not as yet been shown in any context. Furthermore, regulation of apoptosis may represent a functional consequence of JNK, and this has yet to be delineated in the context of the neutrophil inflammatory response.Apoptosis is an important mechanism for regulating the extent of an inflammatory response, making it self-limiting and thus preventing massive tissue damage. TNFα is a potent inducer of apoptosis in neutrophils, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Recent reports have suggested that TNFα in conjunction with β2integrins induces apoptosis in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner (37Walzog B. Jeblonski F. Zakrzewicz A. Gaehtgens P. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have shown activation of the cysteine proteases, caspase-3 and -8 (8Yamashita K. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Hirata H. Mesner Jr., P.W. Kaufmann S.H. Yonehara S. Yamamoto K. Uchiyama T. Sasada M. Blood. 1999; 93: 674-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of MAPK members, in particular JNK pathway activation, in the TNFα induction of apoptosis remains controversial (38Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 39Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to determine the conditions under which TNFα might activate the JNK pathway in human neutrophils, to define components of a putative MAPK-module, and to delineate key upstream components, as well as downstream functional consequences (in particular apoptosis). We report that in adherent neutrophils, activation of JNK1 in response to TNFα results from the mobilization of an integrin-mediated cascade involving activation of tyrosine kinases, in particular Syk and Pyk2, and activation of a MAPk module in which MEKK1 activates either or both of the MAPk kinases, MKK7 and MKK4. Among possible functional consequences of this pathway, we show that TNFα-elicited JNK activation is accompanied by a dramatic acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis which is modulated both by integrins and tyrosine kinases. Together, these results provide the first description to date of the activation of the JNK MAPk cascade in the human neutrophil, while providing a potential mechanism for TNFα-induced apoptosis in the human neutrophil.DISCUSSIONRegulation of cellular responses to specific stimuli occurs in part through selective activation of MAPk-signaling cascades. In human neutrophils, chemoattractant-induced activation of c-Raf and MEKK1 leads to the activation of p42/p44 ERK MAPk pathways (40Avdi N. Winston B.W. Russel M. Young S.K. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas chemoattractants and lipopolysaccharide activate p38 MAPk as well (63Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P.R. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 64Nick J. Avdi N. Young S. Knall C. Johnson G. Worthen G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies to date in human neutrophils have not as yet provided evidence for activation of JNK and its associated signaling partners. This study, performed in primary human neutrophils, describes key elements leading to activation of the JNK pathway following stimulation with TNFα under adherent conditions. Our data support the conclusion that integration of two signals, one from integrin-mediated adherence and the other through the TNF receptor(s), regulates a pathway in which activation of tyrosine kinases, Syk and Pyk2, is linked to activation of a MAPK module consisting of MEKK1, MKK4/7, JNK1, and associated with cleavage of caspases-3 and externalization of phosphatidylserine (Fig.11). We propose that induction of apoptosis, a critical mechanism for maintaining a self-limiting inflammatory response, may be associated with activation of these elements. This pathway not only constitutes the first report of activation and utilization of a JNK pathway in human neutrophils but joins a very limited group of studies on apoptosis induced through stimulation of the JNK pathway.JNK activation in response to TNFα exposure has been reported for a variety of cell types (65Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). Ten different human JNK isoforms, found as either 46- or 55-kDa proteins, have been described, arising from the alternative splicing of the three genes jnk1, jnk2, andjnk3. We detected by Western blot analysis both the 46- and 55-kDa species, although the predominant species was a 55-kDa protein. This p55 splice variant we detected is probably JNK1α2 or JNK1β2 (65Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar, 66Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Evidence of TNFα-induced neutrophil JNK activation comes both from observations that immunoprecipitated, endogenous JNK is itself specifically phosphorylated following TNFα stimulation and that it phosphorylates a c-Jun fragment substrate.The MAP kinases kinases reported to be directly upstream of JNK include MKK4 and the recently cloned MKK7 (67Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MKK4 in a variety of cell types leads to activation of JNK(s) (46Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 68Dérijard B. Raingeaud J.L. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Davis R. Flavell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, suggest that MKK7 may be the preferred MKK leading to JNK activation following TNFα exposure (48Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotsh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, both MKK4 and MKK7 were activated in a stimulus-dependent manner when neutrophils were exposed to TNFα, indicating the likelihood that both MKK4 and MKK7 are involved in JNK1 activation in the neutrophil. Our data, while suggesting that MKK7 may be a more potent activator of JNK1 than MKK4 in this system, do not preclude the possibility that immunoprecipitation may not allow detection of the full extent of activation. In keeping with the upstream location of MKK4 and MKK7, their peak activation (5 min) precedes that of JNK1 (10–15 min). Similar time courses of activation for JNK and MKK4 have been reported in macrophages following TNFα exposure (52Winston B.W. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4491-4497PubMed Google Scholar).MAP kinase kinase kinases shown to act upstream of JNK include MEKK family members (49Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J.

In this study, we demonstrate, with the use of recombinant constituents of the JNK pathway, MEKK1 activation in adherent neutrophils following exposure to TNFα. In light of our previous findings that formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine induces MEKK1-associated p42/44 ERK MAPk activation (conditions in which MKK4 is not activated (40Avdi N. Winston B.W.

The yeast accomplishes such specificity through the use of scaffolding proteins (76Yablonski D. Marbach I. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13864-13869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, or alternatively, other MEKK family members may also activate MKK4 and MKK7 in response to TNFα.Signaling events upstream of MEKK remain to be elucidated, although the pleiotropic actions of TNFα (7Marino M.

Delhause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).In spite of the many activities linked to activation of TNFRI and -II, we demonstrate that an additional component, neutrophil adherence, is necessary for JNK1 activation in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils. Although neutrophils utilize a variety of adhesion molecules, β2 integrins are fundamentally important in both homotypic and cell-substratum adhesive events, and neutrophil interactions with the extracellular matrix have been shown to require integrins (16Nathan C. Srimal S. Farber C. Sanchez E. Kabbash L. Asch A. Gailit J. Wright S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In our studies, both the JNK and MEKK1 activation in TNFα-stimulated adherent neutrophils could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with an antibody to CD11b, the α subunit of the β2 integrin, Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18, aMβ2). Although JNK activation following integrin activation alone has been reported (84Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Burbel P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), we found that in neutrophils adherence in the absence of TNFα stimulation was insufficient to initiate activation of JNK1. By using an isotype control antibody, we demonstrated that the anti-Cd11b blocking was indeed specific. Additionally, we present evidence that anti-CD11b does not block the TNFR itself by demonstrating that TNFα-induced actin assembly in neutrophils is an integrin-independent function (Fig. 2 C). Initial actin assembly in the neutrophil in response to variety of agonists occurs in suspension and is independent of β2 integrin blockade. Hence, this provides a system in which integrin-independent signaling events downstream of the TNFR and its expression can be assessed.Neutrophil interactions with the extracellular matrix have been shown to induce phosphorylation of specific cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including the Src family member p58Fgr (19Berton G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that TNFα activation of adherent neutrophils resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of several protein species that were not seen in suspended cells. Our studies show that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, attenuated TNFα-induced JNK activation, providing initial evidence for upstream participation of tyrosine kinases. A recent study in T-cells reports that activation through the T-cell receptor, if associated with ligation of a co-receptor, results in activation of Syk and downstream activation of the JNK pathway (85Jacinto E.

https://openalex.org/W1979005586,"Two novel antimicrobial peptides, which we propose to name termicin and spinigerin, have been isolated from the fungus-growing termite <i>Pseudacanthotermes spiniger</i>(heterometabole insect, Isoptera). Termicin is a 36-amino acid residue antifungal peptide, with six cysteines arranged in a disulfide array similar to that of insect defensins. In contrast to most insect defensins, termicin is C-terminally amidated. Spinigerin consists of 25 amino acids and is devoid of cysteines. It is active against bacteria and fungi. Termicin and spinigerin show no obvious sequence similarities with other peptides. Termicin is constitutively present in hemocyte granules and in salivary glands. The presence of termicin and spinigerin in unchallenged termites contrasts with observations in evolutionary recent insects or insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, in which antimicrobial peptides are induced in the fat body and released into the hemolymph after septic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2024143289,"Approximately 40% of human breast cancers contain alterations in the tumor suppressor p53. The p53 172R-H gain-of-function mutant (equivalent to the common 175R-H human breast cancer mutant) has been shown to promote aneuploidy and tumorigenesis in the mammary gland in transgenic mice and may affect genomic stability in part by causing centrosome abnormalities. The precise mechanism of action of these gain-of-function mutants is not well understood, and has been studied primarily in fibroblast cell lines. A novel p53-null mouse mammary epithelial cell line developed from p53-null mice has been used in adenovirus-mediated transient transfection experiments to study the properties of this p53 mutant. Marked centrosome amplification and an increased frequency of aberrant mitoses were observed within 72 h of introduction of p53 172R-H. However, few cells with aberrant centrosome numbers were observed in cells stably expressing the p53 172R-H mutant. Furthermore, stable expression of this p53 mutant reduced both basal and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. This result may be mediated in part through abrogation of p73 function. The p53 172R-H mutant, therefore, appears to influence tumorigenesis at the molecular level in two distinct ways: promoting the development of aneuploidy in cells while also altering their apoptotic response after DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2145709335,"C-peptide is a cleavage product that comes from processing proinsulin to insulin that induces nitric oxide (NO) -mediated vasodilation. NO modulates leukocyte-endothelium interaction. We hypothesized that C-peptide might inhibit leukocyte-endothelium interaction via increased release of endothelial NO. Using intravital microscopy of the rat mesentery, we measured leukocyte-endothelium interactions after administration of C-peptide to the rat. Superfusion of the rat mesentery with either thrombin or L-NAME consistently and significantly increased the number of rolling, adhering, and transmigrated leukocytes. C-peptide significantly attenuated either thrombin- or L-NAME-induced leukocyte-endothelium interactions in rat mesenteric venules. A control scrambled sequence of C-peptide characterized by the same amino acid composition in a randomized sequence failed to inhibit leukocyte-endothelium interactions. These effects of C-peptide were associated with decreased surface expression of the cell adhesion molecules P-selectin and ICAM-1 on the microvascular endothelium. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA levels were increased in rats injected with C-peptide. This enhanced eNOS expression was associated with a marked increase in basal NO release from the aorta of C-peptide-treated rats. We conclude that C-peptide is a potent inhibitor of leukocyte-endothelium interaction and that this effect is specifically related to inhibition of endothelial cell adhesion molecules via maintenance of NO release from the vascular endothelium."

We analyzed biodistribution of transgene expression after intravascular and periadventitial gene delivery methods using the first generation nuclear-targeted lacZ adenovirus. RT-PCR and X-Gal stainings were used to study transgene expression 14 days after the gene transfer. After intravascular catheter-mediated gene transfer to rabbit aorta mimicking angioplasty procedure, the target vessel showed 1.1% +/- 0. 5 gene transfer efficiency. Other tissues showed varying lacZ gene expression indicating a systemic leakage of the vector with the highest transfection efficiency in hepatocytes (0.7% +/- 0.5). X-Gal staining of blood cells 24 h after the intravascular gene transfer indicated that a significant portion (1.8% +/- 0.8) of circulating monocytes was transfected. X-Gal-positive cells were also found in testis. After periadventitial gene transfer using a closed silicon capsule placed around the artery, 0.1% +/- 0.1 lacZ-positive cells were detected in the artery wall. Positive cells were also found in the liver and testis (<0.01%), indicating that the virus escapes even from the periadventitial space, although less extensively than during the intravascular application. We conclude that catheter-mediated intravascular and, to a lesser extent, periadventitial gene transfer lead to leakage of adenovirus to systemic circulation, followed by expression of the transgene in several tissues. Possible consequences of the ectopic expression of the transgene should be evaluated in gene therapy trials even if local gene delivery methods are used."

In addition to the SAPK signaling pathway, MLK-3 also activates the p38 (RK/HOG) signaling pathway via MKK3 and MKK6 (13Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Moreover, MLK2 and DLK have been found to slightly activate p38 and MLK2 also appears to activate ERK weakly (9Hirai S.

In Jurkat T cells, MLK-3 is activated upon costimulation with CD3 and CD28, and Cdc42 and Rac also activate NF-κB via MLK-3 (20Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O. Wing-Lan Leung I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). While these two events are crucial for MLK-3 activation, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.Many kinases are phosphorylated in the kinase activation loop located between the conserved sequence DFG of subdomain VII and APE of subdomain VIII (28Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The activation loop plays a crucial role in substrate recognition, and in many cases; phosphorylation in this segment is required to allow correct alignment of the substrates to the catalytic site (28Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 30Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This segment can be regulated either through autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by other kinases. For example, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase autophosphorylates the Thr197 located in its activation loop (31Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ERK2 is phosphorylated on Thr183 and Tyr185 by MEK in the corresponding activation loop (32Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In both cases, phosphorylation in the activation loop is essential for the activation of these kinases. The putative kinase activation loop of MLK-3 contains three potential phosphorylation sites at residues Thr277, Thr278, and Ser281 that may play a role in MLK-3 activation.It is clear that MLK-3 plays a central role in integrating and processing inputs into SAPK, p38, and NF-κB signaling pathways, however, the activation mechanism of MLK-3 has not been elucidated fully. We have demonstrated previously that dimerization via the tandem leucine zippers is required both for MLK-3 autophosphorylation and the activation of SAPK, suggesting that autophosphorylation might be an intermediate step of MLK-3 activation (27Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this report, we aimed to further define the mechanism of MLK-3 activation and examine the role of the kinase activation loop in such a mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe kinase activation loop, defined as the region spanning between the subdomains VII and VIII, has been shown in a number of kinases to regulate catalytic activity (28Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of kinase activation loop in MLK-3 activation. First, we mutated the three potential phosphorylation residues in the kinase activation loop to investigate whether these residues are required for MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity. We found that mutating residue Thr277 to alanine significantly reduced MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity. This same MLK-3 mutant only had negligible phosphorylation activity toward its substrate SEK1 and did not activate either JNK/SAPK or p38/RK. The S281A mutant displayed a reduced level of autophosphorylation activity, and reduced activation of SEK1, JNK/SAPK, and p38/RK, whereas the T278A mutant, which exhibited close to normal autophosphorylation activity, can almost fully activate these proteins. These results clearly demonstrate that the activation loop is crucial for MLK-3 autophosphorylation and its subsequent activation and suggest that the MLK-3 autophosphorylation level correlates with activity.Mutation of Thr277 and Ser281 might result in the loss of MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity in two different ways; first, it may affect the MLK-3 substrate binding ability and second, it may eliminate the autophosphorylation site. Our data show that when the Thr277 and Ser281 residues were mutated to acidic residues, so as to mimic negatively charged phosphorylated serine or threonine residues, the ability of MLK-3 to activate the SAPK pathway was retained. These findings suggest that MLK-3 is functional when the Thr277 and Ser281 residues are phosphorylated and support the idea that these two residues may, in fact, serve as the MLK-3 (auto)phosphorylation sites. We found that when Thr277 is mutated, MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity is minimal whereas when Ser281 is mutated, there are still some levels of autophosphorylation activity indicating that Thr277 can still be phosphorylated independent of Ser281. One explanation for these observations is that Thr277 is required for the subsequent phosphorylation of the Ser281. An alternative possibility is that the Thr277 is the only autophosphorylation site within the activation loop and mutation of Ser281 simply affects the “self” recognition and subsequent autophosphorylation of Thr277. One way to distinguish these possibilities will be to use phospho-specific antibodies when they become available.Our results also indicate that all three residues (Thr277, Thr278, and Ser281) are important for efficient phosphorylation of SEK1 and therefore, substitution of any of these neutral hydrophilic residues to hydrophobic alanine residues may affect substrate binding specificity. However, since mutation of Thr277 and Ser281 to alanine have substantial effects on SEK1 phosphorylation whereas mutation of Thr278to alanine only resulted in relatively minor reduction of SEK1 phosphorylation seems likely that both Thr277 and Ser281 but not Thr278 need to be phosphorylated for normal MLK-3 function toward SEK1.Because MLK-3 lies downstream of HPK1 in the stress signaling pathway and is directly phosphorylated by HPK1 (21Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we also asked whether HPK1 could activate MLK-3 by phosphorylating MLK-3 activation loop. We identified the Ser281 residue as the HPK1-phosphorylation site, indicating that both autophosphorylation and HPK1 phosphorylation could activate MLK-3 via the kinase activation loop which underscores the complex regulation of MLK-3 activation. This mode of regulation, by autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation by another kinase(s) within the activation loop has also been reported for the tyrosine kinase Lck (37Chiang G.G. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6055-6058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that MLK-3 homodimerization is required for its autophosphorylation, critical for its activation, and can be induced by Cdc42 (27Leung I.W.

In this report, we in fact demonstrated that autophosphorylation is essential for MLK-3 activation.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the two residues corresponding to the MLK-3 potential autophosphorylation sites are conserved among other MLK family members. As shown in Fig.8, the Thr277 residue is conserved in MLK1 and MLK2 (but substituted with a serine in DLK/MUK/ZPK and LZK), whereas the Ser281 residue is conserved in all MLK family members. Hence it is temping to hypothesize that these two residues may also be crucial for the autophosphorylation, thus activation, of other MLK family members. To date, five members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK)1 family have been identified: MLK1 (1Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J.

With the exception of MLK1, all MLK family members have been shown to function as mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), which predominantly activate the SAPK (JNK) stress-signaling pathway (9Hirai S.

Although MLK-3 and MLK2 can activate SAPK via both SEK1 (MKK4) and MKK7, MLK2 shows preferential association with MKK7 (16Hirai S. Noda K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Yamashita A. Deyama T. Fukuyama K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7406-7412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and DLK activates SAPK via MKK7 only (17Merritt S.E. Mata M. Nihalani D. Zhu C. Hu X. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10195-10202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This MKK7 specific SAPK activation can be mediated by the recently identified scaffold proteins JNK-interacting proteins JIP1 and JIP2 (18Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 19Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These scaffold proteins interact specifically with MLK2/MLK-3/DLK, SAPK, and MKK7 but not MKK4. In addition to the SAPK signaling pathway, MLK-3 also activates the p38 (RK/HOG) signaling pathway via MKK3 and MKK6 (13Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Moreover, MLK2 and DLK have been found to slightly activate p38 and MLK2 also appears to activate ERK weakly (9Hirai S. Izawa M. Osada S. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Besides functioning as a MAPKKK, MLK-3 also acts as an IκB kinase kinase and mediates activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which targets genes such as those involved in immune and inflammatory responses (20Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O. Wing-Lan Leung I. Lassam N. Scheidereit C. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2556-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A number of upstream molecules utilize MLK-3 in SAPK activation. Dominant negative forms of MLK-3 have been shown to block SAPK activation mediated through the Ste20 homologues germinal center kinase (13Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and hematopoetic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) (21Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac (22Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and the guanine-nucleotide exchange protein CRK SH3-binding GNFP (C3G) (23Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting that MLK-3 is downstream of these proteins in the SAPK signaling pathway. In Jurkat T cells, MLK-3 is activated upon costimulation with CD3 and CD28, and Cdc42 and Rac also activate NF-κB via MLK-3 (20Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O. Wing-Lan Leung I.

J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3829-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, only HPK1, Cdc42, and Rac have been shown to directly interact with MLK-3. HPK1 binds to the MLK-3 SH3 domain and phosphorylates MLK-3 (21Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas Cdc42 binds to the Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding region (26Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and induces MLK-3 homodimerization (27Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). While these two events are crucial for MLK-3 activation, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Many kinases are phosphorylated in the kinase activation loop located between the conserved sequence DFG of subdomain VII and APE of subdomain VIII (28Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The activation loop plays a crucial role in substrate recognition, and in many cases; phosphorylation in this segment is required to allow correct alignment of the substrates to the catalytic site (28Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 30Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This segment can be regulated either through autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by other kinases. For example, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase autophosphorylates the Thr197 located in its activation loop (31Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ERK2 is phosphorylated on Thr183 and Tyr185 by MEK in the corresponding activation loop (32Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In both cases, phosphorylation in the activation loop is essential for the activation of these kinases. The putative kinase activation loop of MLK-3 contains three potential phosphorylation sites at residues Thr277, Thr278, and Ser281 that may play a role in MLK-3 activation. It is clear that MLK-3 plays a central role in integrating and processing inputs into SAPK, p38, and NF-κB signaling pathways, however, the activation mechanism of MLK-3 has not been elucidated fully. We have demonstrated previously that dimerization via the tandem leucine zippers is required both for MLK-3 autophosphorylation and the activation of SAPK, suggesting that autophosphorylation might be an intermediate step of MLK-3 activation (27Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this report, we aimed to further define the mechanism of MLK-3 activation and examine the role of the kinase activation loop in such a mechanism. DISCUSSIONThe kinase activation loop, defined as the region spanning between the subdomains VII and VIII, has been shown in a number of kinases to regulate catalytic activity (28Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of kinase activation loop in MLK-3 activation. First, we mutated the three potential phosphorylation residues in the kinase activation loop to investigate whether these residues are required for MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity. We found that mutating residue Thr277 to alanine significantly reduced MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity. This same MLK-3 mutant only had negligible phosphorylation activity toward its substrate SEK1 and did not activate either JNK/SAPK or p38/RK. The S281A mutant displayed a reduced level of autophosphorylation activity, and reduced activation of SEK1, JNK/SAPK, and p38/RK, whereas the T278A mutant, which exhibited close to normal autophosphorylation activity, can almost fully activate these proteins. These results clearly demonstrate that the activation loop is crucial for MLK-3 autophosphorylation and its subsequent activation and suggest that the MLK-3 autophosphorylation level correlates with activity.Mutation of Thr277 and Ser281 might result in the loss of MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity in two different ways; first, it may affect the MLK-3 substrate binding ability and second, it may eliminate the autophosphorylation site. Our data show that when the Thr277 and Ser281 residues were mutated to acidic residues, so as to mimic negatively charged phosphorylated serine or threonine residues, the ability of MLK-3 to activate the SAPK pathway was retained. These findings suggest that MLK-3 is functional when the Thr277 and Ser281 residues are phosphorylated and support the idea that these two residues may, in fact, serve as the MLK-3 (auto)phosphorylation sites. We found that when Thr277 is mutated, MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity is minimal whereas when Ser281 is mutated, there are still some levels of autophosphorylation activity indicating that Thr277 can still be phosphorylated independent of Ser281. One explanation for these observations is that Thr277 is required for the subsequent phosphorylation of the Ser281. An alternative possibility is that the Thr277 is the only autophosphorylation site within the activation loop and mutation of Ser281 simply affects the “self” recognition and subsequent autophosphorylation of Thr277. One way to distinguish these possibilities will be to use phospho-specific antibodies when they become available.Our results also indicate that all three residues (Thr277, Thr278, and Ser281) are important for efficient phosphorylation of SEK1 and therefore, substitution of any of these neutral hydrophilic residues to hydrophobic alanine residues may affect substrate binding specificity.

Because MLK-3 lies downstream of HPK1 in the stress signaling pathway and is directly phosphorylated by HPK1 (21Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we also asked whether HPK1 could activate MLK-3 by phosphorylating MLK-3 activation loop. We identified the Ser281 residue as the HPK1-phosphorylation site, indicating that both autophosphorylation and HPK1 phosphorylation could activate MLK-3 via the kinase activation loop which underscores the complex regulation of MLK-3 activation. This mode of regulation, by autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation by another kinase(s) within the activation loop has also been reported for the tyrosine kinase Lck (37Chiang G.G. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6055-6058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that MLK-3 homodimerization is required for its autophosphorylation, critical for its activation, and can be induced by Cdc42 (27Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this report, we in fact demonstrated that autophosphorylation is essential for MLK-3 activation. Taken together, these data indicate that MLK-3 employs an activation mechanism similar to that of receptor tyrosine kinases; that is, induced dimerization leads to autophosphorylation and the subsequent activation of MLK-3. Based on the fact that all MLK family members (except MLK1 which has not been reported) display autophosphorylation activity and bear tandem leucine zippers (2Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.F. Price G.

Within the MLK family, DLK has also been shown to also employ a dimerization-based activation mechanism (38Nihalani D. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the two residues corresponding to the MLK-3 potential autophosphorylation sites are conserved among other MLK family members. As shown in Fig.8, the Thr277 residue is conserved in MLK1 and MLK2 (but substituted with a serine in DLK/MUK/ZPK and LZK), whereas the Ser281 residue is conserved in all MLK family members. Hence it is temping to hypothesize that these two residues may also be crucial for the autophosphorylation, thus activation, of other MLK family members. We are in debt to Dr. J. McGlade, Dr. D.

To test this hypothesis, chimeric fusion proteins were constructed of the dimerization domain (apple 4) of factor XI and β2GPI. Both a covalent (apple 4-β2GPI) and a noncovalent (apple 4-C321S-β2GPI) chimer were constructed. As controls, apple 2-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S, in which β2GPI-W316S is not able to bind to phospholipids, were made. In a phospholipid binding assay, apple 4-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI were able to bind to phospholipids with an affinity 35 times higher than that of plasma-derived β2GPI and apple 2-β2GPI. Apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S did not bind at all. Only apple 4-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI were able to bind to adhered platelets as shown by immunofluorescence. Using the prothrombin time, which was the most responsive coagulation assay, the clotting time was approximately doubled when 200 μg/ml apple 4-β2GPI or apple 4-C321S-β2GPI was added. Addition of 200 μg/ml plasma-derived β2GPI, apple 2-β2GPI, or apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S did not affect clotting time. Clotting time could be corrected with the addition of extra phospholipids, which is indicative for lupus anticoagulant activity. An additional increase in clotting times for apple 4-β2GPI or apple 4-C321S-β2GPI was achieved by the addition of monoclonal antibodies against β2GPI.

It consists of 326 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 42 kDa. β2GPI is a member of the short consensus repeat or complement control protein superfamily. The first four domains of β2GPI consist of ∼60 amino acids and contain two conserved disulfide bonds. The fifth domain, comprising 84 amino acids, is different with an extra C-terminal tail, resulting in a C-terminal loop and an extra disulfide bond (1Kristensen T. Schousboe I. Boel E. Mulvihill E.M.

This domain is important for phospholipid binding, as has been shown by several studies. Experiments, using mutated forms of β2GPI and peptides spanning the fifth domain of β2GPI, indicated that residues Cys281 to Cys288 are important for phospholipid binding (6Hunt J.E. Simpson R.J.

Furthermore, analysis of a naturally occurring polymorphism, in which Trp316 is mutated to a serine (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1770-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that a hydrophobic sequence at position 313–316 in the fifth domain is crucial for cardiolipin binding. The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of β2GPI (11Bouma B. De Groot P.G. van den Elsen J.M.H. Ravelli R.B.G. Schouten A. Simmelink M.J.A. Derksen R.H.W.M. Kroon J. Gros P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5166-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) showed that a patch of 14 positively charged amino acids in the fifth domain is important for electrostatic interaction with negatively charged phospholipids. It was also shown that the amino acids at positions 311–317 form a membrane-insertion loop, which yields specificity for lipid bilayers. At present, the in vivo function of β2GPI is unknown. In vitro, it has been shown to influence coagulation (both procoagulant and anticoagulant) (12Schousboe I. Blood. 1985; 66: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nimpf J. Bevers E.M.

The persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in plasma is a risk factor for thrombosis, pregnancy loss, and thrombocytopenia. These clinical and serological observations together are termed the antiphospholipid syndrome (28Wilson W.A. Gharavi A.E. Koike T. Lockshin M.D. Branch D.W. Piette J.C. Brey R. Derksen R.H.W.M.

Initially it was thought that the antiphospholipid antibodies were directed against phospholipids directly, but now it is generally accepted that these antibodies are directed against phospholipid-bound proteins, such as β2GPI (34Galli M. Comfurius P. Maassen C. Hemker H.C. de Baets M.H. van Breda-Vriesman P.J.C. Barbui T. Zwaal R.F.A. Bevers E.M. Lancet. 1990; 335: 1544-1547Abstract PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 35McNeil H.P.

Haemost. 1991; 66: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Antiphospholipid antibodies are a very heterogeneous group of antibodies, which can be subdivided into lupus anticoagulants (LAC) and anticardiolipin antibodies, of which the latter can bind to β2GPI immobilized on cardiolipin surfaces (38Loizou S. McCrea J.D. Rudge A. Reynolds R. Boyle C.C. Harris E.N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1985; 62: 738-745PubMed Google Scholar, 39Harris E.N. Gharavi A.E. Boey M.L. Patel B.M. Mackworth-Young C.G. Loizou S. Hughes G.R.V. Lancet. 1983; 2: 1211-1214Abstract PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Antibodies with LAC activity are detected by their ability to prolong phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays (40Exner T. Triplett D.A. Taberner D. Machin S.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 65: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 41Brandt J.T. Triplett D.A. Alving B. Scharrer I. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The prolongation cannot be corrected by the addition of normal pool plasma, but can be corrected by the addition of extra phospholipids. Some of these lupus anticoagulants depend on prothrombin to prolong clotting time in vitro (42Permpikul P. Rao L.V.M. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1994; 83: 2878-2892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but most of them depend on β2GPI (43Oosting J.D. Derksen R.H.W.M. Entjes H.T.I. Bouma B.N. De Groot Ph.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1992; 67: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 44Roubey R.A.S. Pratt C.W. Buyon J.P. Winfield J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Two possible explanations for the mechanism of action of β2GPI-anti-β2GPI antibody complexes are suggested. First, β2GPI undergoes a conformational change when it interacts with anti-β2GPI antibodies (45Wagenknecht D.R. McIntyre J.A. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 69: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 46Ichikawa K. Khamashta M.A. Koike T. Matsuura E. Hughes G.R.V.

Second, β2GPI is able to form bivalent complexes when it interacts with an anti-β2GPI antibody (51Willems G.M. Janssen M.P. Pelsers M.A.L. Comfurius P. Galli M. Zwaal R.F.A. Bevers E.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13833-13842Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 52Arnout J. Wittevrongel C. Vanrusselt M. Hoylaerts M. Vermylen J. Thromb.

The final result is a strongly increased affinity of β2GPI for negatively charged phospholipids. Due to the increased affinity, β2GPI is then able to compete with clotting factors for the phospholipid surface, resulting in the in vitro prolongation of coagulation (54Takeya H. Mori T. Gabazza E.C. Kuroda K. Deguchi H. Matsuura E. Ichikawa K. Koike T. Suzuki K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, a covalent and a noncovalent chimeric dimer of β2GPI were constructed to determine the role of bivalent β2GPI complexes without the intervention of antibodies. It is shown that chimeric dimers of the dimerization domain of coagulation factor XI (apple 4) (55Meijers J.C.M. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Blood. 1992; 79: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and β2GPI were able to induce a strongly increased binding to phospholipids, resulting in a LAC activity. Human β2GPI cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. T. Kristensen (University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark) was subcloned into theBam HI site of pUC18. The nonphospholipid binding form β2GPI-W316S (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) of pUC18-β2GPI with the primers β2GPI-f (CA GTT CTC TGG CTT TTT GCA AAA CTG ATG CAT CCG ATG) and β2GPI-r (CAT CGG ATG CAT CAG TTT TCG AAA AAG CCA GAG AAC TG). The sequences in italic indicate the mutated codon. The sequence encoding the mature β2GPI protein was amplified with the primers β2GPI-Xho I (C CCTCGAGGA CGG ACC TGT CCC AAG CC) and β2GPI-Xba I (GC TCTAGAAAA CAA GTG TGA CAT TTT ATG TGG A) in a PCR reaction. To construct chimeric fusion proteins of the dimerization domain of factor XI (apple 4) and β2GPI, the PCR product was cloned withXho I and Xba I (underlined in β2GPI-Xho I and β2GPI-Xba I, respectively) into the vectors apple 4-tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-S478A and apple 4-C321S-tPA-S478A (56Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this way apple 4-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI were constructed. As controls, the chimers apple 2-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316, in which β2GPI-W316S is not able to bind to phospholipids, were made. For apple 2-β2GPI, the PCR product was cloned into apple 2-tPA-S478A with Xho I and Xba I (56Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S, the PCR product was cloned into apple 4-C321S-tPA-S478A (56Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed to confirm correct amplification of the β2GPI cDNA. Transfection of baby hamster kidney cells was performed as described previously (55Meijers J.C.M. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Blood. 1992; 79: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of all fusion constructs was performed in conditioned serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 1% UltroserG; Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom). Protein expression was measured using a total β2GPI-ELISA as described previously (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Apple-β2GPI fusion proteins were purified using a monoclonal antibody to β2GPI (21B2) bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bound fusion proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.7). The purified proteins were immediately neutralized with 1m Tris, pH 9. Apple 4-β2GPI, apple 4-C321S-β2GPI, and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S containing fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and were subjected to further purification on a mono S column using FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fusion proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient from 50 mm NaCl to 1 m NaCl. All chimers were dialyzed against TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The yield varied from 5 to 10 μg of protein/ml of culture medium. Purified constructs were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). β2GPI was isolated from freshly frozen citrated human plasma as described previously (33Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Donders R.C.J.M. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 916-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, dialyzed human plasma was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A50 column, subsequently followed by protein G-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, and finally heparin-Sepharose chromatography (all Sepharoses were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient. Afterward, β2GPI was dialyzed against TBS. Purity of the protein was checked with SDS-PAGE analysis. Fab fragments of the monoclonal anti-β2GPI-antibody 23H9, which is directed against domain 2, were generated using an ImmunoPure Fab kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). In short, IgG was incubated with papain-coated beads overnight at 37 °C, and Fc fragments and uncut IgG were removed on a protein-A Sepharose column. After SDS-PAGE, 23H9 Fab appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa under reducing conditions. The Fab fragments still recognize β2GPI. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay. Apple-β2GPI fusion proteins and β2GPI were applied to Superdex 200 gel filtration column using FPLC equipment. The column was equilibrated with TBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the eluent was monitored at 280 nm. Molecular masses were determined by comparison to a standard curve of chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine (PS), 40% phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or 20% PS and 80% PC (Sigma) were prepared according to Brunner et al. (57Brunner J. Skrabal P. Hauser H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) with some modifications as described by van Wijnen et al. (58Van Wijnen M. Stam J.G. Van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The phospholipid content of the fractions was determined by phosphate analysis (59Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). To measure binding of apple-β2GPI chimers and β2GPI to phospholipids, a solid phase binding assay according to Horbach et al. (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with some modifications was used. In short, 25 μm phospholipids (20% PS/80% PC and 20% PC/40% PC/40% PE vesicles) were coated in 96-well ELISA plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with TBS plus 0.5% gelatin for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by successive incubations with apple-β2GPI chimers or β2GPI (50 μl/well) for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and monoclonal antibody 2B2 (3 μg/ml; 50 μl/well; 1.5 h at 37 °C). Afterward, wells were incubated with a rabbit-anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000 diluted; 50 μl/well; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and developed usingo-phenylenediamine. All samples were diluted in TBS and 0.5% gelatin and after each incubation step, wells were washed three times with TBS. Nonspecific binding was determined in wells where phospholipids were absent. Glass coverslips (18 × 18 mm; Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) were soaked overnight in chromosulfuric acid, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, and air-dried. Human placenta collagen type III (Sigma) was solubilized in 50 mm acetic acid (1 mg/ml) and sprayed on glass coverslips at a final density of 30 μg/cm2 with a retouching air-brush (Badger model 100; Badger Brush Co., Franklin Park, IL). Perfusions were performed in a single-pass perfusion chamber. The perfusions were performed under nonpulsatile flow conditions using a parallel plate perfusion with a slit height of 0.1 mm and a slit width of 2 mm. Experiments were done with a flow rate of 58 μl/min (shear rate 300 s−1) (60van Zanten H.G. Saelman E.U.M. Schut Hese K.M. Wu Y.P. Slootweg P.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. De Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 3862-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a perfusion time of 3 min with collagen type III as a surface. Prewarmed (5 min at 37 °C) citrated blood (1/10 volume, 3.2% trisodium citrate) was drawn through the perfusion chamber by an infusion pump (pump 22, model 2400-004; Harvard, Natick, MA). Afterward, the coverslips were removed and rinsed with 10 mm HEPES buffer, containing 150 mm NaCl, followed by fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.005% glutardialdehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed glass coverslips were stored until use in PBS, 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.002% glutardialdehyde, pH 7.4. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and blocked for 10 min with PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4. After this, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with apple-β2GPI fusion proteins (10 μg/ml) diluted in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4, followed by three washes with PBS and 10 min of blocking with PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated for 45 min with the monoclonal anti-β2GPI antibody 2B2 diluted in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4 (10 μg/ml), at 37 °C, followed by three washes with PBS and 10 min of blocking with PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Afterward, the coverslips were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-mouse antibody (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), diluted 1:20 in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4, for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes with PBS. Finally, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and 0.1% para-phenylenediamine (Sigma). β2GPI-deficient plasma was made using a monoclonal antibody to β2GPI (21B2) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pooled normal plasma (10 ml) was applied to the column, and the flow-through plasma was collected in fractions of 0.5 ml and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Levels of β2GPI were determined using a total-β2GPI ELISA as described previously (9Horbach D.A. Van Oort E. Tempelman M.J. Derksen R.H.W.M. De Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and fractions containing less than 10% β2GPI were considered deficient. All assays were performed in a KC-10 coagulometer (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). For prothrombin time (PT), 25 μl of pooled normal plasma and 25 μl of apple-β2GPI fusion protein or plasma-derived β2GPI (final concentration, 0–200 μg/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by an incubation of 1.5 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of Innovin (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). Activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was measured with a test that has been sensitized to aid the detection of lupus anticoagulants, the PTT-LA (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France). 25 μl of pooled normal plasma and 25 μl of apple-β2GPI fusion protein or plasma-derived β2GPI (final concentration, 0–200 μg/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After addition of 50 μl of PTT-LA reagent, the samples were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 25 mm CaCl2. Dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) was measured with LAC screen (Gradipore Ltd, North Ryde, Australia). 25 μl of pooled normal plasma and 25 μl of apple-β2GPI fusion protein or plasma-derived β2GPI (final concentration, 0–200 μg/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by an incubation of 1.5 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by addition of 50 μl of LAC screen. Correction of clotting time was performed using PT and extra addition of cephalin. 25 μl of pooled normal plasma and 25 μl of a mixture of apple-β2GPI fusion protein (final concentration, 0–200 μg/ml) and cephalin (final concentration was 3.2 times the concentration used in a PTT according to the instructions of the manufacturer; PTT reagent, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by an incubation of 1.5 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of Innovin. The effect of monoclonal antibodies against β2GPI on clotting time in the presence of plasma-derived β2GPI or apple-β2GPI dimeric chimers was determined using PT. Two monoclonal anti-β2GPI antibodies with LAC activity were used. One was directed against domain four (19H9), and one was directed against domain two (23H9) of β2GPI (52Arnout J. Wittevrongel C. Vanrusselt M. Hoylaerts M. Vermylen J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). 25 μl of β2GPI-deficient plasma and 25 μl of a mixture of plasma-derived β2GPI or apple-β2GPI fusion protein (final concentration, 0 or 200 μg/ml) and a monoclonal antibody against β2GPI (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) or the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody 23H9 (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by an incubation of 1.5 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of Innovin (Dade Behring). Results were indicated in clotting time (seconds; mean ± S.D.,n = 3). Clotting times ≥ mean clotting time + 20% were considered to be positive. For the coagulation assays using monoclonal antibodies against β2GPI, only one representative experiment was shown. To study the effect of dimeric β2GPI on phospholipid binding and clotting time, chimeric constructs of β2GPI fused to the C terminus of the dimerization domain, apple 4, of factor XI were made (Fig. 1 A). Both a covalent (apple 4-β2GPI) and a noncovalent (apple 4-C321S-β2GPI) chimeric dimer were made. As controls, apple 2-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S, in which β2GPI-W316S is not able to bind to phospholipids, were constructed. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with expression vectors containing chimeric apple-β2GPI constructs. Protein expression was confirmed with a total β2GPI-ELISA. The proteins were affinity-purified with a monoclonal antibody against β2GPI. Apple 4-β2GPI, apple 4-C321S-β2GPI, and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S were further purified by FPLC with a mono S column. After purification, the fusion proteins were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1, B and C). Under nonreducing conditions apple 4-C321S-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S migrated as monomers with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa. Apple 2-β2GPI migrated slightly slower than apple 4-C321S-β2GPI and apple 4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S at 49 kDa, which is probably caused by glycosylation of apple 2. Apple 4-β2GPI migrated as a dimer under nonreducing conditions with a molecular mass of ∼110 kDa. Plasma-derived β2GPI migrated with a molecular mass of 42 kDa under nonreducing conditions. Upon reduction, all fusion proteins migrated as monomers with a molecular mass of 59 kDa for apple 2-β2GPI and 57 kDa for the other fusion proteins. Plasma-derived β2GPI migrated with a m"
https://openalex.org/W2055347503,"Mammary epithelial cells from p53 null mice have been shown recently to exhibit an increased risk for tumor development. Hormonal stimulation markedly increased tumor development in p53 null mammary cells. Here we demonstrate that mammary tumors arising in p53 null mammary cells are highly aneuploid, with greater than 70% of the tumor cells containing altered chromosome number and a mean chromosome number of 56. Normal mammary cells of p53 null genotype and aged less than 14 wk do not exhibit aneuploidy in primary cell culture. Significantly, the hormone progesterone, but not estrogen, increases the incidence of aneuploidy in morphologically normal p53 null mammary epithelial cells. Such cells exhibited 40% aneuploidy and a mean chromosome number of 54. The increase in aneuploidy measured in p53 null tumor cells or hormonally stimulated normal p53 null cells was not accompanied by centrosome amplification. These results suggest that normal levels of progesterone can facilitate chromosomal instability in the absence of the tumor suppressor gene, p53. The results support the emerging hypothesis based both on human epidemiological and animal model studies that progesterone markedly enhances mammary tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048123716,"The prion protein (PrP), a glycolipid-anchored membrane glycoprotein, contains a conserved hydrophobic sequence that can span the lipid bilayer in either direction, resulting in two transmembrane forms designated NtmPrP andCtmPrP. Previous studies have shown that the proportion ofCtmPrP is increased by mutations in the membrane-spanning segment, and it has been hypothesized that CtmPrP represents a key intermediate in the pathway of prion-induced neurodegeneration. To further test this idea, we have surveyed a number of mutations associated with familial prion diseases to determine whether they alter the proportions of NtmPrP andCtmPrP produced in vitro, in transfected cells, and in transgenic mice. For the in vitro experiments, PrP mRNA was translated in the presence of murine thymoma microsomes which, in contrast to the canine pancreatic microsomes used in previous studies, are capable of efficient glycolipidation. We confirmed that mutations within or near the transmembrane domain enhance the formation of CtmPrP, and we demonstrate for the first time that this species contains a C-terminal glycolipid anchor, thus exhibiting an unusual, dual mode of membrane attachment. However, we find that pathogenic mutations in other regions of the molecule have no effect on the amounts of CtmPrP and NtmPrP, arguing against the proposition that transmembrane PrP plays an obligate role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.

B. (ed) (1999) Prion Biology and Diseases, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar, 2Harris D.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These disorders include kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, “mad cow disease” in cattle, and scrapie in sheep. Prion diseases can have an infectious or genetic origin, or can arise spontaneously. The infectious agent is hypothesized to be PrPSc,1 a conformationally altered isoform of a normal cell-surface glycoprotein of unknown function called PrPC (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). PrPSc from dietary or other infectious sources is thought to act as a catalyst or template to convert endogenous PrPC into more PrPSc, which then accumulates, eventually causing disease. Familial forms of prion disease result from germline mutations in the PrP gene on chromosome 20, which are believed to favor conversion of the protein to the PrPSc form (4Young K. Piccardo P. Dlouhy S. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Prions: Molecular and Cellular Biology. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, United Kingdom1999: 139-175Google Scholar). Sporadic cases may be due to rare, spontaneous conversion of wild-type PrPC to PrPSc. No covalent modifications that distinguish PrPSc from PrPC have been detected (5Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson G.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), but the conformations of the two isoforms are dramatically different, with PrPSc having a much higher content of β-sheet (6Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). There are several biochemical properties that distinguish PrPSc from PrPC, the most prominent being protease resistance. After treatment with proteinase K (PK), PrPSc is cleaved near amino acid 90 to yield a protease-resistant core fragment known as PrP 27–30, while under the same conditions PrPC is completely degraded (8Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Weissmann C. Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). PrPSc is found in the brain in most cases of infectious, familial, and sporadic prion disease (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). However, in some inherited prion diseases, for example cases of Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome due to an A117V mutation in PrP, PrPSc has not been detected and brain material does not appear to be infectious when injected into rodents (9Tateishi J. Kitamoto T. Doh-ura K. Sakaki Y. Steinmetz G. Tranchant C. Warter J.M. Heldt N. Neurology. 1990; 40: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tateishi J. Kitamoto T.

These exceptions raise the interesting possibility that PrPSc, although it is the infectious form of the protein, may not be the proximate cause of neurodegeneration in at least some forms of prion disease. Recently, it has been proposed that an alternate form of PrP that is distinct from PrPSc may play an important role in prion pathogenesis. This form, designated CtmPrP, has an unusual transmembrane topology (12Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Most molecules of PrPC do not span the lipid bilayer and are attached to the cell surface exclusively by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor appended to the C terminus of the polypeptide chain (13Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast,CtmPrP is thought to span the membrane once, with its C terminus on the exofacial surface and a highly conserved, hydrophobic region in the center of the molecule (amino acids 111–134) serving as a transmembrane anchor. Another form of PrP, NtmPrP, has also been described with the same transmembrane segment, but the reverse orientation (N terminus on the exofacial surface) (12Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R.

It has been proposed that the relative proportions of these three topological variants is influenced by as yet unidentified accessory proteins that interact with the translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (15Hegde R.S.

Recent studies have brought the potential biological relevance of transmembrane forms of PrP into sharper focus. These species were originally observed only after translation of PrP mRNA in vitro on rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ ribosomes in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes (17Hay B.

In more recent investigations, however, CtmPrP has been identified in brain membranes from transgenic mice that express PrP molecules carrying mutations within or near the transmembrane domain; in vitro translation experiments had indicated that these mutations increased the relative proportion of CtmPrP (12Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P.

Transgenic mice expressing such CtmPrP-favoring mutations at high levels develop a spontaneous neurodegenerative illness that bears some similarities to scrapie, but without the presence of PrPSc (12Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). There is also indirect evidence thatCtmPrP accumulates in mice expressing wild-type PrP during the course of scrapie infection (22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it has been hypothesized that CtmPrP represents a common intermediate in the pathogenesis of both infectious and genetic prion diseases (22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this view, CtmPrP is the ultimate cause of neurodegeneration, and PrPSc acts indirectly by increasing the amount of CtmPrP.

The mutations analyzed in those investigations lie outside of the conserved hydrophobic region that serves as a transmembrane anchor in CtmPrP and NtmPrP. To test the hypothesis that transmembrane PrP is part of a general pathway for prion-related neurodegeneration, we undertook here to determine whether these mutations induce the formation of NtmPrP andCtmPrP in vitro, in cultured cells, and in transgenic mice. We confirm that mutations in the central, hydrophobic region enhance formation of transmembrane PrP, and we demonstrate for the first time that CtmPrP contains a C-terminal GPI anchor as well as a transmembrane segment, thus exhibiting two modes of membrane attachment. However, we find that pathogenic mutations in other regions of the molecule have no effect on the amounts ofCtmPrP and NtmPrP, arguing against the possibility that transmembrane PrP plays an obligate role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. P45–66 antibody, raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing amino acids 45–66 of mouse PrP, has been described previously (14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Monoclonal antibody 3F4, which recognizes an epitope from hamster and human PrP encompassing residues 109–112 (28Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M.

R20 antibody, raised against a synthetic peptide comprising residues 218–232 of mouse PrP (29Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J.

Anti-calnexin antibody was fromStressgen (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). All mouse PrP cDNAs were cloned into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and carried an epitope tag for monoclonal antibody 3F4 created by changing residues 108 and 111 to methionine. The following mutations were introduced into the wild-type PrP cDNA using polymerase chain reaction as described previously (14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar): PG11 (six-octapeptide insertion), PG14 (eight-octapeptide insertion), K109I/H110I, 3AV (Ala → Val at 112, 114, and 117), A116V, D177N, V179I, F197S, E199K, and V209I. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI and gel-purified. In vitro transcriptions were performed with the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Messenger RNAs were translated with [35S]methionine in a final volume of 25 μl containing 50% nuclease-treated, rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promgea, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Canine pancreatic microsomal membranes were purchased from Promega, or were prepared by the method of Walter and Blobel (30Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Microsomes from BW5147.3 mouse thymoma cells were prepared as described (31Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4686-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization and passage through a 27-gauge needle. Pancreatic and thymoma microsomes were used at 1.5 and 5 μl per translation reaction, respectively, to equalize the amounts of ER marker proteins added. In some reactions, an oligosaccharide acceptor peptide (Bz-N-G-T-Ac; Bachem, Torrance, CA) was used at a final concentration of 0.5 mm to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. Translation reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. To detect protease-protected products, 5 μl aliquots of translation reactions were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl with 100 μg/ml PK (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2 for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to terminate digestion. Some digestion reactions also contained 0.5% Triton X-100 to solubilize membranes. Samples were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, or they were first subjected to immunoprecipitation or treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) as described below. Radioactive bands on gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Aliquots of the translation reactions were boiled in the presence of 1% SDS for 5 min to denature the proteins, and were then diluted with 10 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors (pepstatin A and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm). One μl of the appropriate anti-PrP antibody was added, and samples incubated on ice for 60 min. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. Beads were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, after which proteins were eluted with 1% SDS in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and subjected to deglycosylation with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Following methanol precipitation, proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Five μl aliquots of translation reactions were diluted to 200 μl with 1% Triton X-114 (precondensed as described (Ref. 32Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, samples were subjected to phase partitioning by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min to separate the phases. The aqueous phase was removed, and the detergent phase diluted to 200 μl with PBS containing protease inhibitors and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. One unit of PIPLC from Bacillus thuringiensis (prepared as described in Ref. 33Shyng S.L. Moulder K.L. Lesko A. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was added to one half of the diluted detergent phase, and both halves were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The phase separation was repeated, and proteins in the second set of aqueous and detergent phases either were precipitated with methanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 3F4 antibody. BHK cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin. CHO cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection by brief trypsinization or by mechanical detachment, rinsed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 250 μl of 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After 5 min on ice, cells were lysed by 10 passages through silastic tubing (0.3 mm, inner diameter) connecting two syringes with 27-gauge needles (34Lehmann S. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12047-12051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g for 2 min. PK protection assays were performed by incubating post-nuclear supernatants in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 μg/ml PK, and in some cases 0.5% Triton X-100. After 60 min at 22 °C, digestion was terminated by addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were deglycosylated with peptide:N-glycosidase F prior to analysis by Western blotting. Fresh brain tissue (∼0.5 g wet weight) was homogenized using a Dounce apparatus in 5 ml of Buffer B (0.25m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), followed by passage (five times each) through 16-, 18-, 21-, 23-, and 27-gauge needles. The homogenate was centrifuged first at 12,000 × g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, and then at 541,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor, and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of Buffer B. PK protection assays were carried out as described above for transfected cells, except that PK was used at 50 μg/ml. PrP is attached to the cell surface via a C-terminal GPI anchor (13Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In carrying out studies of the membrane topology of PrP after in vitro translation, it would thus be desirable to utilize microsomal membranes that are capable of attaching the GPI anchor to newly synthesized polypeptides. Previous investigations have employed microsomes derived from canine pancreas, which do not effectively carry out GPI anchor addition (35Fasel N. Rousseaux M. Schaerer E. Medoff M.E. Tykocinski M.L. Bron C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6858-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore tested microsomes derived from BW5147.3 murine thymoma cells, which have been reported to be much more efficient in GPI anchoring (31Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4686-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We translated mouse PrP mRNA in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of pancreatic or thymoma microsomes, and then incubated Triton X-114 lysates of the membranes with or without PIPLC, a bacterial phospholipase that cleaves the GPI anchor. By partitioning the lysate into detergent and aqueous phases, we could then score the amount of PrP that had been rendered hydrophilic by removal of the anchor. As shown in Fig.1, all translation reactions produced two groups of products of 32 and 25 kDa, representing, respectively, core-glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of PrP. The latter correspond to molecules that had not been translocated into the lumen of the microsomes, since they are susceptible to digestion with PK (see below). Less than 10% of the PrP chains translated in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes shifted into the aqueous phase after PIPLC treatment, indicating that very few molecules carried a GPI anchor (lanes 1–4). In contrast, about 50–60% of the glycosylated protein produced in the presence of thymoma microsomes shifted into the aqueous phase, indicating relatively efficient GPI anchoring (lanes 5–8). Untranslocated PrP chains, although they lack a GPI anchor, are retained in the detergent phase, presumably because they contain both N- and C-terminal signal peptides that are hydrophobic. Of note, PrP molecules shifted into the aqueous phase migrated with a slightly lower mobility than those that remained in the detergent phase (compare lanes 7and 8), a phenomenon that is typical for polypeptides that have lost their GPI anchor (37Rosenberry T.L. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 1133-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We believe that the actual efficiency of anchor addition by thymoma microsomes may be even higher than 60%, and that the persistence of some glycosylated PrP in the detergent phase after PIPLC treatment is likely to reflect inefficient PIPLC digestion and phase partitioning. In support of this idea, when samples were denatured in SDS prior to PIPLC treatment, to improve accessibility of proteins to the phospholipase, essentially all of the glycosylated PrP was converted to the more slowly migrating band (not shown). In contrast, PIPLC treatment after SDS denaturation did not alter the gel mobility of PrP synthesized with pancreatic microsomes. To detect transmembrane forms of PrP, translation products were subjected to digestion by PK, which cleaves off portions of the polypeptide chain residing on the external side of the microsomal membrane and leaves transmembrane and lumenal domains intact. Samples were then immunoprecipitated with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 to eliminate globin contamination contributed by the reticulocyte lysate, which obscures visualization of low molecular weight PrP fragments. Proteins were also subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation to reveal differences in the sizes of PrP species independent of glycosylation state. After PK digestion of translation reactions containing either canine pancreatic or thymoma microsomes, wild-type PrP was resolved into three forms of 25, 19, and 15 kDa (Fig.2, A and B,lane 2). The 25-kDa form is the same size as PrP before protease treatment (lane 1) and therefore represents molecules that are completely protected from digestion, and which therefore have been fully translocated into the microsome lumen; for consistency with an earlier report (12Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), we refer to this form asSecPrP. The two smaller fragments are derived from transmembrane species whose cytoplasmic domains have been digested by the protease, and whose lumenal and transmembrane domains have been protected by the microsome. No PrP is detected after PK treatment in the presence of a detergent that disrupts the microsomal membrane (lane 3), confirming that the 19- and 15-kDa fragments do not represent intrinsically protease-resistant portions of the molecule. As will be shown below, the 19-kDa fragment derives fromCtmPrP, a species whose C terminus resides in the ER lumen, and the 15-kDa fragment from NtmPrP, a species whose N terminus is lumenal. Consistent with previous studies (12Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R.

Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we find that two mutations in the central hydrophobic region of the PrP molecule increase the relative amount of CtmPrP with little change in the amount of NtmPrP (Fig. 2, A and B,lanes 4–9; TableI). A116V is the mouse homologue of a mutation in human PrP (A117V) that is associated with Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (38Tranchant C. Doh-ura K. Warter J.M. Steinmetz G. Chevalier Y. Hanauer A.

We have previously shown that phosphorylation of threonine 422 in the α1B calcium channel domain I-II linker region resulted in a dramatic reduction in somatostatin receptor-mediated G-protein inhibition of the channels and that the I-II linker consequently serves as an integration center for cross-talk between protein kinase C (PKC) and G-proteins (Hamid, J., Nelson, D., Spaetgens, R., Dubel, S.

Here we show that opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of N-type channels is affected to a lesser extent compared with that seen with somatostatin receptors, hinting at the possibility that PKC/G-protein cross-talk might be dependent on the G-protein subtype. To address this issue, we have examined the effects of four different types of G-protein β subunits on both wild type and mutant α1Bcalcium channels in which residue 422 has been replaced by glutamate to mimic PKC-dependent phosphorylation and on channels that have been directly phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Our data show that phosphorylation or mutation of residue 422 antagonizes the effect of Gβ1 on channel activity, whereas Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4 are not affected. Our data therefore suggest that the observed cross-talk between G-proteins and protein kinase C modulation of N-type channels is a selective feature of the Gβ1 subunit.

Finally, it has been shown that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit antagonizes receptor-mediated G-protein inhibition of the channel (1Swartz K.J.

This phenomenon (termed PKC1/G-protein cross-talk) appears to be mediated by a single threonine residue (Thr-422) in the α1B domain I-II linker region (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For somatostatin receptor-induced G-protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels, mutation of Thr-422 to glutamic acid mimics the antagonistic effect of protein kinase C on G protein inhibition, whereas a switch to alanine precludes the occurrence of PKC/G-protein cross-talk (4Hamid J.

Here we have examined the dependence of PKC/G-protein cross-talk on the nature of the G protein β subunit isoform. Using transient expression of either wild type or mutant (T422E) N-type calcium channels in combination with various G-protein β subunit isoforms (Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4), we show that the effect of only the Gβ1 isoform is reduced in the “permanently phosphorylated” mutant N-type channel. PKC/G-protein cross-talk thus appears to be a selective feature of the Gβ1 subunit isoform. In view of the notion that different types of G-protein-coupled receptors may combine with specific subsets of Gαβγ combinations (20Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this may suggest that the extent of cross-talk occurring in intact neurons could be dependent on the type of neurotransmitter involved, thus providing a mechanism for the fine tuning of calcium homeostasis. The calcium channel cDNA constructs (α1B, α1B(T422E), β1b, α2-δ) were the same as those discussed previously in Hamid et al. (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Wild type constructs were kindly donated by Dr. T. P. Snutch. The cloning of the various Gβ-subunits is described in detail by Arnot et al. (16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding for green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was purchased from CLONTECH. Human embryonic kidney tsa-201 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to 85% confluency, split with trypsin-EDTA, and plated on glass coverslips at 5–10% confluency about 12 h before transfection. Immediately before transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and a standard calcium phosphate protocol was used to transiently transfect the cells with cDNA constructs encoding for mutant and wild type calcium channel α1, β1b, and α2-δ subunits and green fluorescent protein as an expression marker and as appropriate with G-protein subunits or the μ-opioid receptor. After 12 h, cells were washed with fresh medium, allowed to recover for 12 h, and then incubated at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–3 days prior to recording. The exact whole cell recording procedures have been described in detail previously (16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The external recording solution was comprised of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mmglucose, and 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2), recording pipettes were filled with 108 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and showed typical resistances of 2 to 4 megaohms. For experiments involving opioid receptor activation, the intracellular solution was supplemented with 40 μm GTP. DAMGO (purchased from RBI) was dissolved in water at a stock concentration of 2 mm, diluted into the recording solution at a final concentration of 1 μm, and perfused directly into the vicinity of the cells via a gravity-driven microperfusion system. Typically, cells were held at −100 mV and currents were elicited upon depolarizations to various test potentials. Tonic G-protein inhibition of the channels was assessed by application of strong depolarizing prepulses (to +150 mV) followed by a test depolarization to +20 mV (see Refs. 8Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and 16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The time course of development of prepulse relief was determined by varying the duration of the prepulse (Δt1) while leaving the duration between the prepulse and the test pulse constant at 5 ms (see Fig. 2). The reinhibition kinetics were determined by applying a 50-ms prepulse, followed by a test pulse spaced from the prepulse at variable intervals (Δt2). The total degree of prepulse relief was obtained by extrapolating the exponential decay of the prepulse effect back to timet2 = 0 (see Ref. 16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thus allowing us to assess the degree of prepulse relief without contamination from reinhibition. For the experiment in Fig. 2, the data were obtained at a fixed interval of 4 ms between the prepulse and the test pulse. For experiments involving PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the channels, the phorbol ester PMA was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 2 mm, diluted into the recording solution at a final concentration of 30 nm, and perfused directly onto the cell with a gravity-driven microperfusion system. Western blots on cell lysates generated from transfected or sham-transfected tsa-201 cells were carried out as described in detail by Jarvis et al. (21Jarvis S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Antibodies to G protein β subunits were purchased from Santa Cruz Laboratories (anti-Gβ2 and anti-Gβ3) and from Transduction Laboratories (anti-Gβ1/4). Immunoblots were subjected to chemiluminescence analysis using ECL plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected on film. Data were analyzed using Clampfit software. Preparation of figures and statistical analysis was performed via SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Error bars are standard errors, p values reflect Student's ttests. We have previously shown that activation of protein kinase C in tsa-201 cells reduces a somatostatin receptor-induced G-protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A point mutation in the domain I-II linker region of the channel (T422E) mimicked the effects of PKC activation, whereas a substitution to alanine precluded the effects of PKC on G-protein inhibition. We concluded that PKC/G-protein cross-talk occurs via phosphorylation of threonine 422 (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To assess whether this effect was selective for somatostatin receptors, we coexpressed μ-opioid receptors with wild type or mutant (T422E) N-type (α1B, β1b, α2-δ) calcium channels and applied 1 μm DAMGO to trigger G protein inhibition of the channels via the receptor. As seen in Fig. 1, wild type channels underwent a robust, reversible inhibition by 56 ± 4% in response to opioid receptor activation. In contrast, the T422E mutant exhibited a reduced degree of G-protein inhibition (32 ± 3%), in accord with our assertion that a negative charge (which permanently mimics phosphorylation) in position 422 reduces G protein efficacy. A comparison with our previous work with somatostatin receptors (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), however, shows that the somatostatin receptor-mediated inhibition of N-type calcium channels was significantly more strongly affected than the μ-opioid response (20 ± 3% versus 32 ± 3%, p < 0.05), whereas the wild type channels were similarly inhibited by both pathways (DAMGO, 56 ± 4%; somatostatin, 53 ± 5%,p > 0.05). Although the latter observation indicates that both receptor types are equally effectively coupled to wild type N-type channels in tsa-201 cells, the observation with the T422E mutant suggests that there are nonetheless differences in the way the two receptor types couple to the channels. It is possible that the two receptor types couple to the channels via different G-protein heterotrimer compositions, which may be differentially affected by the presence of the T422E mutation.Figure 1Cross-talk between G-protein modulation and PKC-dependent phosphorylation of N-type calcium channels. A, schematic representation of the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit. The α1 subunit consists of four homologous domains that are linked by large intracellular loops (30Catterall W.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1499-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic linker between domains I and II is one of the prime targets for binding of Gβγ subunits (12Zamponi G.W.

Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Residue Thr-422 forms the core of a protein kinase C consensus site (see amino acid sequence) which underlies G-protein PKC cross-talk (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P.

Note that a mutation that permanently mimics phosphorylation of residue 422 affects the somatostatin receptor-mediated inhibition significantly more strongly than that induced by μ-opioid receptor activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The key G-protein species involved in direct inhibition of N-type calcium channels is the Gβ subunit (5Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 6Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, five different types of Gβ subunits have been identified in mammalian brain (17Garcia D.E. Li B. Garcia-Ferreiro R.E. Hernandez-Ochoa E.O. Yan K. Gautam N. Catterall W.A. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9163-9170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that N-type channels expressed in tsa-201 cells are most effectively inhibited by Gβ1and Gβ3, whereas Gβ4 and Gβ2mediate a somewhat smaller inhibition, and Gβ5 is ineffective and is thus not further considered here (16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that PKC/G-protein cross-talk might preferentially affect a subset of the Gβ subunit isoforms, we coexpressed wild type channels with one of four different Gβ subtypes (+Gγ2) and used a strong depolarizing prepulse to compare the resulting tonic G-protein inhibition before and after phosphorylation of the channel by protein kinase C (elicited by 2-min application of 30 nm PMA). As shown in Fig. 2, in cells expressing Gβ1, the degree of prepulse relief became reduced from 2.4 ± 0.3 to 1.4 ± 0.1 (n = 7, p < 0.02, paired t test) following PMA treatment, whereas inhibition by the three other G-protein β subunit subtypes was not significantly altered (Fig. 2 B). Thus, these data suggest that PKC/G-protein cross-talk selectively affects Gβ1-mediated responses. Although N-type calcium channels expressed in tsa-201 cells show only negligible background G-protein inhibition in the absence of exogenous Gβγ (16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is true that these cells contain endogenous G protein βγ subunits that are presumably complexed as αβγ heterotrimers. To assess the likelihood of contamination of our results by endogenously present Gβ proteins, we carried out Western blot analysis of control cells and cells transfected with either one of the four Gβ subunits. As seen in Fig. 2 C, exogenous expression of each of the four subtypes tested resulted in a substantial increase in Gβ levels compared with those found in control cells, confirming that the exogenously expressed subunits are the predominant G-protein species in transfected cells. To obtain an indication of the change in affinity of the channels for the G-proteins, which occurs after phosphorylation, we utilized dynamic prepulse protocols to determine the time constants of recovery from inhibition (by varying prepulse duration) and reinhibition after the prepulse (by varying the duration between the prepulse and the test pulse, see Fig. 3 A). However, after prolonged application of PMA (>3 min), we noted that current levels began to run down, which would interfere with the accuracy of these types of experiments. Hence, we chose to utilize the T422E mutant for our kinetic measurements. Fig. 3 B shows that the T422E mutant behaved like the phosphorylated wild type channel with regard to the Gβ subtype dependence of cross-talk, such that the mutation induced a selective decrease in the degree of prepulse relief seen in the presence of Gβ1 (wild type, 2.8 ± 0.3; T422E, 1.9 ± 0.1;p < 0.05) whereas the facilitation ratios of the three remaining G-protein β subunit isoforms did not differ significantly from those obtained with the wild type channels (note, however, that the data shown in Figs. 2 B and 3 B were obtained by slightly different protocols, and hence, absolute values for the degree of prepulse relief are not directly comparable). As seen in Fig. 3 C, the T422E mutation selectively reduced the time constant of recovery from Gβ1 inhibition (wild type, 11.0 ± 0.6 ms; T422E, 8.0 ± 0.6 ms; p < 0.05), indicating that one of the consequences of the T422E mutation is a slight destabilization of the Gβ1-channel complex. In addition, the time course of Gβ1 reinhibition after the prepulse (Fig. 3 D) was slowed 3-fold as a result of the T422E mutation (wild type, 18.5 ± 2.4 ms; T422E, 51.7 ± 4.7 ms; p < 0.05). Interestingly, a small increase in the time course of reinhibition was also observed with Gβ2(WT, 46.2 ± 6.3 ms; T422E, 27.8 ± 4.1 ms; p< 0.05), indicating that the T422E mutation may exert subtle effects on this subunit. Overall, however, the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3indicate that a mutagenically phosphorylated threonine residue in position 422 affects predominantly the inhibition of N-type calcium channels by Gβ1 subunits. To date, little is known about the association of individual types of seven helix transmembrane receptors with specific subsets of G-protein subunits. It has been shown, however, that antisense depletion of Gβ1 subunits abolishes somatostatin receptor signaling in rat pituitary GH3 cells (22Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that somatostatin receptors exclusively couple to Gβ1subunits, which can account nicely for our observation that the T422E mutation dramatically reduced the G-protein inhibition induced by both overexpression of Gβ1 and upon activation of somatostatin receptors. In contrast, it is possible that the μ-opioid receptor couples to N-type calcium channels through more than one type of G-protein β subunit. Whereas the observation that the opioid response was reduced in the T422E mutant would suggest that at least part of the opioid signaling is mediated by Gβ1, our data showing that the opioid and somatostatin responses were not equally affected by the T422E substitution (Fig. 1 D), however, support a mechanism in which μ-opioid receptors may couple to a mixed population of G-protein β subunit isoforms. This scenario would account for the intermediate response we observed. The data shown in Fig. 3, C and D, provide some insights into the molecular mechanisms by which cross-talk may occur. It is now widely accepted that Gβγ physically interacts with the N-type calcium channel domain I-II linker region (8Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 24Herlitze S. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), thus phosphorylation events or amino acid substitutions occurring in this region may affect the binding interactions between the channel and the Gβγ dimers. Consistent with such an effect, the T422E substitution resulted in a significant decrease in the time constant for development of facilitation during the prepulse and an increase in the time constant for reinhibition after the prepulse. In view of evidence that G proteins must physically dissociate from the channel during the prepulse (8Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), these changes in kinetics likely reflect a change in the G-protein association and dissociation kinetics, and thus an overall reduction in the affinity of the channel for Gβ1, which may also account for the reduction in the degree of prepulse relief seen with the T422E mutant. Our experiments do not permit us to provide an absolute value for the PKC-induced changes in the equilibrium dissociation constant between the G proteins and the channels, because the kinetics for recovery from inhibition during the prepulse (+150 mV) and reinhibition after the prepulse (i.e. repolarization to −100 mV) were obtained at different voltages. Nonetheless, based on the 3-fold decrease in reinhibition kinetics and the 1.4-fold speeding of the recovery time constant, we estimate that the presence of the T422E mutation may perhaps result in an ∼5-fold change in Gβ1 affinity. An important aspect to consider is control over the G protein expression levels in our experiments. Our Western blot analysis shows that each of the four Gβ subtypes expressed well in tsa-201 cells, indicating that the exogenously expressed G-protein subunits are much more abundant than endogenously present Gβ, although it is difficult to predict relative expression levels among the four Gβ subtypes from Western blots as antibody sensitivity may vary. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2 B, the inhibition of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated channels by each Gβ subtype was studies in the same cell, and hence, at a constant Gβ concentration. In the experiments shown in Fig. 3 B, the effects of each Gβ subtype on wild type and mutant channels needed was assessed in different cells. However, for each given Gβ subtype, wild type and mutant channels were studied under identical conditions, thus attributing any changes in channel inhibition to residue 422 rather than Gβ levels. Both types of experiments resulted in essentially the same result, namely that only Gβ1-mediated responses were affected by phosphorylation/mutation of the channel. Although in vivo evidence supporting our conclusions is still lacking, it is tempting to speculate about the implications of observations for neurotransmission: calcium influx through N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels is essential for the fast release of neurotransmitter (25Williams M.E. Brust P.F. Feldman D.H. Patthi S. Simerson S. Maroufi A. McCue A.F. Velicelebi G. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M. Science. 1992; 257: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Regulation of presynaptic calcium channel activity by cytoplasmic messenger molecules is thus an essential means for the precise control of neurotransmission. The activation of opioid receptors, for example, depresses synaptic activity (13Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Stefani A. Surmeier D.J. Bernardi G. Brain Res. 1994; 642: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and tonic G-protein inhibition at presynaptic nerve termini contributes to paired pulse facilitation (27Stuart G.J. Redman S.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 126: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Bertram R. Behan M. J. Comput.

We have previously presented evidence that integration of protein kinase C and Gβγ pathways by the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit can produce multiple levels of current activity (4Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). If our results are extrapolated to an in vivo situation, the notion that the extent of this integration appears to depend on the type of Gβ subunit isoform present may provide additional avenues by which neurotransmitter receptors may regulate calcium homeostasis in the presynapse. Together with the notion that different types of G-protein β subunits do not only affect N-type channel activity to different degrees (16Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Garcia D.E. Li B. Garcia-Ferreiro R.E. Hernandez-Ochoa E.O. Yan K. Gautam N. Catterall W.A. Mackie K. Hille B. J.

Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the unique activation of specific Gβγ combinations by different types of seven-helix transmembrane receptors could provide a highly complex regulatory mechanism for the fine tuning of presynaptic calcium levels and, thus, neurotransmitter release.

https://openalex.org/W2081384426,"There is no definite information available on the structural characteristics of IgE binding epitopes on allergenic molecules, although it is widely accepted that most of them are conformational. In the current study we aimed to characterize the IgE epitope of Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, by the application of phage display peptide libraries. We purified IgE specific for Bet v 1 from allergic patients' sera to select mimotopes representing artificial IgE epitopes by biopanning of phage libraries. By linear alignment, it was not possible to attribute mimotope sequences to the primary structure of Bet v 1. We developed a computer-aided, 3-dimensional coarse-grained epitope search. The 3-dimensional search, followed by statistical analysis, revealed an exposed area on the Bet v 1 molecule (located between residues 9-22 and 104-123) as the IgE binding structure. The IgE epitope was located at a 30 A distance from a previously described IgG epitope and the respective mimotope, designated Bet mim E. Such mimotopes could potentially be used for the induction of IgG capable of interfering with the IgE/allergen interaction. To test this hypothesis, we immunized BALB/c mice with the phage-displayed Bet mim E. Immunizations resulted in the induction of Bet v 1-specific IgG, which was able to block the IgE binding to Bet v 1 in vitro. Based on these observations, we propose that immunotherapy with IgE mimotopes generated by biopannings result in formation of blocking IgG. We conclude that mimotope immunotherapy may represent a new and promising concept for treatment of type I allergic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1988431691,"This study addresses the mechanisms by which a defect in CFTR impairs pancreatic duct bicarbonate secretion in cystic fibrosis. We used control (PANC-1) and CFTR-deficient (CFPAC-1; DeltaF508 mutation) cell lines and measured HCO3- extrusion by the rate of recovery of intracellular pH after an alkaline load and recorded whole cell membrane currents using patch clamp techniques. 1) In PANC-1 cells, cAMP causes parallel activation of Cl- channels and of HCO3- extrusion by DIDS-sensitive and Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange, both effects being inhibited by Cl- channel blockers NPPB and glibenclamide. 2) In CFPAC-1 cells, cAMP fails to stimulate Cl-/HCO3- exchange and Cl- channels, except after promoting surface expression of DeltaF508-CFTR by glycerol treatment. Instead, raising intracellular Ca2+ concentration to 1 micromol/l or stimulating purinergic receptors with ATP (10 and 100 micromol/l) leads to parallel activation of Cl- channels and HCO3- extrusion. 3) K+ channel function is required for coupling cAMP- and Ca2+-dependent Cl- channel activation to effective stimulation of Cl-/HCO3- exchange in control and CF cells, respectively. It is concluded that stimulation of pancreatic duct bicarbonate secretion via Cl-/HCO3- exchange is directly correlated to activation of apical membrane Cl- channels. Reduced bicarbonate secretion in cystic fibrosis results from defective cAMP-activated Cl- channels. This defect is partially compensated for by an increased sensitivity of CF cells to purinergic stimulation and by alternative activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels, mechanisms of interest with respect to possible treatment of cystic fibrosis and of related chronic pancreatic diseases."

Therefore, the KRKXXXXXXXX KKK motif may be a bipartite NLS driving the protein into nuclei. Yeast RAD27Δ cells transformed with human mutant Mkrk survived poorly upon methyl methanesulfonate treatment or when they were incubated at an elevated temperature. flap endonuclease-1 green fluorescence protein, MMS, methyl methanesulfonate nuclear localization signal polymerase chain reaction proliferating cell nuclear antigen xeroderma pigmentosum group G propidium iodide fluorescein isothiocyanate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline wild type DNA replication and repair are critical for maintaining genome stability. These processes are in part dependent on the activity of an emerging family of structure-specific endonucleases. These enzymes, typified by flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1),1 are multifunctional. They possess both flap-specific endo- and nick-specific exo(ribo)nuclease activities and interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (1Lieber M.R.

The fact that FEN-1 is critical for preserving the integrity of a genome is underscored by recent work showing thatRAD27 (FEN-1 homologue) null mutants inSaccharomyces cerevisiae have a strong mutator phenotype. This phenotype is a result of duplication mutations arising from the inability of the cells to process correctly the RNA primers associated with Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA replication (15Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88 (263): 263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Duplication mutations are associated with several human disorders such as recessive retinitis pigmentosa, lethal junctional epidermolysis bullosa, familial hypertropic cardiomyopathy, and various cancers. In addition, FEN-1 helps to prevent trinucleotide repeat expansion and contraction, as a deletion of RAD27 in S. cerevisiae results in length-dependent destabilization of CTG tracts and a marked increase in expansion frequency (16Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 17Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X.

Trinucleotide expansions are involved in genetic diseases such as myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, ataxias, and fragile X syndrome. Nuclear localization is an important component of the ability of the cell to regulate DNA replication, repair, and other biological functions. Transport occurs through the nuclear pore complex (18Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 19Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The nuclear pore allows small molecules to diffuse freely into and out of the nucleus (18Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 19Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Targeting of larger proteins to the nucleus usually requires the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (19Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A variety of proteins such as heat shock protein factor 2, p53, transcription factors, DNA repair complex hRad51/BRCA1, and xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) nuclease have a nuclear localization signal (20Baeuerle P.A.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 949-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two major types of NLSs are recognized as follows: 1) a single cluster of basic amino acids, exemplified by the SV40 T antigen NLS; and 2) a bipartite NLS composed of one cluster of two basic amino acids, a spacer region of 10–12 amino acids, followed by another basic cluster, as found in nucleoplasmin (18Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 27Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). To function, DNA replication and repair proteins have to migrate into the nucleus after they are translated in the cytoplasm since their target DNA substrates are located in nucleus. Previously identified NLSs in DNA repair proteins are bipartite (28Friedberg E.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutations of the NLS motif may not only alter regulation of protein movement but also affect their cellular functions, which in humans may cause diseases. The NLS of the DNA repair protein XPG resides in the C-terminal region (amino acid residues 1164–1185) and is essential for the formation of foci and for response to UV damage (22Park M.S. Knauf J.A. Pendergrass S.H. Coulon C.H. Strniste G.F. Marrone B.L. MacInnes M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8368-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Knauf J.A. Pendergrass S.H. Marrone B.L. Strniste G.F. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The distribution of XPG proteins could also regulate the rate of DNA repair within transcriptionally active and inactive compartments of the cell nucleus. Recently, the NLS of mammalian DNA replication ligase (ligase I) has been identified at residues 119–131 (30Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzyme has an additional motif of ∼20 amino acids at their N terminus, which functions as a replication factory targeting sequence. This motif, consisting of two clusters of bulky and positively charged residues, is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). DNA ligase I is recruited to sites of DNA replication by an interaction with PCNA. It was proposed that there are three motifs of the FEN-1 nuclease responsible for three distinct functions as follows: nuclease activities, PCNA interaction, and nuclear localization (1Lieber M.R. BioEssays. 1996; 19: 233-240Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D.J. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 26 amino acids of hFEN-1 are basic and conserved in the FEN-1/XPG family and may be involved in nuclear localization (31Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that FEN-1 nuclease localizes into the nucleus in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in response to DNA damage in human HeLa cells. Truncational and site-directed mutagenesis in the C-terminal NLS motif was carried out for in vitro and in vivo functional analysis in both mammalian and yeast cells. Truncation of the signal domain effectively blocked nuclear localization in vivo but had no effect on nuclease activity and PCNA interaction in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that KRKXXXXXXXX KKK is a bipartite NLS since substitution of KRK with alanines completely eliminate the nuclear localization, whereas KKK mutagenesis partially abolishes the function. An NLS-defective FEN-1 transformed into yeast null mutant cells resulted in an increased sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment and slower growth at an elevated temperature. These results indicate that the NLS is essential to the FEN-1-dependent cellular responses to environmental stresses. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at the City of Hope Cancer Center core facility. Sources of plasmid vectors used in this study for subcloning, mutagenesis, and expression are detailed below. Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit, PCR-cloning kit, andEscherichia coli strain XL1 blue competent cells were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [α−32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyclonal antibody against human FEN-1 protein was custom-produced at Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The anti-FEN-1 serum was collected from a rabbit after three boosts and stored at −80 °C. Monoclonal antibody against human FEN-1 protein was purchased from Novus (Littleton, CO). Secondary antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nylon membrane was purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Fast purification liquid chromatography accessories and reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Yeast culture media, including YPD, synthetic complete (SC), minimal sporulation, and synthetic dextrose minimal (SD), were prepared according to Sherman et al. (32Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Cell cycle inhibitors (mimosine and nocodazole), amino acids, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. cDNA for human FEN-1 was the laboratory stock as described previously (33Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Vectors for expression, subcloning, and mutagenesis included pBSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for subcloning and mutagenesis, pEGFP-N1 N-terminal protein fusion vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for the expression of FEN-1 proteins fused with GFP in human cells, and pET-28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) for protein overexpression in E. coli. The pBSK plasmid with the insertion of wild type FEN-1 was used for site-directed mutagenesis to give rise to the following three mutants. Mkrk has the mutation of KRK at residues 354–356 to AAA using the primers 5′GCTCACTCTCTTCAGCTGCGGCTGCTGAGCCAGAACCCAAGG3′ and 5′CCTTGGGTTCTGGCTCAGCAGCCGCAGCTGAAGAGAGTGAGC3′. Mkkkhas the mutation of KKK at the residues 365–367 to AAA (KKK/AAA) using the primers 5′ACCCAAGGGATCCACTGCTGCTGCTGCAAAGACTGGGGCAG3′ and 5′CTGCCCCAGTCTTTGCAGCAGCAGCAGTGGATCCCTTGGGT3′. The third mutant Mkr has mutation of KR at residues 378 and 379 to AA using the primers 5′GGCAGCAGGGAAGTTTGCAGCGGGAAAAAGCTTTATTAAA3′ and TTTAATAAAGCTTTTTCCCGCTGCAAACTTCCCTGCTGCC3′. To determine the localization pattern of the FEN-1 proteins in human cells, we amplified DNA fragments of the wild type FEN-1 and the three site-directed mutants Mkkk, Mkrk, and Mkr using PCR based on primers, CK01- 5′CCTCTGTGCTAGCATGGGAATTCAAGGCC3′ and CK02a-5′CCTCTCCAAGCTTTCCCCTTTTAAACTTCC3′ (sequences for desired restriction sites are underlined). These fragments were then subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector, respectively, at theNhe I and Hin dIII sites. An NLS-truncated FEN-1 cDNA construct (Mnlsd) was also generated using the primer pair of CK01 and CK03a, 5′CCTCTCCAAGCTTGAAGAAATCATCCAG3′, and then cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector also at the Nhe I and Hin dIII sites. To observe the biological functions of the FEN-1 proteins in yeast, DNA fragments of the wild type FEN-1, Mkkk, Mkrk, and Mkr cDNA were directly derived from pBSK-based plasmids using the restriction enzyme Not I. They were then cloned into the yeast expression vector, pDB20. The truncation mutant Mnlsd DNA was PCR-amplified using primers T7 and NLSDNOT (5′ACACACAGCGGCCGCTTACTTGAAGAAATCATCCAG) and then subcloned into pDB20 at the Not I site. For bacterial overexpression of FEN-1 proteins, the full-length wild type human FEN-1 coding sequence was previously subcloned into pET-28b vector (33Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DNA fragments of mutants Mkrk, Mkkk, and Mkr from the pBSK-based constructs were excised usingNco I and Xho I and were subcloned into pET28b. For the construction of pET28b plasmid of the NLS-truncated mutant, a DNA fragment of the mutant was amplified using primers T7 and CK03a and was subcloned into pET28b at the Nco I and Xho I sites. Truncated and site-directed NLS mutant proteins overexpressed in bacteria were less soluble than wild type FEN-1 protein, and a majority of the protein was located in the inclusion bodies. We overcame this problem by optimizing bacterial expression conditions. Specifically, the bacterial cells were cultured in 70% Luria broth at 30 °C for higher solubility of the FEN-1 protein in vivo. Once the protein was solubilized, they were purified as described previously (34Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysate was sonicated (Branson Sonifier 450, Branson Ultrasonics) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 45 min to remove the cell debris. A 5-ml HiTrap chelating Ni2+column was equilibrated with buffer A using fast purification liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After loading, the column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A and 25 ml of buffer A plus 60 mm imidazole and was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from 60–500 mm imidazole in buffer A at 2 ml/min. The fractions were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The buffers of the fractions were exchanged to 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, by a HiTrap desalting column. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Assays for flap endonuclease and nick-specific exonuclease activities were carried out as described previously (31Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to make the flap and nicked DNA substrates: a template strand (5′GGACTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAACGTG), a 5′-labeled flap strand (5′GATGTCAAGCAGTCCTAACTTTGAGGCAG AGTCC-3′), and an adjacent strand (5′CACGTTGACTACCGTC) for the flap DNA substrate; for the exonuclease DNA substrate, a 5′-labeled downstream strand 5′TTGAGGCAGAGTCC3′ was employed instead of the flap strand in the flap substrate. The reactions were performed in a mixture containing 0.8 pmol of [32P]DNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 30 ng of enzyme in 13 μl at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 3 μl of stop solution (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), boiled for 3 min, and then cooled in ice. 4 μl of each reaction product was run on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to Kodak x-ray film. For PCNA interaction analysis, E. coli cell crude extracts of His-tagged proteins of wild type FEN-1 and NLS mutants were individually mixed with crude extracts of BL21(DE3)/pT7/PCNA expressing PCNA without a His tag (5Li X. Li J. Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 35Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The mixture was loaded onto a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech nickel column, washed, and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The eluates were run on a 10% SDS gel to examine the interaction of PCNA and NLS mutant FEN-1 proteins. HeLa cells (laboratory stock) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were passaged until the day before transfection. When cells achieved 60% of confluency, they were individually transfected with the plasmid DNAs as follows: wild type FEN-1, Mnlsd, Mkrk, Mkkk, Mkr, and pEGFP N-1, with the FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After transfection, the cells were cultured for 24 h and then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After a final wash with PBS, the cells were mounted with glycerol. GFP fluorescence signals in transfected cells were detected with an Olympus fluorescence microscope using a 495-nm filter. To assess the nuclear localization response to DNA damage, cells released from nocodazole inhibition at G2phase (see below) were treated with 150 μm MMS. Treated cells harvested at the different time intervals were observed for the status of nuclear localization under a fluorescent microscope, and the results were recorded. Nuclear proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (see below for details). HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary using mimosine and at the G2/M boundary using nocodazole as described previously (36Lee S.E. Mitchell R.A. Cheng A. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 37Petersen L.N. Orren D.K. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Synchronization in G1 was achieved by serum starvation to 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were then re-fed in the complete medium supplemented with mimosine (200 μm, final concentration) for 24 h. To release cells into S phase, the cells were incubated in mimosine-free medium. Synchronization in G2 was achieved by culturing cells with 40 ng/ml nocodazole (final concentration) in complete medium for 12 h. After removal of drugs, the cells were harvested at different time points. The cell cycle phase distribution of a cell population was determined by measuring cell DNA contents in different phases by flow cytometry. To prepare cell samples for flow cytometry, cells (1 × 106) were resuspended in complete medium after trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation at 500 ×g, resuspended in PBS, and then repelleted. The cells were fixed in 75% cold ethanol and stored at 4 °C. Immediately prior to flow cytometric analysis, the samples were treated with RNase A for 30 min at room temperature and then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, final concentration) overnight. The samples were analyzed by using a MoFlo FACS (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO). The HeLa cells (2 × 107) treated with MMS (150 μm, final concentration) were harvested by scraping cells with a rubber policeman and transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The nuclei were first isolated from cells based on the protocol described by Docherty (39Allan J. Docherty K. Gene Transcription: DNA Binding Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 140-141Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 400 μl of HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.9) with 10 mm KCl and 1× protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 15 min. Then 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 solution was added, the suspension vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and centrifuged for 30 s at 15,000 × g. To disrupt the nuclear membrane and extract the nuclear proteins, the pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NaDoC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifuging for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and transferred to a fresh tube. 10 μg of nuclear protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. To visualize uniform loading of nucleic protein extracts taken from different time points, the gel was cut into halves. The upper part was silver-stained (Bio-Rad), and the proteins on the lower part of the gel were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for use in Western blotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with anti-FEN-1 polyclonal antibody (1:4,000) or monoclonal antibody (1:1000) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5,000). The Western blotting image was visualized by the Pierce chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). HeLa cells were cultured in glass chamber slides (Fisher) coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. They were then incubated with anti-FEN-1 polyclonal antibody (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:50) for 1 h. The cells were also stained with 0.5% propidium iodide (PI) to visualize nuclei. After washing with PBS, they were then mounted in 90% glycerol/PBS. FEN-1 protein signals and nuclei were observed and recorded with an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). Six constructs including pDB20 plasmid with no insert and pDB20-based plasmids with FEN-1 wild type or different NLS mutants were transformed into two isogenic yeast strains F3C-15B (wild type) and IC2-1 (the rad 27 null mutant), respectively (40Frank G. Qiu J. Somsouk M. Weng Y. Somsouk L. Nolan J.P. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33064-33072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The null mutant displayed a distinctive phenotype due to defects in the DNA replication and repair pathways. Transformants were selected using SD-URA plates. Nine strains were chosen and grown in SD-URA liquid medium to saturation at 30 °C. Cell density was measured with a spectrophotometer at 600 nm and diluted in water if necessary. The concentration of nine strains was standardized to OD value of 1.5 (∼3 × 107 cells per ml). For growth curves, 100 μl of cells of each standardized strain was grown in 8 ml of SD-URA liquid medium at both 30 and 37 °C. OD values were then measured at 5, 10, 15, and 22 h. The growth curves were plotted using the average OD values of triplicate experiments versus culture time. Different yeast strains were diluted 1, 5, 25, 125, and 625 times and grown on SD-URA plates at both 30 and 37 °C. One microliter of each dilutant was plated on the medium as a dot as shown in the figures. For each density-standardized strain, 500 μl of cells were used for MMS treatment. Cells were centrifuged and washed with water and then treated with 500 μl of 0.05 or 0.1% MMS in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 30 min. The treated cells were washed with 1.5 ml of water three times and suspended in water in a final volume of 500 μl. The samples were further diluted 8,000 times for the control (without MMS treatment), 2,000 times for 0.05% MMS treatment, and 1,000 times for 0.1% MMS treatment. 100 μl of cells were plated on SD-URA and cultured at 30 °C. After 4 days, colonies were observed and counted. Survival rate was determined based on the ratio of colony counts with MMS to colony counts without MMS treatment. Survival histograms represent the mean from at least two independent experiments. In addition, the observation of MMS sensitivity of different strains with various dilutions on plates was made on SD-URA with 0.05% MMS. Five dilutions, 1, 5, 25, 125, and 625 times, were made for each sample. One microliter of each diluent was plated as a dot on a SD-URA plate. Samples were observed and photographed after 5 days of incubation at 30 °C. To study the nuclear localization of the human enzyme, cell cycle phases were first determined by flow cytometry based on relative fluorescence represented on the x axis and cell number represented on the y axis of the flow cytometric profiles (Fig. 1 A). After removal of mimosine (an inhibitor of DNA replication forks), cells entered the S phase and underwent a period of high DNA synthesis (0–6 h after release corresponding to S phase), followed by G2phase (8–15 h after release). G2 phase-synchronized cells were obtained by nocodazole inhibition (Fig. 1 A). FEN-1 protein signals were detected at 0, 3, 6, 10, and 13 h after G1 release as well as at a time immediately after G2 release (Fig. 1 B). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear immunostainings were observed when cells were immediately released from the G1/S boundary and G2 phase (Fig. 1 B, 0 h and G2). The FEN-1 protein clearly moved to and localized in nuclei 3 and 6 h after mimosine release, which corresponds to S phase (Fig. 1 B). The fact that FEN-1 protein was localized into the nuclei in S phase is in agreement with the role of FEN-1 nuclease in DNA replication. When cells entered G2 phase, FEN-1 nuclease migrated back to cytoplasm (Fig.1 B, 10 and 13 h). Fig. 1 C is the PI sta"

Currently there is no available vaccine, although studies in animal models have demonstrated protective immunity induced by an epitope of the RSV G-protein representing amino acids 174-187. Two peptides containing amino acids 174-187 of the G-protein of the human RSV A2 strain (NF1-RSV/172-187 and NF2-RSV/170-191) were separately engineered as translational fusions with the alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein and individually expressed in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN plants through virus infection. RSV G-protein peptides were expressed in infected plant tissues at significant levels within 2 wk of inoculation and purified as part of recombinant alfalfa mosaic virions. BALB/c mice immunized intraperitoneally with three doses of the purified recombinant viruses showed high levels of serum antibody specific for RSV G-protein and were protected against infection with RSV Long strain."

Here we demonstrate for the first time a direct effect of BRN-3A on the survival of neuronal cells. Specifically, overexpression of BRN-3A in cultured trigeminal ganglion or dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons enhanced their survival following the withdrawal of nerve growth factor. Moreover, reduction of BRN-3A levels impaired the survival of these neurons. The survival of sympathetic neurons was not affected by either approach. Similarly, overexpression of BRN-3A activated the endogenous Bcl-2 gene in trigeminal neurons, but not in sympathetic neurons. The protective effect of BRN-3A on trigeminal neuron survival following nerve growth factor withdrawal significantly increased during embryonic development. In contrast, overexpression of the related factor BRN-3B enhanced survival of trigeminal neurons only at an early stage of embryonic development. Thus, BRN-3A (and in some circumstances, BRN-3B) can promote the survival of nerve growth factor-dependent sensory but not sympathetic neurons, allowing it to play a direct role in the survival of some (but not all) neuronal populations in the developing and adult nervous systems.

All the original founder members of the POU family are expressed in neuronal cells, with Pit-1 playing a key role in the development of the pituitary gland (3Anderson B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol.

The three BRN-3 factors are BRN-3A (also known as BRN-3 or BRN-3.0) (7Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Tuner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Turner E.E. Mech. Dev. 1996; 53: 291-304Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of Brn-3a, Brn-3b, andBrn-3c, as well as their relationship to Unc-86, suggest that they may play key roles in the development of specific neuronal cell types in mammals. In agreement with this, inactivation of the gene encoding BRN-3C in knockout mice results in defective inner ear cell function due to the failure to produce sensory hair cells (14Erkman L. McEvilly J. Luo L. Ryan A.K. Hooshmand F. O'Connel S.M. Keithley E.M. Rapaport D.H. Ryan A.F. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1996; 381: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and mutation in the human gene encoding BRN-3C has recently been reported to be the cause of progressive deafness in an Israeli family (15Vahaua O. Morell R. Lynch E.D. Weiss S. Kagen M.F. Ahitau N. Morrow J.E. Lee M.K. Skvorak A.B. Morton C.C. Blumenfeld A. Frydman M. Friedman T.B. King M.-C. Avraham K.B. Science. 1954; 279: 1950-1998Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similarly, inactivation of the gene encoding BRN-3B results in the loss of ∼70% of retinal ganglion cells, with little effect on other neurons (14Erkman L. McEvilly J. Luo L. Ryan A.K. Hooshmand F.

In contrast to the relatively organ-specific effects of inactivation of Brn-3b or Brn-3c, inactivation of BRN-3A causes widespread losses of specific populations of motor neurons and of proprioreceptive, mechanoreceptive, and nociceptive sensory neurons. This results in mice with uncoordinated limb movement and impaired suckling that die shortly after birth (17McEvilly R.J. Erkman L. Luo L. Sawchenko P.E. Ryan A.F. Rosenfeld M.G.

This widespread role for BRN-3A is paralleled by its ability to activate the expression of a number of different genes expressed in neuronal cells such as those encoding pro-opiomelanocortin (7Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Tuner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, none of these genes are significantly activated by BRN-3B (19Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the losses of neuronal cells in Brn-3a knockout mice have previously been suggested to be due to a loss of expression of specific neurotrophic factors or their receptors (17McEvilly R.J. Erkman L. Luo L. Sawchenko P.E. Ryan A.F. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In turn, this would evidently disrupt neurotrophin signaling, resulting in a loss of their survival-promoting effects and consequently leading to the observed neuronal cell death. However, no direct effect of BRN-3A on the promoters of genes encoding neurotrophins or their receptors has been reported. We have recently reported that BRN-3A overexpression can activate the promoter of the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene ∼50-fold in cotransfection assays (22Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, BRN-3A overexpression results in ∼15-fold overexpression of BCL-2 protein derived from the endogenous Bcl-2 gene in a transfected neuronal cell line (22Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that BRN-3A may have a direct effect on the survival of neuronal cells. We have therefore investigated the effect of increasing or decreasing the levels of BRN-3A in specific neuronal cell types on their survival in the presence or absence of neurotrophins. Full-length Brn-3a andBrn-3b cDNA expression vectors have been described elsewhere (22Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S.

The BRN-3A-specific antisense construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 using primersGGATCCGCTGCAGAGCAACCTCTTC andGTCGACGAGCGACGGCGACGAGATC, where boldface and underlined sequences indicate Bam HI and Sal I restriction enzyme recognition sites, respectively. The 240-base pair PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and subcloned as aBam HI/Sal I fragment into the mammalian expression vector pJ7. Dorsal root, trigeminal, and superior cervical ganglia were dissected from newborn Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 1 or from staged C57 mouse embryos, where the day of finding the vaginal plug was designated embryonic day (E) 0.5. Following dissection, ganglia were incubated for between 5 and 15 min at 37 °C with 0.05% trypsin (Worthington; in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution). The precise period of incubation in trypsin was dependent on the age of the ganglia. After removal of trypsin, ganglia were washed twice with 10 ml of Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and were gently triturated with a fire-polished, siliconized Pasteur pipette to give a single cell suspension. Neurons were then purified from non-neuronal cells using a metrizamide density gradient, modified from the purification strategy devised by Camu and Henderson (24Camu W. Henderson C.E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1992; 44: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Metrizamide (Sigma M 4512) volumetrically prepared at 6% (w/v) in growth medium without bovine serum albumin was sterile-filtered and equilibrated in an incubator prior to use. Dissociated cells were gently layered with a metrizamide cushion and then centrifuged at 145 × g (900 rpm) for 5 min at room temperature. Neurons were collected into a pellet, whereas the non-neuronal cells (∼95%) remained in the supernatant. The supernatant was decanted, and the pelleted cells were washed with complete growth medium and spun again at 145 × g for 5 min. Neurons were cultured as described (25Wyatt S. Ensor E. Begbie J. Ernfors P. Reichardt L.F. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Davies A.M. Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neural Cell Culture: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 153-175Google Scholar). The purified neurons were plated at a density of 500–1000 neurons in a 50-μl droplet on a 13-mm coverslip in a 24-well plate. Coverslips were precoated with poly-dl-ornithine (0.5 mg/ml overnight) and laminin (20 μg/ml overnight). The cells were then left between 5 h and overnight to adhere and flooded with growth medium. The neurons were incubated at 37.5 °C in a humidified 3.5% CO2 incubator in a defined medium consisting of Ham's F-14 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 0.35% bovine serum albumin (Pathocyte-4, ICN), 60 ng/ml progesterone, 16 μg/ml putrescine, 400 ng/ml l-thyroxine, 38 ng/ml sodium selenite, 340 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 60 mg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Neurons were recognized by their bipolar morphology under phase-contrast optics (25Wyatt S. Ensor E. Begbie J. Ernfors P. Reichardt L.F. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Davies A.M. Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neural Cell Culture: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 153-175Google Scholar). Prior to transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in medium supplemented with recombinant nerve growth factor (NGF; Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. In control experiments, this 24-h incubation was sufficient to select for NGF-dependent neurons. Thus, the resulting cultures showed no enhanced survival when other neurotrophic factors were added together with NGF compared with adding NGF alone. The following day, 1 μg of pCi expression vector containing the murine long form ofBrn-3a cloned downstream of the constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) gene promoter (pCi3A) was introduced into cultured cells by liposome-mediated transfection. Control cultures were similarly transfected with 1 μg of empty pCi expression vector (referred to as pCi). Liposome transfection was carried out exactly as described by McQuillinet al. (27McQuillin A. Murray K.D. Etheridge C.J. Stewart L. Cooper R.G. Brett P.M. Miller A.D. Gurling H.M.D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3β-[N-(dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol was formulated into cationic liposomes with dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (27McQuillin A. Murray K.D. Etheridge C.J. Stewart L. Cooper R.G. Brett P.M. Miller A.D. Gurling H.M.D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 1 μg of DNA was added to the liposomes at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) in 300 μl of serum-free medium, mixed by pipetting, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was removed from the cells and replaced with complete growth medium. Previous experiments using this technique noted a 50% transfection efficiency in the ND7 neuronal cell line (27McQuillin A. Murray K.D. Etheridge C.J. Stewart L. Cooper R.G. Brett P.M. Miller A.D. Gurling H.M.D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the study by McQuillin et al.(27McQuillin A. Murray K.D. Etheridge C.J. Stewart L. Cooper R.G. Brett P.M. Miller A.D. Gurling H.M.D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the proliferating ND7 cells were processed for β-galactosidase immunohistochemistry 48 h following transfection and are likely to have divided in this time. This will result in an underestimate of transfection efficiency, which would not be the case in our experiments with non-dividing neurons. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h following transfection, and the medium was then replaced with fresh medium with or without the addition of NGF. To determine efficiency of transfection and to identify individual transfected neurons, cultures were cotransfected with 1 μl of plasmid encoding the lacZ gene under the control of the CMV promoter (CMV-lacZ). Survival of transfected cells (as visualized by β-galactosidase staining) was assessed 24 h after the transfer to medium with or without NGF. In parallel experiments, 1 μl of plasmid DNA at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (pCi or pCi3A together with CMV-lacZ) was introduced into the nuclei of neurons by microinjection. The full-lengthBrn-3a cDNA was cloned downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and in reverse orientation to the cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) cloned under the control of the CMV promoter. This expression cassette (pR20.5-Brn-3a) was subcloned into a shuttle vector so that it was flanked by herpes simplex virus-1 UL43 gene sequences. The pR20.5-Brn-3a-UL43 shuttle vector was cotransfected into baby hamster kidney cells together with herpes simplex virus-1 strain 1764 DNA, which contains an inactivating insertion in the Vmw65 gene as well as deletion of both copies of the ICP34.5 gene (28Coffin R.S. Maclean A.R. Latchman D.S. Brown S.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 886-891PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant virus was subsequently plaque-purified on the basis of the visualization of GFP under ultraviolet conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm that high levels of BRN-3A protein were produced in infected cultures before a high titer stock was grown. Control virus containing the bacterial lacZ gene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (i.e. containing pR20.5-lacZ-UL43) was similarly generated. Trigeminal ganglion neurons were isolated and maintained in cultures as described above on glass coverslips at a density of ∼200 neurons/coverslip. Cultures were infected in duplicate with ∼1 × 105 plaque-forming units of BRN-3A or control virus/coverslip for 60 min, washed, and then maintained in medium supplemented with NGF for 24 h. Efficiency of viral infection was determined by visualization of GFP before the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without the addition of NGF. Neuronal cell counts were then performed 24 h later. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Terminal transferase reaction solution (10 units of terminal transferase and 2 mm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in buffer containing 200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm cobalt chloride, pH 6.6) was added for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. The number of apoptotic nuclei was counted and expressed as a percentage of total nuclei. The reverse transcription-PCR assay was carried out as described previously using conditions that have been shown to generate a linear relationship between the input mRNA and the signal obtained (22Smith M.D. Ensor E.A.

The primers for the total Brn-3a mRNA (amplifying both endogenous mRNA and exogenous mRNA from the transfected plasmid) (see Fig. 3) were forward primer 5′-CGGGGTTGTACGGCAAAA3-′ and reverse primer 5′-GTGGGCTCGGCGCTGGCC3-′. Primers to specifically amplify the exogenous Brn-3a mRNA (see Fig. 7) consisted of a forward primer derived from the 5′-untranslated region of the expression vector (5′-TCTCGAACTTAAGCTGCAGT-3′) and a reverse primer from within the Brn-3a mRNA (5′-TGAGGCTGCTTGCTGTTCAT-3′). This combination ensured amplification of only the exogenous Brn-3a mRNA derived from the transfected expression vector, producing a 380-base pair product.Figure 7Expression of exogenous Brn-3a mRNA, the control glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, and Bcl-2 mRNA in trigeminal and SCG neurons either untransfected or transfected with empty expression vector or Brn-3a expression vector.

The primers for the endogenousBcl-2 mRNA were 5′-AGAATCACAGGACTTCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GCTTGAATGCACTTGAAGTA-3′, which produce a 430-base pair product. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then placed in annexin buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). 10 μl of annexin V-phycoerythrin (30 μg/ml; R&D Systems) was added per milliliter of annexin buffer and incubated on the cells at room temperature for 10 min. The buffer was removed and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. Annexin-positive cells were identified under a fluorescence microscope. Single factor ANOVA was used to analyze differences for each group of treatments, with differences among means within each group of treatments being compared using Student'st test. Significance was taken as a p < 0.05. To protect against inflation of error rate as a result of multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni method was applied manually to the results of the ANOVA tests. In Bonferroni's test, to achieve significance, each comparison must show significance well beyond the 0.05 (95% confidence) level. The level of significance required is determined by the following equation: C =k!/(2!(k − 2)!), where k is the number of treatments and ! is the factorial of the preceding number. The corrected level of significance is determined by dividing 0.05 by C. BRN-3A has previously been shown to be expressed at high levels in trigeminal ganglion neurons (7Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Tuner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Wyatt S. Ensor E. Begbie J.

We therefore investigated the effect of overexpressing BRN-3A on the ability of these neurons to survive both in the presence and absence of NGF, whose removal results in the death of significant numbers of neurons by programmed cell death or apoptosis. Trigeminal ganglion neurons obtained from rat pups at postnatal day 1 were separated from non-neuronal cells on a metrizamide density gradient. The resulting cultures contained >95% neurons on the basis of their typical bipolar morphology and extensive neurites after 2 days in culture. The phase-contrast images of the cultures are very similar to those reported previously using this method (33Vogel K.S. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Parad L.F.

In addition, we also confirmed the identity of these cells by their positive staining for α-internexin, a type IV intermediate filament that is a specific marker for neurons of the peripheral nervous system (Fig.1) (35Athlan E.S.

Neurons were cultured for 24 h in medium supplemented with NGF, and plasmid DNA was then introduced by liposome-mediated transfection. In control experiments in which a GFP-expressing reporter construct was transfected into these cultures by this method, transfection efficiencies of >70% of the neurons were routinely observed (Fig.2).Figure 2Cultures of postnatal trigeminal neurons transfected with an empty expression vector (a andb) or with a GFP expression vector (c and d) and visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (a and c) or by GFP fluorescence (b and d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Parallel samples of neurons were transfected with either empty expression vector lacking any insert or the same expression vector containing full-length cDNA for Brn-3a cloned downstream of the constitutive cytomegalovirus gene promoter. Each transfection also included a β-galactosidase expression vector, allowing successfully transfected cells to be visualized by staining for β-galactosidase. Cell survival was then calculated for each sample on the basis of the number of surviving transfected neurons in each case. To confirm that Brn-3a expression was elevated in the transfected cells, we used a reverse transcription-PCR assay, which we have previously used to measure Brn-3a mRNA levels in small amounts of material under conditions in which the signal obtained is linearly related to the amount of mRNA in the sample (25Wyatt S.

https://openalex.org/W2030900937,"Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) is the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber cells and the founder member of the water channel gene family. Here we show that disruption of the AQP0 gene by an early transposon (ETn) element results in expression of a chimeric protein, comprised of approximately 75% AQP0 and approximately 25% ETn long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence, in the cataract Fraser (CatFr) mouse lens. Immunoblot analysis showed that mutant AQP0-LTR was similar in mass to wild-type AQP0. However, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that AQP0-LTR was localized to intracellular membranes rather than to plasma membranes of lens fiber cells. Heterozygous CatFr lenses were similar in size to wild-type but displayed abnormal regions of translucence and light scattering. Scanning electron microscopy further revealed that mature fiber cells within the core of the heterozygous CatFr lens failed to stratify into uniform, concentric growth shells, suggesting that the AQP0 water channel facilitates the development of the unique cellular architecture of the crystalline lens."
https://openalex.org/W2023020967,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with cervical cancer and interact with growth factors that may enhance malignant transformation of cervical carcinoma cells. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is released from HPV transfected keratinocytes and induces increased growth response in these cell lines in comparison with normal cells. In the present study several cervical carcinoma cell lines have been analyzed to investigate the expression of ET-1 and its receptors as well as their involvement in tumor growth. All HPV-positive cancer cells secreted ET-1 and expressed mRNA for ET-1 and its receptors, whereas a HPV-negative carcinoma cell line expressed only the ETBR mRNA and didn't secrete ET-1. Binding studies showed that HPV-associated cells expressed an increased number of functional ETAR. ET-1 stimulated a marked dose-dependent increase in [3H]-thymidine incorporation with respect to the normal cells whereas ET-3 and ETBR agonists had no effect. In HPV-positive cancer cells, a specific antagonist of ETAR inhibited the proliferation induced by ET-1 and substantially reduced the basal growth rate of unstimulated cervical tumor cells, whereas the ETBR antagonist had no effect. These results demonstrate that ET-1 participates in the progression of neoplastic growth in HPV-associated carcinoma, in which ETAR are increased and could be targeted for antitumor therapy."

The decomposition ofS-nitrosothiols to regenerate NO is proposed to be a mechanism whereby NO may be either translocated or prevented from diffusing away from the site of synthesis (8Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Myoglobin is present in relatively high concentration in skeletal and cardiac muscle (2.1–6 mg/g of wet tissue (Refs. 20Perkoff G.T. Tyler F.H.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23426-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intracellular concentrations of ferric or metmyoglobin are strictly controlled in vivo by a “metmyoglobin reductase” that maintains the heme iron in the reduced form and able to bind dioxygen (24Hagler L. Coppes R.I. Herman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to oxyhemoglobin (25Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S.

Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and this process has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate NO in skeletal and cardiac muscle (9Kelm M. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1561-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and vascular smooth muscle (27Nakane M. Schmidt H.H. Pollock J.S. Forstermann U. Murad F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of human Mb is unique among mammalian myoglobins in that it possesses a cysteine residue, Cys110(28Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, we investigated the reaction of recombinant human Mb and hydrogen peroxide and showed that Cys110 is readily oxidized to a thiyl radical that promotes formation of a disulfide-linked dimeric Mb product (29Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This reactivity of the sulfhydryl led us to hypothesize that human Mb may also react with NO to yield an S-nitrosothiol group at Cys110 of human Mb. If substantiated, such reactivity would endow Mb with the unique combination of abilities to preserve NO bioactivity through formation of a S-nitrosothiol group and to regulate NOin vivo by either formation of a nitrosyl Mb complex or oxidizing NO to NO3−. In the present work, we have studied the reaction of human Mb and its C110A variant to evaluate the relative reactivities of the thiol group at Cys110 and the heme iron in the in vitro reaction of wild-type human Mb with NO through the combined use of EPR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), electronic absorbance spectroscopy, and electrospray mass spectrometry. 2,2′-Dithiodipyridine (DTP), horse heart Mb, reduced glutathione (GSH), iodoacetamide, trypsin (type III, 10,200 units/mg of protein), urea, EDTA, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), Tris buffer, and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) were obtained from Sigma. Diethylammonium(z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DeaNO, ε260 ∼ 6500m−1 cm−1) was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Electronic absorbance spectra of solutions of DeaNO at pH 10 and 7.4 indicated a single maximum at A 260 nm consistent with that reported by the manufacturer, so the reagent was used without further purification. Concentrated stock solutions of DeaNO (up to 100 mm in 1 mm NaOH) were prepared immediately prior to use. NaNO2 (purity 97%) was from Eastman Kodak Co. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD). NaCl (purity 99.5%) was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). NO gas (purity 98.5%) was from Linde Union Carbide (Praxair, Vancouver, Canada). Where required, buffers were prepared from either glass-distilled water or glass-distilled water purified further by passage through a Barnstead Nanopure system. All buffers were stored over Chelex-100® (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for at least 24 h to remove contaminating transition metals as verified by ascorbate autoxidation analysis (30Buettner G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Organic solvents and all other reagents employed were of the highest quality available. Transformed bacteria (strain AR68) containing plasmids for the wild-type recombinant human myoglobin and the C110A variant (31Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were obtained from Prof. S. G. Boxer. The procedures used here for the expression and purification of the various proteins has been described in detail elsewhere (29Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The respective recombinant myoglobins were isolated as the corresponding metmyoglobin. When required, proteins were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10 concentrators, Millipore). Samples of the various apo-Mbs were prepared by adjusting the pH of corresponding solutions of holo-Mb in Tris buffer (5 mm, pH 7.4) to pH = 2.5 by addition of 1 m HCl at 4 °C. Free heme was then removed from the mixture by repeated extraction (three times) of the acidified fraction into ice-cold 2-butanone as described previously (32Teale F.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The acidified aqueous fraction was then dialyzed extensively against the buffer of choice (2, 20, and 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm DTPA), and the concentration of apo-Mb was determined from the A 280 nm (ε280 = 16 mm−1cm−1). For all apoprotein preparations, no other absorption maxima were detected overA 220–700 nm except for a residual Soret band (<2% of the initial Soret intensity) that could not be eliminated by further extraction into 2-butanone. All working solutions of apo-Mb were prepared immediately before use to avoid inadvertent oxidation of redox-sensitive amino acids (e.g. Cys110 in wild-type human Mb). Samples of metmyoglobin were reduced to the corresponding ferrous protein with a 2–3-fold molar excess of Fe(EDTA)2− (33Wherland S. Holwerda R.A. Rosenberg R.C. Gray H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 5260-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Oxygen was removed from protein solutions either by gently purging solutions of the ferric or ferrous holo-Mb (or where applicable apo-Mb) with purified nitrogen gas that had previously passed through a vanadium(II)/mercury-zinc amalgam (34Meites L. Meites T. Anal. Chem. 1948; 20: 984-985Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar) or by alternately freezing and thawing the sample under vacuum with a dual manifold vacuum line. Anaerobic reactants and reaction mixtures were transferred with gas-tight syringes and placed in flasks fitted with rubber septa to avoid oxygen contamination. In some instances, dioxygen (99.0% purity, Praxair, Vancouver, Canada) was bubbled directly into samples of ferrous Mb, and then excess Fe(EDTA)2− and Fe(EDTA)− were removed by gel filtration (PD-10 G-25 column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Under these conditions, proteins were isolated as the corresponding ferrous oxy-Mb. In this investigation, three sources of nitrosating reagents were employed throughout to yield nitroso complexes at either sulfhydryl (S) or heme (iron) centers. Each of the sources has been verified previously as established means of generating NO (35Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 36Stamler J.S.

Solutions of GSH or apo-Mb (either modified with iodoacetamide or not for the case of wild-type human apo-Mb) were prepared in 0.5 m HCl, exposed to NaNO2(NO:target sulfhydryl ∼2 mol/mol) and the reaction mixture stirred for 30 min at 20 °C in either the presence or absence of air. Acidic solutions of NO2− yield NO gas in a stoichiometric reaction (18Morse R.H. Chan S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7876-7882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of the reaction mixtures was then raised to pH 7.4 by titration with phosphate buffer (final phosphate concentration 2, 25, or 50 mm and containing DTPA (100 μm)) and the protein was eluted over two gel filtration columns (PD-10) to remove excess nitrite/nitrate. As holo-Mb is sensitive to acidic conditions (<pH ∼ 5.5), nitrosation of either ferric or ferrous holo-Mb was not performed by method 1 but by one of the following techniques. Solutions of ferric or ferrous holo-Mb were degassed with purified nitrogen (where appropriate) and then treated with authentic NO gas in a dual manifold vacuum line. Prior to the introduction of nitric oxide gas into the vacuum line, the NO was first passed through an anaerobic column of solid KOH pellets at 5 p.s.i. and 20 °C and then introduced to the sample chamber. Protein solutions were then stirred continuously for 20 min under an atmosphere of NO gas (39Osipov A.N. Gorbunov N.V. Day B.W. Elsayed N.M. Kagan V.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 193-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (concentration of dissolved NO ∼2.1 mm at 20 °C, based on solubility (X) of NO = 3.78 × 10−5 mol of NO/mol of H2O at the prevailing atmospheric pressure). Finally, reaction mixtures were removed from the gas line, and excess low molecular weight contaminants were removed by gel filtration (PD-10) using columns pre-equilibrated with appropriately degassed buffers. Solutions of apo-Mb or ferric or ferrous holo-Mb (each prepared in 2, 25, or 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) were treated with alkaline solutions (1 mm NaOH) of concentrated DeaNO (at ratios of DeaNO:protein ∼ 0–20 mol/mol). Concentrated stock solutions of DeaNO were used to minimize hydroxide addition to the buffered solutions and resulting changes in pH. Where appropriate, stock reagents and solutions containing the target protein were thoroughly degassed prior to mixing to yield anaerobic reaction mixtures. Reaction mixtures were then purified by gel filtration (PD-10) using columns that had been equilibrated with appropriately degassed buffers. Regardless of the method used to generate the nitrosated product, DTPA (final concentration, 100 μm) was included in all reaction mixtures containing sufhydryls to minimize the possibility of either transition metal-mediated oxidation of the protein sulfhydryl or the metal-mediated decomposition of the correspondingS-nitrosothiol (12Williams D.L.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 869-876Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 37Singh R.J Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

Method 3 proved to be the most convenient protocol for addition of precise amounts of NO to solutions of Mb and so was used for all concentration-dependent studies (see “Results”). X-band EPR spectroscopy was carried out at 77 K with a Bruker model ESP 300e spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard microwave frequency counter. For low temperature EPR, samples (250 μl) of reaction mixture were placed into a 3-mm quartz cell (Wilmad, Buena, NJ), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to a finger Dewar insert (77 K) for EPR analysis. The time required to removing the sample from the reaction vial and freezing for EPR analyses was consistently <10 s. The limit of detection of a stable nitroxide (TEMPO) under identical conditions was determined to be ∼50 nm. Unless stated otherwise, EPR spectra were obtained as an average of five scans with sweep time of 84 s. Microwave power, modulation amplitude, and scan range were as indicated in the legend to the figure(s). ESI-MS was performed with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer described in detail elsewhere (40Hunter C.L. Mauk A.G. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Samples of Mb (± NO gas) were exchanged into water, diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm in heme (with methanol/water 1:10, v/v) and then infused continuously (flow rate of 1 μl/min) into the ion source at 20 °C. Experiments were performed without an internal standard. Multiply charged gas phase proteins were generated by pneumatically assisted ESI. In some experiments, the voltage difference between the orifice and skimmer was set at +100–110 V, conditions under which mass peaks for apo-Mb dominate (29Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Hunter C.L. Mauk A.G. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, however, some minor contamination from intact holoprotein was detected. Estimates of mass for the holo-Mbs were performed with a voltage difference of 50–60 V to preserve the heme-protein complex and afford charge state distributions largely for the holo-Mb form of the protein. The ESI-MS system was mass-calibrated with solutions of CsI. Horse heart Mb (predicted mass of apoprotein = 16,950 atomic mass units) was employed as a standard to test the mass accuracy of the system prior to use. Mass values were obtained by standard fitting analyses of the various m/z distributions with “BioMultiView” software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mass determinations were performed for ≥2 independent protein preparations on different days. Mass values reported here refer to the mean ± S.D. from ≥5 analyses. Electronic absorption spectra were obtained with a Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Mb solutions were diluted into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) prior to analysis. Holo-Mb concentration was determined from the Soret maximum (ε408 nm ∼ 188,000m−1cm−1), while apo-Mb concentration was determined from the A 280 nm(ε280 nm ∼ 16,000m−1cm−1). For the analyses of NO complexes, various Mb solutions were first exposed to NO using one of methods 1–3. The reaction mixture was then diluted into the appropriate degassed buffer, and the spectrum was recorded. By performing the nitrosation reactions in 2 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and subsequently diluting into 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the yields of the respective S-nitrosothiol were optimized. Under these conditions, steady state levels ofS-nitrosothiols were monitored in the various reaction mixtures. In some experiments, wild-type human Mb was incubated with iodoacetamide (thiol-blocking reagent:protein = 10 mol/mol) to block the free thiol prior to reaction with NO. Carboxymethylation of the protein thiol was confirmed by determining residual thiol content before and after iodoacetamide treatment using DTP (molar ratio of DTP:protein = 10 mol/mol) and monitoring the reaction atA 325 nm (29Witting P.K.

Consistent with our previous report (29Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), modification with iodoacetamide decreased the free thiol in wild-type human Mb by >85% (data not shown). FTIR spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. The IR cell consists of two CaF2 windows and a Teflon spacer (25 μm). The temperature of the sample was maintained at 20 °C with a water-jacketed cell holder and IR cells that have large contact surface to allow efficient thermal equilibration (Specac, Inc.). In addition, the sample compartment was purged continuously with dry nitrogen gas to minimize vapor absorption. Spectra were collected at an OPD velocity of 2 cm/s on both sides of the center burst and averaged over 500 scans. An apodization function was used to truncate the spectra, and the spectral resolution was 2 cm−1. Background absorption from the empty cavity was recorded under conditions identical to those used for the protein samples. As a result of the weak S-H stretching vibration for protein sulfhydryls in solution, relatively high concentrations of holo- or apoprotein (5–6 mm) were necessary to obtain useful data above the FTIR background for water. Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test available in Excel (Microsoft), and significant difference was accepted at p < 0.05. Spectroscopic characteristics of a variety of metmyoglobins and their corresponding ferrous nitrosyl-heme complexes are collected in Table I. The ferric form of horse heart Mb, wild-type human Mb, and the C110A variant of human Mb each exhibited similar Soret and visible maxima, as expected from the similarity of the amino acid sequences for all mammalian Mb at the heme binding pocket (28Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 42Takano T. J. Mol.

In addition, each ferric protein exhibited aA Soret/A 280 nmratio > 5, consistent with the high purity of these preparations (not shown). In the absence of dioxygen, both the ferrous form of wild-type human Mb and the C110A variant of human Mb readily reacted with either authentic NO gas (method 2) or NO derived from the decomposition of DeaNO (method 3) to yield ferrous nitrosyl-heme complexes of the corresponding protein (Table I). Visible bands measured for solutions of the various human nitrosyl Mb complexes were similar to each other and distinct from those for the corresponding metmyoglobin. Furthermore, the visible bands for NO complexes of both wild-type human Mb and the C110A variant were nearly identical to those that are characteristic for the ferrous NO complex of horse heart Mb (Table I). Importantly, no significant increase in absorbance was detected between 330 and 350 nm for the ferrous nitrosyl-heme complexes of the various Mb proteins (Table I).Table IElectronic absorbance data obtained for various proteins before and/or after NO treatmentProtein1-aUnless otherwise stated data represent the mean ± range of duplicate analyses or are taken from a single literature source (58).

https://openalex.org/W1975816014,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in many neuroadaptive responses to ethanol in the nervous system. PKC activation results in translocation of the enzyme from one intracellular site to another. Compartmentalization of PKC isozymes is regulated by targeting proteins such as receptors for activated C kinase (RACKs). It is possible, therefore, that ethanol-induced changes in the function and compartmentalization of PKC isozymes could be due to changes in PKC targeting proteins. Here we study the response of the targeting protein RACK1 and its corresponding kinase betaIIPKC to ethanol, and propose a novel mechanism to explain how ethanol modulates signaling cascades. In cultured cells, ethanol induces movement of RACK1 to the nucleus without affecting the compartmentalization of betaIIPKC. Ethanol also inhibits betaIIPKC translocation in response to activation. These results suggest that ethanol inhibition of betaIIPKC translocation is due to miscompartmentalization of the targeting protein RACK1. Similar events occurred in mouse brain. In vivo exposure to ethanol caused RACK1 to localize to nuclei in specific brain regions, but did not affect the compartmentalization of betaIIPKC. Thus, some of the cellular and neuroadaptive responses to ethanol may be related to ethanol-induced movement of RACK1 to the nucleus, thereby preventing the translocation and corresponding function of betaIIPKC."

Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of 21 close homologs of RsmC and YgjO revealed the presence of the third paralogous lineage in E. coli and other gamma-Proteobacteria, which might correspond to the subfamily of MTases specific for G1516 in 16S rRNA. In addition, the comparative sequence analysis supported by sequence/structure threading suggests that rRNA:m2G MTases are very closely related to RNA and DNA:m6A MTases and that these two enzyme families share common architecture of the active site and presumably a similar mechanism of methyl group transfer onto the exocyclic amino group of their target bases."
https://openalex.org/W2037538895,"Thiopurines and topoisomerase II-targeted drugs (e.g., etoposide) are widely used anticancer drugs. However, topoisomerase II-targeted drugs can cause acute myeloid leukemia, with the risk of this secondary leukemia linked to a genetic defect in thiopurine catabolism. Chronic thiopurines result in thioguanine substitution in DNA. The effect of these substitutions on DNA topoisomerase II activity is not known. Our goal was to determine whether deoxythioguanosine substitution alters DNA cleavage stabilized by human topoisomerase II. We studied four variations of a 40 mer oligonucleotide with a topoisomerase II cleavage site, each with a single deoxythioguanosine in a different position relative to the cleavage site (-1 or +2 in the top and +2 or +4 in the bottom strand). Deoxythioguanosine substitution caused position-dependent quantitative effects on cleavage. With the -1 or +2 top and +2 or +4 bottom substitutions, mean topoisomerase II-induced cleavage was 0.6-, 2.0-, 1.1-, and 3.3-fold that with the wild-type substrate (P=0. 011, < 0.008, 0.51, and < 0.001, respectively). In the presence of 100 microM etoposide, cleavage was enhanced for wild-type and all thioguanosine-modified substrates relative to no etoposide, with the +4 bottom substitution showing greater etoposide-induced cleavage than the wild-type substrate (P=0.015). We conclude that thioguanine incorporation alters the DNA cleavage induced by topoisomerase II in the presence and absence of etoposide, providing new insights to the mechanism of thiopurine effect and on the leukemogenesis of thiopurines, with or without topoisomerase inhibitors."

Vallejos R.H. Topics Photosynth. 1987; 8: 527-560Google Scholar). This flavoprotein is the last enzyme in the electron transport chain of linear photosynthesis, where electrons are transferred through a series of electron carriers and finally produce NADPH. FNRs have also been identified in various tissues and organisms not capable of photosynthesis, where FNR is involved in nitrogen fixation and steroid hydroxylation (2Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In photosynthesis, FNR catalyzes the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH according to the reaction,2Fdred+NADP++H+→2Fdox+NADPHREACTION 1which can be divided into two half-reactions. For catalyzing this reaction, FNR utilizes the noncovalently but strongly bound prosthetic group FAD as the only redox center. In the first step, FNR catalyzes the successive transfer of two electrons from each molecule of the reduced one-electron carrier [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin I (Fd) to a single molecule of FAD. In the second step, FNR utilizes these two electrons to convert NADP+ into NADPH via hydride (H−) transfer from N5 of FAD (1Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Topics Photosynth. 1987; 8: 527-560Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structures of the oxidized and reduced form of native spinach FNR and of the complexes with the competitive inhibitor 2′-phospho-5′-AMP have been determined by Bruns and Karplus (3Karplus P.A.

None of these studies showed a complex characteristic for productive electron transfer between FNR and NADP+. More recently, crystal structures of the complexes between two mutants of pea FNR (Y308S and Y308W) and NADP+ have been solved that reveal a single productive NADP+ binding mode (6Deng Z. Aliverti A.

FNR consists of two distinct domains, one responsible for binding the prosthetic group FAD and the other for NADP+ binding. The FAD-binding domain is a six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, which is capped at one side by an α-helix, while the NADP+ binding domain consists of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices. This unique structural two-domain motif has been proposed to be a prototype for a large family of flavoproteins (7Correll C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A.

While all members show the characteristic two-domain FNR motif, some members like PDR also contain extra domain(s) to extend their catalytic capability.Electron transfer reactions involving protein-protein interactions require the formation of a transient complex that brings together the two redox centers exchanging electrons. Extensive biochemical studies revealed the involvement of electrostatic interactions in complex formation between FNR and its redox partner Fd (13Foust G.P. Mayhew S.G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 964-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and implied a model for complex formation (14De Pascalis A.R. Jelesarow I. Ackermann F. Koppenol W.H. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Bosshard H.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the proposed complex, FNR is predominantly positively and Fd is predominantly negatively charged. It was suggested that FNR and Fd are initially steered toward each other via complementary charge interactions of the molecular dipoles. Subsequently, interaction of basic residues on the surface of FNR and acidic residues on the surface of Fd are thought to help to attain an optimal orientation. Finally, short range forces, such as hydrophobic packing, van der Waals contacts, and hydrogen bonding should also contribute to fine structural rearrangements of the two redox partners, which optimize the interprotein electron transfer. Attempts to solve the three-dimensional structure of an efficient electron transfer complex between FNR and Fd (and NADP+) remained unsuccessful, despite extensive efforts and different crystallographic approaches (4Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).To gain detailed insight into the catalytic reaction mechanism of FNR, we have undertaken to sequence the gene of Capsicum annuumFNR precursor and determined the crystal structure of mature pFNR at 2.5-Å resolution. Moreover, comparison of mature FNRs from different species on the amino acid level as well as on the structural level reveals structurally and functionally conserved features. The crystal structure of pFNR enabled us to model complexes between FNR and its physiological redox partner Fd, resulting in a complex consistent with known biochemical data. This model suggests a mechanism for complex formation between FNR and Fd. Furthermore, we were able to derive a potential electron transfer pathway for successive electron transfer between FNR and Fd. This should help us to gain further understanding regarding the mechanisms of intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer processes, which are still debated.

While all members show the characteristic two-domain FNR motif, some members like PDR also contain extra domain(s) to extend their catalytic capability. Electron transfer reactions involving protein-protein interactions require the formation of a transient complex that brings together the two redox centers exchanging electrons. Extensive biochemical studies revealed the involvement of electrostatic interactions in complex formation between FNR and its redox partner Fd (13Foust G.P. Mayhew S.G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 964-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and implied a model for complex formation (14De Pascalis A.R. Jelesarow I. Ackermann F. Koppenol W.H. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Bosshard H.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the proposed complex, FNR is predominantly positively and Fd is predominantly negatively charged. It was suggested that FNR and Fd are initially steered toward each other via complementary charge interactions of the molecular dipoles. Subsequently, interaction of basic residues on the surface of FNR and acidic residues on the surface of Fd are thought to help to attain an optimal orientation. Finally, short range forces, such as hydrophobic packing, van der Waals contacts, and hydrogen bonding should also contribute to fine structural rearrangements of the two redox partners, which optimize the interprotein electron transfer. Attempts to solve the three-dimensional structure of an efficient electron transfer complex between FNR and Fd (and NADP+) remained unsuccessful, despite extensive efforts and different crystallographic approaches (4Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To gain detailed insight into the catalytic reaction mechanism of FNR, we have undertaken to sequence the gene of Capsicum annuumFNR precursor and determined the crystal structure of mature pFNR at 2.5-Å resolution. Moreover, comparison of mature FNRs from different species on the amino acid level as well as on the structural level reveals structurally and functionally conserved features. The crystal structure of pFNR enabled us to model complexes between FNR and its physiological redox partner Fd, resulting in a complex consistent with known biochemical data. This model suggests a mechanism for complex formation between FNR and Fd. Furthermore, we were able to derive a potential electron transfer pathway for successive electron transfer between FNR and Fd. This should help us to gain further understanding regarding the mechanisms of intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer processes, which are still debated.

https://openalex.org/W2007222638,"The δ subunit of the rod photoreceptor PDE has previously been shown to copurify with the soluble form of the enzyme and to solubilize the membrane-bound form (1Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological effect of the δ subunit on the light response of bovine rod outer segments, we measured the real time accumulation of the products of cGMP hydrolysis in a preparation of permeablized rod outer segments. The addition of δ subunit GST fusion protein (δ-GST) to this preparation caused a reduction in the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis in response to light. The maximal reduction of the light response was about 80%, and the half-maximal effect occurred at 385 nm δ subunit. Several experiments suggest that this effect was not due to the effects of δ-GST on transducin or rhodopsin kinase. Immunoblots demonstrated that exogenous δ-GST solubilized the majority of the PDE in ROS but did not affect the solubility of transducin. Therefore, changes in the solubility of transducin cannot account for the effects of δ-GST in the pH assay. The reduction in cGMP hydrolysis was independent of ATP, which indicates that it was not due to effects of δ-GST on rhodopsin kinase. In addition to the effect on cGMP hydrolysis, the δ-GST fusion protein slowed the turn-off of the system. This is probably due, at least in part, to an observed reduction in the GTPase rate of transducin in the presence of δ-GST. These results demonstrate that δ-GST can modify the activity of the phototransduction cascade in preparations of broken rod outer segments, probably due to a functional uncoupling of the transducin to PDE step of the signal transduction cascade and suggest that the δ subunit may play a similar role in the intact outer segment. The δ subunit of the rod photoreceptor PDE has previously been shown to copurify with the soluble form of the enzyme and to solubilize the membrane-bound form (1Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J.

In these cells, light induces a highly regulated and well studied cascade of events that leads to changes in photoreceptor membrane potential and neurotransmitter release. PDE61 is an integral part of this cascade. When a photon of light hits the chromophore in the transmembrane protein rhodopsin, a conformational change occurs that allows the G protein, transducin, to be activated. Transducin then activates PDE6 by binding to its inhibitory γ subunits. When active, PDE6 rapidly hydrolyzes cGMP, causing the closure of cGMP-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the photoreceptor, reduced influx of sodium and calcium, and hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell. The light signal ends when transducin becomes inactive by hydrolyzing its GTP, and rhodopsin kinase phosphorylates rhodopsin, blocking further interaction between transducin and rhodopsin. GDP-bound transducin releases the γ subunits of PDE6, allowing the catalytic subunits of PDE6 to become reinhibited after transducin has hydrolyzed its GTP. Reductions in calcium caused by light stimulate guanylate cyclase to replace the hydrolyzed cGMP.Rhodopsin is a transmembrane protein that is found in the internal membranous disks of photoreceptor cells. Therefore, it is logical that significant fractions of its effectors, transducin and PDE6, are also found on disc membranes. This colocalization presumably helps guarantee the most effective transfer of the light signal from one protein to the next. The localization of these effector molecules to the membrane is dependent on their post-translational modification with prenyl groups (2Qin N. Pittler S.J. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8458-8463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of PDE6, the modifications are found on the catalytic subunits: the α subunit is farnesylated, and the β subunit is geranylgeranylated. In other proteins, such as small G proteins, prenylation is sufficient to bind the protein firmly to the membrane. However, despite having two such hydrophobic prenyl modifications, PDE6 catalytic subunits can easily be removed from the membrane by treatment with detergent-free hypotonic buffers.In addition to the membrane-bound PDE (mPDE), a soluble fraction of rod PDE6 (sPDE) (5Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been identified. Under isotonic conditions, ∼30% of the PDE6 isolated from rod outer segments is found in this soluble fraction. sPDE appears identical to mPDE, except that sPDE is complexed with one or more 17-kDa δ subunits. Purified sPDE (which has bound δ subunit) is activated by transducin with the same dose response as purified mPDE (without δ subunit) in solution (6Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the δ subunit does not appear to directly affect the enzyme's catalytic activity. At this point, the functional roles of sPDE and the δ subunit in the photoreceptor are not clear; however, it is possible that regulation of the localization of PDE6's catalytic subunits could modify the response of the cell to light.Several observations led us to hypothesize that the δ subunit might modulate the activity of the phototransduction cascade. The δ subunit is highly expressed in retina and is localized in the outer segments of the photoreceptors (1Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), so it is in the right location to have an effect on the cascade. Additionally, δ subunit-free PDE6 is activated to a higher level by transducin when the PDE is membrane-bound than when it is in solution (7Fung B.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tyminski P.N. O'Brien D.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Bennett N. Clerc A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7418-7424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the δ subunit could alter PDE6's interaction with the membrane to cause a conformational change or a destabilization of the PDE6/transducin interaction. Alternatively, the δ subunit might simply move PDE6 away from the membrane where active transducin is bound, thus reducing the amount of PDE that is locally available to be activated by transducin. The δ subunit has also been shown to have an effect on the binding of cGMP to noncatalytic sites on PDE6(11). This could modify the PDE's interaction with its γ subunit (and thus its ability to be activated by transducin) or modify the γ subunit's ability to act as a GTPase-activating protein cofactor for transducin. In addition, the δ subunit can interact with RPGR, a photoreceptor protein that has homology to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 (12Linari M. Ueffing M. Manson F. Wright A. Meitinger T. Becker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and can act as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Arl3, a small G protein (13Linari M. Hanzal-Bayer M. Becker J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar interactions could affect phototransduction.Due to the effects of the δ subunit on the solubility of PDE6, we hypothesized that the δ subunit would reduce the PDE activity induced by a flash of light. In this paper, we test this hypothesis and demonstrate the effect of δ subunit-GST fusion protein on light-induced PDE activity in isolated rod outer segments. We use an assay that measures the real time accumulation of the products of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis, so the effect of δ-GST on both the rate of cGMP hydrolysis and the inactivation of the system is shown. Since this assay measures protons generated as a direct consequence of cGMP hydrolysis in homogenized rod outer segments, the effects we see cannot be affected by downstream changes in the phototransduction pathway, such as Ca2+ influx and channel closure. We also perform experiments that suggest that the effects of δ-GST on cGMP hydrolysis are probably due to direct effects on the catalytic activity of the PDE rather than effects on other parts of the phototransduction cascade.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFresh bovine eyes were purchased from Schenk Packing (Stanwood, Washington). [α-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ultrafree® filters were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Super Signal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.MethodsDelta Subunit Expression and PurificationRecombinant δ subunit was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase (δ-GST) and purified as described (42Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Concentrations of all proteins were determined using the Bradford assay (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Peptide SynthesisAll peptides prepared in this study were prepared using the previously published general method for peptide synthesis with or without prenyl groups and C-terminal methyl esters (15Liu L. Jang G.F. Farnsworth C.C. Yokoyama K. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All peptides were purified to apparent homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase column, and their structures were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Peptides used in this paper were described previously in detail (42Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and include GKQPGGGPASKSC (α-13-f-Me), PASKSC (α-6-f-Me), and PRSSTC (β-6-gg-Me), all with C-terminal methylation and prenylation. As negative controls, GKQPGGGPASKSC(S-farnesyl)-COOH without methylation (α-13-f-OH) and PRSSTC-COOMe without prenylation (β-6-np-Me) were used.pH AssayThis assay is used to measure time-dependent cGMP hydrolysis in a mixture of ROS, nucleotides, and proteins. All procedures were performed in complete darkness using an infrared viewer unless otherwise indicated. ROS from fresh retinas (16Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) were permeablized by trituration 10 times through a 28-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml disposable insulin syringe Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ). ROS (final [rhodopsin] = 7–10 μm in a total reaction size of 400 μl) were then added to a solution containing pH assay buffer (140 mmpotassium aspartate, 7 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 3.3 mmMgCl2, 0.986 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0; this buffer is calculated to give 641 nm free Ca2+), 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, and 2 μmδ-GST or control buffer (see purification procedure, above). This was incubated at room temperature for 5 min to allow full mixing of the components. Then cGMP was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the pH electrode was placed in the mixture. The mixture was stirred constantly. After a constant base line (generally 0.1–1 mV/second) was achieved, light flashes were given as indicated in the figure legends. A 25-ms light flash with the 0.0 neutral density filter bleached ∼0.1% of the rhodopsin. Data from the pH meter were collected and analyzed using the DataLogger program and the Serial Box Interface from Vernier Software (Beaverton, OR). Gain was adjusted so that an increase of 1 mV corresponded to about 3.4 × 10−10 mol of cGMP hydrolyzed. Two data points were collected per second. Derivatives shown are from data averaged over seven points. The dark rate of cGMP hydrolysis is subtracted from all results shown in this paper. The pH of the reaction changed 0.3 pH units at most, which has little effect on the PDE's activity (17Miki N. Baraban J.M. Keirns J.J. Boyce J.J. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6320-6327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A long light flash given at the end of every experiment to measure remaining cGMP showed that at least 2.5 mm cGMP remained after all data was collected, significantly above theK m for the enzyme. In some experiments, neutral density filters were used to vary the light intensity of the flash. These filters are graded on a log scale so that a 1.0 filter lets in 10% as much light as a 0.0 filter. 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 filters let in 50, 25, and 12.5% as much light, respectively, as the 0.0 filter.Single Turnover GTPase AssayGTPase activity was determined under the same conditions as those used for the pH assay, except that [α-32P]GTP (∼4 × 104 dpm/pmol, 50 nm) was added to the mixture, and ATP was omitted to remove rhodopsin phosphorylation as a factor in the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Zero time values were determined by first adding 300 μmGTPγS and then the [α-32P]GTP. The assay was carried out as described previously (18Arshavsky V. Gray-Keller M.P. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18530-18537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ROS from fresh bovine eyes (7–10 μm rhodopsin) were mixed with δ subunit, pH assay buffer, and cGMP. This mixture was then incubated in the light or dark for 10 min to hydrolyze endogenous GTP. The reaction was started by the addition of [α-32P]GTP, and 30-μl aliquots were taken at the noted times. Reactions were stopped by adding the aliquots to 115 μl of 6% perchloric acid. After collection, aliquots were treated with 700 μl of 5% activated charcoal in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5). Free phosphate remaining in the supernatant after this treatment was counted in a Tri-Carb scintillation counter (Packard). At the zero time point, between 3 and 7% of the total radioactivity in these reactions remained in the supernatant.ImmunoblotsSamples were prepared for immunoblot analysis by the addition of 6× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples containing ROS were not boiled. After running these samples on 12 or 15% gels, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 140 mmNaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). PDE catalytic subunit immunoreactivity was measured using the PDE6 cat pAb (1Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a rabbit polyclonal antibody, at 1:3000 dilution. Transducin α-subunit immunoreactivity was detected using antibody 5552 (kindly provided by Dr. Jim Hurley) at 1:3000 dilution. Transducin β subunit was detected using the Gβ (M-14) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology at 1:1000 dilution. All primary antibodies were detected by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The secondary antibody was visualized with Super Substrate West Pico chemiluminescent substrate.RESULTSBased on the localization of the δ subunit and its ability to remove PDE6 from the membrane, we hypothesized that δ-GST would reduce the PDE activity seen in response to a flash of light. To test the effect of δ-GST on the light-induced PDE activity, we used the pH assay to measure the real time hydrolysis of cGMP in response to light in a rod outer segment preparation containing key components of the phototransduction cascade (19Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Kaplan M.W. Palczewski K. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 205-215Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this assay, a pH meter was used to measure the generation of H+ produced by the hydrolysis of cGMP into GMP by PDE. In the absence of δ-GST, ROS responded to light with a transient increase in cGMP hydrolysis due to activation of the phototransduction cascade (Fig.1 A, top trace). The rate of cGMP hydrolysis throughout the course of the reaction was measured by taking the derivative of the raw data shown in Fig. 1 A (Fig. 1 B). After the light flash, the rate of cGMP hydrolysis increased as the PDE was activated by transducin and then after about 50 s returned to the base-line dark rate of hydrolysis as the cascade was shut off by transducin's GTPase activity, the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase, and reassociation of the inhibitory γ subunit of PDE6.The addition of δ-GST to this reaction resulted in a decrease in the total amount of cGMP hydrolyzed (Fig. 1 A, bottom trace). This was associated with a reduction in the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis in the presence of δ-GST (Fig. 1 B,bottom trace).Peptides that can block δ-GST's ability to solubilize PDE have been developed (42Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These peptides block the solubilization of PDE6 by 2 μm δ-GST with IC50 values ranging from 1 to 10 μm. To determine whether they would also block δ-GST's effect in the pH assay, these peptides (10 μm) were added to the pH assay reaction mixture (Fig.2). At this concentration, the peptides do block the effect of δ-GST (Fig. 2, A and B). Peptides alone, without δ subunit, do not affect the response to light (Fig. 2, C and D). This is not surprising, since immunoblots show that these ROS preparations contain little endogenous δ subunit (data not shown).Figure 2Block of δ-GST effect by prenylated peptides. The experiment was performed as in Fig. 1, except that some samples were also incubated with 10 μmprenylated, methylated peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the α or β catalytic subunit. A and B, peptides block δ-GST effect. Thick dashed line, ROS alone; lower solid line, ROS with δ subunit; upper dashed line, ROS with 10 μmβ-6-gg-Me; dotted line, ROS with 10 μm α-13-f-Me.

Unprenylated or unmethylated peptides cannot block δ-GST's effects in this assay (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)pH assay experiments were repeated to take into account variations between different preparations of ROS and δ-GST. Figs. 1 and 2 show representative data from one experiment; Fig.3 shows the average maximum rate of cGMP hydrolysis from three separate experiments. Purified expressed GST alone had no effect in this assay (data not shown).Figure 3δ-GST's effect on the maximum rate of cGMP hydrolysis corresponds with the movement of PDE from the pellet fraction into the supernatant. pH assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The graph shows the average maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis from three separate experiments.Error bars represent the S.D. Aliquots (25 μl) of each reaction were spun down at 14,000 × g for 10 min to separate membrane-bound from soluble fractions. These fractions were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and the localization of the PDE catalytic subunits was determined by doing a Western blot with the PDE6 cat pAb(1) at 1:1000 dilution (insets: S, soluble fraction;P, pellet fraction). The peptide used in this Western blot experiment was α-6-f-Me. α-13-f-OH had no effect on the δ subunit activity (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoblots of ROS supernatants and pellets were performed to determine whether PDE6 catalytic subunits were solubilized under the same conditions used for the pH assay. These blots demonstrate that PDE6 catalytic subunits become soluble at the concentrations of δ-GST used, unless peptide is present to block the effect of δ-GST (Fig.3). Since the hypothesis being tested suggested that the reduction in cGMP hydrolysis would be caused by this solubilization of the PDE by δ-GST, we determined whether both of these effects occur in a similar concentration range of δ-GST (Fig. 4). Dose-response curves of the solubilization of PDE catalytic subunits by δ-GST (Fig. 4 A) and the δ-GST-associated reduction in cGMP hydrolysis (Fig. 4 B) were performed. Both effects occur in a similar concentration range. This strongly suggests that the two effects are causally linked.Figure 4Dose response of δ-GST actions. A, solubilization of PDE6 by δ-GST. ROS aliquots (7 μm) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of δ-GST for 5 min. Supernatants were separated from pellets by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g, and immunoblots to show PDE6 catalytic subunit immunoreactivity were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” S, supernatant fraction; P, pellet fraction. B, assay was performed as in Fig. 1 with varying amounts of δ subunit. The maximum rate of cGMP hydrolysis as a percentage of the maximum rate seen without δ subunit is shown. Data shown is the average of three experiments done with two separate δ subunit preparations. Data were fitted with an exponential equation to determine IC50. Error bars, S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dose-response curve using various amounts of δ-GST (Fig.4 B) showed that the IC50 of δ-GST's effect in the pH assay was 385 nm. Based on calculations of the rhodopsin/PDE ratio in bovine rod outer segments (21Pugh E.N.J. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 111-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), there should be about 140 nm holo-PDE in this preparation, 280 nm catalytic subunits. Therefore, the IC50 of δ-GST was in the range of the amount of PDE catalytic subunits in this experiment. Since other work has suggested that the δ subunit interacts with the catalytic subunits with high affinity (≤14 nm) (1Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it is likely that this IC50 represents titration of the catalytic subunits by the δ subunit and underestimates the true affinity of the interaction.The magnitude of the δ-GST effect on the maximum rate of cGMP hydrolysis was dependent on light intensity (Fig.5). Using a 1.0 neutral density filter, which blocks 90% of the light that will come through a 0.0 filter (∼0.01% rhodopsin bleached), the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis in the presence of δ-GST was 80% of the maximal rate without δ-GST (Fig. 5, A and C). Using a 0.0 neutral density filter (∼0.1% rhodopsin bleached) the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis in the presence of δ-GST was 18% of the maximal rate without δ subunit (Fig. 5, A and B). Immunoblots showed that δ-GST brought approximately the same amount of PDE into the supernatant with and without light exposure (data not shown), so the variable effect of δ-GST was not due to different amounts of PDE being solubilized under different light conditions. One interpretation of these results is that in the presence of δ subunit, the response of the ROS is basically independent of light; a similar, low level response is always seen. Another possibility is that the dose-response curve for light has been shifted well to the right. Due to high noise at low light intensities and the lack of a brighter light source, we could not distinguish between these two possibilities by using higher or lower light levels.Figure 5δ-GST's effect on maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis is more pronounced at higher light levels. pH assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. 25-ms flashes were given using neutral density filters, which block up to 90% of the light.

Flashes without a neutral density filter (0.0; ∼0.1% rhodopsin bleached) and with a 0.3 neutral density filter (∼0.05% rhodopsin bleached) were given with (lower two lines) and without (upper two lines) δ-GST.

Flashes were given with 0.6 (∼0.025% rhodopsin bleached) and 0.9 (∼0.0125% rhodopsin bleached) filters with (lower two lines) and without (upper two lines) δ-GST. These results are representative of experiments performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to its effect on the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis, δ-GST prolonged the time to turn-off of the system (Fig.6). The amount of time that it took for the rate of cGMP hydrolysis to be reduced from its maximal value to half of the maximal value (over base line) was calculated. In the presence of 2 μm δ-GST, it took ∼2.5 times as long for the signal from a 0.0 flash to be reduced by half. Due to the larger amount of noise in derivatives of lower light flashes, it was not possible to determine whether this effect of δ-GST was also reduced at lower levels of light.Figure 6δ-GST increases the amount of time it takes to reduce the maximum rate of cGMP hydrolysis by half. pH assays were performed as described in Fig. 2 using a 0.0 neutral density filter. Maximum rates of cGMP hydrolysis were calculated, and the time it took for responses to return halfway to base line was measured. Data shown represent the average of three experiments; error bars represent the S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was important to determine whether the effects on cGMP hydrolysis and inactivation were due to action on the PDE itself, to the effects of δ-GST on some other part of the signal transduction cascade, or a combination of these two possibilities. Previous studies have shown that δ-GST can solubilize mPDE and that the δ subunit appears to have no direct effect on the catalytic activity of the PDE. Fig. 4shows that solubilization of PDE is associated with the reduction of cGMP hydrolysis by δ-GST, and both effects of δ-GST were negated by preincubation with peptides that block the solubilization of PDE activity (42Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by δ-GST (Figs. 2 and 3). These observations suggest that the effects of δ-GST in the pH assay may be due to PDE solubilization, but they do not rule out that δ-GST's effects could be due to actions on other proteins in the signal transduction cascade.

Lytic enzymes and oxygen radicals released by PMN are important in clearing an infection or cellular debris, but can also produce host tissue damage. Failure to properly regulate the inflammatory response contributes to a variety of human diseases like sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in surgical intensive care units. Many aspects of human disease pathology, including hepatic PMN infiltration, can be recapitulated in mice using an endotoxic shock model. Six quantitative trait loci that predispose to high infiltration of PMN in hepatic sinusoids after high-dose endotoxin administration were provisionally identified. Two of these loci, Hpi1 and Hpi2 on mouse chromosomes 5 and 13, were mapped to the significant and highly significant level using a low-resolution genome scan on 122 intercross animals. These loci interact epistatically to produce a high degree of PMN infiltration. Intercross and recombinant inbred strain mice with a specific genotype at these loci always had a high infiltration response, indicating that genotype analysis at just these two loci can accurately predict a high PMN infiltration response. Genetic predisposition to the degree of PMN infiltration in the inflammatory response in mice suggests that analogous genetic mechanisms occur in human beings that could be used for diagnostic purposes."

We have studied the effects of the N and C domains on the protein structure and its nucleic acid-interactive properties. Although the presence of the C domain decreases the proteolytic susceptibility of the core (central) domain, quenching of the core tryptophan fluorescence by iodide is unaltered by the presence of the terminal domains. These results suggest that the overall conformation of the core domain remains largely independent of the flanking domains. Removal of the N or the C terminus does not abolish the DNA renaturation activity of the protein. However, intact protein and its three truncated forms differ in DNA helix-destabilizing activity. The C domain alone is responsible for the kinetic barrier to natural DNA helix destabilization seen with intact protein. Intact protein and core domain potentiate the DNA helix-destabilizing activity of truncated protein lacking only the C domain (*I), enhancing the observed hyperchromicity while increasing the melting temperature. Proteolysis experiments suggest that the affinity of core domain for single-stranded DNA is increased in the presence of *I.

Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), has been a model for single strand-specific nucleic acid-binding proteins (2Karpel R.L. Revzin A. The Biology of Non-specific DNA-Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1990: 103-130Google Scholar). 32 protein1 binds cooperatively to single-stranded nucleic acids, a property essential to its roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair as well as to its ability to regulate its own expression at the translational level. The protein consists of three domains, originally defined and generated by limited proteolysis experiments (2Karpel R.L. Revzin A. The Biology of Non-specific DNA-Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1990: 103-130Google Scholar). Each of these domains is structurally and functionally distinct. For example, removal of the protein N-terminal (B) domain to form the *II product results in the complete loss of cooperativity (3Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the C-terminal domain in *II reduces somewhat the intrinsic affinity of the protein for single-stranded nucleic acid (3Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, binding cooperativity is clearly the result of homotypic protein-protein interactions that occur when the protein binds nucleic acid. The core domain (*III) contains the intrinsic nucleic acid binding site (4Williams K.R. Konigsberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2463-2470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Karpel R.L.

In the crystal structure of this domain complexed to a single-stranded oligonucleotide, the substrate is located within a positively charged cleft (6Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Within this cleft is the internal (Lys/Arg)3(Ser/Thr)2 (LAST) motif, which we had previously predicted to be involved directly in nucleic acid binding (8Casas-Finet J.R. Fischer K.R. Karpel R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Casas-Finet J.R. Karpel R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9735-9744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the oligonucleotide is disordered within the crystal, modeling of the substrate clearly showed the basic side chains of Lys (110), Arg (111), and Lys (112) in contact with the nucleic acid phosphates and plausibly positioned the heterocyclic bases in contact with hydrophobic pockets (6Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A large number of biophysical experiments indicates that both electrostatic and nonpolar interactions contribute to the overall binding free energy (2Karpel R.L. Revzin A. The Biology of Non-specific DNA-Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1990: 103-130Google Scholar). The C-terminal (A) domain has a major role in gene 32 protein interaction with other T4 proteins (10Krassa K.B. Green L.S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a property that is the basis of viewing this protein as a “candidate organizing factor” for protein-protein interactions (12Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M.A. Hanson E.S. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This domain has another very interesting property: it modulates the ability of the protein to lower the melting temperature of natural double-stranded DNA helices. On the basis of its selective binding affinity for single strands, the protein should possess significant helix-destabilizing activity. However, the intact protein fails to lower the T m of natural dsDNA, suggesting that there is a kinetic block to protein-induced melting (1Alberts B.M. Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 13Jensen D.E. Kelly R.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7215-7228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, proteolytic excision of the A domain from the C terminus of 32 protein yields a product (*I) that lowers theT m of natural dsDNA by ≈60 °C, consistent with the removal of the kinetic block. *I promotes rapid renaturation of single-stranded DNA at temperatures below T m (14Hosoda J. Moise H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7547-7558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, full-length 32 protein will renature DNA, but it does not lower T m under any of the tested conditions (13Jensen D.E. Kelly R.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7215-7228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in 32 protein, it appears that the presence of the C-terminal domain establishes the kinetic barrier to DNA helix destabilization. The presence of this domain has a small negative effect on intrinsic nucleic acid binding affinity (3Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although to a first approximation the binding properties of each domain are independent of the others, there are indications that there are functional linkages among them. We have observed that the residues within the N-terminal domain most essential for homotypic protein-protein interaction, Lys (3Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)-Arg (4Williams K.R. Konigsberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2463-2470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)-Lys (5Karpel R.L. Levin V.Y. Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9359-9366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)-Ser (6Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)-Thr (7Wu M. Flynn E.K. Karpel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), are homologous to the aforementioned LAST residues within the core domain, Lys (110)-Arg (111)-Lys (112)-Thr (113)-Ser (114). On the basis of this and other observations, we devised a model for the cooperative binding of 32 protein (8Casas-Finet J.R. Fischer K.R. Karpel R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Casas-Finet J.R. Karpel R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9735-9744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the absence of bound nucleic acid, we proposed that there is an internal interaction between core domain LAST residues and an acidic surface located elsewhere on the protein. Upon cooperatively binding single-stranded nucleic acid, these LAST residues now interact with the acidic nucleic acid backbone, and a conformational change is effected whereby the N-terminal B domain is positioned to interact with the acidic surface of the adjacent 32 protein. Thus, these residues are proposed to interact with both an acidic protein surface and the acidic nucleic acid surface; the acidic protein surface is capable of interaction with both N-terminal and core domain LAST sequences. The model links the functionality of nearly identical sequences within the N-terminal and core domains, and if the acidic surface is associated with the C-terminal domain (see below), then all three domains become functionally linked. Additional evidence that the domains are linked to each other comes from the nucleic acid binding properties of full-length 32 protein with mutations within the N-terminal LAST sequence at positions 3 and 4 (15Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,16Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27623-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Were the domains fully independent, these mutations would be expected to affect only the cooperativity parameter, ω, a measure of homotypic protein-protein interaction. However, several mutants,e.g. Arg (4Williams K.R. Konigsberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2463-2470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) → Glu, affect both ω andK int, the affinity of the protein for an isolated binding site on the nucleic acid. Since the nucleic acid-interactive surface within 32 protein is clearly within the core domain, the alteration in K int suggests that there was a change of some sort in this surface brought about by a change in the homotypic protein-protein interaction. In our ongoing effort to understand how the protein modulates its various functionalities through its structural domains, we provide in this report answers to the following questions. 1) Do the N- or C-terminal domains have an effect on the conformation of the core domain? 2) Is the helix-destabilizing activity of *I a consequence of its nucleic acid binding cooperativity? 3) Is the helix-destabilizing activity of *I a direct consequence of its stoichiometric binding to ssDNA? 4) Can different forms of 32 protein coordinately associate with ssDNA, and can the binding of one form potentiate the binding of another? We find that the presence of the C-terminal domain decreases the proteolytic susceptibility of residues within the core domain. However, the quenching of the core domain tryptophan residue fluorescence by iodide is unaltered by the presence or absence of the terminal domains. These results further support the notion that the C domain modulates accessibility of large substrates to the nucleic acid binding surface, but the overall conformation of the core domain remains largely independent of the flanking regions. We have studied in detail the helix denaturation and renaturation activities of the three truncated products of gene 32 protein. In addition, we have evaluated the nucleic acid helix-destabilizing activities of gene 32 protein lacking its C terminus (*I) in the presence of full-length protein or core domain (*III, lacking both N and C domains). Our results indicate that under conditions (0.05m NaCl) where *III shows no measurable effect onT m , the addition of this adduct increases the amount of DNA melting in the presence of a fixed amount of *I. Similar results are observed for the effect of intact protein on *I-effected DNA melting. In both cases, although the hyperchromic change is enhanced, the actual melting temperature increases. In general, the enhancement of hyperchromicity and increase in T m is monotonic with increasing amounts of intact protein or *III. These results reflect binding of full-length protein or core domain to single-stranded regions created by the action of *I and may be indicative of protein-protein interactions between *I and intact protein or *III. pYS6 (17Shamoo Y.

After gel purification, the EcoRI-NcoI fragment of pYS6, which spans codons 1–81 of the structural gene, was ligated with theNcoI-EcoRI fragment of pYS55, which spans codons 81 to 253. This produced plasmid pEKF1 (encoding *I, residues 1–253), and conversely, the corresponding fragments of pYS6 and pYS55 were ligated to produce plasmid pEKF2 (encoding *II, residues 22–301). The scheme is shown in Fig. 1. Restriction analysis and sequencing of the plasmids confirmed the identity of the clones. The plasmids were transformed into the AR120 Escherichia coli cell line. Expression was induced with 0.1 mg/ml nalidixic acid when the cells reached an A 595 of 0.8–0.9, and the proteins were isolated on denatured DNA-cellulose as described previously (7Wu M. Flynn E.K.

Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar), were added to 1000-μl solutions containing 1.00 μm intact gene 32 protein or core domain (*III) in 50 mmNa2HP04, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.7. The results were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation,F o /F = 1 +K Q [Q], where F o = emission of unquenched protein, F = emission of quenched protein, [Q] = concentration of quencher, and K Q is the quenching constant. Plots of F o /F were subjected to linear regression analysis; the uncertainties in the calculated values of K Q were obtained from the S.D. of the slopes of these plots. A 75-base pair HinfI restriction fragment of pBR322 (36% G+C) from a 1-kilobase DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was isolated by electroelution into a dialysis bag and labeled with [α-32P]ATP using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The denatured form of this fragment was prepared by heating the DNA to 95 °C followed by rapid quenching. Reactions were performed in either 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA (low salt buffer) or in 5 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (high salt buffer) at 37 °C for 30 min. 1 pmol of DNA (residue) and 15 pmol of protein (except where noted) were used in each reaction. Unless otherwise noted, reactions were stopped by the addition of buffer to create final concentrations of 0.33% SDS, 15% glycerol, and 0.15% bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis was performed on 15 × 15-cm 10% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 1 × TAE buffer (21Casas-Finet J.R. Smith Jr., J.D. Kumar A. Kim J.G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 873-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Teflon-stoppered micro quartz cuvettes containing 100 μl of test solutions were placed in a Gilford 2400−2 spectrophotometer designed to raise the temperature at a constant rate of 25 °C/h. Generally an absorbance-temperature experiment uses a total of 4 cuvettes (a semimicro reference cuvette containing ≈1 ml of buffer plus 3 micro cuvettes containing samples of 100 μl). In formulating these solutions, the protein components were mixed before the addition of nucleic acid so as to prevent any order of addition problems. Temperature was continually monitored by means of a calibrated thermistor (Yellow Springs Instruments) inserted through a narrow hole in the stopper of the reference cuvette; absorbance was measured at 260 nm. Absorbance-temperature profiles were graphically differentiated, and T m s were determined two ways, as the inflection point of the transition and as the temperature at which half the DNA was melted. Although the melting profiles were not always symmetric, T m values obtained by either method were within the stated uncertainties. The reproducibility was about ±1 °C, except where otherwise noted. We previously showed that although the core domain of gene 32 protein was susceptible to the action of mammalian endoproteinase Arg-C, the intact protein was refractory to digestion (7Wu M. Flynn E.K. Karpel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Casas-Finet J.R. Karpel R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9735-9744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of the N- or the C-terminal domain is responsible for this protection, we compared the endo Arg-C digestion behavior of all three truncated products. As seen in Fig. 2, the digestion pattern of *I is similar to that of *III, although the core domain is somewhat more susceptible to the action of the enzyme. The 17- and 11-kDa bands produced by digestion of both *III and *I were previously identified as being generated by cleavage at, respectively, Arg-111 (corresponding to residues 112–253/4) and Arg-138 (corresponding to residues 139–253/4 (7Wu M. Flynn E.K. Karpel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Both these residues are located within the nucleic acid binding cleft of core domain (6Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, virtually no low molecular weight products are seen when *II is digested, where, as is the case with full-length protein, only small amounts of a band corresponding to *III are observed (9Casas-Finet J.R. Karpel R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9735-9744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The interacting oligonucleotide, p(dT)5, inhibits digestion at these sites in both *III and *I but has no apparent effect on the limited action of the protease on *II (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the presence of the C-terminal domain either blocks access to the arginines in the DNA binding cleft or alters the conformation of the protein in the vicinity of these residues. To further probe the influence of the flanking regions on the conformation of core domain, we have determined the effect of the collisional quencher, KI, on the tryptophan fluorescence of intact protein and of core domain. All five Trp residues are located within the core domain. Previous quenching experiments suggest that binding of oligonucleotides exposes a tryptophan side chain to the solvent environment (19Kelly R.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7229-7239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plots of the ratio of unquenched (F o ) to quenched (F) fluorescence emission versus quencher concentration (Stern-Volmer) plots are linear and are of identical slope for both forms of the protein (Fig.3; K Q = 5.03 ± 0.09 and 4.95 ± 0.10 for intact protein and core domain, respectively). These results suggest that the iodide-induced quenching is entirely due to a collisional mechanism, as noted previously for intact protein by Kelly and von Hippel (19Kelly R.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7229-7239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the accessibility of the Trp residues that are quenched is identical for both forms of the protein. Although one or two of the Trp residues in (folded) 32 protein are “dark” (2Karpel R.L. Revzin A. The Biology of Non-specific DNA-Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1990: 103-130Google Scholar) and therefore do not serve as reporters for KI quenching experiments, the identical slopes of the Stern-Volmer plots strongly indicates that the local conformation of the remaining tryptophans are equivalent. These results also suggest that the overall conformation of the core domain is essentially independent of the flanking N- and C-terminal domains, a conclusion consistent with a wide body of data (2Karpel R.L. Revzin A. The Biology of Non-specific DNA-Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1990: 103-130Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of the C domain on endoproteinase Arg-C digestion is likely due to a reduction in accessibility of Arg-110 and Arg-138 to the active site of the protease. As we noted in the Introduction, whole gene 32 protein is unable to lower theT m of long chain double-stranded DNA, and removal of the C-terminal domain removes this inhibition. Initially, we wished to assess and compare both the nucleic acid helix-destabilizing and renaturing activities of intact and truncated gene 32 protein. To do this, we incubated a 32P-labeled 75-base pair restriction fragment, either double-stranded or heat-denatured, with each protein for 30 min at 37 °C in either a very low ionic strength buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) or in the same buffer with 50 mm NaCl and 10 mmMgCl2. The amount of protein used (15 pmol) was sufficient to fully saturate ssDNA under conditions of high affinity. The two ionic conditions were chosen so that in the absence of protein, theT m of DNA is above"
https://openalex.org/W2119347923,"The genes defective in familial Alzheimer's disease encode the proteins presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and 2). Expression of presenilins (PSs) and their proteolytic processing are regulated during neuronal development. Even though these proteins are detected and regulated mainly in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, their subcellular distribution during the development is not known. The present study aimed to investigate the localization of PSs and their role during early developmental stage using mouse embryo model. At preimplantation stage, PSs were detected not only in cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus from oocyte to 2.5 dpc (day postcoitum), then disappeared in the nucleus at blastocyst stage (3.5 dpc). Antisense against PS1 and PS2 decreased the transition to blastocyst stage, whereas each antisense alone had no effect. Treatment with lactacystin (26S proteosome inhibitor), which arrest cell cycle at M phase, redistributed PSs into centrosome-kinetochore microtubule. PS2 overexpression in HEK 293 cell arrested cell cycle at S phase. These data suggest that PSs play key roles in cell division and differentiation during early development."
https://openalex.org/W1996852743,"To identify new proteins involved in erythropoietin (Epo) signal transduction, we purified the entire set of proteins reactive with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies from Epo-stimulated UT7 cells. Antisera generated against these proteins were used to screen a lambdaEXlox expression library. One of the isolated cDNAs encodes Gbeta2, the beta2 subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. Gbeta and Galpha(i) coprecipitated with the Epo receptor (EpoR) in extracts from human and murine cell lines and from normal human erythroid progenitor cells. In addition, in vitro Gbeta associated with a fusion protein containing the intracellular domain of the EpoR. Using EpoR mutants, we found that the distal part of the EpoR (between amino acids 459-479) was required for Gi binding. Epo activation of these cells induced the release of the Gi protein from the EpoR. Moreover in isolated cell membranes, Epo treatment inhibited ADP-ribosylation of Gi and increased the binding of GTP. Our results show that heterotrimeric Gi proteins associate with the C-terminal end of the EpoR. Receptor activation leads to the activation and dissociation of Gi from the receptor, suggesting a functional role of Gi protein in Epo signal transduction."

Premakumar R. Stacey G. Burris R.H. Evans H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 736-762Google Scholar). Expression of the three nitrogenases is regulated by the metal content of the culture medium (2Luque F. Pau R.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dinitrogenase contains a unique iron-sulfur-heterometal cofactor that is the active site of the enzyme. The iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co)1 constitutes the active site of the nif-encoded, molybdenum-containing dinitrogenase. It is composed of molybdenum, iron, sulfur, and the organic acid homocitrate in a 1:7:9:1 ratio (3Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2768-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The active site cofactor of the vnf-encoded, vanadium-containing nitrogenase (FeV-co) is believed to be structurally analogous to FeMo-co, with an atom of vanadium in FeV-co in the position of molybdenum in FeMo-co. The anf-encoded dinitrogenase contains iron as the only metal in its active site cofactor (FeFe-co).The products of several nif genes, includingnifB, nifE, nifN, nifH,nifV, and nifX have been shown to be involved in the synthesis of FeMo-co. The genes coding for the structural components of dinitrogenase (nifDK) are not required (5Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FeMo-co is assembled elsewhere and then inserted into dinitrogenase. The metabolic product of the protein encoded by nifB is NifB-co, a FeMo-co precursor that has been shown to be the iron and sulfur donor to the cofactor (6Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifB-co is most probably also a precursor of FeV-co and FeFe-co, because nifB is required for vanadium-dependent and iron only-dependent diazotrophic growth of A. vinelandii (8Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene products of nifE and nifN form a heterotetrameric protein (NifNE) that has been shown to bind NifB-co (9Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is proposed to serve as a scaffold during cofactor synthesis (10Brigle K.E. Weiss M.C. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The counterparts of NifE and NifN in the vnf system (VnfE and VnfN) probably serve a similar function during the synthesis of FeV-co. The product ofnifH ( and vnfH), dinitrogenase reductase, has multiple functions in the nitrogenase system. Besides being the obligate electron donor to dinitrogenase during catalysis, it is also required for FeMo-co (FeV-co) biosynthesis (11Shah V.K. Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Paustian T.D. Roberts G.P.

Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5963-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homocitrate is a structural component of FeMo-co and presumably FeV-co and FeFe-co, because nifV is required for full functionality of all three dinitrogenases (15Kennedy C. Dean D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The products of nifX and its homologue vnfX have also been shown to be involved in FeMo-co and FeV-co synthesis, respectively, although their exact role remains to be established. A vanadium- and iron-containing cluster having similar EPR characteristics to FeV-co accumulates on VnfX during FeV-co synthesis (16Rüttimann-Johnson C. Staples C.R. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K.

Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It typically involves mixing of extracts from two different mutants defective in the synthesis of the cofactor or a mutant extract complemented with the purified missing component(s). In vitro synthesis of FeV-co has not been accomplished yet. Here we report the homocitrate-dependent in vitro incorporation of a VnfX-associated V-Fe-S cluster intonif apodinitrogenase.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo investigate in vitro FeV-co synthesis, extracts of different mutant strains defective in FeV-co (or FeMo-co) synthesis were mixed and incubated in conditions similar to those that have been described for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis (18Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When an extract of vanadium-grown A. vinelandii CA11.1, which lacks the structural components of vnf-nitrogenase, was complemented with an extract of tungsten-grown A. vinelandii UW45 (nifB− ) (in the presence of other components; see “Experimental Procedures”), acetylene reduction activity was observed (Table I,line 1). High activities were also observed when the extract of A. vinelandii UW45 was replaced by purifiednif-apodinitrogenase (Table I, line 2). Both the extract of UW45 (W) and the purifiednif-apodinitrogenase were added in amounts that were saturating in the assay, as determined by titration (see “Experimental Procedures”). The enzyme responsible for the acetylene reduction activity observed is probably a hybrid ofnif-dinitrogenase and FeV-co. The activity detected is characteristic of alternative nitrogenases, because ethane as well as ethylene were produced from acetylene. The ratio of ethylene to ethane produced (C2H6/C2H4 × 100) ranged from 2.2 to 2.9. These values are in the same range that has been described for vnf-nitrogenases (29Dilworth M.J. Eady R.R. Eldridge M.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Eady R.R. Chem.

J. 1988; 250: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A control assay containing Mo and all factors necessary for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis showed high ethylene production activity but no detectable ethane, as expected (Table I, line 3).Table IAcetylene reduction activities of mixtures of extracts of different A. vinelandii mutant strainsMixtureEthylene formedEthane formednmol/minnmol/min 1.

Open table in a new tab Because the reaction mixture used contains all factors necessary for FeMo-co synthesis, except for Mo, it is important to show that the activity seen (or part of it) is not due to FeMo-co being synthesized using contaminating Mo present in the system. The level of activity arising from contaminating Mo present in the assay solutions and in the extract of UW45 grown in tungsten is very low, as can be seen in TableI, line 9. This control assay contains all components necessary for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis, except for Mo. A control experiment using an air-oxidized extract of vanadium-grownA. vinelandii CA11.1 and all other factors necessary for the reaction exhibited significantly reduced activity (Table I, line 5) compared with the experimental values, showing that the activities seen in Table I, lines 1 and 2 do not arise from contaminating Mo supplied by the extract of A. vinelandii CA11.1. Furthermore, when the assay was carried out with an extract of a tungsten-tolerant A. vinelandii strain that is incapable of Mo accumulation (CA11.6.82, tungsten-tolerant,vnfD82::Tn5-B21ΔnifHDK Rifr, (24Premakumar P. Jacobitz S. Ricke S.C. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 691-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), similar levels of activity were observed (Table I, line 4).To show that the cofactor present in this nitrogenase contains vanadium, the assay was carried out under standard conditions using purified nif-apodinitrogenase and an extract of A. vinelandii CA11.1 that had been grown in the presence of49V (a radioactive isotope of vanadium). The assay mixture was electrophoresed under anoxic native conditions, and the gel was analyzed by phosphorimaging. A transfer of label from VnfX to the position of dinitrogenase was observed (Fig.1, lane 2). An extract ofA. vinelandii CA12 (ΔnifHDK) grown in the presence of 49V was loaded in Fig. 1, lane 4 as a standard to show the migration of vnf-dinitrogenase in the gel. 55Fe-labeled nif-dinitrogenase obtained byin vitro FeMo-co synthesis using 55Fe-NifB-co is shown in Fig. 1, lane 5. Both nitrogenases run as multiple bands in anoxic native gel conditions. The reason for this is unknown. It has been described previously that in A. vinelandii CA11.1 most of the 49V accumulates on VnfX, as seen in Fig.1, lane 1, in the form of a vanadium-containing Fe-S cluster (16Rüttimann-Johnson C. Staples C.R. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18087-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Experiments in which a source of vnf-apodinitrogenase was provided instead of nif-apodinitrogenase were also conducted. Extracts of A. vinelandii CA117.3 (ΔnifDKΔnifB) and CA11.8 (ΔnifHDKvnfH) were used as sources ofvnf-apodinitrogenase. Unexpectedly, very low nitrogenase activity was observed in these experiments (Table I, lines 6 and 7). Accordingly, no 49V was seen associated to dinitrogenase by phosphorimage analysis of anoxic native gels of these incubations (Fig. 1, lane 3). The reason for the failure to see nitrogenase activity in these conditions is currently unknown. All the factors necessary for the synthesis of FeV-co should be present in the extract of A. vinelandii CA11.1 grown in vanadium, because the addition of purifiednif-apodinitrogenase alone is enough to see the activity. Thus, the lack of activity observed when usingvnf-apodinitrogenase could be due to inefficient insertion of the cofactor. It is possible that an unknown factor required for insertion is labile and does not withstand the cell lysis or assay conditions. It has been shown that the product of vnfG is required for insertion of FeV-co into vnf- dinitrogenase (21Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6819-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). VnfG was present in the extracts used as a source ofvnf-apodinitrogenase, as estimated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). What protein, if any, was facilitating the insertion of the newly formed FeV-co into nif-apodinitrogenase in the experiments described earlier is not known. VnfG was not present in the incubation mixtures containing nif-apodinitrogenase, because the mutant strain used (CA11.1) has a deletion in vnfDGK. The non-nif protein gamma has been shown to function as a chaperone that aids insertion of FeMo-co intonif-apodinitrogenase (26Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gamma is expressed undervnf conditions and was present in the extracts of A. vinelandii CA11.1, as well as part of thenif-apodinitrogenase used (α2β2γ2). A stable association of FeV-co with gamma has not been observed before and gamma is not able to replace VnfG effectively in the insertion of FeV-co intovnf-apodinitrogenase (21Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6819-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is possible that gamma can transiently associate with FeV-co and allow its insertion intonif-apodinitrogenase. Alternatively, some other protein or VnfX itself may be acting as the insertase in this system. Experiments with purified components where no gamma is present will provide insight into this problem.Effect of Homocitrate AnaloguesBecause A. vinelandii CA11.1 is defective in the subunits forvnf-dinitrogenase and not in any of the genes known to encode proteins required for the biosynthesis of FeV-co, it seemed possible that the activity seen in Table I (lines 1,2, and 4) was due to FeV-co present in this extract. It has been reported that the V-Fe-S cluster accumulating on VnfX in extracts of A. vinelandii CA11.1 contains no or very low levels of homocitrate (16Rüttimann-Johnson C. Staples C.R. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18087-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test whether homocitrate incorporation into the unfinished cluster occurs in vitro, we studied the effect of homocitrate analogues on the reaction. These organic acids are able to replace homocitrate in the FeMo-co synthesis system (27Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Liang J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3647-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), resulting in the synthesis of aberrant forms of FeMo-co that are known to exhibit altered substrate specificity (27Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,32Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Liang J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3647-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The use of isocitrate and malate in FeMo-co synthesis results in dinitrogenases with 8–16% of the wild type acetylene reduction activities (27Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When added in an excess in in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assays containing homocitrate, these organic acids cause a reduction in the level of the acetylene reduction activity of the resulting dinitrogenase. Isocitrate and malate were added to the assays containing an extract of vanadium-grown A. vinelandii CA11.1 and nif-apodinitrogenase (TableII). When no organic acid was added to the reaction, some residual activity was seen, presumably resulting from the homocitrate present in the extract. High activity was observed when 0.1 mm homocitrate (final concentration) was added. This concentration has been shown to be saturating for the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction (32Hoover T.R. Imperial J. Liang J. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3647-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In assay mixtures containing 0.1 mm homocitrate and isocitrate (5 and 10 mm), acetylene reduction activities were decreased by 86 and 89%, respectively. The highest concentration of malate used (20 mm) resulted in a 46% decrease in the acetylene reduction ability of nitrogenase. To ensure that the effect of the organic acids observed was not an inhibition of the coupled acetylene reduction assay, isocitrate and malate were added to control reactions immediately before the acetylene reduction assays were started (TableII, lines 10–13). The highest concentrations used of malate and isocitrate only inhibited acetylene reduction by 10.4 and 5.9%, respectively. Thus, the low activities observed when adding the organic acids during the synthesis phase probably reflect the incorporation of the homocitrate analogues into FeV-co during the reaction.Table IIEffect of homocitrate analogues on acetylene reduction activity by resulting nitrogenaseOrganic acid added during FeV-co synthesis phaseEthylene producedDecrease in activitynmol/min% 1.

HC, homocitrate. Open table in a new tab Requirements for the Homocitrate Incorporation ReactionTo further characterize the reaction taking place when incubating the extract of vanadium-grown A. vinelandii CA11.1 withnif-apodinitrogenase, a crude extract was chromatographed on Sephadex G-25 to remove low molecular weight molecules. The desalted extract was used for the reactions described in Table III and Fig.2. As expected, the complete system showed high acetylene reduction activity (Table III, line 1) and a shift of the 49V label to the position of nitrogenase in the anoxic native gel (Fig. 2, lane 2). No activity was observed when homocitrate was omitted from the reaction mixture (TableIII, line 4). Accordingly, the appearance of the label on nitrogenase was dependent on the presence of homocitrate (Fig. 2,lane 3). 55Fe-labeled nif dinitrogenase obtained by in vitro FeMo-co synthesis using55Fe-NifB-co is shown in Fig. 2, lane 6. The hexameric form of nif-apodinitrogenase (α2β2γ2), which is directly activable by FeMo-co, was used in these reactions. Apodinitrogenase can also exist in a tetrameric form (α2β2), which is not activable by FeMo-co. The maturation of the α2β2 form into the α2β2γ2 form requires ATP and dinitrogenase reductase (26Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not the insertion of FeMo-co into the mature α2β2γ2 form. In our system, ATP was found not to be necessary for the homocitrate incorporation reaction or for the insertion of FeV-co into apodinitrogenase (Table III, line 5; Fig. 2, lane 5). The omission of NifB-co from the incubation mixture did not have a significant effect on the observed activity (Table III,line 6), nor did the exclusion of Na3VO4 or its replacement by VCl3(Table III, lines 7 and 8). Similarly, the presence of unlabeled Na3VO4 in the reaction mixture did not affect the intensity of the 49V label seen on nitrogenase (Fig. 2, lane 4). These observations are consistent with the idea that the reaction occurring in vitro is the incorporation of homocitrate into the cluster associated with VnfX that already contains vanadium, iron, and sulfur. When the reaction was carried out using a desalted extract of A. vinelandii CA11.1 grown with a source of unlabeled vanadium, and49VCl5 was included in the reaction mixture, no49V was observed associated with dinitrogenase in phosphorimages of anoxic native gels, despite high nitrogenase activities (data not shown). Thus, the in vitro FeV-co synthesis system seems to use only vanadium already associated with the cluster. It is also conceivable that incorporation of vanadium into the cluster occurs in vitro but that the system is only able to use the chemical form of vanadium present in the extract, which may be different from the form of vanadium supplied externally. However, desalted 49V-labeled extracts show homocitrate-dependent incorporation of 49V into nitrogenase (Fig. 2, lane 2), and thus, we conclude that the label is transferred from a macromolecule-bound form.Table IIIRequirements for FeV-co synthesisConditionEthylene formedEthane formednmol/minnmol/min1.

VnfH (NifH) is known to be involved in FeV-co (FeMo-co) synthesis (12Filler W.A. Kemp R.M. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A. Smith B.E. Eur. J.

Thus, nifH vnfH double mutants are unable to synthesize FeMo-co and FeV-co. No acetylene reduction activities were seen when trying to complement an extract of a mutant strain defective in VnfH and NifH (A. vinelandii CA11.8) grown in vanadium medium with an extract of UW45 grown in tungsten medium, which contains NifH andnif-apodinitrogenase (TableIV, line 1). The same results were obtained when purified apodinitrogenase and NifH were used instead of the extract of UW45 grown in tungsten (Table IV, line 3) or when a source of VnfH (an extract of CA117.3 grown in vanadium) was added to these assays (Table IV, lines 2 and 4).

https://openalex.org/W2051914601,"Exposure of B-lineage lymphoid cells to a 100 microT 60 Hz AC magnetic field has been reported to stimulate the rapid activation of Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases and the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings are significant because of the critical role played by these B cell signaling events in the control of growth and differentiation, and therefore the potential of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure to induce cancer. We report the first study carried out with the aim of reproducing the reported EMF effects on Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases. The system used enabled EMF exposure conditions to be carefully controlled and also allowed experiments to be performed blind. The effects of a 100 microT 60 Hz AC magnetic field on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and on Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinase activities were investigated in Nalm-6 and DT40 B cells in the absence and presence of a 46 microT DC magnetic field. However, no significant effects of low-energy electromagnetic fields on tyrosine kinase activities or protein phosphorylation were observed."
