https://openalex.org/W2082400305,"Arctic and antarctic fishes, living in contact with sea ice at -1.9 degrees C, have plasma equilibrium freezing points near -1.2 degrees C which are dependent on salt concentrations. These supercooled fishes have plasma protein concentrations much higher than other polar animals have, and the proteins impede ice propagation at temperatures down to -2 degrees C. Plasma protein concentration increases as environmental water temperature decreases."

The metacarpal of Paranthropus from Swartkrans, South Africa, was so located with respect to groups of monkeys, apes, and modern man. The results suggest that the fossil metacarpal may be functionally similar to that of chimpanzees."

https://openalex.org/W2001734291,Polyamino acids were thermally prepared from the proportions of amino acids identified (sometimes after hydrolysis) among the products of simulated prebiotic syntheses and (after hydrolysis) in lunar and meteoritic samples. Inferences are made concerning the composition of prebiotic protein and the possible extraterrestrial existence of protein-like polymers.

https://openalex.org/W2067522933,"A charge density analysis of accurate x-ray data for the mineral kernite Na(2)B(4)O(6)(OH)(2). 3H(2)O indicates that the sodium and boron atoms have partial positive charges of 0.4 to 0.5 unit and 0.4 to 0.7 unit, respectively, whereas the oxygen atoms have negative charges of about 0.4 to 0.5 unit. The best agreement with the intensities and with the experimental scale factor is obtained with contracted molecule-optimized atomic orbitals. Difference density maps based on high-order parameters show more density in B-O than in Na-O bonds, thus supporting the covalent nature of the bonds between boron and oxygen atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2067309717,There has been concern about the possibility of selection bias in cloud seeding experiments. Covariates and experimental design have been used to obtain an estimate of this bias. The results indicate that there was no selection bias in the Caribbean and Florida series of cloud seeding experiments.
