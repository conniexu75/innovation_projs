https://openalex.org/W2146573461,"Long non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), a relatively recently recognized class of widely transcribed genes, are thought to affect chromatin state and epigenetic regulation, but their mechanisms of action and potential roles in human disease are poorly understood. This study shows that long non-coding RNAs in the human HOX loci are systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression, and that expression levels of the lincRNA termed HOTAIR can predict cancer metastasis. Elevated levels of HOTAIR can lead to altered patterns of Polycomb binding to the genome. These findings indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the genome. Here it is shown that lincRNAs in the HOX genetic loci are dysregulated during breast cancer progression in human cells, and that expression levels of the lincRNA called HOTAIR can predict whether a tumour will metastasize. Moreover, enforced expression of HOTAIR can lead to altered patterns of binding of the PRC2 protein to the genome. Large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the genome1,2,3 yet their potential involvement in human disease is not well understood4,5. Recent studies of dosage compensation, imprinting, and homeotic gene expression suggest that individual lincRNAs can function as the interface between DNA and specific chromatin remodelling activities6,7,8. Here we show that lincRNAs in the HOX loci become systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression. The lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast tumours and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumours is a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness, particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. These findings indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2024848067,"Epigenetic Maps Methylation of genomic DNA on cytosine bases provides critical epigenetic regulation of gene expression and is involved in silencing transposable elements (TEs) and repeated sequences, as well as regulating imprinted gene expression. Zemach et al. (p. 916 , published online 15 April; see the Perspective by Jeltsch ) analyzed DNA methylation in the genomes of five plants, five fungi, and seven animals by bisulfite sequencing. The data suggest that land plants and vertebrates, which have extensive DNA methylation, are under strong selective pressure to repress TEs, because of their sexual mode of reproduction. Unicellular animals and fungi that reproduce asexually are more likely to lose TE methylation. Although gene body methylation is evolutionarily ancient, it is also mutagenic, and so loss of this pathway has been relatively common and occurred early in fungal evolution and later in several plant and animal lineages."

Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neural coupling analyses that episodic future thinking reduces the rate of delay discounting through a modulation of neural decision-making and episodic future thinking networks. In addition to a standard control condition, real subject-specific episodic event cues were presented during a delay discounting task. Spontaneous episodic imagery during cue processing predicted how much subjects changed their preferences toward more future-minded choice behavior. Neural valuation signals in the anterior cingulate cortex and functional coupling of this region with hippocampus and amygdala predicted the degree to which future thinking modulated individual preference functions. A second experiment replicated the behavioral effects and ruled out alternative explanations such as date-based processing and temporal focus. The present data reveal a mechanism through which neural decision-making and prospection networks can interact to generate future-minded choice behavior.

Episodic imagery reduces impulsivity in intertemporal decision-making Adjustments in discounting were predicted by the degree of ACC-hippocampal coupling Decision-making and prospection networks interact to enable future-minded choice The consequences of choices are often delayed in time, and in many cases it pays off to wait. While agents normally prefer larger over smaller rewards, this situation changes when rewards are associated with costs, such as delays, uncertainties, or effort requirements. Agents integrate such costs into a value function in an individual manner. In the hyperbolic model of delay discounting (also referred to as intertemporal choice), for example, a subject-specific discount parameter accurately describes how individuals discount delayed rewards in value (Green and Myerson, 2004Green L. Myerson J. A discounting framework for choice with delayed and probabilistic rewards.Psychol. Bull. 2004; 130: 769-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, Mazur, 1987Mazur J.E.

Although the degree of delay discounting varies considerably between individuals, humans in general have a particularly pronounced ability to delay gratification, and many of our choices only pay off after months or even years. It has been speculated that the capacity for episodic future thought (also referred to as mental time travel or prospective thinking) (Bar, 2009Bar M.

USA. 2007; 104: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) may underlie the human ability to make choices with high long-term benefits (Boyer, 2008Boyer P. Evolutionary economics of mental time travel?.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2008; 12: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), yielding higher evolutionary fitness of our species. At the neural level, a number of models have been proposed for intertemporal decision-making in humans. In the so-called β-δ model (McClure et al., 2004McClure S.M. Laibson D.I. Loewenstein G. Cohen J.D. Separate neural systems value immediate and delayed monetary rewards.Science. 2004; 306: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, McClure et al., 2007McClure S.M. Ericson K.M. Laibson D.I. Loewenstein G. Cohen J.D. Time discounting for primary rewards.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), a limbic system (β) is thought to place special weight on immediate rewards, whereas a more cognitive, prefrontal-cortex-based system (δ) is more involved in patient choices. In an alternative model, the values of both immediate and delayed rewards are thought to be represented in a unitary system encompassing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and ventral striatum (VS) (Kable and Glimcher, 2007Kable J.W. Glimcher P.W. The neural correlates of subjective value during intertemporal choice.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, Kable and Glimcher, 2010Kable J.W.

Overlapping and distinct neural systems code for subjective value during intertemporal and risky decision making.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 15727-15734Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Finally, in the self-control model, values are assumed to be represented in structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) but are subject to top-down modulation by prefrontal control regions such as the lateral PFC (Figner et al., 2010Figner B. Knoch D. Johnson E.J. Krosch A.R. Lisanby S.H. Fehr E. Weber E.U. Lateral prefrontal cortex and self-control in intertemporal choice.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; (in press.

Self-control in decision-making involves modulation of the vmPFC valuation system.Science. 2009; 324: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Both the β-δ model and the self-control model predict that reduced impulsivity in intertemporal choice, induced for example by episodic future thought, would involve prefrontal cortex regions implicated in cognitive control, such as the lateral PFC or the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Lesion studies, on the other hand, also implicated medial temporal lobe regions in decision-making and delay discounting. In rodents, damage to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) increases delay discounting (Winstanley et al., 2004Winstanley C.A. Theobald D.E. Cardinal R.N. Robbins T.W. Contrasting roles of basolateral amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in impulsive choice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), effort discounting (Floresco and Ghods-Sharifi, 2007Floresco S.B. Ghods-Sharifi S. Amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuitry regulates effort-based decision making.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Ghods-Sharifi et al., 2009Ghods-Sharifi S.

Fundamental contribution by the basolateral amygdala to different forms of decision making.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interactions between the ACC and the BLA in particular have been proposed to regulate behavior in order to allow organisms to overcome a variety of different decision costs, including delays (Floresco and Ghods-Sharifi, 2007Floresco S.B. Ghods-Sharifi S. Amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuitry regulates effort-based decision making.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, impairments in decision-making are also observed in humans with damage to the ACC or amygdala (Bechara et al., 1994Bechara A. Damasio A.R. Damasio H. Anderson S.W.

Effortless control: executive attention and conscious feeling of mental effort are dissociable.Neuropsychologia. 2005; 43: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Along similar lines, hippocampal damage affects decision-making. Disadvantageous choice behavior has recently been documented in patients suffering from amnesia due to hippocampal lesions (Gupta et al., 2009Gupta R. Duff M.C. Denburg N.L. Cohen N.J. Bechara A. Tranel D. Declarative memory is critical for sustained advantageous complex decision-making.Neuropsychologia. 2009; 47: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and rats with hippocampal damage show increased delay discounting (Cheung and Cardinal, 2005Cheung T.H. Cardinal R.N. Hippocampal lesions facilitate instrumental learning with delayed reinforcement but induce impulsive choice in rats.BMC Neurosci. 2005; 6: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Mariano et al., 2009Mariano T.Y.

The effects of delaying reward on choice preference in rats with hippocampal or selective septal lesions.Behav. Brain Res. 1985; 15: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These observations are of particular interest given that hippocampal damage impairs the ability to imagine novel experiences (Hassabis et al., 2007Hassabis D. Kumaran D. Vann S.D. Maguire E.A. Patients with hippocampal amnesia cannot imagine new experiences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Based on this and a range of other studies, it has recently been proposed that hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex play a crucial role in the formation of vivid event representations, regardless of whether they lie in the past, present, or future (Schacter and Addis, 2009Schacter D.L. Addis D.R. On the nature of medial temporal lobe contributions to the constructive simulation of future events.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The hippocampus may thus contribute to decision-making through its role in self-projection into the future (Bar, 2009Bar M. The proactive brain: memory for predictions.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, Schacter et al., 2007Schacter D.L. Addis D.R. Buckner R.L. Remembering the past to imagine the future: the prospective brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), allowing an organism to evaluate future payoffs through mental simulation (Johnson and Redish, 2007Johnson A. Redish A.D. Neural ensembles in CA3 transiently encode paths forward of the animal at a decision point.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12176-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, Johnson et al., 2007Johnson A. van der Meer M.A. Redish A.D. Integrating hippocampus and striatum in decision-making.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Future thinking may thus affect intertemporal choice through hippocampal involvement. Here we used model-based fMRI, analyses of functional coupling, and extensive behavioral procedures to investigate how episodic future thinking affects delay discounting. In Experiment 1, subjects performed a classical delay discounting task (Kable and Glimcher, 2007Kable J.W. Glimcher P.W. The neural correlates of subjective value during intertemporal choice.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, Peters and Büchel, 2009Peters J. Büchel C. Overlapping and distinct neural systems code for subjective value during intertemporal and risky decision making.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 15727-15734Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) that involved a series of choices between smaller immediate and larger delayed rewards, while brain activity was measured using fMRI. Critically, we introduced a novel episodic condition that involved the presentation of episodic cue words (tags) obtained during an extensive prescan interview, referring to real, subject-specific future events planned for the respective day of reward delivery. This design allowed us to assess individual discount rates separately for the two experimental conditions, allowing us to investigate neural mechanisms mediating changes in delay discounting associated with episodic thinking. In a second behavioral study, we replicated the behavioral effects of Experiment 1 and addressed a number of alternative explanations for the observed effects of episodic tags on discount rates. On day 1, healthy young volunteers (n = 30, mean age = 25, 15 male) completed a computer-based delay discounting procedure to estimate their individual discount rate (Peters and Büchel, 2009Peters J. Büchel C. Overlapping and distinct neural systems code for subjective value during intertemporal and risky decision making.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 15727-15734Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This discount rate was used solely for the purpose of constructing subject-specific trials for the fMRI session (see Experimental Procedures). Furthermore, participants compiled a list of events that they had planned in the next 7 months (e.g., vacations, weddings, parties, courses, and so forth) and rated them on scales from 1 to 6 with respect to personal relevance, arousal, and valence. For each participant, seven subject-specific events were selected such that the spacing between events increased with increasing delay to the episode, and that events were roughly matched based on personal relevance, arousal, and valence. Multiple regression analysis of these ratings across the different delays showed no linear effects (relevance: p = 0.867, arousal: p = 0.120, valence: p = 0.977, see Figure S1 available online). For each subject, a separate set of seven delays was computed that was later used as delays in the control condition. Median and range for the delays used in each condition are listed in Table S1 (available online). For each event, a label was selected that would serve as a verbal tag for the fMRI session. On day 2, volunteers performed two sessions of a delay discounting procedure while fMRI was measured using a 3T Siemens Scanner with a 32-channel head-coil. In each session, subjects made a total of 118 choices between 20€ available immediately and larger but delayed amounts. Subjects were told that one of their choices would be randomly selected and paid out following scanning, with the respective delay. Critically, in half the trials, an additional subject-specific episodic tag (see above, e.g., “vacation paris” or “birthday john”) was displayed based on the prescan interview (see Figure 1) indicating which event they had planned on the particular day (episodic condition), whereas in the remaining trials, no episodic tag was presented (control condition). Amount and waiting time were thus displayed in both conditions, but only the episodic condition involved the presentation of an additional subject-specific event tag. Importantly, nonoverlapping sets of delays were used in the two conditions. Following scanning, subjects rated for each episodic tag how often it evoked episodic associations during scanning (frequency of associations: 1, never; to 6, always) and how vivid these associations were (vividness of associations: 1, not vivid at all; to 6, highly vivid; see Figure S1). Additionally, written reports were obtained (see Supplemental Information). Multiple regression revealed no significant linear effects of delay on postscan ratings (frequency: p = 0.224, vividness: p = 0.770). We averaged the postscan ratings across events and the frequency/vividness dimensions, yielding an “imagery score” for each subject. During fMRI, subjects made repeated choices between a fixed immediate reward of 20€ and larger but delayed amounts. In the control condition, amounts were paired with a waiting time only, whereas in the episodic condition, amounts were paired with a waiting time and a subject-specific verbal episodic tag indicating to the subjects which event they had planned at the respective day of reward delivery. Events were real and collected in a separate testing session prior to the day of scanning. Individual participants' choice data from the fMRI session were then analyzed by fitting hyperbolic discount functions to subject-specific indifference points to obtain discount rates (k-parameters), separately for the episodic and control conditions (see Experimental Procedures). Subjective preferences were well-characterized by hyperbolic functions (median R2 episodic condition = 0.81, control condition = 0.85). Discount functions of four exemplary subjects are shown in Figure 2A . For both conditions, considerable variability in the discount rate was observed (median [range] of discount rates: control condition = 0.014 [0.003–0.19], episodic condition = 0.013 [0.002–0.18]). To account for the skewed distribution of discount rates, all further analyses were conducted on the log-transformed k-parameters. Across subjects, log-transformed discount rates were significantly lower in the episodic condition compared with the control condition (t(29) = 2.27, p = 0.016), indicating that participants' choice behavior was less impulsive in the episodic condition. The difference in log-discount rates between conditions is henceforth referred to as the episodic tag effect. Fitting hyperbolic functions to the median indifference points across subjects also showed reduced discounting in the episodic condition (discount rate control condition = 0.0099, episodic condition = 0.0077). The size of the tag effect was not related to the discount rate in the control condition (p = 0.56). Shown are experimentally derived discount functions from the fMRI session for four exemplary participants (A), correlation with imagery scores (B), and reaction times (RTs) (C). (A) Hyperbolic functions were fit to the indifference points separately for the control (dashed lines) and episodic (solid lines, filled circles) conditions, and the best-fitting k-parameters (discount rates) and R2 values are shown for each subject. The log-transformed difference between discount rates was taken as a measure of the effect of the episodic tags on choice preferences. (B) Robust regression revealed an association between log-differences in discount rates and imagery scores obtained from postscan ratings (see text). (C) RTs were significantly modulated by option value (main effect value p < 0.001) with faster responses in trials with a value of the delayed reward higher than the 20€ reference amount. Note that although seven delays were used for each condition, some data points are missing, e.g., only five delay indifference points for the episodic condition are plotted for sub20. This indicates that, for the two longest delays, this subject never chose the delayed reward. ∗∗∗p < 0.005. Error bars = SEM. We next hypothesized that the tag effect would be positively correlated with postscan ratings of episodic thought (imagery scores, see above). Robust regression revealed an increase in the size of the tag effect with increasing imagery scores (t = 2.08, p = 0.023, see Figure 2B), suggesting that the effect of the tags on preferences was stronger the more vividly subjects imagined the episodes. Examples of written postscan reports are provided in the Supplemental Results for participants from the entire range of imagination ratings. We also correlated the tag effect with standard neuropsychological measures, the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) V (Beauducel et al., 2003Beauducel A. Strobel A. Brocke B. Psychometrische Eigenschaften und Normen einer deutschsprachigen Fassung der Sensation Seeking-Scale, Form V.Diagnostica. 2003; 2: 61-72Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Zuckerman, 1996Zuckerman M. Item revisions in the Sensation Seeking Scale Form V (SSS-V).Pers. Individ. Dif. 1996; 20: 515Crossref Google Scholar) and the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Approach Scale (BIS/BAS) (Carver and White, 1994Carver C.S. White T.L. Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and affective responses to impeding reward and punishment: The BIS/BAS scales.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1994; 67: 319-333Crossref Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). The tag effect was positively correlated with the experience-seeking subscale of the SSS (p = 0.026) and inversely correlated with the reward-responsiveness subscale of the BIS/BAS scales (p < 0.005). Repeated-measures ANOVA of reaction times (RTs) as a function of option value (lower, similar, or higher relative to the reference option; see Experimental Procedures and Figure 2C) did not show a main effect of condition (p = 0.712) or a condition × value interaction (p = 0.220), but revealed a main effect of value (F(1.8, 53.9) = 16.740, p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons revealed faster RTs for higher-valued options relative to similarly (p = 0.002) or lower valued options (p < 0.001) but no difference between lower and similarly valued options (p = 0.081). FMRI data were modeled using the general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM5. Subjective value of each decision option was calculated by multiplying the objective amount of each delayed reward with the discount fraction estimated behaviorally based on the choices during scanning, and included as a parametric regressor in the GLM. Note that discount rates were estimated separately for the control and episodic conditions (see above and Figure 2), and we thus used condition-specific k-parameters for calculation of the subjective value regressor. Additional parametric regressors for inverse delay-to-reward and absolute reward magnitude, orthogonalized with respect to subjective value, were included in the GLM. We first analyzed differences in the condition regressors without parametric modulation. Compared to those of the control condition, BOLD responses to the presentation of the delayed reward in the episodic condition yielded highly significant activations (corrected for whole-brain volume) in an extensive network of brain regions previously implicated in episodic future thinking (Addis et al., 2007Addis D.R.

(B) Regions in which the subjective value correlation was greater for the episodic compared with the control condition included lateral parietal cortex (LPC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the right amygdala (Amy).

We next analyzed the neural tag effect, i.e., regions in which the subjective value correlation was greater for the episodic condition as compared with the control condition (Figure 4B and Table S4). This analysis revealed clusters in the left LPC (−66, −42, 32, z value = 4.96,), ACC (−2, 16, 36, z value = 4.76), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, −38, 36, 36, z value = 4.81), and right amygdala (24, 2, −24, z value = 3.75). Finally, we performed a triple-conjunction analysis, testing for regions that were correlated with subjective value in both conditions, but in which the value correlation increased in the episodic condition. Only left LPC showed this pattern (−66, −42, 30, z value = 3.55, see Figure 4C and Table S5), the same region that we previously identified as delay-specific in valuation (Peters and Büchel, 2009Peters J.

Here, a zinc-finger protein Cfp1 is found to be associated with non-methylated CpG islands and sites of H3K4me3 genome-wide in vivo. Cfp1 is part of the Setd1 complex which trimethylates H3K4. Artificial CpG clusters are shown to recruit Cfp1, leading to novel peaks of H3K4me3. Therefore a primary function of non-methylated CpG islands might be to genetically determine the local chromatin modification state. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CpG islands that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites at which histone H3 lysine 4 is trimethylated (H3K4me3 sites). Here, a zinc-finger protein, Cfp1, is found to be associated with non-methylated CpG islands and H3K4me3 sites throughout the genome in the mouse brain. A primary function of non-methylated CpG islands might be to genetically determine the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins. CpG islands (CGIs) are prominent in the mammalian genome owing to their GC-rich base composition and high density of CpG dinucleotides1,2. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity3,4. In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to non-methylated CpGs in vitro5,6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins."

Nevertheless, GluD2 is essential for the normal development of cerebellar circuits. Using immunocytochemistry, binding assays, electrophysiology, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy, Matsuda et al. (p. 363 ) found that Cbln1, a soluble protein secreted from cerebellar granule cells, binds to the extracellular N terminus of GluD2 on Purkinje cells. Binding has two independent consequences: First, it leads to presynaptic differentiation and second, it causes postsynaptic clustering of several important synapse-specific molecules. Both events are needed for synapse formation between granule cells and Purkinje cells."

The density map reveals side-chain densities of all types of amino acids (except glycine), enabling construction of a full-atom model of the viral particle. Our structure and biochemical results show that priming involves autocleavage of the membrane penetration protein and suggest that Lys84 and Glu76 may facilitate this autocleavage in a nucleophilic attack. We observe a myristoyl group, covalently linked to the N terminus of the penetration protein and embedded in a hydrophobic pocket. These results suggest a well-orchestrated process of nonenveloped virus entry involving autocleavage of the penetration protein prior to exposure of its membrane-insertion finger."

All cells were maintained in their respective culture medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cultured cells were grown to ∼80% confluence before RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was made from 1 μg of RNA reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler and iCycler iQ Optical System Software (Bio-Rad). PCR reactions were performed using Bio-Rad iQ SYBR Green Supermix. The PCR protocol started with 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 54.3 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. Quantification was measured as sample fluorescence crossed a predetermined threshold value that was just above the background. Expressions of STIM and Orai were compared with those of the housekeeping gene GAPDH and were measured using comparative threshold cycle values. The sense and antisense primers targeting human GAPDH, STIM, and Orai isoforms are described in supplemental Table S1. Sets of either three or four different siRNAs per target gene were initially assessed for their ability to reduce mRNA levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) as described above. siRNA sequences that induced most significant decrease in their target mRNA were used in Western blotting to confirm protein knockdown (described below). All transfections in MDA-MB231 and MCF 7 were done using Nucleofector device II (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions i.e. using program X-013 and P-020 for MDA-MB231 and MCF7, respectively. As a marker of cell transfection, 0.5 μg of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was co-transfected with siRNA for identification of successfully transfected cells during experiments. As a control, we used a non-targeting sequence (Control siRNA). Sequences of all siRNAs used in the study are listed in supplemental Table S2. Cells were transfected with 20 μg of siRNA of choice per ∼1 × 106 cells, seeded on either round glass coverslips (for Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp studies) or plates (for Western blotting) and were assayed between 72 and 96 h post-transfection.

Briefly, coverslips with attached cells were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 40–60 min in culture medium containing 4 μm Fura-2/AM for all cell lines expect MCF 10A and 184A1 where 3 μl of Pluronic F127 was added along with 4 μm Fura-2/AM in the loading solution. Cells were then washed (3 times) and bathed in HEPES-buffered saline solution (140 mm NaCl, 1.13 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) for at least 10 min before Ca2+ measurements were made. For Ca2+ measurements, fluorescence images of several cells were recorded and analyzed with a digital fluorescence imaging system (InCyt Im2; Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Fura-2 fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm was induced by exciting Fura-2 alternately at 340 and 380 nm. The 340/380 ratio images were obtained on a pixel-by-pixel basis. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. All figures depicting Ca2+ imaging traces are an average from several cells from one coverslip and are representative of several independent recordings. Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 mm EDTA). Generally, 50–100 μg of proteins in denaturing conditions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–9%). Proteins from gels were then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 2 h at room temperature, blots were given three washes with TTBS for 5 min each and probed overnight at 4 °C, with specific primary antibodies in TTBS containing 2% NFDM. The primary antibodies used were STIM1 (1:250; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), hOrai1 (1:500; Prosci Inc), hOrai3-NT (1:500; ProSci Inc., Poway, CA) and β-actin-NT domain (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich). The next day, membranes were washed with TTBS (three washes of 5 min each) and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:20,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) for STIM1 and actin or anti-rabbit IgG for Orai1 and Orai3 (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) in TTBS containing 2% NFDM. Detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL Western blotting detection reagents; Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of bands was achieved by densitometry using the ImageJ software. Patch clamp electrophysiology was essentially conducted as described previously (10Abdullaev I.F. Bisaillon J.M.

The cells used for whole-cell patch clamp recordings have a capacitance of 29.9 pF±2.1 for MDA-MB231; n = 31 and 48.9pF ± 3.5 for MCF7; n = 22. 2.5–4 MΩ patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) with P-97 flaming/brown micropipette puller (Sutter). Axopatch 200B and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) with pCLAMP 10 software were used for data acquisition and analysis. Cells were seeded on round coverslips for 24–72 h before experiment. Immediately before the experiments, cells were washed with bath solution containing (in mm): sodium methanesulfonate, 145; MgSO4, 1.2; HEPES, 10; CaCl2, 10; and glucose, 10 (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Pipette solution contained (in mm): Cs-methanesulfonate, 145; Cs-BAPTA, 12; MgCl2, 8; HEPES, 10 (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Divalent-free bath solution contained (in mm): sodium methanesulfonate, 155; Na3HEDTA, 10; EDTA, 1; HEPES, 10 (pH = 7.4, adjusted with HCl). Upon obtaining GΩ seal and break-in, recordings were made from cells with <15 mΩ series resistance. Cells were maintained at 0 mV holding potential during experiments and subjected to voltage ramps from +80 to −140 mV lasting 250 ms every 3 s. Reverse ramps were designed to inhibit voltage-gated channels. 3 μm nimodipine was added to bath solution to generally stabilize membrane patches and reach better seals. The ground silver-silver chloride electrode was connected to the bath through an agar bridge. Pulses of divalent-free (DVF) solutions were delivered focally to cells with least possible pressure to minimize accidental seal damage, which could lead to leak currents contaminating recordings. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical analysis using one way ANOVA was done with Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Differences are considered significant when p values are < 0.05. The p values of <0.05, <0.01, and <0.001 are represented as *, **, and ***, respectively. Native SOCE in many cell types has been shown to be inhibited by low concentrations of lanthanides (Gd3+; 1–10 μm) and by the drug 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB; 30–50 μm)(5Parekh A.B.

Previous studies comparing the functions of Orai1/2/3 when ectopically co-expressed individually with STIM1 in HEK293 cells showed that while 2-APB inhibits Orai1 and Orai2 it has the ability to activate Orai3 and to alter their ion selectivity by presumably increasing their pore size(33DeHaven W.I.

We undertook a thorough analysis of the pharmacological features of thapsigargin-activated SOCE in 5 different ER+ and 5 ER− breast cell lines (two “normal” breast epithelial cells and 3 cancerous ones) in response to 5 μm Gd3+ and 30 μm 2-APB using Fura2 imaging. Cell lines were picked in an unbiased manner; the ER+ cell lines were: MCF7, BT474, ZR751, T47D, and HCC1500. The ER− cell lines were: MCF10A and 184A1 normal breast epithelial cells and the cancerous cell lines MDA-MB231, BT20, and HCC1937. Our results show that 5 μm Gd3+ inhibits SOCE in both ER+ and ER− cell lines (Fig. 1, A, C, E). However, while 30 μm 2-APB essentially abrogated SOCE in ER− cell lines (Fig. 1, D and F) the effect of that concentration of 2-APB on ER+ cell lines was more complex involving a transient and robust potentiation followed by sustained levels of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1B). One exception was the cell line T47D where SOCE was equally potentiated by 2-APB, followed by partially inhibited yet sustained Ca2+ entry. There was small and transient potentiation of SOCE by 2-APB in the ER− cell lines MDA-MB231 and BT20, which is typical of Orai1(11Potier M. Gonzalez J.C. Motiani R.K. Abdullaev I.F. Bisaillon J.M.

However, the more robust and sustained potentiation of SOCE by 2-APB in ER+ cell lines clearly indicated the presence of a calcium entry channel unique to ER+ cells with features similar to those previously described for 2-APB-mediated Ca2+ entry in HEK293 cells ectopically expressing human Orai3 (33DeHaven W.I.

Furthermore, analysis of the extent of SOCE in ER+ and ER− cell lines consistently showed that SOCE is significantly more robust in the ER− breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231, BT20, and HCC1937) compared with the ER+ cell lines or the ER− normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A, 184A1) (Fig. 1G). Statistical analysis on the extent of Ca2+ release induced by thapsigargin in all 10 cell lines is also represented in Fig. 1G. Western blot analysis of STIM1, Orai1, and Orai3 proteins in all 10 cell lines revealed a significantly higher expression of Orai3 in ER+ cell lines while the expression levels of STIM1 and Orai1 were slightly lower compared with the ER− cell lines (Fig. 2A), suggesting that in ER+ cell lines the balance of STIM1/Orai interaction might be tipped toward STIM1/Orai3. Statistical analysis of the ratio of protein band densitometry to actin normalized to the protein levels of MCF10A from 3–4 independent experiments is shown in Fig. 2B.FIGURE 2Western blot analysis of STIM1, Orai1, and Orai3 expression in breast cancer cells. A, all 10 breast cancer cells lines were lysed, and 50 μg of proteins each were loaded in the same gels. After transfer, membranes were probed with specific antibodies against either STIM1, Orai1, or Orai3 followed by the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase as described under “Materials and Methods,” and proteins bands were visualized using the ECL kit. B, blots obtained from 3–4 independent experiments were analyzed using Image J software and densitometric ratios to corresponding actin were calculated. All densitometric values were then normalized to those of the normal cell line MCF10A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the rest of this study, we focused on two representative and widely studied cell lines, the ER+ MCF7 and the ER− MDA-MB231. Given the robust 2-APB potentiation of thapsigargin-activated SOCE in MCF7 cells, we reasoned that Orai3 might be contributing to SOCE in ER+ cells. While 2-APB is a nonspecific drug that has been shown to activate TRPV channels, it does so at concentrations that are 10-fold higher than those used in our study (300 μm; (38Braun F.J. Aziz O. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J.

Nevertheless, to rule out contributions from TRPV channels to 2-APB-mediated potentiation of SOCE in ER+ cells, we conducted additional experiments in MCF7 cells depicted in Fig. 1H. In these experiments, pre-incubation of MCF7 cells with low concentrations of Gd3+ (1–10 μm), known to specifically inhibit Orai channels, was used to block SOCE, followed by thapsigargin stimulation using the standard Ca2+ off/Ca2+ on protocol and subsequent addition of 2-APB. At these low concentrations, Gd3+ does not inhibit TRPV channels (concentrations as high as 500 μm Gd3+ were reported to induce a slow developing block of TRPV4(42Liedtke W. Choe Y.

Fig. 1H shows that the concentration-dependent inhibition of SOCE by Gd3+ directly correlated with the reduction of 2-APB-mediated potentiation, strongly arguing that 2-APB action in MCF7 cells is likely mediated by Orai3 channels. To substantiate these pharmacological data and provide confidence for the involvement of Orai3 channels in mediating SOCE in ER+ cells, we conducted whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings in MDA-MB231 ER− and MCF7 ER+ cells. To characterize the current mediating SOCE in MDA-MB231 and MCF7 cells, we used the standard method for measuring ICRAC in whole-cell mode with intracellular dialysis of high concentrations of the pH-independent, fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, as described previously (10Abdullaev I.F.

Here, we demonstrate that RAG protein binding occurs in a highly focal manner to a small region of active chromatin encompassing Ig kappa and Tcr alpha J gene segments and Igh and Tcr beta J and J-proximal D gene segments. Formation of these small RAG-bound regions, which we refer to as recombination centers, occurs in a developmental stage- and lineage-specific manner. Each RAG protein is independently capable of specific binding within recombination centers. While RAG1 binding was detected only at regions containing recombination signal sequences, RAG2 binds at thousands of sites in the genome containing histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4. We propose that recombination centers coordinate V(D)J recombination by providing discrete sites within which gene segments are captured for recombination."

It ensures that sensory processing is biased toward behaviorally relevant features and locations. As a consequence the perceptual quality of a visual stimulus located within an attended region is improved (Carrasco et al., 2004Carrasco M. Ling S. Read S. Attention alters appearance.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) at the expense of the perceptual quality of stimuli located elsewhere (Pestilli and Carrasco, 2005Pestilli F. Carrasco M.

Such attention-dependent perceptual changes are reflected in neurophysiological data from striate and extrastriate visual cortex, where firing rates of neurons tuned toward an attended spatial location (Spitzer et al., 1988Spitzer H.

In addition, spatial and feature-guided attention increases the synchrony of neuronal populations in area V4 (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P. Rossi A.F. Desimone R.

Thus, in addition to modulating neuronal firing rates, attention acts to synchronize the activity of neurons that respond to an attended stimulus (Börgers et al., 2008Börgers C. Epstein S.

These attention-dependent changes in neural synchrony have so far been recorded at mid- and high-level stages in the visual hierarchy (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P. Rossi A.F. Desimone R. Parallel and serial neural mechanisms for visual search in macaque area V4.Science. 2005; 308: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Buschman and Miller, 2007Buschman T.J. Miller E.K.

It is unclear whether attention modulates the neural response in a similar way in early cortical processing. To test this we measured the local field potential (LFP) and spiking activity in primary visual cortex while macaque monkeys performed a visual attention-demanding task. We found that attending to a visual stimulus located within the receptive field (RF) of the recorded neurons resulted in a significant decrease in the magnitude of LFP oscillations and the spike field coherence (SFC) in the gamma frequency range (30–50 Hz). To ensure that this result was not related to task differences, we confirmed that attention increases gamma LFP power and SFC in area V4, in line with previous results (Fries et al., 2001Fries P. Reynolds J.H. Rorie A.E. Desimone R. Modulation of oscillatory neuronal synchronization by selective visual attention.Science. 2001; 291: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). Thus, increases in neuronal synchrony are not a universal mechanism by which attention benefits the processing of visual stimuli in visual cortex. We measured the LFP signal from 258 recording sites in area V1 from three macaque monkeys (monkeys HU, HO, and BL) while they engaged in a top-down spatial attention task where bar stimuli of optimal orientations were presented centered on the RF of neurons at the recording site. The attentional state of the monkey was manipulated by presenting a visual cue prior to each trial, which instructed the monkey to attend either toward or away from the corresponding RF (“attend-RF” and “attend-away” conditions, respectively). In order to investigate the impact of interaction of attention and stimulus dimension on the LFP response and the SFC, we varied the stimulus contrast in experiment 1 and the bar length in experiment 2. For experiment 1 the contrast of the bar stimuli was variable (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 50% Michelson contrast), while the bar length was fixed (0.4° long in monkey HU, 39 recording sites; 1.2° long in monkey HO, 26 recording sites). In experiment 2 the length of the bar stimuli was varied (0.2°–2.4°) and the contrast was fixed at 24% in monkey HU (135 recording sites) and monkey BL (12 recording sites), while it was 85% in monkey HO (46 recording sites). For additional task and experimental details see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1. In line with the general literature, we found that attending toward the RF location increased the firing rate of the neurons compared with the rate achieved in the attend-away condition. An example of this effect in the recorded population (bar length experiment) is shown in Figure 1A (p < 0.001, signed rank test). Figure 1B shows an example, population-evoked LFP response from the contrast experiment. It shows that stimulus onset resulted in a stereotypical deflection of the LFP, which lasted for about 200–250 ms, whereas after the LFP, as assessed by the evoked response, it was reasonably stationary. The latter is a prerequisite for performing the spectral analyses that are reported below. To investigate the effects of attention on the sustained LFP response, we calculated the LFP response power spectrum and the stimulus-induced power spectrum, both averaged over the time interval of 256–512 ms after stimulus presentation. The time period of 256–512 ms was chosen because it is the period wherein attentional modulation of firing rates was most profound (Herrero et al., 2008Herrero J.L. Roberts M.J. Delicato L.S. Gieselmann M.A. Dayan P. Thiele A. Acetylcholine contributes through muscarinic receptors to attentional modulation in V1.Nature. 2008; 454: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, Roberts et al., 2007Roberts M. Delicato L.S. Herrero J. Gieselmann M.A. Thiele A. Attention alters spatial integration in macaque V1 in an eccentricity-dependent manner.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (see also Figure 1A), and it corresponds to the time period wherein the animal had to increase the level of attention to detect behaviorally relevant stimulus changes (Roberts et al., 2007Roberts M. Delicato L.S. Herrero J. Gieselmann M.A. Thiele A. Attention alters spatial integration in macaque V1 in an eccentricity-dependent manner.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Figure 1C shows the average LFP power spectrum for the recordings from the bar length experiment, pooled across the three monkeys. The attend-away condition is shown in blue, and the attend-RF condition is shown in red. Power spectra exhibited their maximum at low frequency, dropping off with increasing frequency. However, there was an additional peak in the gamma band (30–50 Hz), provided that the stimulus induced a V1 network state that favored gamma oscillations (Gieselmann and Thiele, 2008Gieselmann M.A. Thiele A. Comparison of spatial integration and surround suppression characteristics in spiking activity and the local field potential in macaque V1.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), i.e., a large stimulus was used that encroached on the suppressive surround. In addition to the dependence on stimulus type, gamma oscillations were usually larger for the attend-away, compared with the attend-RF, condition. These differences were significant (p < 0.05, two-factor repeated-measurement [RM] ANOVA; for a detailed analysis of the significance levels for different spectral bands, see below). Figure 1D shows examples of stimulus-induced spectra for the three animals. The attend-away condition resulted in more stimulus-induced power in the gamma range than the attend-RF condition. In order to provide a quantitative understanding of how attention modulated the LFP signal, we divided the power spectrum into five different frequency bands (delta: 1–4 Hz, theta (cortical): 4–7 Hz, alpha: 7–13 Hz, beta: 13–25 Hz, and gamma: 30–50 Hz), and analyzed the effects of attention on the LFP response power separately for each frequency band. The gamma range was restricted to powers of <50 Hz, because all three monkeys showed that their main stimulus-induced gamma activity within this range (see Figure 1D). Moreover, the LFP power for higher frequencies could be contaminated by “spike intrusion,” and would thus at least partially reflect the multiunit activity at the recording site. Data from the experiment wherein stimulus contrast was systematically varied are shown in Figure 2A . Stimulus contrast significantly increased delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band activity, while attending to the RF significantly reduced power in all five frequency bands (two-factor RM ANOVA; delta: pattention < 0.001, pcontrast < 0.001, theta: pattention < 0.001, pcontrast < 0.001, alpha: pattention < 0.001, pcontrast < 0.001, beta: pattention < 0.001, pcontrast < 0.001, gamma: pattention = 0.004, pcontrast < 0.001, n = 65 recording sites). The effects for the gamma band activity were significant both collectively and individually (for additional details see Table 1), and they applied to both the raw power and the stimulus-induced power. In addition to the effects of contrast and attention alone, we also found a significant interaction between stimulus contrast and attention for the gamma band activity. Attention reduced the raw and stimulus-induced power more strongly at high contrasts (raw gamma power: pattention∗contrast = 0.001; stimulus-induced gamma power: pattention∗contrast < 0.001).Table 1Analysis of the Effect of Attention on Different Frequency Bands for the Different Monkeys and Experimental ConditionsExperimentAnimalVariableFrequency BandAlphaBetaGammaContrastMonkey HU (n = 39)raw powerp < 0.001p < 0.001p = 0.010stimulus powerp = 0.002p = 0.004p = 0.004STA powerp < 0.001SFCp = 0.023Monkey HO (n = 26)raw powerp = 0.167p = 0.342p = 0.026stimulus powerp = 0.048p = 0.82p = 0.002STA powerp < 0.001SFCp = 0.009Bar lengthMonkey BL (n = 12)raw powerp < 0.001p < 0.001p = 0.002stimulus powerp < 0.001p < 0.001p = 0.005STA powerp = 0.013SFCp = 0.011Monkey HU (n = 135)raw powerp < 0.001p < 0.001p < 0.001stimulus powerp < 0.001p < 0.001p < 0.001STA powerp < 0.001SFCp = 0.027∗Monkey HO (n = 46)raw powerp < 0.001p < 0.001p = 0.518stimulus powerp = 0.003p < 0.001p = 0.265STA powerp = 0.006SFCp = 0.102p values printed in Roman indicate that attention significantly reduced the spectral power and spike field coherence (SFC) in the respective frequency band. p values printed in italics (only monkey HO in the bar length experiment) indicate that attention increased the power in the relevant frequency band.

Only 12 experiments are available from monkey BL due to the fact that the animal's implant had to be removed midway through the experiments. The data for the experiment wherein the bar length was varied are shown in Figure 2B. Bar length had a significant effect on all frequency bands (p < 0.001, two-factor RM ANOVA, n = 193 recording sites from three monkeys). However, increasing stimulus size did not have the same effect on the delta, theta, alpha, and beta band activity as increasing stimulus contrast did. While increasing contrast resulted in more delta, theta, alpha, and beta LFP power, increasing the stimulus size significantly reduced the overall power and the stimulus-induced power in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands (p < 0.001, two-factor RM ANOVA). Notably, the effects of contrast and stimulus length on gamma band activity were very similar. LFP power significantly increased with bar length in the gamma band (p < 0.001, two-factor RM ANOVA). In line with the contrast experiments, attending to the RF of the recording sites significantly reduced the power in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands (p < 0.001, two-factor RM ANOVA) in monkey HU and monkey BL. Additionally, a significant interaction between bar length and attention was found for all five frequency bands (p < 0.05, two-factor RM ANOVA). In the delta, theta, alpha, and beta band, the largest attention-induced power changes occurred for short bar stimuli, while in the gamma band, the largest changes occurred for long bars. The effects in monkey HO were more variable (Table 1; see Figure S2 for a possible explanation of this variability). The stimulus-induced power is dependent on the power during spontaneous activity (see Experimental Procedures). It is conceivable that attending to the cued location already caused an increase in gamma power before stimulus onset, and thus stimulus-induced power reduction might be a consequence of increased gamma power before stimulus onset. However, we found no significant increase of gamma power before stimulus onset for the two attention conditions (p > 0.4, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Thus, the change in stimulus-induced power was not a result of changes occurring prior to stimulus onset. Another way of controlling for this is by calculating stimulus-induced power with explicit normalization relative to power during spontaneous activity (see Experimental Procedures). An approach where stimulus power was calculated with explicit normalization relative to power during spontaneous activity yielded basically identical results to an approach where this explicit normalization was not performed (for details see Experimental Procedures). The previous analyses have determined the power spectrum of the LFP to be a function of the stimulus and of attention. The influence of attention on oscillatory behavior in area V4 has previously been analyzed by calculating the power spectrum of the spike triggered average (STA) LFP and by calculating the SFC (Fries et al., 2001Fries P. Reynolds J.H. Rorie A.E. Desimone R. Modulation of oscillatory neuronal synchronization by selective visual attention.Science. 2001; 291: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). This study had found that the SFC was increased in the gamma range in V4 when attention was directed to the RF of the neurons under study. Although it is unlikely that LFP gamma power decreases with attention in V1 while SFC in the gamma range shows a concomitant increase, we still aimed to determine the effect of stimulus type and attention on SFC. Figure 3A shows an example of the spike triggered LFP from a single recording site, when a bar of 2.4° was presented and attention was either directed to the RF of the recording site (solid) or directed away from the recording site (dashed). Figure 3B shows the power spectrum that was obtained from the STA at this recording site. The STA LFP in the attend-away condition was more strongly modulated in the gamma frequency range than in the attend-RF condition, and consequently the power spectrum showed a larger peak in the gamma range for the attend-away condition (Figure 3B). Figure 4 shows the effect of stimulus type and attention on the power in the gamma range of the STA LFP for all recording sites separately for the different monkeys. Attention significantly reduced the STA gamma power for the experiments wherein stimulus contrast was varied in both monkeys (p < 0.01, two-factor RM ANOVA). Moreover, for these experiments there was a significant interaction between contrast and attention in both animals (p < 0.05, two-factor RM ANOVA). The differences between the data from the two monkeys that are apparent from Figure 4A are probably due to the fact that the stimulus size differed. In monkey HO a bar of 1.2° length was used, which activates center surround modulation, provided the contrast is high. In monkey HU a bar of 0.4° length was used, which hardly (if at all) activates center surround mechanisms, and therefore does not generate as much gamma drive per se. Therefore increasing contrast in monkey HU does not result in the same STA gamma power increase as in monkey HO. However, irrespective of the stimulus-induced difference, attending to the RF resulted in significantly reduced STA LFP gamma power in both animals. Attention significantly reduced STA LFP gamma power in all three monkeys when the bar length was varied (p < 0.05, two-factor RM ANOVA, Figure 4B). Stimulus type also had a significant effect on STA LFP gamma power. Increasing the bar length to a size where the ends just encroached on the RF surrounds (0.4° or 0.8° long) initially reduced STA LFP gamma power, while large bars (which extended well into the RF surrounds of V1 neurons) resulted in significantly increased STA LFP gamma power (Figure 4B). In addition to the STA LFP gamma power, we also calculated the SFC (see Experimental Procedures). Figure 5A shows the SFC for the attend-RF (solid line) and attend-away (dashed line) condition when a bar of 50% luminance contrast was presented, pooled across data from both monkeys. SFC showed a peak in the gamma range (∼30–50 Hz), and this was significantly larger for the attend-away condition (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The SFC data in the gamma range as a function of contrast for the two monkeys are shown in Figure 5B. SFC significantly increased as stimulus contrast increased (p < 0.001, two-factor RM ANOVA). Attending to the RF significantly decreased SFCs (p = 0.03, two-factor RM ANOVA), and there was a significant interaction between contrast and attention (p = 0.02, two-factor RM ANOVA). When stimulus length was varied, we equally found a significant effect of stimulus length on the strength of the SFC (Figure 5C). Larger stimuli resulted in significantly higher SFC (p < 0.0001, two-factor RM ANOVA). Attention only decreased SFC for shorter bar lengths. Attention itself had no significant effect on SFCs in the gamma range, but there was a significant interaction between attention and bar length (p = 0.016, two-factor RM ANOVA), reflecting a stronger effect of attention on SFC for short and medium-sized bars (see Table 1 for a breakdown of effects across different animals). While these data show that attending away from the RF increases LFP gamma power and SFC in V1, it may also be important to look at the spike-field phase relationship. It has been argued that gamma power ensures that spikes are elicited at a “good” LFP phase, so that neuronal interactions are more effective. It may be the case that despite increased SFC in the attend-away condition, the phase relationship is more effective to promote neuronal interactions in the attend-RF condition. While it is unclear what an ‘optimal’ phase relationship is, as this will depend on conduction delay times, it is still possible to investigate whether attention affects the phase relationship between spikes and gamma frequency oscillations. We thus calculated the spike-field phase relationship for the attend-RF and attend-away condition for each experiment as a function of stimulus condition. Figure 6 plots the distribution of spike-field phase relationship for the contrast experiment. For this figure we plotted the preferred phase relationship for the frequency range from 36–40 Hz, from 40–44 Hz, and from 44–48 Hz, i.e., each recording site contributes three data points (vectors) for each stimulus and attention condition. A plot where the individual frequency bands are analyzed separately yields virtual identical results. The stimulus type had a significant effect on the spike-field relationship (p < 0.001, two-factor ANOVA, contrast experiment; p = 0.02, two-factor ANOVA, bar length experiment). During spontaneous activity there is no consistent spike-field phase relationship. Upon stimulus presentation there is a concentration of spike-field phase relationships at an angle of ∼−0.65π. Upon inspection of Figure 6 it is also clear that the concentration is more profound for medium and high contrast stimuli. Attention had no significant effect on the distribution of spike-field phase relationships (p = 0.26, two-factor ANOVA). Also, there was no significant interaction between stimulus condition and attention on spike-field phase relationships (p = 0.87, two-factor ANOVA). The results from the bar length experiment yielded virtually identical results. We thus conclude that attention reduces SFC in V1 but does not systematically affect the spike-field phase relationship. To ensure that the results obtained in V1 were not caused by differences in experimental design or laboratory differences, we recorded LFPs from an additional monkey (monkey ST) in an attention task in V4 at 43 recording sites. Stimuli were moving square-wave gratings within a circular aperture of 2° diameter (1 cyc/°, 2 Hz). As in the task used for the V1 recordings, the monkey was cued to attend to either the RF at the recording site or a location in the opposite hemifield. He had to detect a reduction in grating contrast from 90% to 60% Michelson contrast. For these recordings we found a significant increase in LFP gamma power when the animal directed attention to the RF of the recording sites, compared with when he attended away from it (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). However, it could be argued that the animal differed from those used for the V1 study and the stimuli were also different. Thus task difficulty and requirements may also have differed, and this might be the cause of the different results in V1 and V4. To determine whether this can account for the different results, we recorded from monkey HU's area V1 and area V4 simultaneously, under task conditions that were identical to those described for the previous V1 experiments, but under stimulus conditions that were slightly different. Instead of using small bars, we used square-wave gratings presented in a circular aperture of 1° diameter. The animal had to detect a subtle change at the center of the cued grating and ignore changes at the other grating location. We used slightly more extended stimuli to ensure that simultaneously recorded neurons in V1 and V4 would both be activated. The RFs of neurons in V1 and V4 in all these recordings were overlapping, although RF centers did not necessarily coincide. Stimuli were always centered on the RF of the V1 neurons, but always also elicited a significant response in the simultaneously recorded V4 neurons. These simultaneous recordings replicated our basic V1 results, namely that attention to the RF of the neurons under study reduced SFC (p < 0.05, signed rank test, n = 48 recording sites), while in V4 the simultaneously recorded SFC was significantly increased (p < 0.01, signed rank"

https://openalex.org/W2050612118,"The pathogenesis and treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not well established. Feeding a diet deficient in both methionine and choline (MCD) is one of the most common models of NASH, which is characterized by steatosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, hepatocellular injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, the individual contribution of the lack of methionine and choline in liver steatosis, advanced pathology and impact on mitochondrial S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and glutathione (GSH), known regulators of disease progression, has not been specifically addressed. Here, we examined the regulation of mitochondrial SAM and GSH and signs of disease in mice fed a MCD, methionine-deficient (MD), or choline-deficient (CD) diet. The MD diet reproduced most of the deleterious effects of MCD feeding, including weight loss, hepatocellular injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, whereas CD feeding was mainly responsible for steatosis, characterized by triglycerides and free fatty acids accumulation. These findings were preceded by MCD- or MD-mediated SAM and GSH depletion in mitochondria due to decreased mitochondrial membrane fluidity associated with a lower phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio. MCD and MD but not CD feeding resulted in increased ceramide levels by acid sphingomyelinase. Moreover, GSH ethyl ester or SAM therapy restored mitochondrial GSH and ameliorated hepatocellular injury in mice fed a MCD or MD diet. Thus, the depletion of SAM and GSH in mitochondria is an early event in the MCD model of NASH, which is determined by the lack of methionine. Moreover, therapy using permeable GSH prodrugs may be of relevance in NASH."

Chem. 2009; 284: 1971-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).The hippocampus is one of the main brain regions affected during the early stages of AD, and changes in the hippocampus coincide with the memory deficits observed in AD patients. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating APP expression in primary hippocampal neurons will be useful in understanding this disease.In the present work, we focused on identifying a microRNA regulating APP expression in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. In addition, we have analyzed the response of this microRNA to treatment of the cultures with IL-1β.DISCUSSIONAPP is one of the genes potentially regulated by the microRNA pathway in hippocampal neurons, since APP protein levels were up-regulated in neurons in which Ago2 was silenced. Reducing Ago2 levels did not significantly affect APP mRNA levels, suggesting that APP up-regulation is not the consequence of an indirect effect on APP transcription.The experiments presented here suggest that APP mRNA may be loaded into the RISC complex and may be directly regulated by specific microRNAs. Among microRNAs potentially targeting the APP 3′-UTR, miR-101 is a microRNA with two putative REs within the APP 3′-UTR and is also expressed in adult hippocampal tissue. Expression of miR-101 and APP both in embryonic primary hippocampal cell cultures and in postnatal rat hippocampal tissues further support the hypothesis that miR-101 is a repressor of hippocampal APP expression. Indeed, using a luciferase assay, we demonstrated that miR-101 actively represses a reporter containing the APP 3′-UTR. In addition, using site directed mutagenesis, a functional interaction between miR-101 and one of two microRNA REs within the APP 3′-UTR was identified. A number of cis regulatory elements which stabilize or destabilize APP mRNA have been described within the APP 3′-UTR (44Zaidi S.H. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Westmark P.R. Shin H.C. Westmark C.J. Soltaninassab S.R. Reinke E.K. Malter J.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report demonstrated that a RE for miRNAs belonging to the miR-20 family down-regulates APP expression (32Hébert S.S. Horré K. Nicolaï L. Bergmans B. Papadopoulou A.S. Delacourte A. De Strooper B. Neurobiol. Dis. 2009; 33: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the APP 3′-UTR is the target of multiple regulatory pathways, which may constitute an integrated network. Further work will be required to define the functional interactions between the different regulatory elements.Gain and loss of function experiments identified miR-101 as a negative regulator of APP in rat hippocampal neurons. MiR-101 overexpression reduced Aβ load and Cox-2 levels in neuronal cultures. Aβ assembly into oligomers and fibrils is involved in AD pathogenesis (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar) and elevated levels of Cox-2, which contribute to neuroinflammation, are associated with AD (46Yasojima K. Schwab C. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1999; 830: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, our observations suggest that miR-101 could play a protective role in AD. In fact, the Cox-2 reduction induced by miR-101 overexpression may contribute to the regulation of APP metabolism. Cox-2 is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGE2 has been shown to induce synthesis of APP mRNA and holoprotein (47Lee R.K. Knapp S. Wurtman R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 940-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to stimulate Aβ production (48Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the robust reduction of intracellular APP and of Aβ fibrils in the extracellular space may suggest that miR-101 can act by down-regulating both APP and Cox-2, which also reduces PGE2 levels. Whether other putative miR-101 targets may be associated with APP and Aβ metabolism is an interesting possibility that we will be addressed in future work.The influence of IL-1β on APP expression has been analyzed in various cell types and, in primary neuronal cell cultures, IL-1β was able to up-regulate the transcription of APP (43Del Bo R. Angeretti N. Lucca E. De Simoni M.G. Forloni G. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 188: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that treatment of hippocampal neuron cultures with lower IL-1β concentrations increased APP through regulation of translation, since the steady-state level of APP mRNA did not increase after IL-1β treatment but APP protein levels were transiently up-regulated. In addition, miR-101 may contribute to the reduction in APP expression after prolonged IL-1β treatment, suggesting a role for miR-101 in the control of APP expression in response to IL-1β. However, the overall regulation of APP translation may be the result of multiple mechanisms. For instance, previous findings have suggested that, in human astrocytes (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), IL-1β stimulation regulates translation of APP through the 5′-UTR of the APP mRNA. Thus, further dissection of the precise role of miR-101 in regulating APP and its potential interaction with other regulatory pathways will be necessary.Altered expression of microRNAs has been described in AD patients. Two independent miRNA expression profiles (30Hébert S.S. Horré K. Nicolaï L. Papadopoulou A.S. Mandemakers W. Silahtaroglu A.N. Kauppinen S. Delacourte A. De Strooper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PloS One. 2010; 5: e8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have shown that miR-101 is down-regulated in the human AD cerebral cortex, suggesting that miR-101 down-regulation may play a role in the development of AD. This hypothesis is in agreement with our results that indicate a direct role of miR-101 in controlling APP translation and Aβ fibril accumulation. Additional studies in AD murine models will be necessary to define the significance of miR-101 in the development and progression of AD pathology.

The hippocampus is one of the main brain regions affected during the early stages of AD, and changes in the hippocampus coincide with the memory deficits observed in AD patients. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating APP expression in primary hippocampal neurons will be useful in understanding this disease. In the present work, we focused on identifying a microRNA regulating APP expression in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. In addition, we have analyzed the response of this microRNA to treatment of the cultures with IL-1β. DISCUSSIONAPP is one of the genes potentially regulated by the microRNA pathway in hippocampal neurons, since APP protein levels were up-regulated in neurons in which Ago2 was silenced. Reducing Ago2 levels did not significantly affect APP mRNA levels, suggesting that APP up-regulation is not the consequence of an indirect effect on APP transcription.The experiments presented here suggest that APP mRNA may be loaded into the RISC complex and may be directly regulated by specific microRNAs. Among microRNAs potentially targeting the APP 3′-UTR, miR-101 is a microRNA with two putative REs within the APP 3′-UTR and is also expressed in adult hippocampal tissue. Expression of miR-101 and APP both in embryonic primary hippocampal cell cultures and in postnatal rat hippocampal tissues further support the hypothesis that miR-101 is a repressor of hippocampal APP expression. Indeed, using a luciferase assay, we demonstrated that miR-101 actively represses a reporter containing the APP 3′-UTR. In addition, using site directed mutagenesis, a functional interaction between miR-101 and one of two microRNA REs within the APP 3′-UTR was identified. A number of cis regulatory elements which stabilize or destabilize APP mRNA have been described within the APP 3′-UTR (44Zaidi S.H. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Westmark P.R. Shin H.C. Westmark C.J. Soltaninassab S.R. Reinke E.K. Malter J.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report demonstrated that a RE for miRNAs belonging to the miR-20 family down-regulates APP expression (32Hébert S.S. Horré K. Nicolaï L. Bergmans B. Papadopoulou A.S. Delacourte A. De Strooper B. Neurobiol. Dis. 2009; 33: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the APP 3′-UTR is the target of multiple regulatory pathways, which may constitute an integrated network. Further work will be required to define the functional interactions between the different regulatory elements.Gain and loss of function experiments identified miR-101 as a negative regulator of APP in rat hippocampal neurons. MiR-101 overexpression reduced Aβ load and Cox-2 levels in neuronal cultures. Aβ assembly into oligomers and fibrils is involved in AD pathogenesis (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar) and elevated levels of Cox-2, which contribute to neuroinflammation, are associated with AD (46Yasojima K. Schwab C. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1999; 830: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, our observations suggest that miR-101 could play a protective role in AD. In fact, the Cox-2 reduction induced by miR-101 overexpression may contribute to the regulation of APP metabolism. Cox-2 is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGE2 has been shown to induce synthesis of APP mRNA and holoprotein (47Lee R.K. Knapp S. Wurtman R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 940-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to stimulate Aβ production (48Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T.

Thus, the robust reduction of intracellular APP and of Aβ fibrils in the extracellular space may suggest that miR-101 can act by down-regulating both APP and Cox-2, which also reduces PGE2 levels. Whether other putative miR-101 targets may be associated with APP and Aβ metabolism is an interesting possibility that we will be addressed in future work.The influence of IL-1β on APP expression has been analyzed in various cell types and, in primary neuronal cell cultures, IL-1β was able to up-regulate the transcription of APP (43Del Bo R. Angeretti N. Lucca E. De Simoni M.G. Forloni G. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 188: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that treatment of hippocampal neuron cultures with lower IL-1β concentrations increased APP through regulation of translation, since the steady-state level of APP mRNA did not increase after IL-1β treatment but APP protein levels were transiently up-regulated. In addition, miR-101 may contribute to the reduction in APP expression after prolonged IL-1β treatment, suggesting a role for miR-101 in the control of APP expression in response to IL-1β. However, the overall regulation of APP translation may be the result of multiple mechanisms. For instance, previous findings have suggested that, in human astrocytes (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M.

Thus, further dissection of the precise role of miR-101 in regulating APP and its potential interaction with other regulatory pathways will be necessary.Altered expression of microRNAs has been described in AD patients.

https://openalex.org/W2028140379,"SAGA is a transcriptional coactivator complex that is conserved across eukaryotes and performs multiple functions during transcriptional activation and elongation. One role is deubiquitination of histone H2B, and this activity resides in a distinct subcomplex called the deubiquitinating module (DUBm), which contains the ubiquitin-specific protease Ubp8, bound to Sgf11, Sus1, and Sgf73. The deubiquitinating activity depends on the presence of all four DUBm proteins. We report here the 1.90 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the DUBm bound to ubiquitin aldehyde, as well as the 2.45 angstrom resolution structure of the uncomplexed DUBm. The structure reveals an arrangement of protein domains that gives rise to a highly interconnected complex, which is stabilized by eight structural zinc atoms that are critical for enzymatic activity. The structure suggests a model for how interactions with the other DUBm proteins activate Ubp8 and allows us to speculate about how the DUBm binds to monoubiquitinated histone H2B in nucleosomes."

For instance, the seismic properties of the solid inner core suggest hemispherical structural asymmetry, but questions remain as to how these variations arose (see the Perspective by Buffett ). Monnereau et al. (p. 1014 , published online 15 April) modeled grain sizes of crystalline iron—the predicted dominant mineral phase in the core—and found that a slow translational motion eastward may trigger melting in the Eastern Hemisphere and solidification in the Western Hemisphere, creating a lopsided core. Deuss et al. (p. 1018 , published online 15 April) examined the normal-mode seismic structure of the inner core, collected from 90 large earthquakes, which reveal not just simple hemispherical variations, but more nuanced regional structures. The overlap of the seismic data with Earth's magnetic field suggests that directionally dependent crystal alignment in the inner core formed during the solidification of the core or as a consequence of strong forces exerted by magnetism."

The revised age also suggests that magmatism was ongoing in Mars for a large part of its history and that ALH84001 was actually formed during the heavy bombardment period, just before the martian core dynamo stopped and the planetary magnetic field was lost."

https://openalex.org/W2153188717,"Background The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in all industrialized countries and its prevention has become a public health priority. However, the predictors of diabetes risk are insufficiently understood. We evaluated, whether 31 novel biomarkers could help to predict the risk of incident diabetes. Methods and Findings The biomarkers were evaluated primarily in the FINRISK97 cohort (n = 7,827; 417 cases of clinically incident diabetes during the follow-up). The findings were replicated in the Health 2000 cohort (n = 4,977; 179 cases of clinically incident diabetes during the follow-up). We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the relative risk of diabetes, after adjusting for the classic risk factors, separately for each biomarker. Next, we assessed the discriminatory ability of single biomarkers using receiver operating characteristic curves and C-statistics, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Finally, we derived a biomarker score in the FINRISK97 cohort and validated it in the Health 2000 cohort. A score consisting of adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein and ferritin almost doubled the relative risk of diabetes in the validation cohort (HR per one standard deviation increase 1.88, p = 2.8 e-5). It also improved discrimination of the model (IDI = 0.0149, p<0.0001) and reclassification of diabetes risk (NRI = 11.8%, p = 0.006). Gender-specific analyses suggested that the best score differed between men and women. Among men, the best results were obtained with the score of four biomarkers: adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, ferritin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, which gave an NRI of 25.4% (p<0.0001). Among women, the best score included adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein and insulin. It gave an NRI of 13.6% (p = 0.041). Conclusions We identified novel biomarkers that were associated with the risk of clinically incident diabetes over and above the classic risk factors. This gives new insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes and may help with targeting prevention and treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2008595762,"Metabotropic GABA(B) receptors play a fundamental role in modulating the excitability of neurons and circuits throughout the brain. These receptors influence synaptic transmission by inhibiting presynaptic release or activating postsynaptic potassium channels. However, their ability to directly influence different types of postsynaptic glutamate receptors remains unresolved. Here we examine GABA(B) receptor modulation in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from the mouse prefrontal cortex. We use two-photon laser-scanning microscopy to study synaptic modulation at individual dendritic spines. Using two-photon optical quantal analysis, we first demonstrate robust presynaptic modulation of multivesicular release at single synapses. Using two-photon glutamate uncaging, we then reveal that GABA(B) receptors strongly inhibit NMDA receptor calcium signals. This postsynaptic modulation occurs via the PKA pathway and does not affect synaptic currents mediated by AMPA or NMDA receptors. This form of GABA(B) receptor modulation has widespread implications for the control of calcium-dependent neuronal function."

Under conditions of single-task (sequential) performance, they observed bilateral brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate and the premotor cortex that correlated with the reward value of the current task. However, under dual-task conditions, activity in these regions on the left corresponded to primary-task reward performance, while on the right, activity corresponded to secondary-task performance.

Here, we demonstrate a vesicle pool that is not confined to a synapse but spans multiple terminals. Using fluorescence imaging, correlative electron microscopy, and modeling of vesicle dynamics, we show that some recycling pool vesicles at synapses form part of a larger vesicle “superpool.” The vesicles within this superpool are highly mobile and are rapidly exchanged between terminals (turnover: ∼4% of total pool/min), significantly changing vesicular composition at synapses over time. In acute hippocampal slices we show that the mobile vesicle pool is also a feature of native brain tissue. We also demonstrate that superpool vesicles are available to synapses during stimulation, providing an extension of the classical recycling pool. Experiments using focal BDNF application suggest the involvement of a local TrkB-receptor-dependent mechanism for synapse-specific regulation of presynaptic vesicle pools through control of vesicle release and capture to or from the extrasynaptic pool."

Seismic studies using compressional body waves suggest hemispherical variation in the anisotropic structure of the inner core, but are poorly constrained because of limited earthquake and receiver distribution. Here, using normal mode splitting function measurements from large earthquakes, based on extended cross-coupling theory, we observe both regional variations and eastern versus western hemispherical anisotropy in the inner core. The similarity of this pattern with Earth's magnetic field suggests freezing-in of crystal alignment during solidification or texturing by Maxwell stress as origins of the anisotropy. These observations limit the amount of inner core super rotation, but would be consistent with oscillation."

Many natural and synthetic compounds have been found to act on the thermoTRPs leading to altered nociception, but little is known about endogenous painful molecules activating TRPV3. Here, we show that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), an intermediate metabolite in the mevalonate pathway, specifically activates TRPV3 among six thermoTRPs using Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology with cultured keratinocytes and TRPV3-overexpressing cells. Agonistic potencies of related compounds in the FPP metabolism were ignorable. Voltage-dependence of TRPV3 was shifted by FPP, which appears to be the activation mechanism. An intraplantar injection of FPP acutely elicits nociceptive behaviors in inflamed animals, indicating that FPP is a novel endogenous pain-producing substance via TRPV3 activation. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that this FPP-evoked signal in the keratinocytes is transmitted to sensory neurons. In addition, FPP reduced TRPV3 heat threshold resulting in heightened behavioral sensitivity to noxious heat. Taken together, our data suggest that FPP is the firstly identified endogenous TRPV3 activator that causes nociception.

It has been reported that some of endogenous molecules are able to modulate TRPV3 activation. For example, unsaturated fatty acids potentiated TRPV3 activation by 2-APB (14Hu H.Z. Xiao R. Wang C.

A variety of metabolites are formed in the human body as a result of the diverse biochemical processes and some of the metabolites are potentially involved in pain development (17Sutherland S.P. Cook S.P. McCleskey E.W. Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 129: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is an intermediate molecule in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. In the present study, we examined whether FPP is an activator for TRPV3. We performed Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp experiments with TRPV3 and other related thermoTRPs for the pharmacological characterization of the FPP action. Animal behavioral studies were also carried out to test whether FPP elicits pain via a TRPV3-mediated mechanism. HEK293T cells were cultured as previously (18Bang S. Kim K.Y. Yoo S. Kim Y.G. Hwang S.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Bang S. Kim K.Y. Yoo S. Lee S.H. Hwang S.W. Neurosci. Lett. 2007; 425: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of individual TRP channel plasmid DNA (hTRPA1, rTRPV1, rTRPV2, or mTRPV4 in pcDNA3.1; hTRPV3 or mTRPM8 in PCDNA5/FRT) per 35-mm dish using Fugene HD (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. In vitro transfection of HaCaT keratinocytes with 8 μg of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was performed according to the above protocols for the HEK293T cells. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes in the first passage were purchased from Cambrex Bioscience Walkersville, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). The keratinocytes were maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Cambrex Bioscience Walkersville, Inc.). All the experiments were conducted using the 3–5 times passed keratinocytes. Mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were cultured. Briefly, DRG was dissected out of adult ICR mice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1.5 mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) at 37 °C for 45 min and were then treated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 15 min. Neurons were then plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass cover slips in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5–50 ng/ml 2.5S NGF (Invitrogen). Experiments with DRG neurons were performed 48–72 h after plating. HaCaT cells and mouse DRG neurons were co-cultured in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Cambrex Bioscience, Walkersville Inc.) with 2.5 S NGF for some experiments. All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. DRG neuron and keratinocyte co-cultures were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPV3 (Alomon Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) for TRPV3-expressing cells, and Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for nuclei. The secondary antibody for the anti-TRPV3 was Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). All cultures were performed at least in triplicate for Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology experiments. Ca2+ imaging experiments were carried out as described previously (20Kim K.Y. Bang S. Han S. Nguyen Y.H. Kang T.M. Kang K.W. Hwang S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 370: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm glass coverslips and used for Fluo-3 Ca2+ imaging 16–48 h later. The bath solution was composed of (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Cells were loaded with Fluo-3AM (5 μm, at 37 °C for 1 h) in bath solution containing 0.02% pluronic acid (Invitrogen). The imaging experiments were performed with a confocal microscope (LSM5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss, Germany) and images at 488 nm excitation/514 nm emission were collected every 3 s using Carl Zeiss ratio tool software. Keratinocytes were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM for 30 min, and the cells were resuspended in (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Images of Fura-2 loaded cells with the excitation wavelength alternating between 340 nm and 380 nm were captured with a cooled CCD camera (Retiga-SRV, Q-imaging Corp., Burnaby, BC, Canada). The ratio of fluorescence intensity of the two wavelengths in each experiment was analyzed using MetaFluor (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Values from different experiments were normalized to baseline of the ratio 340/380 nm. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed as described previously (18Bang S. Kim K.Y. Yoo S. Kim Y.G. Hwang S.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP, 0.2 NaGTP titrated to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The holding potential was −60 mV and for the current-voltage analysis, 800-ms voltage-ramp pulses from −80 to +80 mV were used. For whole cell voltage-dependence analysis, a step protocol composed of 32 episodes of 800-ms step pulses with a 10-mV increment starting from −120 mV was used. Each step pulse was followed by a 400-ms invariant step to −120 mV. The peak inward tail currents at −120 mV were collected for each step, normalized to the maximum tail current, and fitted using the Boltzmann equation. For single channel recordings with cell-attached and inside-out configurations, the whole cell bath solution was used as the pipette solution and the holding potential was −60 mV. For the experiments for the in vitro channel activation by heat, the solution temperature of the bath chamber was controlled and monitored using a digital temperature controller (CL-100, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Heat activation thresholds were obtained from Q10 (increase in reaction rate per 10 °C increase in temperature) analysis in which the intersection temperature point of the nonspecific reaction phase and the steeply increasing phase is referred to as the temperature threshold (21Vyklický L. Vlachová V. Vitásková Z. Dittert I. Kabát M. Orkand R.K. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The study was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University Committee on Laboratory Animals. Hind paw licking and lifting behavior was quantitated every minute for 20 min as previously described (4Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N. Spencer K.S. Andahazy M. Story G.M. Patapoutian A. Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 18Bang S. Kim K.Y. Yoo S. Kim Y.G. Hwang S.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 6-week-old male ICR mice and TRPV1-knock-out mice (generously provided by Dr. Uhtaek Oh) were used. Animals were acclimated for 1 h to the test environment prior to performing the experiments. For inflammation, 2% carrageenan in 10 μl was injected into a hind paw 3 h prior to the FPP injection. Drugs in 10-μl vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 80) were injected into mice hind paws intradermally at the doses detailed in the results. For shRNA administration, 10 μg of shRNA in 20 μl of saline with 20 μl EzWayTM transfection reagent (Komabiotech, Korea) were injected into a hind paw 48 h prior to the FPP injection. Hargreaves assay apparatus (Plantar Analgesia meter, for noxious heat sensitivity) were from UGO Basile (Italy) and the assay for changes in thermal behaviors was performed as described previously (4Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N. Spencer K.S. Andahazy M. Story G.M. Patapoutian A. Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 22Yoo S. Han S. Park Y.S. Lee J.H. Oh U. Hwang S.W. Mol. Cell. 2009; 27: 417-422Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The tests were performed under unconstrained condition. Baseline responses were measured 5 min prior to FPP administration. Paw withdrawal latencies of the contralateral hind paws were also measured both before and after drug injection. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed Student's t test (***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05) and shown as means ± S.E. For the comparison of the accumulating licking/lifting time or flinch numbers, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc test was performed and for the comparison of the data at each time point, the two-tailed Student's t test was performed. To examine the epidermal expression of TRPV3, cultured human keratinocytes or epidermal keratinocytes that were collected from mice hind paws were used. For collecting the mice hind paw keratinocytes, ∼0.2 cm2 pieces of the plantar skin epidermal layers were isolated from sacrificed mice and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay cell lysis buffer (Elpis Biotech, Korea) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min and was followed by SDS-PAGE for Western blotting (Bio-Rad). The transferred membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPV3 antibodies (1:300, Alomon Labs, Israel) and with rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:2000, Abcam) before visualizing the proteins by ECL system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The extraction of total RNA from isolated keratinocytes was carried out using RNA preparation kit (Axygen, Union City, CA). Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using a PCR thermal cycler (Takara, Japan). Reverse transcription was performed using the amfiRivert single-step RT-PCR kit (GenDEPOT, Barker, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR primers were as follows: mTRPV3, 5′-CCCCATCCTCTTTCTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-CGACGTTTCTGGGAATTCAT-3′; hTRPV3, 5′-CCTCGTGCTCAGTGCTCAGT-3′ and 5′-CTGGCAGGAGGAAAGACTCC-3′. The PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise described. FPP, farnesol, geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). mTRPV3-shRNA (5′-CCGGGCTGGAAATCATCGTCTACAACTCGAGTTGTAGACGATGATTTCCAGCTTTTTG-3′) and hTRPV3-shRNA (5′-CCGGGCTGCATATGAAGTGGAAGAACTCGAGTTCTTCCACTTCATATGCAGCTTTTTG-3′) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). A non-target scrambled shRNA (5′-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCTAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTTAGG-3′) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stock solutions were made using water or ethanol and were diluted with test solutions before use. Fluo-3 intracellular Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed with TRPV3-expressing HEK293T cells to examine whether FPP activates TRPV3. As soon as 100 nm FPP was applied to the bath, increases in the intracellular Ca2+ levels were detected (Fig. 1A). To test if the same cells expressed TRPV3, camphor, a TRPV3 agonist was added subsequently and all of the FPP-sensitive cells showed Ca2+ influx response to camphor (Fig. 1A). FPP failed to evoke such a response from untransfected HEK293T cells (data not shown, n = 45). In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, 1 μm FPP application also elicited rapid current responses in the TRPV3-expressing HEK cells (Fig. 1B). The current in response to FPP was outwardly rectifying as that in response to camphor, and was obviously blunted by addition of 20 μm ruthenium red (RR), a TRP channel blocker (Fig. 1, B and C), which indicates that the FPP-evoked current was mediated by TRPV3 activation. Because phosphorylated intermediates in the mevalonate pathway (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme reductase pathway) hardly cross the plasma membrane (23Henneman L. van Cruchten A.G. Denis S.W. Amolins M.W. Placzek A.T. Gibbs R.A. Kulik W. Waterham H.R. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 383: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the binding site of FPP would be located in the extracellular side of the channel according to the above results with extracellular drug application methods. To further confirm whether FPP acts on the extracellular side of the TRPV3 channel, we carried out single channel patch recordings with cell-attached and inside-out configurations. In the cell-attached patches, single channel currents relevant to the TRPV3 conductance were detected as soon as the seal formation when the recording pipette contained 300 nm FPP (Fig. 1, D, upper trace and E). On the other hand, with the recording pipette free from FPP, delayed onset of the single channel activation with low open probability was observed in the inside-out patch when FPP was applied to the bath (intracellular side of the channel) (Fig. 1, D, lower trace and E). These data indicate that FPP binds to the extracellular side of TRPV3 and activate this channel. The results from the whole cell and inside-out experiments also suggest that FPP unlikely acts as a donor for farnesylation of TRPV3 proteins for activating the channel because cytosolic enzymes are diluted or removed in the two experiments. We next examined the thermoTRP channel specificity for FPP activation using HEK293T cells expressing individual TRPs (TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPA1, and TRPM8) and using the Ca2+ imaging. Of the six TRP channels, only TRPV3 clearly showed a significant sensitivity to FPP in terms of its activation (Fig. 2A). Other substances chemically related to FPP were also tested for the thermoTRP activation. IPP and GPP are the precursors of FPP and GGPP is the downstream product of FPP in the mevalonate pathway. Farnesol is the alcoholic form of FPP with the same carbon backbone (Fig. 2E) and is known as a ligand of nuclear Farnesoid X receptor (24Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). None of the substances elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels in the TRPV3-HEK cells at micromolar ranges (Fig. 2A). From the TRPV3-mediated Ca2+ influx, the dose-response curve for FPP was obtained (Fig. 2B). The EC50 of FPP on TRPV3 was 131.1 nm, indicating that FPP exerts its action on the TRPV3 activity at the nanomolar and micromolar levels. To further investigate TRPV3 activation mechanisms by FPP, we performed voltage-dependence analysis as TRPV3 exhibits voltage-dependent activation (16Xiao R. Tang J. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tian J. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6162-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Hu H. Grandl J. Bandell M. Petrus M. Patapoutian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1626-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The peak inward tail currents at −120 mV after a 800-ms voltage step protocol of test potentials ranging from −120 mV to +200 mV were measured with or without FPP application (Fig. 2C). As a result, the voltage dependence of TRPV3 activation is shifted toward more negative voltages upon FPP application (Fig. 2D). The V½ decreased from 143 mV at resting state to −66 mV during FPP application. The results suggest that TRPV3 activation by FPP is caused via a shift in its voltage dependence. With the results of TRPV3-specific activation by FPP in the heterologous expression system, we hypothesized that the skin keratinocyte, which is a TRPV3-abundant cell type, is also able to show similar responses to FPP. In Ca2+-imaging experiments using HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines and normal human keratinocytes, rapid intracellular Ca2+ elevation were induced upon FPP application (Fig. 3, A and C). In all the same cells, camphor responses were also detected. In whole cell voltage clamp experiments evident current responses (in which the outwardly rectifying current-voltage relationships were similar to those upon camphor application) were detected upon FPP application and blocked by RR co-application, both with HaCaT keratinocytes and with normal human keratinocytes (Fig. 3, B and D). Earlier, FPP was reported to activate GPR92, leading to intracellular Ca2+ elevation (26Oh D.Y. Yoon J.M. Moon M.J. Hwang J.I. Choe H. Lee J.Y. Kim J.I. Kim S. Rhim H. O'Dell D.K. Walker J.M. Na H.S. Lee M.G. Kwon H.B. Kim K. Seong J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21054-21064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Another activator for GPR92, N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAG) failed to elicit such Ca2+ response (data not shown). Thus the Ca2+ influx of the keratinocytes are mediated via TRPV3 activation and not via GPR92 activation. Thermal activation of TRPV3 results in pain behaviors (4Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N. Spencer K.S. Andahazy M. Story G.M. Patapoutian A. Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 5Huang S.M. Lee H. Chung M.K. Park U. Yu Y.Y. Bradshaw H.B. Coulombe P.A. Walker J.M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13727-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To check if FPP is also able to evoke pain behaviors, we performed acute pain behavior assays used in a previous study (18Bang S. Kim K.Y. Yoo S. Kim Y.G. Hwang S.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When FPP was intradermally injected into a hind paw, no significant change in behavior was observed in normal mice (Fig. 4B). Animals locally inflamed by carrageenan for 3 h, however, exhibited significant increases in time consumed in acute licking and lifting behaviors in response to the FPP injections (Fig. 4, A and C) whereas injections with vehicle or GPP (the structurally closest precursor to FPP without activity on thermoTRPs) were without effect (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the effects of FPP were attenuated when intradermally pretreated with RR, which indicates that the acute pain induced by FPP was mediated by TRPV3 activation (Fig. 4, A and B). For further examination, mice were pretreated with mTRPV3-shRNA in a hind paw 48 h prior to the behavioral test. The mTRPV3-shRNA-treated mice showed suppressed epidermal TRPV3 expression in the pretreated hind paw (Fig. 4, D and E). Like the pharmacological blockade with RR, the shRNA treatment significantly attenuated FPP-induced licking/lifting responses (Fig. 4, B and C). The mTRPV3-shRNA did not affect capsaicin-evoked licking behaviors (n = 5, data not shown). No significant behavioral suppression was observed in mice treated with a scrambled shRNA (Fig. 4, B and C), which indicates that only the mTRPV3-shRNA specifically down-regulated TRPV3 expression and that it subsequently blocked FPP-action on TRPV3. We hypothesized that this FPP-induced nociception is relayed by the sensory neurons. Thus we examined the in vitro neuronal response upon FPP application using co-culture of HaCaT keratinocytes and the mouse DRG sensory neurons. When co-cultured, a close proximity of neuronal terminals and keratinocytes was observed (Fig. 5A). In the Ca2+ imaging experiments, the DRG sensory neurons showed significant Ca2+ influx responses following the keratinocyte responses upon FPP application in the same dish (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, 38% of the neurons responding to FPP was also capsaicin-sensitive (n = 16), which indicates that nociceptive populations relay the FPP signals. The onsets of the DRG responses were behind those of keratinocyte responses (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that the sensory neurons do not contain functional TRPV3 or other excitatory components directly sensitive to FPP. RR application completely ablated the keratinocyte FPP responses and subsequent DRG responses (Fig. 5D). Moreover, no change in the intracellular Ca2+ levels of the mouse sensory neurons by FPP was detected in cultures without keratinocytes or cultures with keratinocytes treated with hTRPV3-shRNA, which further demonstrates that the mouse sensory neurons are lacking in functional TRPV3 or other direct FPP-sensing machinery on their own (Fig. 5, E and F) (1,4,27). We also confirmed the effect of the hTRPV3-shRNA on TRPV3 expression of the keratinocytes using RT-PCR and Western blot analyses (Fig. 5, G and H). These results suggest that FPP excites keratinocytes via TRPV3 activation and that signals instantly released from the keratinocytes activate the adjoined sensory neurons. We also ascertained whether FPP acutely affects in vivo heat thresholds. After FPP was intradermally injected into a hind paw, paw withdrawal latencies upon radiant heat were significantly decreased in the Hargreaves test (Fig. 6A). We hypothesized that an increase in heat sensitivity of TRPV3 or TRPV1 may cause this phenomenon. TRPV1-knock-out mice exhibited the similar reduction in the Hargreaves threshold (Fig. 6A), indicating that FPP affects the heat sensitivity in a TRPV1-independent manner. By contrast, no significant reduction in the heat threshold of mice pretreated with mTRPV3-shRNA was observed, suggesting that TRPV3 mediates the in vivo FPP-induced thermal hypersensitivity. We further examined the in vitro heat thresholds of these two TRP channels with or without FPP incubation. TRPV3 but not TRPV1 (n = 4, data not shown), exhibited significantly lower temperature thresholds for its activation under FPP incubation even at a 10 nm, which is a marginal concentration to activate TRPV3 (n = 8, 3.5 °C ± 0.5 decrease at average, Fig. 6, B and C). FPP also failed to potentiate capsaicin response of TRPV1 (data not shown. n = 160 in Ca2+ imaging).

Pals1 loss shows exquisite dosage sensitivity, so that heterozygote mutants show an intermediate phenotype on cell fate and cell death. Loss of Pals1 blocks essential cell survival signals, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while mTORC1 activation partially rescues Pals1 deficiency.

The proliferation of cortical progenitor cells, followed by their irreversible depletion near the time of birth, is tightly orchestrated by cellular and molecular events that balance the generation of early-born neurons with the maintenance of progenitors for later-born neurons (Caviness et al., 1995Caviness Jr., V.S.

Two neural progenitor cell types are identified in the developing cortex. One is a radial neuroepithelial cell, with a cell body in the ventricular zone and an apical process that inserts into the ventricular lining, and a long, thin basal processes that reaches the pial surface at the outside of the brain (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E.

These radial cells serve both as progenitors and migratory guides for newly born neurons. The other progenitor cell type is a more recently characterized basal progenitor, which localizes primarily to the subventricular zone (SVZ) and undergoes one or more cell divisions, typically symmetrically, to generate neurons in the cerebral cortex (Haubensak et al., 2004Haubensak W.

Radial neuroepithelial progenitors form an epithelial structure with their apical, ventricular processes connected to adjoining cells by adherens junctions. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the cellular events of radial glial progenitor cell division, the molecular control of cell fate decisions remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that similar functions of apical complex proteins in cell fate determination may unite flies and mammals (Doe, 2008Doe C.Q.

Molecular control of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neuroblasts.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The apical polarity complex of flies, which includes the proteins Bazooka (Par3), Par6, and aPKC, restricts cell fate determinants to one side of neural stem cells, termed neuroblasts, such that these determinants are inherited preferentially by one daughter cell that retains the neuroblast cell fate. On the other hand, the basal complex proteins, Lgl/Dlg/Scb and Numb, are segregated to the other daughter cell, termed the ganglion mother cell (Roegiers and Jan, 2004Roegiers F. Jan Y.N. Asymmetric cell division.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, Wodarz, 2005Wodarz A.

Genetic studies of the vertebrate Numb orthologs have uncovered a number of roles in neurogenesis (Li et al., 2003Li H.S. Wang D. Shen Q. Schonemann M.D. Gorski J.A. Jones K.R. Temple S. Jan L.Y.

Sestan N. Numb and Numbl are required for maintenance of cadherin-based adhesion and polarity of neural progenitors.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to its role in invertebrates, deletion of aPKCλ in mice at E15 (midway through neurogenesis) did not clearly affect cell fate decisions in a fashion comparable to its role in invertebrates (Imai et al., 2006Imai F. Hirai S. Akimoto K. Koyama H. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Noguchi S. Sasaoka T. Noda T. Ohno S. Inactivation of aPKClambda results in the loss of adherens junctions in neuroepithelial cells without affecting neurogenesis in mouse neocortex.Development. 2006; 133: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mouse Lgl1 mutants showed hyperproliferation of progenitors in the brain, in conjunction with Numb mislocalization (Klezovitch et al., 2004Klezovitch O. Fernandez T.E. Tapscott S.J. Vasioukhin V. Loss of cell polarity causes severe brain dysplasia in Lgl1 knockout mice.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that Par3 is segregated asymmetrically in cortical progenitors and also serves as a cell-autonomous regulator of Notch signaling (Bultje et al., 2009Bultje R.S. Castaneda-Castellanos D.R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Kriegstein A.R. Shi S.H. Mammalian Par3 regulates progenitor cell asymmetric division via notch signaling in the developing neocortex.Neuron. 2009; 63: 189-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, knockdown and overexpression studies of Par3 and Par6 (Costa et al., 2008Costa M.R. Wen G. Lepier A. Schroeder T. Götz M. Par-complex proteins promote proliferative progenitor divisions in the developing mouse cerebral cortex.Development. 2008; 135: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and conditional knockout of their upstream regulator Cdc42 (Cappello et al., 2006Cappello S. Attardo A. Wu X. Iwasato T. Itohara S. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Eilken H.M. Rieger M.A. Schroeder T.T. Huttner W.B. et al.The Rho-GTPase cdc42 regulates neural progenitor fate at the apical surface.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) suggest that the apical complex proteins are essential for self-renewal of neural progenitors in the developing mammalian cortex. While it seems likely that evolutionarily conserved polarity complex proteins have roles in proliferation control, whether they also play a role in maintaining neural progenitor cell fate has not been shown genetically. Here, we study a functionally related apical complex protein, Protein associated with Lin7 (Pals1), and extend the role of the apical complex to control cell survival as well. Pals1 belongs to the Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinase (MAGUK) family of proteins, which are scaffolding factors containing both postsynaptic density 95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (Kamberov et al., 2000Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. Molecular cloning and characterization of Pals, proteins associated with mLin-7.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pals1 also contains two L27 domains that bind PatJ and Lin7, both critical components of tight junction formation and maintenance. The PDZ domain of Pals1 links it to Crb1, -2, and -3, Crumbs vertebrate homologs, which encode transmembrane proteins with EGF-like repeats, thus forming a tripartite PatJ-Pals1-Crbs complex (Roh et al., 2002aRoh M.H. Liu C.J. Laurinec S. Margolis B. The carboxyl terminus of zona occludens-3 binds and recruits a mammalian homologue of discs lost to tight junctions.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27501-27509Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, an evolutionarily conserved domain whose structure is not yet understood mediates binding of Pals1 to the Par6-Par3-aPKC apical complex. Thus, Pals1 links these two evolutionarily conserved apical complex signaling pathways (Hurd et al., 2003Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Direct interaction of two polarity complexes implicated in epithelial tight junction assembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The critical function of Pals1 (Nagie oko in zebrafish) is well established in epithelial polarity and adherens junction assembly in mammalian cells, in zebrafish embryos, and in invertebrates (Bachmann et al., 2001Bachmann A. Schneider M. Theilenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E.

Malicki J. nagie oko, encoding a MAGUK-family protein, is essential for cellular patterning of the retina.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but a role for Pals1 has not been studied in cell fate decisions. In this study, we show that Pals1 loss causes defects not only in cell fate decisions but also surprisingly in cell survival, and we use genetics to elucidate key downstream effectors of these roles. We find that absence of Pals1 leads to the depletion of progenitor cells by premature withdrawal from the cell cycle, generating excessive early-born postmitotic neurons. Unexpectedly however, Pals1-deficient cells undergo massive and rapid cell death, which leads to the total abrogation of almost the entire cortical structure. Since accumulating evidence has implicated interactions between mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway components and polarity proteins (Massey-Harroche et al., 2007Massey-Harroche D.

Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway by elimination of a negative regulator, Tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (Tsc2), partially restores the medial cortex in Pals1 mutants, suggesting genetic interaction between the two signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings identify a connection between the apical complex and mTOR signaling that couples cell fate and cell survival during cortical development. Several aspects of Pals1 expression suggested that Pals1 plays an important role during mammalian neurogenesis. First, Pals1 expression in cortical progenitors was very high during the period of neurogenesis and rapidly downregulated over the course of neurogenesis so that Pals1 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced by P0, when neurogenesis nears completion (Figure S1A) (Ishiuchi et al., 2009Ishiuchi T. Misaki K. Yonemura S. Takeichi M. Tanoue T. Mammalian Fat and Dachsous cadherins regulate apical membrane organization in the embryonic cerebral cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice, Pals1 localized apically in the cortical neuroepithelium along the ventricular surface, and its expression overlapped extensively with members of both apical polarity complexes, including Crb2, aPKCζ, and Patj (Figure S2A). In addition, several apical complex proteins coimmunoprecipitated with Pals1 from E13 forebrain lysates (Figure S2A), suggesting that murine apical complex proteins physically interact as in other species (Hurd et al., 2003Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Direct interaction of two polarity complexes implicated in epithelial tight junction assembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Apical proteins localized adjacent to adherens junctions marked by β-catenin (Figure S2A), reflecting an intimate link between the apical complex and adherens junctions in the developing brain. We removed Pals1 in mouse embryos using a conditional mutation created by inserting LoxP sites into introns 2 and 3 of the mouse Pals1 gene (Figure S1B), since complete loss of Pals1 was lethal at early embryonic ages (data not shown). Pals1 floxed homozygote neonates and adults showed no identifiable phenotype and had normal lifespan and breeding. Cre-mediated recombination removed exon 3, resulting in a nonsense mutation with early truncation of the 867 amino acid Pals1 protein at amino acid 122 (Figure S1C), removing most of Pals1's known functional domains (Roh et al., 2002bRoh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. The Maguk protein, Pals1, functions as an adapter, linking mammalian homologues of Crumbs and Discs Lost.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Deleting Pals1 using Emx1-Cre (Pals1loxp/loxp: Cre+ [CKO] animals), which drives Cre-mediated recombination in cortical progenitors of medial cortex and hippocampus (Gorski et al., 2002Gorski J.A. Talley T. Qiu M. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Jones K.R. Cortical excitatory neurons and glia, but not GABAergic neurons, are produced in the Emx1-expressing lineage.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6309-6314PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in undetectable Pals1 expression by E11 (Figure S1D) in progenitor cells of these structures, confirmed by immunostaining with three distinct antisera (Figure S1D and data not shown) (Chae et al., 2004Chae T.H. Kim S. Marz K.E. Hanson P.I. Walsh C.A. The hyh mutation uncovers roles for alpha Snap in apical protein localization and control of neural cell fate.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, Roh et al., 2002bRoh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. The Maguk protein, Pals1, functions as an adapter, linking mammalian homologues of Crumbs and Discs Lost.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, given the expected role of apical complex proteins in cell fate determination, Emx1-Cre mediated removal of Pals1 (Pals1 CKO) produced not merely a smaller cortex but a cortex that was essentially completely absent, lacking virtually all cortical neurons. Extreme thinning was seen in the lateral cortex, where some Pals1 expression was retained due to weaker or delayed Cre expression (Figures 1A–1D ) (Gorski et al., 2002Gorski J.A. Talley T. Qiu M. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Jones K.R. Cortical excitatory neurons and glia, but not GABAergic neurons, are produced in the Emx1-expressing lineage.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6309-6314PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygote Pals1loxp/+:Cre+ animals (Het) also showed an extremely small cortex, with small residual medial cortical structures, including the hippocampus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the space typically occupied by the neocortex in the wild-type mouse was replaced by a fluid-filled cystic space contiguous with the lateral ventricles in the Pals1 CKO mouse (Figure 1B). There was no apparent change in the size of the third and fourth ventricles, where Cre was not expressed (Figure 1B, data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to Drosophila Stardust, which is not required for neuroblast cell fate determination (Bachmann et al., 2001Bachmann A. Schneider M. Theilenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E. Drosophila Stardust is a partner of Crumbs in the control of epithelial cell polarity.Nature. 2001; 414: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Hong et al., 2001Hong Y. Stronach B. Perrimon N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Drosophila Stardust interacts with Crumbs to control polarity of epithelia but not neuroblasts.Nature. 2001; 414: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), Pals1 is required for normal histogenesis of the cerebral cortex, and interestingly this requirement is dose-dependent with milder heterozygote phenotypes. Remarkably, Pals1 CKO mice survive into adulthood, representing an adult mouse with virtually no cerebral cortex. We found that Pals1 CKO mice survived, fed, and bred in the laboratory environment and, in general, appeared surprisingly healthy, though their overall body weight was lower than age-matched wild-type (WT) controls (Figure 2A ), and their fur appeared less kempt in adulthood (data not shown). Basic neurological reflexes, such as the righting reflex, appeared intact (data not shown). Pals1 CKO mice responded to tail pinch, and there were no detectable differences in their speed to tail withdrawal in the hot water tail flick test when compared to Het or WT controls (data not shown). Preservation of the Preyer reflex indicated that the Pals1 CKO and Het mice registered auditory cues (data not shown). Perhaps most remarkably, considering the ablation of the entire frontal motor cortex, no differences were detected between groups of mice in a motor coordination test using the accelerating rotarod, in either acquiring the task (data not shown) or in test day performance (Figure 2B). Hence, Pals1 CKO mice uncover a series of behaviors that are governed predominantly by cortex-independent circuitry. Not surprisingly, Pals1 CKO mice exhibited severely compromised behaviors in several tests previously shown to depend upon intact cortical circuitry. For example, their movements were irregular and jumpy, disrupting their stride and gait (Figure 2C). Pals1 CKO performed poorly in the wire hang (Figure 2D). Pals1 CKO mice swam; however, while there was no significant difference between the groups of mice in swimming speed, Pals1 CKO mice did so in a characteristic circling pattern (Figure 2E). They typically failed to locate a visible platform in the Morris water maze (success rates: +/+ = 10/10; +/− = 5/10; −/− = 4/10; Figure 2E), as if they were blind to it, and spent less time searching for the visible platform in the appropriate quadrant than Het or WT controls (Figure 2F). Pals1 CKO mice also failed in the visual forepaw reach test (data not shown). Finally, Pals1 mutant mice had reduced exploratory initiative and locomotor behavior in the open field test (Figure 2G). After 3 min in the open field, 6/10 Het mice, and 9/10 Pals1 CKO mice remained in the center quadrant while 10/10 WT control mice had by this time started exploring the novel environment. Neither Pals1 CKO nor Het mice were noticeably distressed in the center of the field. During the course of the full 10 min trial, both Pals1 CKO and Het mice preferred the center quadrant over any other quadrant (Figure 2H). In fact, 4/10 of the Pals1 CKO mice remained in the center quadrant for the entire duration of the experiment. Taken together, these data demonstrate a broad range of behavioral deficits arising from the absence of appropriate cortical feed-forward and feedback circuitry in the Pals1 CKO mouse. In addition, the Het displays an intermediate behavioral phenotype, underscoring the importance of appropriate Pals1 gene dosage during cortical development. In order to investigate the reason for the absence of almost the entire cortex, we examined Pals1 CKO animals and noted striking changes in cortical size and morphology at E12 and E14 (Figures 3A and 3B ). Consistent with the proposed role of the apical complex in regulating cell fate (Bultje et al., 2009Bultje R.S. Castaneda-Castellanos D.R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Kriegstein A.R. Shi S.H.

Wen G. Lepier A. Schroeder T. Götz M. Par-complex proteins promote proliferative progenitor divisions in the developing mouse cerebral cortex.Development. 2008; 135: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), Pals1 CKO animals did show dramatic changes in progenitor cell renewal and cell fate (Figures 3C–3H). S phase cells, marked by BrdU incorporation, were diminished almost 2-fold compared to the WT. M phase cells, marked by phospho-Histone H3 (PH3) immunoreactivity (Figures 3D–3F), were similarly reduced at E12.5 and E14.5, with Hets showing intermediate numbers in both cases. To determine the cause of progenitor cell loss, we labeled progenitor cells with BrdU at E10–E11 and labeled those progenitors still cycling 18–24 hr later by immunostaining with Ki67, as previously described (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Regulation of cerebral cortical size by control of cell cycle exit in neural precursors.Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Of the progenitors labeled at E10, 15.7% of Pals1 CKO progenitors exited the cell cycle on E11 (and were hence not double labeled with Ki67), compared to 8.5% in wild-type and 9.7% in Hets, suggesting that Pals1-deficient progenitors prematurely withdraw from the cell cycle. Mutant progenitors labeled at E11 exited the cell cycle by E12 at 2.3-fold the rate of normal progenitors (Figures 3G and 3H). Furthermore, postmitotic neurons (marked by Reelin, Dcx, Map2, and Tbr1) were increased at E11 and E12 transiently in CKO brains (Figures S3A–S3F), suggesting that some progenitor cells exit the cell cycle to become neurons in the absence of Pals1. Basal progenitors, i.e., intermediate progenitors located in subventricular zone and labeled by Tbr2 immunoreactivity, were also significantly reduced in number at E12 and later stages (Figures S3G–S3J). To determine whether these defects in self-renewal are cell-autonomous, we employed shRNA technology to acutely knockdown Pals1. Pals1 shRNA effectively reduced the expression of Pals1 in cultures of NIH 3T3 cells and in electroporated cells in vivo (Figures S4A and S4B and data not shown) (van Rossum et al., 2006van Rossum A.G.

Pals1 shRNA effects were rescued by coelectroporating a shRNA resistant human PALS1 expression vector, indicating that the defects were specific to Pals1 (Figure S4C).

Progenitors electroporated with Pals1 shRNA also showed defects in self-renewal as revealed by PH3 or transient BrdU labeling compared to control (Figures 4A–4J , arrow).

https://openalex.org/W2145806491,"Progressive decrease in neuronal function is an established feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide induces acute increase in spontaneous synaptic activity accompanied by neurotoxicity, and Abeta induces excitotoxic neuronal death by increasing calcium influx mediated by hyperactive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors. An in vivo study has revealed subpopulations of hyperactive neurons near Abeta plaques in mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be normalized by an AMPA receptor antagonist. In the present study, we aim to determine whether soluble Abeta acutely induces hyperactivity of AMPA receptors by a mechanism involving beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR). We found that the soluble Abeta binds to beta(2)AR, and the extracellular N terminus of beta(2)AR is critical for the binding. The binding is required to induce G-protein/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which controls PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 and beta(2)AR, and AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). beta(2)AR and GluR1 also form a complex comprising postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), PKA and its anchor AKAP150, and protein phosphotase 2A (PP2A). Both the third intracellular (i3) loop and C terminus of beta(2)AR are required for the beta(2)AR/AMPA receptor complex. Abeta acutely induces PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 in the complex without affecting the association between two receptors. The present study reveals that non-neurotransmitter Abeta has a binding capacity to beta(2)AR and induces PKA-dependent hyperactivity in AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2171370489,"Mammalian germ cells are derived from the pluripotent epiblast and share features with pluripotent stem cells, including the expression of key genes that regulate developmental potency. The core genes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog that regulate pluripotency in stem cells also perform important roles in regulating germ cell development and potentially in occurrence of germ line tumors in humans. Despite this, our understanding of the regulation of these genes during germ cell development remains limited. In this study we examine the regulation of pluripotency in the mouse fetal germ line. We show that male-specific methylation occurs in key functional elements of the Nanog and Sox2 promoters, and these genes are suppressed during early male germ cell differentiation. Furthermore, Oct4 translation is suppressed post-transcriptionally as germ cells differentiate down the male lineage and enter mitotic arrest. Combined, our data strongly support the conclusion that repression of the core machinery regulating pluripotency is a robust and early event involved in the differentiation of the male germ cell lineage. We hypothesize that active repression of pluripotency is required for fetal male germ cell differentiation and that failure of this mechanism may render germ cells susceptible to tumor formation."

Traumatic injury to the brain is a problem as old as humanity, but advances in cognitive neuroscience and a long-term view of the dynamic nature of the brain across the lifespan may change how the disorder is understood and treated. Trauma to the brain can change the core of a person's being—their thinking, memory, personality, and behavior. Although individuals who have suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI) may feel alone in their struggle to deal with the aftermath of injury, they actually join the ranks of those affected by one of the most common neurological diagnoses in the United States (Rutland-Brown et al., 2006Rutland-Brown W. Langlois J.A. Thomas K.E. Xi Y.L. J. Head Trauma Rehabil. 2006; 21: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). TBI affects every age group and segment of society. Recent combat-related activities have increased the incidence of TBI as well as piqued the attention of the public and elected representatives. Concussions suffered during sports activities have been a major issue for years and are only now receiving widespread coverage in the news media with high-profile cases. Undoubtedly, many more individuals have suffered brain injury than are diagnosed. Changes in society and advances in neuroscience make it worthwhile to re-examine the scope of the problem, neural mechanisms underlying the cognitive and behavioral deficits of this disorder, and approaches that can be taken to help individuals that have suffered from TBI heal. We highlight several major paradigm shifts that must occur for the field to advance. Although the injuries are acute, functional deficits from TBI may produce tremendous chronic burden on individuals, families, and health care systems. Acquired brain injuries have been a leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S., even before the current military conflicts, and a leading contributor to increasing health care costs. The most common and persistent deficits tend to be in cognitive functions. The abilities to pay attention, hold information in mind, organize, and develop efficient strategies for completing activities seem to be particularly vulnerable (McDowell et al., 1997McDowell S. Whyte J. D'Esposito M. Neuropsychologia. 1997; 35: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Collectively, these abilities are referred to as “executive” or “cognitive control” functions. Deficits in these functions may directly contribute to poor outcomes, affecting numerous aspects of personal functioning, such as the pursuit of educational and occupational goals. The far-reaching impact of these seemingly “invisible” deficits is often not recognized. For example, individuals who cannot pay attention, hold information in mind, and actively participate in learning activities will have reduced benefit from other rehabilitation efforts, such as those directed toward motor functions (Prigatano and Wong, 1999Prigatano G.P. Wong J.L. Arch. Phys. Med. Rehabil. 1999; 80: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Individuals who have suffered a TBI may also be at increased risk for developing cognitive changes later in life. For example, individuals who have suffered moderate or severe TBI may be at 2.3 and 4.5 times increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (Plassman et al., 2000Plassman B.L. Havlik R.J. Steffens D.C. Helms M.J. Newman T.N. Drosdick D. Phillips C. Gau B.A. Welsh-Bohmer K.A. Burke J.R. et al.Neurology. 2000; 55: 1158-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Risk may be increased for those with certain apolipoprotein E genotypes (Van Den Heuvel et al., 2007Van Den Heuvel C. Thornton E. Vink R. Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 161: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Professional athletes in sports where TBI is common (e.g., American football) may have a higher rate of memory problems and public press have highlighted traumatic pathology (Schwartz, 2009Schwartz A. New Sign of Brain Damage in N.F.L..in: New York Times, New York2009Google Scholar). What are the mechanisms by which TBI may contribute to worsened late-life cognitive functioning? Does TBI simply change an individual's cognitive baseline, thereby reducing the threshold at which detectable dementia later in life would occur, or does TBI actually alter the course and rate of age-related cognitive decline? The first possibility could be mediated by a relatively simple mechanism that is related to the concept of “cognitive reserve” (Kesler et al., 2003Kesler S.R. Adams H.F. Blasey C.M. Bigler E.D. Appl. Neuropsychol. 2003; 10: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In other words, if an individual's baseline functioning is “knocked down” a notch after a TBI, leaving a reduced reserve, then that person is more likely to fall below some “threshold” during the normal aging process, even if the rate of decline is unchanged. Could there be a more dynamic “cumulative” effect of TBI on the rate of cognitive decline? This would have even more fundamental implications. One must consider the dynamic nature of brain functioning, where development and learning versus aging and forgetting are constantly countering each other to determine an individual's current level of functioning. After a brain injury, an individual may not learn as quickly nor as effectively as he/she would have without the injury. Thus, if continued learning over our lifespan is required to maintain brain functioning during aging, what happens if learning is impaired by TBI? In this way, TBI could accelerate the rate of decline during aging. Even small, possibly undetectable “deficits” in cognitive functioning may have a magnified effect over the course of aging, as the effects of poor learning accumulate. There is no question that prevention of TBI is the best solution. However, preventive measures may not be fully effective, even in the fraction of circumstances when they are fully implemented. Nevertheless, improved prevention of acute injury may have an impact that extends forward in time far beyond the acute effects of injury. Research must have a long-term view that is directed not only at the early but also later effects of TBI. The effects of TBI on cognition are complex and have challenged clinicians throughout history, as well as deterred neuroscientists from pursuing studies in this “messy” area of inquiry. Understanding the brain systems that underlie the cognitive changes associated with TBI should help determine what to target in the rehabilitation of an individual with TBI. Although TBI may affect almost any aspect of brain functioning, effects on cognitive control functions appear to form a common core across many individuals. The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control is one of the most studied areas in cognitive neuroscience, yet advances have not been translated into the clinical realm. In brief, cognitive control is a term used to describe our ability to direct thought and action based on our goals and intentions, rather than being driven automatically by the environment that surrounds us. Current theories of cognitive control propose that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a critical brain region for this ability by providing top-down signals that modulate incoming sensory information as this information undergoes progressively more elaborative processing within association cortex for incorporation into our stream of consciousness (Mesulam, 2002Mesulam M.-M. Stuss D.T. Knight R.T. Principles of Frontal Lobe Function. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 8-31Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PFC is one of two zones of multimodal association cortex that exist in the brain with extensive projections to both cortical and subcortical regions (Petrides and Pandya, 2002Petrides M. Pandya D.N. Stuss D.T. Knight R.T. Principles of Frontal Lobe Function. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 31-50Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, the PFC is clearly in a privileged position to be one source of top-down signals that could sculpt behavior. Damage to frontal systems following TBI can be directed to cortex, such as with cerebral contusions, or mediated by axonal injury, presumably disrupting network interactions crucial for cognitive control. Interventions to enhance cognitive recovery after TBI have been limited, lacking a strong clinical evidence base as well as an informative neuroscientific basis. The path toward effective treatment may be aided by an approach that bridges cognitive neuroscience and clinical rehabilitation. Two broad types of approaches to interventions for cognitive dysfunction following TBI are possible: biological modulation of neural systems, such as via pharmacotherapy, and more specific modification of neural systems by cognitive training. We address interventions for chronic dysfunction, which has received little attention relative to acute care. There are a number of reasons to consider neuromodulator systems of the brain as therapeutic targets during TBI recovery. These include findings that TBI tends to affect cognitive functions dependent on these neuromodulators, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin, and the predilection for TBI to affect the cortical termination zones as well as the long projection fibers that carry these neuromodulators. A number of drugs that affect neuromodulator systems have been used in clinical practice for years. Although clinical evidence is slowly accumulating (reviewed in Warden et al., 2006Warden D.L. Gordon B. McAllister T.W. Silver J.M. Barth J.T. Bruns J. Drake A. Gentry T. Jagoda A. Katz D.I. et al.Neurobehavioral Guidelines Working GroupJ. Neurotrauma. 2006; 23: 1468-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the approach is generally empiric, with little information to guide a clinician's prescription of one drug or another for any given individual, leaving practice to be driven by trial and error. One particularly important question is thus the specificity of any given drug for any given cognitive function, context, or individual. More than 10 years ago, we demonstrated that a dopaminergic agonist could improve executive function in individuals with TBI, in a specific manner with few effects on other systems (McDowell et al., 1998McDowell S. Whyte J. D'Esposito M. Brain. 1998; 121: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Yet, to this day, no large-scale clinical trials have been performed to assess the efficacy of selective dopaminergic agonists in TBI, and the use of these drugs are not commonplace in clinical practice. Combining therapeutic trials with systems-specific measurements developed through neuroscience would be highly valuable. For example, it is now clear that a single dopaminergic agent can have different dose-response effects on different dopamine systems in the brain. Whether through public or private support, additional work with these approaches needs to be done to develop pharmacotherapy to enhance recovery after TBI. Pharmacotherapy and even novel neuroplasticity altering therapies such as stem cell treatments may change the biology of the brain. However, it cannot be assumed that mechanisms of plasticity affected by these interventions, ranging from changes in intracellular signaling, cellular proliferation, alterations of dendritic or axonal structures and more, will necessarily be beneficial. They could contribute to functional recovery or, just as likely, lead to aberrant growth, such as seen with tumors or epileptogenic foci. Ultimately, for any neuronal changes to beneficially affect neurological functioning, they must lead to functional changes in neuronal networks. Cognitive training provides a crucial set of methods to guide or sculpt plasticity to achieve functionally integrated networks and coherent behavioral output. As mentioned, training cognitive control functions in particular should be the target in TBI patients. These are functions that have far-reaching influence on almost any cognitive domain, serving an important role in controlling neural processes and behavior, including navigating through the challenges of learning and adaptation after injury. Thus, much more attention needs to be paid to rehabilitating these functions when they are disrupted by injury. However, effective cognitive training interventions for executive control functions are not widely available to TBI patients. Why not? One fundamental challenge has been to delineate the specific types of executive control processes that should be the targets of therapy and design therapies that effectively tap those targets. Although a full discussion of principles and controversies for training executive control is beyond the scope of this commentary (D'Esposito and Chen, 2006D'Esposito M. Chen A.J.-W. Prog. Brain Res. 2006; 157: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we would emphasize two approaches. First, aided by advances in cognitive neuroscience of executive control, any particular training approach should be designed to enhance neural mechanisms of executive control (top-down modulation, selective maintenance of goal-relevant information, or the functional integration of control networks toward goal attainment). Determination of these mechanisms will require adaptation of neurophysiologic methods, including brain imaging, to test the effects of interventions in patients. Second, cognitive training must lead to improvement in function in activities of everyday living. However, the ecologically significant role of control functions in the complex, low-structure settings of real life, where individuals typically experience difficulties, is too often not taken into account in cognitive training approaches. Computer-based “brain training games” that have staged a resurgence in interest recently, provide a timely example for considering the generalizability of cognitive training approaches. Would playing a number puzzle computer game be effective for training executive control in a manner that improves functioning in real life? In general, there has been little evidence to support transfer and generalization of benefits from practice on basic tasks, such as computer games, to improved functioning in real life situations (D'Esposito and Gazzaley, 2006D'Esposito M. Gazzaley A. Selzer M.E. Cohen L. Gage F.H. Clarke S. Duncan P.W. Neural Rehabilitation and Repair. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K.2006: 475-487Google Scholar). Real life is filled with multiple possible choices and numerous distractions (i.e., information or choices that are not relevant to a current goal). It is in the context of the complexities and ambiguities of daily life where many patients have the most difficulty, even if they perform perfectly well in a highly structured setting. Whether making lunch for your children for school or carrying out a task at work, to succeed individuals must be able to define the current goal, maintain that goal in mind, then guide attention and information processing, as well as choices and actions based on that goal. Failures in goal-directed self-control may occur at any step along the way. Thus, training in executive control must involve the encouragement of self-direction in the very situations where patients are most likely to get “lost” without external guidance. This type of training approach is very different from the highly structured “drill and practice” approach commonly implemented. As one example of a potential intervention target, if processes of selective information processing (often referred to as selective attention and working memory) influence the efficiency and effectiveness of subsequent goal management processes in complex situations, then training to improve selective processing could improve goal-direction of behavior in real life. Unfortunately, this type of approach that bridges the cognitive neuroscience of the neural systems of control and real life is rarely taken (see Levine et al., 2000Levine B. Robertson I.H. Clare L. Carter G. Hong J. Wilson B.A. Duncan J. Stuss D.T. J. Int. Neuropsychol. Soc. 2000; 6: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, for one example of this type of approach and for another viewpoint on these issues [Cicerone et al., 2006Cicerone K. Levin H. Malec J. Stuss D. Whyte J. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2006; 18: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar]). Improved measures of the effects and mechanisms of interventions are sorely needed. The lack of adequate measurements has limited intervention development. Measurement development needs to progress in two directions. First, biomarkers of the neural processes that mediate cognitive functions affected by TBI (and aging) would be valuable for determining mechanisms. The vast experience of cognitive neuroscience of cognitive control in healthy individuals can serve as a foundation for development of these biomarkers. Just as importantly, measurements that reflect cognitive functioning in ecologically relevant, real life contexts are needed. Unfortunately, most tests of cognitive functioning, including neuropsychological tests and most cognitive neuroscience measures, are not designed to reflect the complexities and low structure of settings in the “real world.” Quite the opposite, these tests are typically designed to isolate the processes of interest. This is like trying to judge how accurate a basketball player is at shooting foul shots using measurements of isolated biceps strength. On the other hand, the few functional assessment measures available tend to be quite removed from understanding the underlying neural-cognitive component processes affected by TBI. The field will make a major breakthrough when these two extremes are brought together to measure cognitive control processes in real world settings. Taking a long-term view on TBI in the context of the lifespan leads to a major challenge and paradigm shift for the field. Recognizing the importance of ongoing learning during injury recovery and aging, we need to move beyond limited cross-sectional comparisons toward longitudinal approaches. Only with an emphasis on follow-up measurements over time would it become apparent whether a treatment actually changes functioning in the course of aging. Which interventions not only provide “cognitive enhancement” in the short term, during treatment, but potentially improve ongoing learning? Can approaches be developed and tested not only for immediate effects but actual enhancement of learning, recovery, and/or maintenance over the long-term? Keeping in mind these questions would significantly alter the emphasis of research and intervention development, expanding the horizons for individuals with TBI.

Molecular dynamics simulations showed that, although the fewer water molecules in rhodopsin were relatively movable, the hydrogen bond network of the beta2-adrenergic receptor was fully loaded with water molecules that were surprisingly immobilized between the two rotamer switches, both apparently being in their closed conformation. Manipulations of the rotamer state of TyrVII:20 and TrpVI:13 demonstrated that these residues served as gates for the water molecules at the intracellular and extracellular ends of the hydrogen bond network, respectively. TrpVI:13 at the bottom of the main ligand-binding pocket was shown to apparently function as a catching trap for water molecules. Mutational analysis of the beta2-adrenergic receptor demonstrated that the highly conserved polar residues of the hydrogen bond network were all important for receptor signaling but served different functions, some dampening constitutive activity (AsnI:18, AspII:10, and AsnVII:13), whereas others (AsnVII:12 and AsnVII:16) located one helical turn apart and sharing a water molecule were shown to be essential for agonist-induced signaling. It is concluded that the conserved water hydrogen bond network of 7TM receptors constitutes an extended allosteric interface between the transmembrane segments being of crucial importance for receptor signaling and that part of the function of the rotamer micro-switches, TyrVII:20 and TrpVI:13, is to gate or trap the water molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2055656597,"Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of disability and death among young people. Although much is already known about secondary brain damage the full range of brain tissue responses to TBI remains to be elucidated. A population of neurons located in cerebral areas associated with higher cognitive functions harbours a vesicular zinc pool co-localized with glutamate. This zinc enriched pool of synaptic vesicles has been hypothesized to take part in the injurious signalling cascade that follows pathological conditions such as seizures, ischemia and traumatic brain injury. Pathological release of excess zinc ions from pre-synaptic vesicles has been suggested to mediate cell damage/death to postsynaptic neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to substantiate the influence of vesicular zinc ions on TBI, we designed a study in which damage and zinc movements were analysed in several different ways. Twenty-four hours after TBI ZnT3-KO mice (mice without vesicular zinc) were compared to littermate Wild Type (WT) mice (mice with vesicular zinc) with regard to histopathology. Furthermore, in order to evaluate a possible neuro-protective dimension of chemical blocking of vesicular zinc, we treated lesioned mice with either DEDTC or selenite. Our study revealed that chemical blocking of vesicular zinc ions, either by chelation with DEDTC or accumulation in zinc-selenium nanocrystals, worsened the effects on the aftermath of TBI in the WT mice by increasing the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells within the first 24 hours after TBI, when compared to those of chemically untreated WT mice. Conclusion/Significance ZnT3-KO mice revealed more damage after TBI compared to WT controls. Following treatment with DEDTC or selenium an increase in the number of both dead and apoptotic cells were seen in the controls within the first 24 hours after TBI while the degree of damage in the ZnT3-KO mice remained largely unchanged. Further analyses revealed that the damage development in the two mouse strains was almost identical after either zinc chelation or zinc complexion therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2154884830,"Disease-causing missense mutations in membrane proteins, such as rhodopsin mutations associated with the autosomal dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), are often linked to defects in folding and/or trafficking. The mechanical unfolding of wild-type rhodopsin was compared with that of 20 selected ADRP-linked mutants more or less defective in folding and retinal binding. Rhodopsin fold is characterized by networks of amino acids in the retinal and G-protein binding sites likely to play a role in the stability and function of the protein. The distribution of highly connected nodes in the network reflects the existence of a diffuse intramolecular communication inside and between the 2 poles of the helix bundle, which makes pathogenic mutations share similar phenotypes irrespective of topological and physicochemical differences between them. Because of this communication, the ADRP-linked rhodopsin mutations share a more or less marked ability to impair selected hubs in the protein structure network. The extent of this structural effect relates to the severity of the biochemical defect caused by mutation. The investigative strategy employed in this study is likely to apply to all structurally known membrane proteins particularly susceptible to misassembly-causing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1974788291,"Gaze direction modulates the gain of neurons in most of the visual cortex, including the primary visual (V1) area. These gain modulations are thought to support a mechanism involved in the spatial localization of objects. In the present study, we show that part of them may reflect an additional function: enhancing the visual processing of the objects located straight ahead. Using single- and multiunit recordings in behaving macaques, we found that in peripheral V1, the gain of most neurons increases as their receptive fields (RF) are brought closer to the straight-ahead direction by changing the direction of gaze. No such tendency was observed in central V1, although the influence of gaze direction is similar in term of strength. This previously unknown organization of the gaze-related gain modulations might insure that objects located straight ahead still receive a privileged processing during eccentric fixation, reflecting the ecological importance of this particular egocentric direction."

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12517-12522Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). DJ-1 encodes for a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein involved in multiple cellular processes including sperm maturation, fertilization, and oncogenesis. It may act as an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase, a redox-dependent chaperone, and a regulator of transcription and RNA metabolism (3Lesage S. Brice A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: R48-R59Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To study the effects of the lack of a functional gene, DJ-1 knock-out (KO) mice and flies were generated. Although they did not show death of DA neurons, increased vulnerabilities to neurotoxic agents were observed (8Goldberg M.S. Pisani A. Haburcak M. Vortherms T.A. Kitada T. Costa C. Tong Y.

Bernardi G. Shen J. Calabresi P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, embryonic stem cells deficient for DJ-1 expression and DA neurons derived from KO mice displayed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and proteasome inhibition (14Martinat C. Shendelman S. Jonason A. Leete T. Beal M.F. Yang L. Floss T. Abeliovich A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e327Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the chain of events that links the loss of functional DJ-1 to neuronal dysfunction is still unclear. The survival of developing and post-natal DA neurons is supported by neurotrophic factors, such as the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (15Lin L.F. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F. Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar). Endogenous neurotrophins regulate natural cell death during development and maintain target innervations and cell survival during postnatal life. Declining production of a neurotrophic factor or impaired signal transduction in aging neurons may contribute to neurodegeneration in selected brain areas (16Mattson M.P. Magnus T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 278-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). GDNF is a member of the GDNF family of neurotrophic factors that signals through a two-component receptor complex consisting of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked GDNF family receptor α and the RET receptor-tyrosine kinase, previously identified as a proto-oncogene (17Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). RET is strongly expressed both at the mRNA and protein levels in adult mesencephalic DA neurons (18Nosrat C.A. Tomac A. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Exp. Brain Res. 1997; 115: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Kramer E.R. Aron L. Ramakers G.M. Seitz S. Zhuang X. Beyer K. Smidt M.P. Klein R. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e39Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DA neuron-specific ablation of RET in conditional KO mice caused progressive and adult-onset loss of DA neurons, degeneration of DA nerve terminals in the striatum, and pronounced glial activation (19Kramer E.R. Aron L. Ramakers G.M. Seitz S. Zhuang X. Beyer K. Smidt M.P. Klein R. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e39Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, loss of RET expression in DA neurons generates PD-like dysfunctions in mouse models, thus indicating its crucial role in mesencephalic DA cell survival. Here we show that DJ-1 has an essential role in the regulation of RET expression levels in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. The inducible loss of DJ-1 triggers the generation of a hypoxic state and the accumulation of free radical species that stabilize the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1a). This is required for the down-regulation of RET expression. This study establishes for the first time a molecular link between the loss of functional DJ-1 and the GDNF signaling pathway that may explain the adult-onset loss of DA neurons. Furthermore, it highlights a possible role for hypoxia in PD pathogenesis. Expression vectors encoding for pcDNA3-FLAG and pcDNA3–2×FLAG-DJ-1 wild type and L166P were previously described (20Zucchelli S. Vilotti S. Calligaris R. Lavina Z.S. Biagioli M. Foti R. De Maso L. Pinto M. Gorza M. Speretta E. Casseler C. Tell G. Del Sal G. Gustincich S. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-FLAG-DJ-1 C106A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pDsRed2-N1 was kindly provided by Professor A. Mallamaci (SISSA, Trieste, Italy). pSUPERIOR and pcDNA6-TetR vectors were obtained from Invitrogen. Two different oligonucleotide sequences were selected for the silencing of DJ-1 expression using small interfering RNA Target Finder software (Invitrogen). The hairpin-encoding oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSuperior vector (Invitrogen). The following oligonucleotide sequences were used: siDJ-1#1 (5′-GGTCATTACACCTACTCTG-3′), siDJ-1#2 (5′-TGGAGACGGTCATCCCTGT-3′), scramble (5′-TGGAGACGGAGATCCCTGT-3′). Two small interfering RNA duplexes were used for silencing HIF-1a expression: siHIF1a#1 (forward, 5′-CUGAUGACCAGCAACUUGAdTdT-3′, reverse 5′-UCAAGUUGCUGGUCAUCAGdTdT-3′) as described in Elvidge et al. (21Elvidge G.P. Glenny L. Appelhoff R.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Ragoussis J. Gleadle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15215-15226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and siHIF-1a#2 (forward 5′-CCAUAUAGAGAUACUCAAAdTdT-3′, reverse 5′-UUUGAGUAUCUCUAUAUGGdTdG-3′) (22Guo S. Miyake M. Liu K.J. Shi H. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen). siCONTROL RISC-Free small interfering RNA was purchased from Dharmacon. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC) were maintained in culture as suggested by vendors. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For preparation of SH-SY5Y-inducible cell lines, first we generated the acceptor cells by transfection of pcDNA6-TetR and selection with Blasticidin (3 μg/ml) (InvivoGen). Individual clones were confirmed by Western blot analysis for tetracycline repressor (TetR) protein level. We then generated SH-SY5Y-inducible stable cell lines by transfecting linearized pSuperior containing interference oligonucleotides against DJ-1 and selecting for positive clones in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and 3 μg/ml Blasticidin (InvivoGen). Individual clones were confirmed by Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Silencing induction was performed by adding 2.5 μg/ml doxycycline hyclate (Sigma) every 48 h for 10 days. For HIF-1a silencing, cells were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Single-strand cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of purified RNA using the iSCRIPT™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and iCycler IQ Real time PCR System (Bio-Rad). Expression of DJ-1, RET, CDC42, GRM8, FLNA, CAMK2B, and ITGB1 was analyzed using specific oligonucleotides (supplemental information). Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was checked using a bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100; Agilent Technologies), and RNA quantity was measured with ND-1000 Nanodrop spectrophotometer. 10 μg of RNA sample was used for microarray analysis on Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133A 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix). Data processing was performed in the R computing environment using packages from the BioConductor software project. Robust multi-array average (RMA) normalization was applied (23Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8516) Google Scholar). Normalized data were then filtered based on the Affymetrix detection call so that only probes that had a Present call in at least one of the arrays were retained. Data were then imported in the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) software (24Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M. Sturn A. Snuffin M.

Biotechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (4021) Google Scholar), and statistical analysis was performed with the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) module (25Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar) to detect significantly differentially expressed genes. Microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE17204. Differentially expressed genes were then specifically examined based on their Gene Ontology annotation (26Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M. Sherlock G. Nat.

Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biology. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot. The following antibodies were used: anti-DJ-1 1:1000 (20Zucchelli S. Vilotti S. Calligaris R. Lavina Z.S. Biagioli M. Foti R. De Maso L. Pinto M. Gorza M. Speretta E. Casseler C. Tell G. Del Sal G. Gustincich S. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and anti-DJ-1 1:1000 (Stressgen), anti-FLAG 1:2000 (Sigma), anti-RET 1:400 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HIF-1a 1:400 (Santa Cruz), anti-β-actin 1:5000 (Sigma), and anti-TetR 1:1000 (Sigma). For development, anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anti-rabbit HRP (Dako) were used in combination with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare). For immunofluorescence experiments, SH-SY5Y cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed following standard protocols (20Zucchelli S. Vilotti S. Calligaris R. Lavina Z.S. Biagioli M. Foti R. De Maso L. Pinto M. Gorza M. Speretta E. Casseler C. Tell G. Del Sal G. Gustincich S. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We used anti-DJ-1 1:100 (purified from immunized rabbits) and anti-DJ-1 1:100 (Stressgen), anti-Hypoxyprobe™-1 antibody 1:600 (Chemicon International Corp.), and anti-FLAG 1:1000 (Sigma). For detection, Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (Invitrogen)-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were used. Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 ng/ml). All images were collected using a confocal microscope (LEICA TCS SP2). For analysis, ImageJ and Leica Confocal Software (LCS) software were used. Cellular hypoxia was assessed using Hypoxyprobe-1 solution (Hypoxyprobe™-1 Plus, Chemicon). Hypoxyprobe-1 is an exogenous nitroaromatic compound that is metabolized in a stepwise reduction pathway by cellular nitro-reductase enzymes that are able to use the nitroaromatic compounds as alternative electron acceptors in conditions of low physiological pO2. The consequent fragmentation of the imidazole ring leads to formation of chemical adducts with several macromolecular components of cells that can be detected by a specific antibody. In our experiments cell medium was supplemented with Hypoxyprobe solution (20 μm) for 2 h before detection. Immunofluorescence was then performed with anti- Hypoxyprobe™-1 antibody (Chemicon) 1:600. Scramble clones and siDJ-1s clones were grown in a 35-mm2 dish to 80% confluency and treated with doxycycline (2.5 μg/ml) for 10 days. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by trypsinization, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A (0.25 mg/ml), and stained with propidium iodide (0.02 mg/ml). Samples were further analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan. Data were analyzed by the BD CellQuest Software. Dihydroethidium (DHE) was used as a specific dye for O2⨪ detection (28Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 10 μm DHE for 20 min in serum-free medium. Dye-loaded cells were washed, mounted, and examined under confocal microscope. All experiments were repeated in triplicate or more. Data represent the mean ± S.E. When necessary, each group was compared individually with reference control group using Student's t test (Microsoft Excel software). To mimic the loss-of-function effects as seen in PD patients with DJ-1 mutations, we used siDJ-1 constructs to inhibit the synthesis of endogenous DJ-1 in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Several attempts of constitutive expression of very efficient siDJ-1s failed for the positive selection of cells that maintained a low but relevant amount of endogenous DJ-1 protein. Therefore, we decided to take advantage of an inducible interference (RNAi) approach in which the expression of the interfering sequence is controlled by the TetR system upon incubation with doxycycline (Doxy). This system allows the selection of stable clones before RNAi induction. To control off-target effects, we used two different RNAi molecules; that is, a first sequence (siDJ-1#1) targeting a region in the 3′-untranslated region of human DJ-1 mRNA and a second sequence (siDJ-1#2) mapping to the second exon. This last sequence was previously demonstrated to partially down-regulate DJ-1 expression when used in transient transfection experiments (29Taira T. Saito Y. Niki T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Takahashi K. Ariga H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). As an additional control, we established inducible cell lines with a random sequence (scramble). For each of the cell lines we selected 24 single clones that were screened for Doxy-inducible down-regulation of DJ-1 expression level by qPCR. To exclude clonal effects, two independent clones for each cell line with maximum RNAi effect were selected and further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1A, siDJ-1#1 caused a profound decrease in DJ-1 mRNA level, achieving a >90% silencing as compared with scramble controls (clones a and b). These results were consistent in the two independent clones A and B. siDJ-1#2 proved to be only partially effective, as previously published (29Taira T. Saito Y. Niki T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Takahashi K. Ariga H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), with a 50% reduction in DJ-1 levels. Only one clone was obtained during the selection process for siDJ-1#2, as most of the clones did not show any variation in endogenous DJ-1 content (data not shown). Additional controls for the efficacy of DJ-1 interference were performed using parental SH-SY5Y cells with similar results (data not shown). To monitor the kinetics of silencing, we measured DJ-1 mRNA levels by qPCR at 3, 6, and 10 days after Doxy induction. A 90% reduction in the amount of DJ-1 mRNA was already present after 3 days of Doxy, and it persists till the tenth day (data not shown). To assess the effects of DJ-1 mRNA silencing on the levels of DJ-1 protein, we monitored the down-regulation of DJ-1 by Western blot analysis. Scramble clones were used as controls. We found that the amount of residual DJ-1 protein was reduced to almost undetectable levels (>90% reduction) after 10 days of Doxy treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). Kinetic experiments showed that DJ-1 protein started to decrease at 6 days (70%) (data not shown), and 90% was knocked down after 10 days. As expected from qPCR data, siDJ-1#2 could reduce DJ-1 protein levels to only 50% (Fig. 1, B and C). When comparing DJ-1 mRNA levels in un-induced and -induced siDJ-1#1, clones, we observed a partial leakage of Tet promoter activity in Doxy-untreated cells. The effect was much milder at the protein level (Fig. 1C). For consistency, all our experiments were carried out comparing DJ-1-interfered clones and scramble controls after 10 days of induction. In summary, we have obtained a human neuroblastoma cell model to study the effects of DJ-1 loss in vitro. To unveil the pathways altered after DJ-1 loss, we performed gene expression profiling on siDJ-1#1 clones displaying the maximum level of interference (clones A and B). Two scramble clones (clones a and b) were used as controls. Samples were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays. Data obtained from two independent experiments for each line were collected and analyzed. To ensure that changes warranted further study, statistical analysis was performed with SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays (25Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar)). Applying a false discovery rate of 10% and a 2-fold-change cutoff, we found 166 genes that were differentially regulated in both siDJ-1#1 clones versus the two scramble ones, with 102 down-regulated and 64 up-regulated transcripts. By Gene Ontology analysis, we clustered the differentially regulated genes to signal transduction, cell motility, developmental processes, cell adhesion, synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, and regulation of transcription. All the genes that were identified with a false discovery rate of 10% are shown in supplemental Table S1. Fully stringent analysis (false discovery rate of 0%) was then applied, obtaining a list of 10 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated genes in DJ-1 RNAi cells (Table 1). As expected, DJ-1 was the most down-regulated gene.TABLE 1Affymetrix gene chip analysisGene nameGene symbol-Fold changeGlutamate receptor, metabotropic 8GRM86.08Cell division cycle 42 (GTP-binding protein, 25 kDa)CDC424.40Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIβCAMK2B4.05Latrophilin 3LPHN33.84AP2-associated kinase 1AAK13.49Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2PTBP22.95Plakophilin 4PKP42.44PDZ and LIM domain 3PDLIM32.18Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 1EIF2AK11.97Chromosome 8 open reading frame 33C8orf331.60Electron-transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenaseETFDH−1.45v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog F (avian)MAFF−1.48Dedicator of cytokinesis 9DOCK9−1.52Protocadherin α12PCDHA12−1.58Integrin-α FG-GAP repeat containing 1ITFG1−1.60Chromosome 5 open reading frame 15C5orf15−1.71ST3 β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase 6ST3GAL6−1.73Mitofusin 1MFN1−1.74Septin 6SEPT6−1.83RAB21, member RAS oncogene familyRAB21−1.94Calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2CALCOCO2−2.01PDZ and LIM domain 5PDLIM5−2.08Integrin β1ITGB1−2.24Filamin Aα (actin-binding protein 280)FLNA−2.72RET proto-oncogeneRET−3.60Parkinson disease (autosomal recessive, early onset) 7/DJ-1PARK7/DJ-1−7.42 Open table in a new tab To validate microarray data, we performed qPCR analysis on the top-three most up-regulated (GRM8, CDC42, CAMK2B) and down-regulated (ITGB1, FLNA, RET) genes. Changes in gene expression revealed by Affymetrix profiling were all confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (GRM8) was up-regulated more than 15-fold compared with scramble clones, whereas a 7-fold induction was observed for the GTPase CDC42 and 2-fold for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CAMK2B). A 2-fold reduction was indeed confirmed for integrin-β1 (ITGB1) and filamin A (FLNA). Importantly, a 9-fold decrease in mRNA expression was measured for RET. Because conditional genetic ablation of RET in DA neurons provokes PD-like dysfunctions and its ligand GDNF is a well known neurotrophic factor for DA cells, we decided to focus our attention on the effects of DJ-1 loss on RET expression. To ascertain the specificity of DJ-1-mediated RET down-regulation and to monitor the role of DJ-1 dosage, we analyzed RET mRNA levels in siDJ-1#2 clone (Fig. 3A). A strong down-regulation of RET expression (6-fold) was confirmed in this independent siDJ-1 clone, thus excluding any off-target effects of sequence siDJ-1#1. Interestingly, we found that RET down-regulation was titrated with DJ-1 levels, further suggesting a causal relationship between DJ-1 and RET expression. By Western blot analysis, RET protein resulted strongly reduced by loss of DJ-1 (>90% decrease) as shown by the almost complete disappearance of RET-specific immunostaining (Fig. 3, B and C). Compatible with a partial reduction of RET mRNA as measured with qPCR, RET protein levels in siDJ-1#2 clone were lowered, although to a lesser extent (∼60%). To further confirm the specificity of DJ-1-mediated effects on RET expression, we performed rescue experiments in siDJ-1#1 clones. Scramble clones were used as controls. Because the siDJ-1#1 sequence was designed on the 3′-non-coding untranslated region, experiments were carried out with 2×FLAG-DJ-1 construct that contained only the open reading frame. The reintroduction of DJ-1 wild type (wt) protein restored the large majority of RET expression in siDJ-1#1 clones (80% of wt) (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the effect of ectopic DJ-1 expression was also seen in scramble clones, where increased DJ-1 dosage further enhanced endogenous RET protein levels. Altogether, our results demonstrate that loss of DJ-1 decreases the expression of RET, the co-receptor for GDNF, in human neuroblastoma cells. The HIF-1a has been previously associated to a decrease in RET mRNA levels, thus representing a good candidate transcription factor for mediating the effects of DJ-1 loss (21Elvidge G.P. Glenny L. Appelhoff R.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Ragoussis J. Gleadle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15215-15226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Because we did not detect any differences in HIF-1a transcripts by microarray analysis, we measured HIF-1a expression by Western blot. A specific up-regulation of HIF-1a protein levels was found in siDJ-1#1 as compared with scramble clones (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, HIF-1a protein was stabilized concomitantly to RET down-regulation in both siDJ-1#1 clones (Fig. 4A). As a further support to HIF-1a protein stabilization in siDJ-1#1 cells, we found that some established HIF-1a target genes, like vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and adrenomedullin (ADM), were up-regulated by DJ-1 loss (supplemental Table S1). To verify whether HIF-1a and RET protein levels were sensitive to hypoxia in this in vitro system, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with the hypoxia-mimic cobalt chloride (CoCl2) for 6, 12, and 24 h. After 6 h of treatment, HIF-1a was strongly stabilized, whereas RET protein levels were reduced. After 24 h of treatment, RET protein was almost completely undetectable (Fig. 4B). To prove that the mechanism of RET down-regulation was strictly dependent on the stabilization of HIF-1a, we performed transient knockdown experiments for HIF-1a. Wild type SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siHIF-1a#1 and siHIF-1a#2 as well as with siRISC-FREE and water (mock) controls and treated with CoCl2 for 24 h. RET and HIF-1a protein levels were then monitored by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4C, RET protein levels were consistently increased by HIF-1a silencing compared with controls in"
https://openalex.org/W2128049814,"Mammalian mitochondrial cytochrome c interacts with cardiolipin to form a complex (cyt. c/CL) important in apoptosis. Here we show that this interaction leads to structural changes in ferrocytochrome c that leads to an open coordinate site on the central iron, resulting from the dissociation of the intrinsic methionine residue, where NO can rapidly bind (k = 1.2 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1)). Accompanying NO binding, the proximal histidine dissociates leaving the heme pentacoordinate, in contrast to the hexacoordinate nitrosyl adducts of native ferrocytochrome c or of the protein in which the coordinating methionine is removed by chemical modification or mutation. We present the results of stopped-flow and photolysis experiments that show that following initial NO binding to the heme, there ensues an unusually complex set of kinetic steps. The spectral changes associated with these kinetic transitions, together with their dependence on NO concentration, have been determined and lead us to conclude that NO binding to cyt. c/CL takes place via an overall scheme comparable to that described for cytochrome c' and guanylate cyclase, the final product being one in which NO resides on the proximal side of the heme. In addition, novel features not observed before in other heme proteins forming pentacoordinate nitrosyl species, include a high yield of NO escape after dissociation, rapid (<1 ms) dissociation of proximal histidine upon NO binding and its very fast binding (60 ps) after NO dissociation, and the formation of a hexacoordinate intermediate. These features all point at a remarkable mobility of the proximal heme environment induced by cardiolipin."
https://openalex.org/W2168851226,"Axonal and dendritic arbors can be characterized statistically by their spatial density function, a function that specifies the probability of finding a branch of a particular arbor at each point in a neural circuit. Based on an analysis of over a thousand arbors from many neuron types in various species, we have discovered an unexpected simplicity in arbor structure: all of the arbors we have examined, both axonal and dendritic, can be described by a Gaussian density function truncated at about two standard deviations. Because all arbors are characterized by density functions with this single functional form, only four parameters are required to specify an arbor's size and shape: the total length of its branches and the standard deviations of the Gaussian in three orthogonal directions. This simplicity in arbor structure can have implications for the developmental wiring of neural circuits."

Here, using co-precipitation and proteomic methods, we find that Rac1b does not bind to many common regulators of Rho family GTPases but that it does display enhanced binding to SmgGDS, RACK1, and p120 catenin (p120ctn), proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion, motility, and transcriptional regulation. We use molecular modeling and structure analysis approaches to determine that the interaction between Rac1b and p120ctn is dependent upon protein regions that are predicted to be unstructured in the absence of molecular complex formation, suggesting that the interaction between these two proteins involves coupled folding and binding. We also find that directed cell movement initiated by Rac1b is dependent upon p120. These results define a distinct binding functionality of Rac1b and provide insight into how the distinct phenotypic program activated by this protein may be implemented through molecular recognition of effectors distinct from those of Rac1.

The Ras superfamily of small GTPases mediates numerous biological functions through specific binding to a plethora of effector proteins when associated with GTP. The function of the small GTPases in diverse cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, transcription, vesicle transport, and cytokinesis, is carefully regulated by regulator proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 2The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGDSGDP dissociation stimulatorGAPGTPase-activating proteinaaamino acid(s)YFPyellow fluorescent proteinYFP-19aaYFP fused to the 19-aa insertionGSTglutathione S-transferaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateshRNAshort hairpin RNAMS/MStandem mass spectrometry. GDP dissociation stimulators (GDSs), and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Rac1b is a splice isoform of Rac1 that results from the inclusion of exon 3b, which contains 57 nucleotides and which leads to a 19-amino acid in-frame insertion (1Jordan P. Brazåo R. Boavida M.G. Gespach C. Chastre E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6835-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Rac1b was first identified in human skin and epithelial tissue of the intestinal tract and has been found to be up-regulated in malignant colorectal (1Jordan P. Brazåo R. Boavida M.G. Gespach C. Chastre E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6835-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and breast cancer (2Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). When assessed in cultured cells, Rac1b has been found to have many of the properties of GTPase-defective Rac1 mutants. For example, exogenously expressed Rac1b promotes density- and anchorage-independent cell growth of NIH 3T3 cells (3Singh A. Karnoub A.E. Palmby T.R. Lengyel E. Sondek J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9369-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), cell survival and cell cycle progression in mouse fibroblasts (4Matos P. Jordan P. Exp.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2469-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, Rac1b also shows distinct activities from Rac1. Unlike Rac1, Rac1b does not promote cadherin-dependent disassembly of adherens junctions in keratinocytes (6Lozano E. Frasa M.A. Smolarczyk K. Knaus U.G. Braga V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it does not induce cytoskeletal rearrangements in colorectal cancer cells as effectively as GTPase-defective mutants of Rac1 (3Singh A. Karnoub A.E. Palmby T.R. Lengyel E. Sondek J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9369-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and it is not as effective as Rac1 for activation of RelB (7Matos P. Jordan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13724-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac1b has distinct positive activities, because expression of Rac1b has been shown to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and genomic instability in mouse mammary epithelial cells exposed to MMP3 (matrix metalloproteinase 3) (8Radisky D.C.

These results suggest that Rac1b is capable of acting through pathways quite distinct from those controlled by Rac1. guanine nucleotide exchange factor GDP dissociation stimulator GTPase-activating protein amino acid(s) yellow fluorescent protein YFP fused to the 19-aa insertion glutathione S-transferase guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate short hairpin RNA tandem mass spectrometry. Structural studies of Rac1b have revealed that the 19-aa insertion confers greatly increased mobility on the switch regions. In crystal structures of Rac1b bound to either GDP or a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, not only was the insertion not visible in electron density, but the adjacent switch 2 was disordered as well (12Fiegen D. Haeusler L.C. Blumenstein L. Herbrand U. Dvorsky R. Vetter I.R. Ahmadian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4743-4749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, switch 1 residues, although stabilized in an open conformation by crystal packing interactions, exhibited increased B-factors also suggestive of structural destabilization and increased flexibility (12Fiegen D.

Biochemical studies have shown that the 19-aa insertion into Rac1b confers accelerated GDP/GTP exchange and impaired GTP hydrolysis, explained by the loss of stabilizing structural elements near the GTP-hydrolyzing active site (12Fiegen D.

These impairments in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis result in the predominance of the GTP-bound form in the cellular context, leading to extended signaling activity (12Fiegen D. Haeusler L.C.

Because Rac1b is capable of binding with reduced affinity to several Rac1 regulators and effectors (4Matos P. Jordan P. Exp.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50442-50448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), previous studies have focused on the physiological consequences mediated by Rac1b through its interaction with a subset of Rac1 binding partners. We hypothesized that the 19-aa insertion and its influence on the conformation and dynamics of the switch regions might confer upon Rac1b the ability to interact with a unique set of binding partners. Here, we report our findings that Rac1b shows markedly different interactions from Rac1 with a variety of regulator and effector proteins and that these interactions are mediated at least in part via interactions with the 19-amino acid insertion. We propose that the 19-amino acid insertion and adjacent switch regions are natively unstructured or sample a multiplicity of conformations in Rac1b but undergo disorder-to-order transition in the molecular recognition of several unique binding partners, distinct from those of Rac1. Such unique interactions may be responsible for the distinct physiological effects of Rac1b, including promotion of malignancy and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Murine mammary epithelial (SCp2) cells were cultured as described previously (8Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L. Albertson D.G. Nieto M.A. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in plastic tissue culture dishes for biochemical analyses and on acid-washed coverslips for fluorescence microscopy. Monoclonal pan-p120ctn and anti-RACK1 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-GIT1, -PAK, and -RhoGDI antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-SmgGDS antibodies were a gift from Dr. C. Williams (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). Polyclonal anti-YFP antibodies were from Invitrogen, and horseradish peroxidase-tagged anti-GST antibodies were from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Secondary goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were from Tago, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). ProLong antifade reagent was from Invitrogen, and glutathione-agarose beads, GDP, and GTPγS were from Sigma. Gene knockdown was performed using Mission shRNA as described previously (14Hirai Y. Bissell M.J. Radisky D.C. Blood. 2007; 110 (author reply 3082–3083): 3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar); p120ctn targeting constructs were as follows: MC41, NM_007615.1–1572s1c1; MC42, NM_007615.1–2284s1c1; MC43, NM_007615.1–2545s1c1; MC44, NM_007615.1–3996s1c1; MC45, NM_007615.1–985s1c1. Rac1b quantitation and cell area were calculated as described previously (9Nelson C.M. Khauv D. Bissell M.J. Radisky D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 105: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For the formation of GST-tagged Rac1, Rac1V12, Rac1N17, and Rac1b DNA constructs, the corresponding DNAs in YFP expression vectors (8Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M.

For the formation of His-tagged Rac1, Rac1V12, Rac1N17, and Rac1b DNA constructs, YFP-tagged Rac1, Rac1V12, Rac1N17, and Rac1b were cut and cloned into pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. To generate the 19-amino acid insertion fragment of Rac1b in GST tag and YFP fusion vectors, a DNA sequence coding for the 19-aa insertion was cloned into pGEX 4T-1 vector using the BamHI restriction site and cloned into pYFP-C1 vector (Invitrogen) using EcoRI, BamHI sites. All constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing of the plasmids. p120-GST expression constructs were described previously (15Yanagisawa M. Huveldt D. Kreinest P. Lohse C.M. Cheville J.C.

Transfection of SCp2 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were used for biochemical experiments or fluorescence microscopy. The mass spectrometry analysis was essentially done as previously described (17Dächsel J.C. Taylor J.P. Mok S.S. Ross O.A. Hinkle K.M. Bailey R.M. Hines J.H. Szutu J. Madden B. Petrucelli L.

Briefly, the protein SDS-polyacrylamide gel was silver-stained using the SilverSNAP stain for mass spectrometry kit (Pierce). Subsequently, the silver-stained gel bands were excised, destained, reduced, and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested for 4 h with 0.6 μg of trypsin (Promega) in digestion buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.0002% Zwittergent 3-16, at 37 °C), followed by peptide extraction with 60 μl of 2% trifluoroacetic acid and then 60 μl of acetonitrile. Pooled extracts were concentrated and then brought up in 0.1% formic acid for protein identification by nano-flow liquid chromatography MS/MS analysis using a ThermoFinnigan LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Bremen) coupled to an Eksigent nano-flow liquid chromatography two-dimensional HPLC system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA). The MS/MS raw data were converted to DTA files using ThermoElectron Bioworks 3.2 and correlated to theoretical fragmentation patterns of tryptic peptide sequences from the Swiss-Prot data base using both SEQUESTTM2 (ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA) and the MascotTM3 (Matrix Sciences, London, UK) search algorithms running on a 10-node cluster (the Swiss-Prot data base was downloaded on May 21, 2006, and 212,425 sequences/77,942,645 residues were actually searched for experiments that identified GIT1, SmgGDS, RhoGDI, and IQGAP1; the Swiss-Prot data base was downloaded on January 9, 2007, and 252,616 sequences/92,372,123 residues were actually searched for experiments that identified p210ctn and RACK1). All searches were conducted with fixed cysteine modifications of +57 for carboxamidomethyl cysteines and variable modifications allowing +16 with methionines for methione sulfoxide and +42 for protein N-terminal acetylation. The search was restricted to trypsin-generated peptides, allowing for two missed cleavages, and was restricted to mice. Peptide mass search tolerances were set to 20 ppm, and fragment mass tolerances were set to ±0.8 Da. Protein identifications were considered when Mascot search results gave at least two unique consensus peptides, each with peptide probability scores at or exceeding the 95% probability cut-off, which was 29 for these searches, and ranking as the number one match for the respective MS/MS spectra. The MS/MS spectra from all of the Mascot-identified peptides were inspected manually for spectrum quality and fragment matching. Matches to poor quality spectra or spectra with numerous unmatched ions were not included. The mass spectrometry analysis was done at the Mayo Proteomics Research center (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN). Protein identification data, including accession, number of unique sequences identified, and percentage of sequence coverage are presented in Table 1; a complete list of identified peptides is presented in supplemental Table 1.TABLE 1Protein identification dataTargetAccessionNumber of unique sequences identifiedSequence coverage%GIT1Q68FF61530SmgGDSP523061122RhoGDIQ99PT11146p120ctnP3099979RACK1P68040623IQGAP1Q9JKF15140 Open table in a new tab Cells were cultured for 24 h, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. After fixation, the cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton, and stained with pan-p120 antibody according to immunostaining protocols described previously (18Orlichenko L. Huang B. Krueger E. McNiven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4570-4579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope with a ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture lens. Immunoprecipitations of YFP-Rac1 fusion proteins were performed using magnetic Dynabeads according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins was done as previously described (18Orlichenko L. Huang B. Krueger E. McNiven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4570-4579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in an SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Electrophoresis was performed in 10% acrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar), transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J.

Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5911) Google Scholar) were as described. Immunodetection of bound antibodies on nitrocellulose membrane was performed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mass spectrometry analysis of protein bands excised from the silver-stained gels was performed as described previously (17Dächsel J.C. Taylor J.P. Mok S.S. Ross O.A. Hinkle K.M. Bailey R.M.

For GST pull-downs, GST-Rac1, -Rac1V12, -Rac1N17, -19 aa of Rac1b, and -Rac1b or GST-p120ctn in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli were plated in 2 ml of 2× YT medium for overnight growth. The next day, the 2-ml cultures were diluted in 500 ml of 2× YT medium and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. After that, expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by 40 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and bacteria were allowed to grow for another 2 h. Purification of fusion proteins was done using the B-PER GST fusion protein purification kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following purification, GST-Rac1, -Rac1V12, -Rac1N17, -Rac1b, and -19 aa of Rac1b fusion proteins were incubated for 1 h with glutathione-agarose beads, thoroughly washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with murine mammary epithelial SCp2 cell lysate for protein binding. For GST-p120ctn pull-downs, GST-p120ctn proteins attached to the glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with cell lysate from SCp2 cells transfected with YFP-Rac1, -Rac1V12, -Rac1N17, -Rac1b, and -19 aa of Rac1b fusion constructs. Purification of His-tagged fusion proteins from BL21 (DE3) E. coli was performed using the B-PER His6 fusion protein purification kit from Pierce. Direct binding of His-tagged Rac1 and Rac1b to the GST-tagged short isoform of p120ctn-4A was done as recently described (14Hirai Y. Bissell M.J. Radisky D.C. Blood. 2007; 110 (author reply 3082–3083): 3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 80 μl of nickel affinity Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was added to purified His-tagged Rac1, Rac1V12, Rac1N17, and Rac1b. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the gel was washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) and then two times with GDP/GTP binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). After that, the gel was mixed with 500 μm GDP or GTPγS in 1 ml of GDP binding buffer and rotated for 30 min following three washes with GDP/GTP binding buffer. GDP- or GTPγS-bound His-Rac1s were then eluted from the nickel-agarose gel using 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol), diluted 25 times with protein binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), and added to GST-p120ctn-agarose beads in protein binding buffer for direct protein binding assay. Biochemical GDP/GTP exchange assay was done using the RhoGEF exchange assay Biochem kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assay kinetic reactions were performed in 96-well plates at 22–25 °C on a BioTek fluorometer, and data were analyzed using Gen5 software (BioTek Instruments Inc.). Disorder propensity sum plots were generated with GlobPlot (version 2.3; Biocomputing Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (available on the World Wide Web)) (22Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Structure. 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), using Russell/Linding propensities and default parameters, for the amino acid sequences of human p120ctn isoform 1AB (Swiss-Prot entry O60716-2) and mouse Rac1b (NCBI Entrez Protein entry EDL19046). A homology model for mouse p120ctn (Swiss-Prot entry P30999) was generated using Swiss-Model software (Biozentrum Basel/Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) (23Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar) via the EXPASY Web server (24Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6033) Google Scholar), using the First Approach mode and default parameters. The template (the ARM (armadillo) domain of plakophilin 1; Protein Data Bank entry 1XM9 chain A) and the modeled residue range (residues 368–830) were selected automatically by the software. The sequence alignment of p120ctn with plakophilin 1 was visually inspected to confirm alignment of conserved residues that define the ARM consensus motif (25Choi H.J. Weis W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but no manual editing was necessary. Figs. 1 and 8B were generated using PyMOL (version 1.00; DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA). Structure coordinates are from Protein Data Bank entries for Rac1-GDP bound to arfaptin (1I4L), Rac1-GPPNP (1MH1), Rac1b-GDP (1RYF), and Rac1b-GPPNP (1RYH). We previously found that Rac1b could induce breakdown of cell-cell adhesion and increased cell motility in SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells (8Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L. Albertson D.G. Nieto M.A. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In order to compare and identify differences in Rac1 and Rac1b protein complexes, we performed two complementary proteomic screens. In the first, we expressed Rac1b, wild type Rac1, and constitutive active mutant Rac1V12 as YFP fusion proteins so as to produce within the cell context sufficient protein to bind to all available partners. YFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated, and protein complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver stain. We found that Rac1 and Rac1b co-immunoprecipitate with distinct interacting proteins (Fig. 1A). These bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to mass spectrometry for protein identification. GIT-1, RhoGDI, and IQGAP, were specifically identified in the Rac1 purifications (Fig. 1, B and C; Table 1; supplemental Fig. 1; and supplemental Table 1). None of these proteins were identified in the Rac1b purification, which is also consistent with previous observations demonstrating that PAK and RhoGDI do not bind Rac1b (12Fiegen D. Haeusler L.C.

Specific antibodies against GIT1 and RhoGDI were used to validate the mass spectrometry data using Western blot analyses; these experiments confirmed the greater affinity of these effectors for Rac1 and Rac1V12 as compared with Rac1b (Fig. 1E), and similar results were shown for IQGAP and RhoGDI (supplemental Fig. 2). Interestingly, SmgGDS, an atypical GEF with multiple armadillo repeats (26Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16626-16634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vikis H.G. Stewart S. Guan K.L.

As a complementary screen for Rac1/Rac1b-binding proteins, we generated purified recombinant GST-Rac1, -Rac1V12, and -Rac1b fusion proteins and incubated these with mouse mammary epithelial SCp2 cell lysates, a method that has the benefit of not perturbing the overall protein expression patterns in the cells. Protein complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE and analyzed using silver staining (Fig. 2A). We found that a number of proteins were enriched in the Rac1b purification compared with the Rac1 purifications (Fig. 2B, Table 1, and supplemental Table 1). Proteomic analysis of two of these bands identified p120ctn, an armadillo domain protein involved in multiple cellular functions (28Anastasiadis P.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), and RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1), a scaffolding protein involved in key signaling pathways (29Nilsson J. Sengupta J. Frank J. Nissen P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Specific antibodies against p120ctn and RACK1 were used to validate these data in Western blot analyses (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that the 19-aa insertion found in Rac1b and not Rac1 may act as a novel and specific binding site. The identification of p120ctn as a selective binding partner of Rac1b in our pull-down experiment was especially striking, because both Rac1b and p120ctn have been implicated as key players in signaling pathways controlling cell adhesion, migration, and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (3Singh A.

We studied the expression and localization of IP3R subtypes in normal and DMD human muscle and in normal (RCMH) and dystrophic (RCDMD) human muscle cell lines. In normal muscle, both type 1 IP3Rs (IP3R1) and type 2 IP3Rs (IP3R2) show a higher expression in type II fibers, whereas type 3 IP3Rs (IP3R3) show uniform distribution. In DMD biopsies, all fibers display a homogeneous IP3R2 label, whereas 24 ± 7% of type II fibers have lost the IP3R1 label. RCDMD cells show 5-fold overexpression of IP3R2 and down-regulation of IP3R3 compared with RCMH cells. A tetanic stimulus induces IP3-dependent slow Ca2+ transients significantly larger and faster in RCDMD cells than in RCMH cells as well as significant ERK1/2 phosphorylation in normal but not in dystrophic cells. Excitation-driven gene expression was different among cell lines; 44 common genes were repressed in RCMH cells and expressed in RCDMD cells or vice versa.

https://openalex.org/W2073135810,"CHD1 is a SNF2-related ATPase that is required for the genome-wide incorporation of variant histone H3.3 in the paternal pronucleus as well as in transcriptionally active nuclei in Drosophila embryos. The S. pombe and vertebrate orthologs of CHD1 have been implicated in the assembly of the centromeric histone H3 variant CenH3CENP-A, which occurs in a DNA replication-independent manner. Here, we examined whether CHD1 participates in the assembly of CenH3CID in Drosophila. In contrast to the findings in fission yeast and vertebrate cells, our evidence clearly argues against such a role for CHD1 in Drosophila. CHD1 does not localize to centromeres in either S2 cells or developing fly embryos. Down-regulation of CHD1 in S2 cells by RNAi reveals unchanged levels of CenH3CID at the centromeres. Most notably, ablation of functional CHD1 in Chd1 mutant fly embryos does not interfere with centromere and kinetochore assembly, as the levels and localization of CenH3CID, CENP-C and BubR1 in the mutant embryos remain similar to those seen in wild-type embryos. These results indicate that Drosophila CHD1 has no direct function in the incorporation of the centromeric H3 variant CenH3CID into chromatin. Therefore, centromeric chromatin assembly may involve different mechanisms in different organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2087127242,"APC/C(Cdh1) plays a key role in mitotic exit and has essential targets in the G(1) phase; however, these mechanisms are poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence that damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) is capable of binding the WD40 domains of Cdh1, but not of Cdc20, through its BPA and BPC domains. Moreover, cells lacking DDB1 exhibit markedly elevated levels of the protein substrates of APC/C(Cdh1). Depletion of DDB1 in mitotic cells significantly delays mitotic exit, which demonstrates that the interaction between DDB1 and Cdh1 plays a critical role in regulating APC/C(Cdh1) activity. However, cells depleted of Cdh1 demonstrated no change in the UV-induced degradation of Cdt1, the main function of DDB1 as an E3 ligase. Strikingly, the APC/C(Cdh1) substrate levels are normal in cell knockdowns of Cul4A and Cul4B, which, along with DDB1, form an E3 ligase complex. This finding indicates that DDB1 modulates the function of APC/C(Cdh1) in a manner independent on the Cul4-DDB1 complex. Our results suggest that DDB1 may functionally regulate mitotic exit by modulating APC/C(Cdh1) activity. This study reveals that there may be cross-talk among DDB1, Cdh1, and Skp2 in the control of cell cycle division."

https://openalex.org/W2147217718,"Leukotriene B4 type-1 receptor (BLT1), which plays a role in various inflammatory diseases, is exclusively expressed in peripheral leukocytes, which suggests that its expression is stringently regulated. However, the precise mechanism of BLT1 expression is not fully understood. Here we report that acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1/Runx1) is involved in the enhancement of BLT1 expression in leukocytes. In retinoic acid (RA)-stimulated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, the transcription of the BLT1 gene was found to be significantly activated. RA did not directly modulate the BLT1 promoter, suggesting enhancers in other loci. DNase I-hypersensitivity analyses revealed an activated region, termed AE-BLex, at the intron-I:exon-II boundary. AE-BLex acts as an enhancer for the BLT1 promoter and possesses 2 AML1 recognition sites. The importance of AML1 was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, reporter assays, and knockdown experiments. We demonstrated that the enhancement of BLT1 expression during the RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is due to a loosening of the chromatin structure around AE-BLex, which leads to the incremental binding of AML1. The AML1/AE-BLex complex was confirmed in other BLT1-expressing leukemia cell lines and human peripheral leukocytes. Thus, AML1 enhances BLT1 expression by binding to AE-BLex, which is accessible in leukocytes.—Hashidate, T., Murakami, N., Nakagawa, M., Ichikawa, M., Kurokawa, M., Shimizu, T., Nakamura, M.

Here, we show that deletion of the PEST motif at the C terminus (CT) domain of Cx50 attenuates the stimulatory effect of Cx50 on lens fiber differentiation. Valine 362, a residue located within the PEST domain, is functionally involved. The structure of the Cx50 CT predicted by molecular modeling revealed four α-helices and Val362 was found to be located in the middle of the 3rd helix. Replacement of Val362 with amino acid residues that disrupt the α-helical structure predicted by molecular modeling, such as arginine, glutamate, or phenylalanine, attenuated the stimulatory effects of Cx50 on lens differentiation, whereas replacement with threonine, isoleucine, leucine, or proline, which maintain the structure preserved the function of Cx50. Circular dichroism (CD) studies supported the structural predictions and showed that the substitution with Glu, but not Thr or Pro, disrupted the α-helix, which appears to be the structural feature important for lens epithelial-fiber differentiation.

The vertebrate eye lens is an avascular organ consisting of an anterior epithelial cell layer and highly differentiated fiber cells in the center. Mitotically active epithelial cells at the lens equator differentiate into the lens fiber cells, which lose major intracellular organelles and accumulate high concentrations of soluble crystallins (1Tholozan F.M. Quinlan R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1754-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The loss of cellular organelles makes the fiber cells become incapable of supporting an active cellular metabolism. Hence, the fiber cells depend upon extensive networks of gap junction communications and transport system to direct microcirculation to support their metabolic needs and homeostasis (2Mathias R.T. Kistler J. Donaldson P. J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 216: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are membrane channels that connect neighboring cells and allow the passage of small molecules (Mr < 1,000), such as small metabolites, ions, and second messengers. This type of cell-cell coupling is essential for normal cell and tissue functions. The structural components of gap junctions are membrane proteins called connexins. Connexins have four conserved transmembrane domains with the most variable cytoplasmic C terminus (CT) 2The abbreviations used are: CTC terminusCxconnexinLYLucifer yellowRDrhodamine dextranTFE2,2,2-trifluoroethanolAQP0aquaporin-0. domain (3Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Three types of connexins are expressed in the lens organ, among which Cx43 is predominately expressed in lens epithelial cells. During the transition process into fibers, the expression level of Cx43 is decreased and eventually replaced by two fiber connexins, Cx50 and Cx46. Each connexin forms channels with distinctive physiological properties of gating, permeation, and selective interaction with other connexins (4Gong X. Cheng C. Xia C.H. J. Membr.

In the lens, the importance of gap junctions and connexins was demonstrated by knock-out mouse models. Both Cx50- and Cx46-deficient mice develop cataracts. In addition, ablation of Cx50 results in decreased lens size, leading to microphthalmia (6White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. J.

The retardation in lens growth caused by deficiency of Cx50 is likely due to the attenuation of lens epithelial-fiber differentiation (9Dunia I. Cibert C. Gong X. Xia C.H. Recouvreur M. Levy E.

Concurring with in vivo observations, we have previously shown that overexpression of Cx50, but not other lens connexins, significantly stimulates lens epithelial-fiber differentiation in lens primary cell culture (10Gu S. Yu X.S. Yin X. Jiang J.X. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2103-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, the CT domain of Cx50 is sufficient to promote lens fiber differentiation, suggesting the importance of this region (11Banks E.A. Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a critical amino acid residue, Val362 within the CT domain of Cx50 that is functionally involved in lens epithelial-fiber differentiation. Furthermore, we showed that this amino acid residue is an important component in maintaining an α-helical structure, and this structural feature appears to be indispensable for the role of Cx50 in lens epithelial-fiber differentiation. Fertilized, unincubated white leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from Ideal Poultry (Cameron, TX) and incubated for 10–11 days in a humidified 37 °C egg incubator. Anti-Cx50 antibody was generated as previously described (12Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Anti-CP49 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Paul Fitzgerald at the University of California (Davis, CA); anti-AQP0 polyclonal antibody was generated from rabbit against chicken AQP0 C terminus (223–262 amino acids). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and chemiluminescence kit (ECL) was purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ); paraformaldehyde (16% stock solution) from Electron Microscopy Science (Hatfield, PA); trypsin, tissue culture reagents, lucifer yellow (LY), and rhodamine dextran (RD) from Invitrogen; fetal bovine serum from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT); the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); Vectashield fluorescence mounting medium from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA); all other chemicals were obtained either from Sigma or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).

Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, lenses from 10–11-day-old chicken embryos were dissected, rinsed with TD buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm glucose, and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4)), and digested with 0.1% trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min. Lens cells were obtained by breaking the lens apart and collecting them in M199 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Living cells were then counted and seeded at 3 × 105 cells per well of a 12-well culture plate. The next day after the primary culture was seeded, retroviruses expressing wild-type and mutated forms of Cx50 were added to primary lens cultures. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and fed every other day. At the start of culturing, only monolayer lens epithelial cells proliferated on the culture plates. After 3–4 days, lens epithelial cells reached confluency and differentiated to form fiber-like “lentoid” structures. The number of lentoid was counted everyday during the culturing. For immunolabeling of AQP0 expressed in the primary lens culture, a glass coverslip was placed into each well of a 12-well plate before seeding the cell. After 6–8 days of culturing, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then incubated with blocking solution (2% goat serum, 2% fish skin gelatin, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution) for another 30 min. AQP0 was labeled with anti-AQP0 polyclonal antibody (1:200) followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:400). The sections were mounted on a glass coverslip using Vectashield. The specimens were analyzed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Image acquisition parameters were maintained consistent for each sample. Representative fluorescent images from random regions within each culture well were taken and the fluorescence signals of the AQP0 staining area versus the whole image area were determined using NIH ImageJ software (10Gu S. Yu X.S. Yin X. Jiang J.X. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2103-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ten to fifteen images for each sample were used to examine the AQP0 expression per measurement. Multiple rounds of Psi-BLAST search in the NCBI data base were performed to identify the possible sequence homology. To construct a structural model for Cx50 CT based on human cyclin A2 (PDB code 3bht) as a template, the SWISS-MODEL online server (37Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5995) Google Scholar) was used. The sequence alignment between Cx50 CT and a part of cyclin A (Ser171–Val430) was performed by the T-COFFEE program (38Notredame C. Higgins D. J. Mol. Bio. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5396) Google Scholar) which was then subjected to alignment mode modeling in SWISS-MODEL. Energy minimization of this Cx50 CT model was performed with GROMOS96 in DeepView software (39Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar). No clashes within the individual subunits or at the subunit interfaces have been observed before or after energy minimization. To further confirm the structural information from the molecular modeling methods, other secondary prediction methods including SOPM (self-optimized method) were utilized to predict the Cx50 CT secondary structure solely based on the composition of amino acids (15Geourjon C. Deléage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition, Profile Hidden Markov Models (HHpred program (16Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar)) were also employed to predict the possible secondary structure of Cx50 CT by scoring pairs of aligned secondary structure states in a way analogous to the classical amino acid substitution matrices. Chicken embryonic fibroblast cells were grown to confluence to maximize cell-cell contact. Scrape loading dye transfer was performed based on a modified protocol (17el-Fouly M.H. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scratched in the presence of two fluorescent dyes: LY (457 Da), which can pass through gap junction channels, and RD (10 kDa), which is too large to pass through gap junction channels. The presence of LY indicates those cells that participate in gap junction-mediated communication and RD serves as a tracer dye for cells originally receiving the dye. Cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min each and then a mixture solution containing 1% LY, 1% RD in phosphate-buffered saline was applied and the plates were scraped lightly with a surgical blade. After 15 min of incubation with the dyes, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution three times, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then fixed in fresh 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Dye transfer results were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), where LY and RD could be detected by using fluorescein and RD filters, respectively. Image acquisition was kept consistent for all measurements and no threshold adjustments were used. Using RD staining as the reference for the original dye-loaded cells, the extent of dye transfer was measured as the distance from the center of the scrape line to the farthest extent of RD- or LY-stained cells with the appropriate scale bar. At least five images per condition tested with six measurements per image were used to assess the degree of dye transfer. Cultured cells were collected in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris and 5 mm EDTA/EGTA, pH 8.0) and then ruptured by passing through a 261/2-gauge needle multiple times. Lysates were centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 × g to remove cellular and nuclear debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (SW 60 Ti rotor, Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and boiled in 0.6% SDS for 3 min. Lysates were analyzed by 10–12% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting assay was performed by probing with anti-AQP0 (1:1,000), anti-CP49 (1:1,000), anti-Cx50 (1:1,000), and anti-β-actin (1:5,000). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) or anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) using chemiluminescence reagent kit (ECL). Circular dichroism spectra were acquired in the far UV (185–250 nm) on a Jasco-815 CD spectropolarimeter at 6 °C using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. All spectra presented in graphs were accumulated and averaged from 5 scans. The peptides containing the second and third helices were generated with a tyrosine residue added to the C termini of each peptide to facilitate concentration determination (Table 2). The capability of the peptide to form a helical structure was evaluated by quantifying secondary structures using CD spectroscopy in the presence of varying concentrations of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) in 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.2, 7.2, or 8.8). Peptide concentration was maintained at 4 μm or 0.16 mg/ml. The secondary structure contents of the peptide were calculated using an online server DICHROWEB, which integrates SELCON, CDSSTR, and K2D analysis algorithms (18Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar).TABLE 2The sequences of peptides used for CD studiesMutantSequenceWild-typeAEEEEEQEEEQQAPQEEPGVKKAEEEVVSDEVEGPYV362EAEEEEEQEEEQQAPQEEPGVKKAEEEEVSDEVEGPYV362PAEEEEEQEEEQQAPQEEPGVKKAEEEPVSDEVEGPYV362TAEEEEEQEEEQQAPQEEPGVKKAEEETVSDEVEGPY Open table in a new tab Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test along with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

We have previously shown that the CT domain of Cx50 is involved in lens epithelial-fiber differentiation (11Banks E.A. Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several residues within a putative PEST motif (rich in amino acids Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr) of Cx50 CT that we have previously identified are associated with Cx50 phosphorylation, protein stability, and caspase 3 cleavage (19Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test if the removal of this motif has any impact on the role of Cx50 in lens fiber differentiation, a truncated form of Cx50 without the PEST motif (ΔPEST-Cx50) was generated (Fig. 1A). The expression of exogenous Cx50 and ΔPEST-Cx50 was achieved by infecting primary lens cells with recombinant retroviruses. Pulse-chase experiments showed that deletion of the PEST domain did not affect Cx50 protein turnover and stability. The number of lentoids, which are an indication of lens epithelial-fiber differentiation, was quantified each day during 8 days of culturing. The result showed that deletion of the PEST domain (ΔPEST-Cx50) significantly abolished the effect of Cx50 on promoting lens fiber differentiation as compared with wild-type Cx50 (Fig. 1B). The attenuated effect due to PEST motif deletion was further confirmed by the reduced expression level of AQP0, a marker for lens fiber differentiation by quantifying fluorescence intensity of immuno-labeled AQP0 (11Banks E.A. Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Zhou L. Chen T. Church R.L. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Within this PEST motif, we have shown that Ser368 is a caspase-3 cleavage site (20Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ser364 and Ser371 are phosphorylated residues (19Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of Ser364 regulates Cx50 turnover and caspase 3-mediated degradation (20Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We generated single (E368A, E368D, S371A, S371D), double (S364A/S371A), and triple (S364A/E368A/S371A) mutants of these three residues by site-directed mutagenesis. However, none of the mutants compromised the influence of Cx50 on promoting lens fiber differentiation as indicated by the level of AQP0 expression (Fig. 1D). To identify possible amino acid residue(s) of Cx50 involved in lens fiber differentiation, a multiple Psi-BLAST search in the NCBI data base was performed. Five highly conserved residues (Glu328, Glu331, Ala348, Val362, and Pro370) were identified between sequences of Cx50 and cyclin A. Among these residues, only two, Val362 and Pro370, are located within the PEST domain. Three recombinant retroviruses expressing the mutated forms of Cx50 were generated (Fig. 2A): M5 contained mutations of all five residues, E328A, E331A, A348P, V362E, and P370A; M4 contained mutations on four resides, E328A, E331A, A348P, and P370A; and M3 contained deletion of the PEST motif (ΔPEST-Cx50) in conjunction with three additional mutations, E328A, E331A, A348P. By expressing wild-type and mutants of Cx50 in the primary lens culture using retroviral infection, we showed that only M4 had a similar stimulatory effect on lentoid formation as wild-type Cx50, whereas ΔPEST-Cx50, M3, and M5 mutants lack such effects when compared with wild-type Cx50 (Fig. 2B). These results were further verified by the expression level of AQP0 determined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C). M4 and M5 have significantly different roles on lens cell differentiation and the only difference between these two mutants is the mutation on Val362. These data imply that Val362 is likely a critical residue in Cx50 CT that is functionally involved in lens fiber differentiation. A homology model of structure for Cx50 CT was constructed using the atomic coordinates of cyclin A2 as a template in the SWISS-MODEL repository. This molecular modeling result suggested that the predicted structure of Cx50 CT contains four α-helical loops where all five highly conserved amino acid residues are located (Fig. 3A). Notably, only Val362 is located in the center of the 3rd helix, whereas all other conserved residues are located outside the helical structures. This finding implies that Val362 might be a critical residue in maintaining the helical structures at Cx50 CT. As an aid to the homology modeling of Cx50 CT, other secondary prediction methods including SOPM were used to predict the Cx50 CT secondary structure primarily based on the composition of amino acids (15Geourjon C. Deléage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These predictions suggested that about 60–70% of Cx50 CT contained α-helical structures, with four major helices (Fig. 3B, h in blue), which is consistent with the above molecular modeling analysis. Particularly, in all these predictions, Val362 is also positioned in the middle of the 3rd helical motif. In addition, Profile Hidden Markov Models were also employed to predict the possible secondary structure of Cx50 CT by scoring pairs of aligned secondary structure states in a way analogous to the classical amino acid substitution matrices. The predicted secondary structure of Cx50 CT by the HHpred program (16Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar) shows good alignment between Cx50 CT and rabbit Cx43 CT with an E-value of 1.9E-12. The predicted helical motif containing Val362 is aligned within the 2nd helix of Cx43 CT (amino acids 342–348) (22Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Spray D.C. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). The molecular modeling in conjunction with the structural prediction and alignment analysis suggested that Val362 is likely to be positioned within the putative 3rd helix of Cx50CT. To test if Val362 is critical in maintaining an α-helical structure and is crucial for the role of Cx50 in lens fiber differentiation, we generated single-site mutants by substituting Val362 with representative amino acid residues. Prior to functional assay, the mutation tool in the UCSF Chimera software package (36Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27219) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the possible structural outcomes of these substitutions. The Rotamers tool allows amino acid side chain rotamers to be viewed and evaluated. “Best” rotamer is selected based on side chain torsion (χ) and probability value, taken from the rotamer library, as well as in the context of the structural environment. The properties of amino acids we substituted are summarized in Table 3. Replacing Val362 with Arg, Lys, or Glu shows much lower possibilities (0.1–0.2) in maintaining the α-helix of Cx50 CT as compared with Leu, Thr, or Ile (0.6–0.8) (Fig. 4A). The changes of Val362 to a negatively charged residue, Glu, would disrupt the helical structure presumably due to an i, i + 4 interaction between two negatively charged residues. Interestingly, this modeling program predicts lower probability of α-helical content with either Arg or Lys substitution, even though both residues have relatively high α-helical propensity and would create a potentially favorable i, i + 4 electrostatic interaction (23Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, changing Val362 to similar hydrophobic side chain residues, Val, Thr, or Ile, would not cause any structural alteration because two non-hydrogen substituents attached to their C-β carbon provides bulkiness near the protein backbone, thereby restricting the presence of these amino acids in the conformations adopted by the main chain. Interestingly, substituting Val362 with known α-helix breakers, Phe or Pro, has the probability value in the middle between V362R/V362K/V362E) and V362L/V362T/V362I, suggesting that the replacement of Val362 with Phe or Pro may or may not cause the disruption of α-helix in Cx50 CT.TABLE 3Side chain properties of substituted amino acid residuesAmino acidsSide chain propertyArginine or lysineBasicGlutamic acidAcidicLeucine or threonineβ-ChainsIsoleucineγ-ChainPhenylalanine or prolineα-Helix breaker Open table in a new tab The functional importance of Val362 and the α-helical structure in lens fiber differentiation was tested in chicken lens primary cultures infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing various wild-type and Cx50 mutants. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that these mutants are partially co-localized with endogenous Cx50. Substitution of Val362 with polar amino acid residues, Arg, Lys, and Glu significantly abolished the effect of Cx50 on increasing the number of lentoids (Fig. 4B) and the expression of AQP0 was detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, C and D). The level of CP49, another lens fiber differentiation marker, is also similarly stimulated (Fig. 4D). The chicken cp49 gene gives rise to two transcripts, CP49 and CP49ins (24Wallace P. Signer E. Paton I.R. Burt D. Quinlan R. Gene. 1998; 211: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), presenting as two separate bands on Western blots. Interestingly, the V362P mutant has similar capability in promoting lentoid formation and expression level of AQP0 and CP49 as wild-type Cx50 and V362L/V362T/V362I mutants. This could be explained by the fact that proline is present in the human and bovine orthologs of Cx50 at the same conserved site as Val362 in chicken and Leu362 in rodents (Fig. 4E). Together, the data suggest that Val362 of Cx50 or the corresponding residue at the same position from other species plays a crucial role in lens fiber differentiation, and this role is likely to be mediated through the structural integrity of an α-helix. This suggests that sequence conservation produces consistent secondary structures with varying primary structures, further illustrating the importance of conserved three-dimensional structures and functions of Cx50 across the animal species. Scrape loading dye transfer was conducted to determine whether these mutations had any impact on gap junction intercellular communication (Fig. 5). The extent of dye transfer was measured as the distance from the center of scrape line to the farthest extent of RD- or LY-stained cells (Fig. 5B). The data suggested that all these mutants form functional gap junctions to a similar degree as wild-type Cx50, albeit their differences in promoting lens fiber differentiation. This result offers further support for the gap junction-independent role of Cx50 in lens epithelial-fiber differentiation as reported (11Banks E.A. Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We tested if Val362 is crucial for forming α-helical structures by examining the secondary structure contents of the peptides derived from putative 2nd and 3rd helices of Cx50CT using far UV CD spectroscopy. In aqueous solution, this peptide was largely unstructured. TFE induced the formation of α-helical structures with two major troughs at 208 and 222 nm observed in the CD spectra. The α-helical content increased to 34.4 in 30% TFE and to 45.7 in 50% TFE but remained the same in 70% TFE solution (Fig. 6A). TFE has been shown to induce and stabilize the intrinsic secondary structures in the peptides derived from connexins (25Zhou Y. Yang W. Lurtz M.M. Ye Y. Huang Y. Lee H.W. Chen Y. Louis C.F. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35005-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Fort A.G. Spray D.C. Biopolymers. 2009; 92: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), possibly by mimicking the plasma membrane-like hydrophobic environment. Sodium phosphate buffers with various pH were also tested in the CD assay and the data suggested that the wild-type peptide adopts the highest content of α-helical structures at low pH (pH 4.8) instead of pH 7.2 or 8.2 (Fig. 6B), presumably due to minimization of charge repulsion by the stretches of negatively charged glutamic acid residues found in the helical regions. In addition, the thermal stability of the peptide structures was determined at 0, 6, 25, and 37 °C and the peptide exhibited the highest α-helical content at low temperature (6 °C) (data not shown). The full CD spectrum of the wild-type and the other three mutant peptides, V362E, V362P, and V362T (Table 2), were obtained under the above optimized condition (50% TFE in 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.8, 6 °C) (Fig. 6C). Consistent with the molecular modeling studies, the peptides containing V362T and V362P exhibited similar structures as wild-type peptide with α-helical contents of about 42%. However, the V362E mutant reduced the α-helical content from 42 to 24.4%. The data demonstrate that substitution of Val362 to Glu destabilizes the α-helical structures, whereas the replacement of Val with Pro or Thr preserves the secondary structures. In this study, we first demonstrate that the PEST domain within the Cx50 CT is indispensable for the role of Cx50 in promoting lens fiber differentiation. By sequence analysis and molecular modeling, the amino acid residue Val362 was identified and mutation of this residue to charged residues abolished the effect of Cx50 on differentiation. Structural modeling and analysis of CD spectra indicated that Val362 is crucial in maintaining an α-helical structure at Cx50 CT and disruption of this structure by altering the Val362 residue attenuated the role of Cx50 in differentiation. This study showed the importance of specific structural features of connexins in cellular function. We have previously shown that only Cx50, but not Cx46 or Cx43, promotes chicken lens fiber differentiation (10Gu S. Yu X.S. Yin X. Jiang J.X. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2103-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that the C terminus of Cx50 is responsible for the role of Cx50 in promoting lens cell differentiation (11Banks E.A. Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying this regulatory function was not clear. Here, we not only identified the involvement of specific motif and amino acid residues, but also demonstrated the importance of the integrity of a unique α-helical structure in the lens fiber differentiation process. This specific structural feature could be critical for binding of certain protein(s) important for differentiation. The C termini of connexin molecules have been shown to be involved in various cellular functions. The C terminus of Cx43, an ubiquitously expressed connexin, has been shown to interact with several cellular proteins, such as ZO-1, p38 MAPK, calmodulin, tubulin, etc. (27Hervé J.C. Bourmeyster N. Sarrouilhe D. Duffy H.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2007; 94: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A previous study also showed that the C terminus of Cx50 directly interacts with ZO-1 although the function of this interaction is unclear (28Nielsen P.A. Baruch A. Shestopalov V.I. Giepmans B.N. Dunia I. Benedetti E.L. Kumar N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2470-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence suggesting the role of connexins in regulating cell cycle regulators. Zhang et al. (29Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y.W. Kaneda M. Morita I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44852-44856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of Cx43 reduced the level of S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), a factor important for cell cycle progression, and that this effect was independent of gap junction function. This is a likely mechanism for tumor suppressing functions of Cx43 on various tumor cell lines. We observed that culturing at days 4–5 is a critical time point for the stimulatory effect of Cx50 on lens epithelial-fiber differentiation. This implies that Cx50 is likely to be involved in the early stages of differentiation. One possibility is that Cx50 may be involved in the inhibition of fiber progenitor cell proliferation through cell cycle control, which in turn, leads to initiation and promotion of lens cell differentiation. At the early stages of lens epithelial cell culture, both Cx43 and Cx50 are expressed. Due to technical reasons, we could not determine whether mutants associate with endogenous Cx50 to form heteromeric connexons, which may affect endogenous Cx50 function. However, this is unlikely because expression of exogenous wild-type Cx50 promotes differentiation. By co-immunostaining, we found that mutants had similar distribution patterns as wild-type and partially co-localized with endogenous Cx50. We observed that expression of wild-type, ΔPEST, and other mutants does not lead to a further increase in gap junction function, consistent with our previous observation (10Gu S. Yu X.S. Yin X. Jiang J.X. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2103-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that endogenous connexins are sufficient to form gap junction channels, thus there is no additional increase of gap junction communication due to exogenous expression. Alternatively, Cx50 may not be a major connexin forming gap junction in lens epithelial cells. Cx50 lacking PEST or the non-conserved mutant of Val362 compromises its capability to promote lens epithelial-fiber differentiation, but has no effect on gap junctions. This is consistent with our previous studies that promotion of lens differentiation is independent of gap junctions using cataract-related mutants lacking gap junction function (11Banks E.A. Yu X.S. Shi Q. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Cx43 CT has been reported using NMR spectroscopy, indicating two short helices (31Hirst-Jensen B.J. Sahoo P. Kieken F. Delmar M. Sorgen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5801-5813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on Profile Hidden Markov Model alignment, we identified one short putative helical structure on Cx50 CT corresponding to the 2nd helical motif on Cx43 CT. Interestingly, this motif contains Val362. Our CD studies further confirm the importance of Val362 in sustaining a helical structure. Furthermore, we found that the integrity of this helical structure on Cx50 CT is directly correlated with the effect of Cx50 on lens fiber differentiation. Substitution of Val362 with charged amino acids reduces the α-helical content and consequently, abolishes the stimulatory effect of Cx50. One interesting observation here is that the substitution of Val362 with proline retains the helical structure although proline is typically known as a helix breaker. Due to the absence of the backbone amide hydrogen important for stabilizing an α-helix, proline is less favorable among 20 amino acids to form normal helical conformation. However, NMR studies verified the incorporation of a proline residue in the middle of an α-helix in the Oct-1 transcription factor. Modeling showed an altered H-bonding pattern, but the resulting helix was remarkably stable (32Cox M. Dekker N. Boelens R. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6032-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Instead of valine at residue 362 in chicken, the proline residue is present in human and bovine ortholog forms of Cx50. Therefore, the helical structure is likely to be conserved across different animal species. Cellular function of proteins generally is fulfilled as a part of a complex with other protein molecules. The maintenance of certain structures of Cx50 could be critical to maintain the stability of the protein complex. Identification of potential interacting protein(s) that facilitates the role of Cx50 in lens epithelial-fiber differentiation warrants further investigation.
