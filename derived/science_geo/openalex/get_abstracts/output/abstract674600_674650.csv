https://openalex.org/W3164220019,"Two elementary parameters for quantifying viral infection and shedding are viral load and whether samples yield a replicating virus isolate in cell culture. We examined 25,381 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Germany, including 6110 from test centers attended by presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalized, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The viral load of the youngest subjects was lower than that of the older subjects by 0.5 (or fewer) log10 units, and they displayed an estimated ~78% of the peak cell culture replication probability; in part this was due to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 109 copies per swab were found in 8% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with a mean age of 37.6 years. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (108.1 RNA copies per swab) and peak cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log10 viral load 1.05 higher than that of non-B.1.1.7 subjects, and the estimated cell culture replication probability of B.1.1.7 subjects was higher by a factor of 2.6."
https://openalex.org/W3165658327,"The northern state of Amazonas is among the regions in Brazil most heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and has experienced two exponentially growing waves, in early and late 2020. Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Amazonas, Brazil, shows successive lineage replacements led to predominance of the variant of concern P.1 and are associated with variable levels of social distancing."
https://openalex.org/W3164397064,"Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into discrete cellular foci without an encapsulating membrane. Condensates are often presumed to increase enzymatic reaction rates through increased concentrations of enzymes and substrates (mass action), although this idea has not been widely tested and other mechanisms of modulation are possible. Here we describe a synthetic system where the SUMOylation enzyme cascade is recruited into engineered condensates generated by liquid–liquid phase separation of multidomain scaffolding proteins. SUMOylation rates can be increased up to 36-fold in these droplets compared to the surrounding bulk, depending on substrate KM. This dependency produces substantial specificity among different substrates. Analyses of reactions above and below the phase-separation threshold lead to a quantitative model in which reactions in condensates are accelerated by mass action and changes in substrate KM, probaby due to scaffold-induced molecular organization. Thus, condensates can modulate reaction rates both by concentrating molecules and physically organizing them. A chemically induced dimerization strategy was used to recruit SUMOylation enzymes into condensates, enabling quantification of the effect of phase separation on the activity of a SUMOylation enzyme cascade reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3165150342,"Background There is no effective therapy for the severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) responsible for the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). To date, dexamethasone has shown a decrease in mortality in patients who require oxygen, especially those with invasive mechanical ventilation. However, it is unknown if another corticosteroid can be used, the optimal dose and its duration, to achieve a better clinical outcome. The objective of the study was to compare the differences in clinical outcome and laboratory results in hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV2 Pneumonia treated with dexamethasone at 6 mg doses versus patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone. Materials and methods Ambispective cohort study with survival analysis of 216 patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2 by Berlin protocol, who were hospitalized in a high-complexity clinic in Medellín, Colombia. The patients should also have supplementary oxygen and radiological confirmation of Pneumonia by chest tomography. Sample size was not calculated since the total population that met the inclusion criteria was evaluated. 111 patients were treated with the institutional protocol with intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg QD for seven to 10 days if they required oxygen. Since September 15, 2020, the hospitalization protocol of the clinic was modified by the Infectious Diseases and Pulmonology service, recommending a high dose of methylprednisolone of 250 to 500 mg every day for three days with a subsequent change to oral prednisone 50 mg every day for 14 days. The protocol was not applied in the intensive care unit, where dexamethasone continued to be administered. The clinical outcome and differences in laboratory results of the patients who received dexamethasone vs. the prospective cohort that received methylprednisolone from September 15 to October 31, 2020, were evaluated. Follow-up was carried out by outpatient consultation one month after discharge or by telephone, inquiring about readmission or living-dead status. Results 216 patients had Covid-19 pneumonia documented by ground-glass imaging and alveolar pressure / inspired oxygen fraction (PaFi) less than 300. 111 patients received dexamethasone (DXM) and 105 received methylprednisolone (MTP). Patients in the DXM group evolved to severe ARDS in a higher proportion (26.1% vs 17.1% than the MTP group). Upon completion 4 days of treatment with parenteral corticosteroid, laboratory markers of severity decreased significantly in the group that received MTP, CRP 2.85 (2.3–3.8) vs 7.2 (5.4–9.8), (p-value &lt; 0.0001), D-dimer 691 (612–847) vs 1083 (740–1565) (p-value = 0.04) and DHL 273 (244–289) vs 355 (270.6–422) (p-value = 0.01). After starting the corticosteroid, transfer to the intensive care unit (4.8% vs. 14.4%) and mortality (9,5% vs. 17.1%) was lower in the group that received MTP. Recovery time was shorter in patients treated with MTP, three days (3–4) vs. DXM 6 days (5–8) (p-value &lt; 0.0001). At 30-day follow-up, 88 (92.6%) were alive in MTP vs 58 (63.1%) of those who received dexamethasone. Conclusions In this study, the treatment of severe Covid-19 Pneumonia with high-dose methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral prednisone for 14 days, compared with 6 mg dexamethasone for 7 to 10 days, statistically significantly decreased the recovery time, the need for transfer to intensive care and the severity markers C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and LDH. Randomized controlled studies with methylprednisolone are required to corroborate its effect, and studies in a population hospitalized in intensive care wards."

https://openalex.org/W3165570809,"Neural stem cells residing in the hippocampal neurogenic niche sustain lifelong neurogenesis in the adult brain. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is functionally linked to mnemonic and cognitive plasticity in humans and rodents. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the process of generating new neurons at the hippocampal neurogenic niche is impeded, yet the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here we identify miR-132, one of the most consistently downregulated microRNAs in AD, as a potent regulator of AHN, exerting cell-autonomous proneurogenic effects in adult neural stem cells and their progeny. Using distinct AD mouse models, cultured human primary and established neural stem cells, and human patient material, we demonstrate that AHN is directly affected by AD pathology. miR-132 replacement in adult mouse AD hippocampus restores AHN and relevant memory deficits. Our findings corroborate the significance of AHN in mouse models of AD and reveal the possible therapeutic potential of targeting miR-132 in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3165153899,"COVID-19 is challenging healthcare preparedness, world economies, and livelihoods. The infection and death rates associated with this pandemic are strikingly variable in different countries. To elucidate this discrepancy, we analyzed 2431 early spread SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID. We estimated continental-wise admixture proportions, assessed haplotype block estimation, and tested for the presence or absence of strains’ recombination. Herein, we identified 1010 unique missense mutations and seven different SARS-CoV-2 clusters. In samples from Asia, a small haplotype block was identified, whereas samples from Europe and North America harbored large and different haplotype blocks with nonsynonymous variants. Variant frequency and linkage disequilibrium varied among continents, especially in North America. Recombination between different strains was only observed in North American and European sequences. In addition, we structurally modelled the two most common mutations, Spike_D614G and Nsp12_P314L, which suggested that these linked mutations may enhance viral entry and replication, respectively. Overall, we propose that genomic recombination between different strains may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and COVID-19 severity and may present additional challenges for current treatment regimens and countermeasures. Furthermore, our study provides a possible explanation for the substantial second wave of COVID-19 presented with higher infection and death rates in many countries."
https://openalex.org/W3165703330,"The zinc-finger transcription factor Helios is critical for maintaining the identity, anergic phenotype and suppressive activity of regulatory T (Treg) cells. While it is an attractive target to enhance the efficacy of currently approved immunotherapies, no existing approaches can directly modulate Helios activity or abundance. Here, we report the structure-guided development of small molecules that recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor cereblon to Helios, thereby promoting its degradation. Pharmacological Helios degradation destabilized the anergic phenotype and reduced the suppressive activity of Treg cells, establishing a route towards Helios-targeting therapeutics. More generally, this study provides a framework for the development of small-molecule degraders for previously unligandable targets by reprogramming E3 ligase substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3164458620,"Background COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder that frequently causes acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the precise clinical and biochemical variables associated with AKI progression in patients with severe COVID-19 remain unclear. Methods We performed a retrospective study on 278 hospitalized patients who were admitted to the ward and intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020, at the University Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed on RT-PCR were included. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We evaluated the incidence of AKI, several clinical variables, medicines used, and outcomes in two sub-groups: COVID-19 patients with AKI (Cov-AKI), and COVID-19 patients without AKI (non-AKI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results First, an elevated incidence of AKI (71.2%) was identified, distributed across different stages of the KDIGO criteria. We further observed higher levels of creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the Cov-AKI group than in the non-AKI group, at hospital admission. On univariate analysis, Cov-AKI was associated with older age (&gt;62 years), hypertension, CRP, MCV, leucocytes, neutrophils, NLR, combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment, use of mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension and the use of vasoactive drugs were independently associated with a risk of higher AKI in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we preferentially found an altered erythrocyte and leukocyte cellular profile in the Cov-AKI group compared to the non-AKI group, at hospital discharge. Conclusions In our study, the development of AKI in patients with severe COVID-19 was related to inflammatory blood markers and therapy with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, with vasopressor requirement and hypertension considered potential risk factors. Thus, attention to the protocol, hypertension, and some blood markers may help assist doctors with decision-making for the management of COVID-19 patients with AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3165186937,"This paper investigates the active steering control of the tractor and the trailer for the articulated heavy vehicle (AHV) to improve its high-speed lateral stability and low-speed path following. The four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) single track dynamic model of the AHV with a front-wheel steered trailer is established. Considering that the road information at the driver’s focus is the most clear and those away from the focus blurred, a new kind controller based on the fractional calculus, i.e., a focus preview controller is designed to provide the steering input for the tractor to make it travel along the desired path. In addition, the active steering controllers based on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and single-point preview controller respectively are also proposed for the trailer. However, the latter is designed on the basis of the articulation angle between the tractor and trailer, inspired by the idea of the driver’s single-point preview controller. Finally, the single lane change maneuver and 90 o turn maneuver are carried out. And the simulation results show that compared with the single-point preview controller, the new kind preview controller for the tractor can have good high speed maneuvering stability and low speed path tracking ability by adjusting the fractional order of the controller. On this basis, three different AHVs with the same tractor are simulated and the simulation results show that the AHV whose trailer adopts the single-point preview controller has better high-speed lateral stability and low-speed path tracking than the AHV whose trailer adopts the LQR controller."
https://openalex.org/W3164455393,"Model representations of plankton structure and dynamics have consequences for a broad spectrum of ocean processes. Here we focus on the representation of zooplankton and their grazing dynamics in such models. It remains unclear whether phytoplankton community composition, growth rates, and spatial patterns in plankton ecosystem models are especially sensitive to the specific means of representing zooplankton grazing. We conduct a series of numerical experiments that explicitly address this question. We focus our study on the form of the functional response to changes in prey density, including the formulation of a grazing refuge. We use a contemporary biogeochemical model based on continuum size-structured organization, including phytoplankton diversity, coupled to a physical model of the California Current System. This region is of particular interest because it exhibits strong spatial gradients. We find that small changes in grazing refuge formulation across a range of plausible functional forms drive fundamental differences in spatial patterns of plankton concentrations, species richness, pathways of grazing fluxes, and underlying seasonal cycles. An explicit grazing refuge, with refuge prey concentration dependent on grazers' body size, using allometric scaling, is likely to provide more coherent plankton ecosystem dynamics compared to classic formulations or size-independent threshold refugia. We recommend that future plankton ecosystem models pay particular attention to the grazing formulation and implement a threshold refuge incorporating size-dependence, and we call for a new suite of experimental grazing studies."

Here we describe the voluntary saliva testing program instituted at the University of California, Berkeley during an early period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. The program was administered as a research study ahead of clinical implementation, enabling us to launch surveillance testing while continuing to optimize the assay. Results of both the testing protocol itself and the study participants' experience show how the program succeeded in providing routine, robust testing capable of contributing to outbreak prevention within a campus community and offer strategies for encouraging participation and a sense of civic responsibility."
https://openalex.org/W3165687716,"Background and objective Dynamic muscle fascicle length measurements through B-mode ultrasound have become popular for the non-invasive physiological insights they provide regarding musculoskeletal structure-function. However, current practices typically require time consuming post-processing to track muscle length changes from B-mode images. A real-time measurement tool would not only save processing time but would also help pave the way toward closed-loop applications based on feedback signals driven by in vivo muscle length change patterns. In this paper, we benchmark an approach that combines traditional machine learning (ML) models with B-mode ultrasound recordings to obtain muscle fascicle length changes in real-time. To gauge the utility of this framework for ‘in-the-loop’ applications, we evaluate accuracy of the extracted muscle length change signals against time-series’ derived from a standard, post-hoc automated tracking algorithm. Methods We collected B-mode ultrasound data from the soleus muscle of six participants performing five defined ankle motion tasks: (a) seated, constrained ankle plantarflexion, (b) seated, free ankle dorsi/plantarflexion, (c) weight-bearing, calf raises (d) walking, and then a (e) mix. We trained machine learning (ML) models by pairing muscle fascicle lengths obtained from standardized automated tracking software (UltraTrack) with the respective B-mode ultrasound image input to the tracker, frame-by-frame. Then we conducted hyperparameter optimizations for five different ML models using a grid search to find the best performing parameters for a combination of high correlation and low RMSE between ML and UltraTrack processed muscle fascicle length trajectories. Finally, using the global best model/hyperparameter settings, we comprehensively evaluated training-testing outcomes within subject ( i . e ., train and test on same subject), cross subject ( i . e ., train on one subject, test on another) and within/direct cross task ( i . e ., train and test on same subject, but different task). Results Support vector machine (SVM) was the best performing model with an average r = 0.70 ±0.34 and average RMSE = 2.86 ±2.55 mm across all direct training conditions and average r = 0.65 ±0.35 and average RMSE = 3.28 ±2.64 mm when optimized for all cross-participant conditions. Comparisons between ML vs. UltraTrack ( i . e ., ground truth) tracked muscle fascicle length versus time data indicated that ML tracked images reliably capture the salient qualitative features in ground truth length change data, even when correlation values are on the lower end. Furthermore, in the direct training, calf raises condition, which is most comparable to previous studies validating automated tracking performance during isolated contractions on a dynamometer, our ML approach yielded 0.90 average correlation, in line with other accepted tracking methods in the field. Conclusions By combining B-mode ultrasound and classical ML models, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve real-time tracking of human soleus muscle fascicles across a number of functionally relevant contractile conditions. This novel sensing modality paves the way for muscle physiology in-the-loop applications that could be used to modify gait via biofeedback or unlock novel wearable device control techniques that could enable restored or augmented locomotion performance."
https://openalex.org/W3164276345,"Poorly controlled postoperative pain has been known to be characterized by longer post-operative care, longer hospital stays with increased readmission rates, and decreased patient satisfaction. Post-operative pain has been continuously addressed in the past three (3) to four (4) decades and has been shown that 20 to 80% of post-operative patients suffer ineffective pain management.The study was aimed at assessing the factors that may predict the satisfaction of patients with early postoperative pain management following abdominal surgeries at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who had undergone abdominal surgeries between October 2019 and December 2019 at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Structured questionnaires based on the IPO-Q were used to obtain responses from the patients. Descriptive and Inferential statistical analysis were employed in analyzing the data obtained from the respondents of the study.138 patients were involved in this study. The mean age of patients in the study was 45.81 (±16.81) years. A higher percentage, 58.7% of the patients were males. 39.1% had completed their tertiary level of education. The majority (50.7%) of the patients had had persistent pain for more than three (3) months. The satisfaction of the patients with the post-operative pain management received was generally high among a significant majority of the patients. Meanwhile, among the factors that influence the satisfaction of the patients with the post-operative pain management received, type of analgesia and pain relief methods (Pearson Coefficient = 0.523, p-value <0.05), patient's ability to request more pain relief, (Pearson Coefficient = 0.29, p-value <0.05), patient's access to information about their pain treatment options from the Nurses (Pearson coefficient = -0.22, p<0.05), were the only predictors of satisfaction in patients.This study found out that patients were generally satisfied with the post-operative pain management offered by their healthcare providers although the degree of satisfaction depended largely on the type of analgesia and pain relief methods, the ability to request for more pain relief, and access to information on pain treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3164767059,"Background Plaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of red scaly plaques. To date psoriasis lesional skin transcriptome has been extensively studied, whereas only few proteomic studies of psoriatic skin are available. Aim The aim of this study was to compare protein expression patterns of lesional and normally looking skin of psoriasis patients with skin of the healthy volunteers, reveal differentially expressed proteins and identify changes in cell metabolism caused by the disease. Methods Skin samples of normally looking and lesional skin donated by psoriasis patients (n = 5) and samples of healthy skin donated by volunteers (n = 5) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After protein identification and data processing, the set of differentially expressed proteins was subjected to protein ontology analysis to characterize changes in biological processes, cell components and molecular functions in the patients’ skin compared to skin of the healthy volunteers. The expression of selected differentially expressed proteins was validated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Results The performed analysis identified 405 and 59 differentially expressed proteins in lesional and normally looking psoriatic skin compared to healthy control. In normally looking skin of the patients, we discovered decreased expression of KNG1, APOE, HRG, THBS1 and PLG. Presumably, these changes were needed to protect the epidermis from spontaneous activation of kallikrein-kinin system and delay the following development of inflammatory response. In lesional skin, we identified several large groups of proteins with coordinated expression. Mainly, these proteins were involved in different aspects of protein and RNA metabolism, namely ATP synthesis and consumption; intracellular trafficking of membrane-bound vesicles, pre-RNA processing, translation, chaperoning and degradation in proteasomes/immunoproteasomes. Conclusion Our findings explain the molecular basis of metabolic changes caused by disease in skin lesions, such as faster cell turnover and higher metabolic rate. They also indicate on downregulation of kallikrein-kinin system in normally looking skin of the patients that would be needed to delay exacerbation of the disease.

https://openalex.org/W3164703143,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks has become a serious problem, as the virus may mutate and reinfect humans; some countries have decided to cull minks. Here, the virus sequencing data in minks were analysed and compared to those of human-virus. Although the mink-virus maintained the characteristics of human-virus, some variants rapidly mutated, adapting to minks. Some mink-derived variants infected humans, which accounted for 40% of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Netherlands. These variants appear to be less lethal and infective compared to those in humans. Variants that have mutated further among minks were not found in humans. Such mink-viruses might be suitable for vaccination for humans, such as in the case of the smallpox virus, which is less infective and toxic to humans."
https://openalex.org/W3164392532,"The objective of the current study was to build predictive models for suicidal ideation in a sample of children aged 9-10 using features previously implicated in risk among older adolescent and adult populations. This case-control analysis utilized baseline data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, collected from 21 research sites across the United States (N = 11,369). Several regression and ensemble learning models were compared on their ability to classify individuals with suicidal ideation and/or attempt from healthy controls, as assessed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version. When comparing control participants (mean age: 9.92±0.62 years; 4944 girls [49%]) to participants with suicidal ideation (mean age: 9.89±0.63 years; 451 girls [40%]), both logistic regression with feature selection and elastic net without feature selection predicted suicidal ideation with an AUC of 0.70 (CI 95%: 0.70-0.71). The random forest with feature selection trained to predict suicidal ideation predicted a holdout set of children with a history of suicidal ideation and attempt (mean age: 9.96±0.62 years; 79 girls [41%]) from controls with an AUC of 0.77 (CI 95%: 0.76-0.77). Important features from these models included feelings of loneliness and worthlessness, impulsivity, prodromal psychosis symptoms, and behavioral problems. This investigation provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify suicide risk in youth. The use of machine learning to examine a large number of predictors spanning a variety of domains provides novel insight into transdiagnostic factors important for risk classification."
https://openalex.org/W3165873894,"The archaeology of Sulawesi is important for developing an understanding of human dispersal and occupation of central Island Southeast Asia. Through over a century of archaeological work, multiple human populations in the southwestern region of Sulawesi have been identified, the most well-documented being that of the Mid- to Late Holocene 'Toalean' technological period. Archaeological models for this period describe a population with a strong cultural identity, subdivided into groups living on the coastal plains around Maros as well as dispersed upland forest dwellers, hunting endemic wildlife with bow-and-arrow technology. It has been proposed that the Toaleans were capable of vast water-crossings, with possible cultural exchange with northern Australia, Java, and Japan. This Toalean paradigm is built almost exclusively on existing interpretations of distinctive Toalean stone and bone artefact technologies, constructed on out-dated 19th and 20th century theory. Moreover, current definitions of Toalean artefact types are inconsistently applied and unsystematic, and the manufacturing sequence has historically been poorly understood. To address these problems in existing artefact models and typologies, we present a clarified typology of the Toalean artefacts of South Sulawesi, and describe the technical aspects of artefact production. This typology provides a tool for standardising research and will facilitate more meaningful assessments of material culture repertoires and more reliable assessment of spatial and temporal changes for the region."
https://openalex.org/W3165157406,"Dentin Sialoprotein (DSP) and phosphophoryn (PP) are two most dominant non-collagenous proteins in dentin, which are the cleavage products of the DSPP (dentin sialophosphoprotein) precursor protein. The absence of the DSPP gene in DSPP knock-out (KO) mice results in characteristics that are consistent with dentinogenesis imperfecta type III in humans. Symptoms include thin dentin, bigger pulp chamber with frequent pulp exposure as well as abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and the appearance of chondrocyte-like cells in dental pulp. To better understand how DSPP influences tooth development and dentin formation, we used a bacterial artificial chromosome transgene construct (BAC-DSPP) that contained the complete DSPP gene and promoter to generate BAC-DSPP transgenic mice directly in a mouse DSPP KO background. Two BAC-DSPP transgenic mouse strains were generated and characterized. DSPP mRNA expression in BAC-DSPP Strain A incisors was similar to that from wild-type (wt) mice. DSPP mRNA expression in BAC-DSPP Strain B animals was only 10% that of wt mice. PP protein content in Strain A incisors was 25% of that found in wt mice, which was sufficient to completely rescue the DSPP KO defect in mineral density, since microCT dentin mineral density analysis in 21-day postnatal animal molars showed essentially identical mineral density in both strain A and wt mice. Strain B mouse incisors, with 5% PP expression, only partially rescued the DSPP KO defect in mineral density, as microCT scans of 21-day postnatal animal molars indicated a reduced dentin mineral density compared to wt mice, though the mineral density was still increased over that of DSPP KO. Furthermore, our findings showed that DSPP dosage in Strain A was sufficient to rescue the DSPP KO defect in terms of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, odontoblast lineage maintenance, along with normal dentin thickness and normal mineral density while DSPP gene dosage in Strain B only partially rescued the aforementioned DSPP KO defect."
https://openalex.org/W3164257580,"Background Despite national guidelines promoting hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing in prisons, there is substantial heterogeneity on the implementation of HCV testing in jails. We sought to better understand barriers and opportunities for HCV testing by interviewing a broad group of stakeholders involved in HCV testing and treatment policies and procedures in Massachusetts jails. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with people incarcerated in Middlesex County Jail (North Billerica, MA), clinicians working in jail and community settings, corrections administrators, and representatives from public health, government, and industry between November 2018—April 2019. Results 51/120 (42%) of people agreed to be interviewed including 21 incarcerated men (mean age 32 [IQR 25, 39], 60% non-White). Themes that emerged from these interviews included gaps in knowledge about HCV testing and treatment opportunities in jail, the impact of captivity and transience, and interest in improving linkage to HCV care after release. Many stakeholders discussed stigma around HCV infection as a factor in reluctance to provide HCV testing or treatment in the jail setting. Some stakeholders expressed that stigma often led decisionmakers to estimate a lower “worth” of incarcerated individuals living with HCV and therefore to decide against paying for HCV testing.”. Conclusion All stakeholders agreed that HCV in the jail setting is a public health issue that needs to be addressed. Exploring stakeholders’ many ideas about how HCV testing and treatment can be approached is the first step in developing feasible and acceptable strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3164207851,"Seefeldt`s classic motor development pyramid model recognizes the significance of fundamental movement skills (FMS) in physical activities and proposes a “proficiency barrier” between FMS and higher-level specific sports skills during middle childhood. However, the relationship between the layers of the conceptual model has not been empirically tested. This study investigated motor fitness (MF), FMS, and quality of movement patterns (QMP) in 7–10 years old children and evaluated the relationships among them. A total of 117 children were randomly selected to take tests of MF, the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2), and the Functional Movement Screen (FMS ™ ). MF and FMS levels were classified according to percentile ranges. Two multiple (R×C) Chi-Square tests were applied to analyze the relationships between MF, FMS, and QMP. Post-hoc testing estimated the possibility of FMS and QMP to predict MF. The results showed that boys scored significantly higher on the object-control subtest and on the TGMD-2 compared to girls (p&lt;0.001), while girls scored significantly higher on the FMS ™ ( p = 0.001). FMS score and QMP level were weakly correlated with MF (FMS: χ 2 = 14.605, p = 0.006, Cramer`s V = 0.25; QMP: χ 2 = 13.943, p = 0.007, Cramer`s V = 0.24). Thus, 60.5% of children with “excellent” FMS and 59.6% with “high” QMP were categorized as having a “good” MF. In contrast, only 23.1% of children with “poor” FMS and 24.3% with “low” QMP were classified as having a “good” MF. Our results confirm MF, FMS, and QMP are correlated with each other, although this relationship is weak. Further, a possible motor skill proficiency barrier exists already in children 7–10 years old. The study results support the promotion of physical activity and motor skill development in primary school children."
https://openalex.org/W3164605665,"As members of cultural groups, humans continually adhere to social norms and conventions. Researchers have hypothesized that even young children are motivated to act conventionally, but support for this hypothesis has been indirect and open to other interpretations. To further test this hypothesis, we invited 3.5-year-old children (N = 104) to help set up items for a tea party. Children first indicated which items they preferred but then heard an informant (either an adult or another child) endorse other items in terms of either conventional norms or personal preferences. Children conformed (i.e., overrode their own preference to follow the endorsement) more when the endorsements were framed as norms than when they were framed as preferences, and this was the case whether the informant was an adult or another child. The priority of norms even when stated by another child opposes the interpretation that children only conformed in deference to adult authority. These findings suggest that children are motivated to act conventionally, possibly as an adaptation for living in cultural groups."
https://openalex.org/W3165014476,"In every kingdom of life, GC-&gt;AT transitions occur more frequently than any other type of mutation due to the spontaneous deamination of cytidine. In eukaryotic genomes, this slow loss of GC base pairs is counteracted by biased gene conversion which increases genomic GC content as part of the recombination process. However, this type of biased gene conversion has not been observed in bacterial genomes, so we hypothesized that GC-&gt;AT transitions cause a reduction of genomic GC content in prokaryotic genomes on an evolutionary time scale. To test this hypothesis, we used a phylogenetic approach to analyze triplets of closely related genomes representing a wide range of the bacterial kingdom. The resulting data indicate that genomic GC content is drifting downward in bacterial genomes where GC base pairs comprise 40% or more of the total genome. In contrast, genomes containing less than 40% GC base pairs have fewer opportunities for GC-&gt;AT transitions to occur so genomic GC content is relatively stable or actually increasing. It should be noted that this observed change in genomic GC content is the net change in shared parts of the genome and does not apply to parts of the genome that have been lost or acquired since the genomes being compared shared common ancestor. However, a more detailed analysis of two Caulobacter genomes revealed that the acquisition of mobile elements by the two genomes actually reduced the total genomic GC content as well."
https://openalex.org/W3165602438,"Prevalence of cognitive impairment increases with worsening severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and majority of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on dialysis have cognitive impairment. Trends of cognitive function (CF) in this population are less well known with published studies reporting conflicting results.We assessed CF in a cohort of non-dialysis CKD and ESKD patients undergoing dialysis using modified mini-mental state examination (3MS), trail-making test (TMT-A & B) scores and Stroop task, and evaluated demographics, comorbidities and depression using Beck depression inventory at baseline. We repeated tests of CF and depression ≥ 1-year after baseline in both groups and compared change scores in CF and depression between ESKD/ CKD sub-groups. Among ESKD patients we compared change scores between patients with dialysis vintage of <1-year and >1-year. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for the effect of age on these change scores.At baseline (N = 211), compared to CKD (N = 108), ESKD (N = 103) patients had significantly worse CF based on 3MS and TMT-A & B scores, and depression scores. On follow-up (N = 160) 3MS scores, especially the memory subscale significantly improved in ESKD, but worsened in CKD, with no significant changes in TMT A /TMT-B, or depression scores after adjusting for age. Among ESKD patients, 3MS, especially memory subscale improved in patients with dialysis vintage <1-year compared to >1-year. The 51 patients who discontinued after baseline assessment had worse baseline CF scores suggesting differential attrition.Though baseline cognitive scores were worse in ESKD patients on dialysis, compared to CKD, their 3MS, especially memory subscale improved on follow-up. Among ESKD patients, the improvement was significant only in patients who have been on dialysis for less than one-year which may indicate a beneficial effect of clearance of uraemic toxins. Differential attrition of study subjects may have impacted the observed results."
https://openalex.org/W3164210851,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) are important for cell homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Here, we show that IPF BAL cells exhibited increased mitochondrial biogenesis that is, in part, due to increased nuclear expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ɣ (PPARɣ) coactivator (PGC)-1α. Increased PPARGC1A mRNA expression directly correlated with reduced pulmonary function in IPF subjects. Oxidant-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK via Akt1 regulated PGC-1α activation to increase mitochondrial biogenesis in monocyte-derived macrophages. Demonstrating the importance of PGC-1α in fibrotic repair, mice harboring a conditional deletion of Ppargc1a in monocyte-derived macrophages or mice administered a chemical inhibitor of mitochondrial division had reduced biogenesis and increased apoptosis, and the mice were protected from pulmonary fibrosis. These observations suggest that Akt1-mediated regulation of PGC-1α maintains mitochondrial homeostasis in monocyte-derived macrophages to induce apoptosis resistance, which contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis."

This study aimed to assess the proprieties of a questionnaire created to evaluate parental practices, preferences, skills and attitudes regarding fruit and vegetables (F&V), sugar and salt. Participants (n = 714) were families of pre-school children (aged 2-6 years old) of the Nutriscience Project-a web-based gamification program-who answered a questionnaire assessing socio-demographic characteristics, nutrition knowledge, and a scale evaluating parental practices, preferences, skills and attitudes, at the baseline of the project. Exploratory factorial analysis was applied to the scale: 21 items and 5 factors were extracted (52.4% of explained variance) with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value of 0.770: 1. Modelling/active promotion of F&V consumption (α = 0.73), 2. Skills for choosing/preparing healthy food (α = 0.75), 3. Food preferences and satiety perception (α = 0.70), 4. Awareness regarding sugar/salt intake (α = 0.61), 5. Allowance regarding F&V consumption (α = 0.55). Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to compare factors according to socio-demographic characteristics. Higher scores for parental modelling and active promotion of F&V consumption were observed in older parents, those with higher nutrition knowledge and who reported to live without income difficulties. Regarding food preferences, higher scores were observed in mothers, with higher nutrition knowledge and from higher educated groups. Higher awareness regarding salt and sugar consumption were observed in older parents, with higher education, higher nutrition knowledge and with female children. Older parents and with female children also registered higher scores of skills for choosing/preparing healthy food. The scale showed satisfactory proprieties and may contribute to assess family food environment using a multidimensional approach. It also highlighted the importance of considering socio-demographic characteristics in interventions to promote healthy eating."
https://openalex.org/W3164330199,"With a possible reference to heat priming and to characterize the extent and variation in the heat stress responses in wheat, the effects of single vs. repeated heat stresses were examined by measuring the changes in morphological and grain yield-related traits and photosynthetic parameters. To achieve these objectives, 51 winter wheat cultivars of various geographic origins were included in two independent experiments covering different phenological stages. In Experiment I, a single heat stress event was applied at stem elongation (SE) and booting (B), and the repeated heat stress was applied at both of these stages (SE+B). In Experiment II, the single heat stress was applied at stem elongation (SE) and full heading (CH), while the repeated heat stress was applied at both stages (SE+CH). While genotype was a more important factor for determining the morphological and yield-related traits, it was the treatment effect that mostly influenced the photosynthetic parameters, with the exception of the chlorophyll content. The heading stage was more sensitive to heat stress than the booting stage, which was primarily due to the larger decrease in the average seed number. The importance of biomass in contributing to grain yield intensified with the heat stress treatments. There was a large variation between the wheat cultivars not only in yielding abilities under control conditions but also in sensitivities to the various heat stresses, based on which 7 distinct groups with specific response profiles could be identified at a highly significant level. The 7 wheat groups were also characterized by their reaction patterns of different magnitudes and directions in their responses to single vs. repeated heat stresses, which depended on the phenological phases during the second cycle of heat stress. The possible association between these findings and heat priming is discussed."

Ten-year overall survival after SLNB was 75% (95%CI, 71%-78%) compared to 61% (95%CI 57%-64%) following observation. After adjustment for risk factors, a lower risk on death (HR = 0.80, 95%CI 0.66-0.96) was found after SLNB compared to observation only.SLNB in patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma on trunk or limb resulted in a 14% absolute and significant 10-year survival difference compared to those without SLNB."
https://openalex.org/W3164595228,"Cardiothoracic surgeries are life-saving procedures but often it results in various complications. Intraoperative cerebral oximetry monitoring used to detect regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) is a non-invasive method that provides prognostic importance in cardiac surgery. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of intraoperative cerebral oxygen monitoring during cardiac surgery on postoperative complications. This was a case-controlled retrospective study conducted on adult patients, who underwent open-heart surgery in National Heart Institute, Malaysia. The case group comprised patients on protocolized cerebral oximetry monitoring. They were treated using a standardized algorithm to maintain rScO2 not lower than 20% of baseline rScO2. The control group comprised patients with matched demographic background, preoperative risk factors, and type of surgical procedures. Propensity score stratification was utilized to contend with selection bias. Retrospective analysis was performed on 240 patients (case group) while comparing it to 407 patients (control group). The non-availability of cerebral oximetry monitoring during surgery was the prominent predictor for all outcome of complications; stroke (OR: 7.66), renal failure needing dialysis (OR: 5.12) and mortality (OR: 20.51). Postoperative complications revealed that there were significant differences for risk of mortality (p<0.001, OR = 20.51), renal failure that required dialysis (p<0.001, OR = 5.12) and stroke (p <0.05, OR = 7.66). Protocolized cerebral oximetry monitoring during cardiothoracic surgeries was found to be associated with lower incidence of stroke, renal failure requiring dialysis and mortality rate."
https://openalex.org/W3165225621,"To evaluate actions taken to implement the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the primary goal of which was to foster competition in the industry, the FCC created a standardized form (Form 477) to collect information about broadband deployment and competition in local telephone service. These data represent the best publicly available record of broadband provision in the United States. Despite the potential benefits offered by this database, there are several nuances to these data related to shifting geographies and reporting requirements that uncorrected, prevent them from being used as an uninterrupted time series for longitudinal analyses. Given the analytical challenges associated with the FCC Form 477 data, the purpose of this paper is to present a solution to the fragmented nature of these data which prevents meaningful longitudinal analyses of the digital divide. Specifically, this paper develops and describes a procedure for producing an integrated broadband time series (BITS) for the last decade (2008-2018). This includes the procedures for using these data, their value to social and economic analysis, and their underlying limitations. The core contribution of this paper is the creation of data infrastructure for investigating the evolution of the digital divide."

This study was conducted to determine the effect of indoor air pollution (IAP) due to solid fuel combustion on physical growth in 262 Sri Lankan children under five. Exposure was defined by the type of fuel used for cooking. Pollutant levels were measured in a subsample of households. “High” exposure group (households using biomass fuel/kerosene oil for cooking) comprised 60% of the study population; the prevalence of wasting was 19.7% and underweight was 20.4% in the entire population where 68% were from the high exposure group. Children from the “high” exposure group had significantly lower mean z-scores for weight-for-height (p = 0.047), height-for-age (p = 0.004) and weight-for-age (p = 0.001) as compared to the “low” exposure group (children of households using liquefied petroleum gas and/or electricity) after adjusting for confounders. Z-scores of weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height were negatively correlated with CO (p = 0.001, 0.018, 0.020, respectively) and PM 2.5 concentrations (p&lt;0.001,p = 0.024 p = 0.008, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W3165804663,"Ecological communities are unique assemblages of species that coexist in consequence of multi-causal processes that have proven hard to generalize. One possible exception are processes that control the biomass packing of vegetation stands; the amount of aboveground standing biomass expressed per unit volume. In this paper, I investigated the empirical and geometric underpinnings of biomass packing in terrestrial plant communities. I support that biomass packing in nature peaks around 1 kg m-3 across contrasted contexts, ranging from grasslands to forest ecosystems. Using published experimental and long-term survey data, I show that expressing biomass per unit volume cancels the effects of air temperature, species richness and soil fertility on aboveground stocks, thus providing a general comparative measure of storage efficiency in plant communities."
https://openalex.org/W3165861511,"Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a heterogeneous group of lesions arising from placental tissue. Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), derived from chorionic-type trophoblast, is the rarest form of GTD with only approximately 130 cases described in the literature. Due to its morphologic mimicry of epithelioid smooth muscle tumors and carcinoma, ETT can be misdiagnosed. To date, molecular characterization of ETTs is lacking. Furthermore, ETT is difficult to treat when disease spreads beyond the uterus. Here using RNA-Seq analysis in a cohort of ETTs and other gestational trophoblastic lesions we describe the discovery of LPCAT1-TERT fusion transcripts that occur in ETTs and coincide with underlying genomic deletions. Through cell-growth assays we demonstrate that LPCAT1-TERT fusion proteins can positively modulate cell proliferation and therefore may represent future treatment targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TERT upregulation appears to be a characteristic of ETTs, even in the absence of LPCAT1-TERT fusions, and that it appears linked to copy number gains of chromosome 5. No evidence of TERT upregulation was identified in other trophoblastic lesions tested, including placental site trophoblastic tumors and placental site nodules, which are thought to be the benign chorionic-type trophoblast counterpart to ETT. These findings indicate that LPCAT1-TERT fusions and copy-number driven TERT activation may represent novel markers for ETT, with the potential to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for women with this rare form of GTD."
https://openalex.org/W3165862434,"Acute blood pressure lowering after exercise seems to predict the extent of blood pressure reduction after chronic exercise training interventions. Based on that, the same weekly amount of exercise performed more frequently could be more beneficial for controlling blood pressure.To compare the effects of a combined training program (resistance plus aerobic exercise) performed four or two times per week on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and other health-related outcomes in middle-aged and older individuals with hypertension.This study will be a randomized, parallel group, two-arm, superiority trial. Ninety-eight participants aged 50-80 years with a previous physician diagnosis of hypertension will be randomized to perform two or four sessions per week of combined training using the same total weekly overload. Primary outcomes will be 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and glycosylated hemoglobin; secondary outcomes will be endothelial function, physical fitness and quality of life. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks period.Our conceptual hypothesis is that a combined exercise program performed four or two times per week with equalized weekly volume/overload will improve all outcomes in comparison to the baseline values, and that reductions in 24-h blood pressure and glycosylated hemoglobin will be more pronounced in the group that trained four times a week than twice. The results of this trial are expected to provide evidences to support that higher weekly frequency of combined training should be emphasized in aging adults with hypertension."

Factors included demographic information of the victim (age, gender, and occupation), type of invasive animals (dog, cat, and other types), time of bite (year, month, and hour), place of residence (urban or rural), and injury and treatment statuses. We also obtained national and provincial animal bite incidence data for all of Iran and for Golestan province for the longer interval 2013-2020 to examine broader time trends. We used SPSS version 19, QGIS version 3.1, and Excel 2013 to generate frequency distributions and descriptive statistics.The incidence rates of animal bites in Golestan province and Iran as a whole both increased smoothly. The latest incidence rate of animal bites in Golestan was 652 per 100,000 people, almost three times the overall national figure for 2020. Most cases of animal bites (67.6%) occurred in rural areas, and 36% of the victims aged under 19 years old. Dog and cat bites accounted for the great majority of cases (89% and 8%, respectively). The highest rate of animal bites was reported in the spring (30.8%). The lower limb was the most commonly bitten area in these individuals (64.6%). Of note, 87% of the cases received incomplete prophylactic post-exposure treatment, and 18% received immunoglobulin.The increasing rates of animal bites in the study area as well as the higher rate compared to the national average indicates the need for further review of animal bite control programs."
https://openalex.org/W3164848032,"Evaluating RNA quality and transcriptomic profile of beef muscle over time post-mortem may provide insight into RNA degradation and underlying biological and functional mechanisms that accompany biochemical changes occurring post-mortem during transformation of muscle to meat. RNA was extracted from longissimus thoracis (LT) sampled from British Continental crossbred heifer carcasses (n = 7) stored at 4°C in an abattoir drip cooler at 5 time points post-mortem, i.e., 45 min (0 h), 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Following RNA-Sequencing, processed reads were aligned to the ARS-UCD1.2 bovine genome assembly. Subsequent differential expression (DE) analysis identified from 51 to 1434 upregulated and 27 to 2256 downregulated DE genes at individual time points compared to time 0 h, showing a trend for increasing counts of both upregulated and downregulated genes over time. Gene ontology and biological pathway term enrichment analyses on sets of DE genes revealed several processes and their timelines of activation/deactivation that accompanied or were involved with muscle transformation to meat. Although the quality of RNA in refrigerated LT remained high for several days post-mortem, the expression levels of several known biomarker genes for meat quality began to change from 24 h onwards. Therefore, to ensure accuracy of predictions on meat quality traits based on the expression levels of those biomarker genes in refrigerated beef muscle tissue, it is crucial that those expression measurements be made on RNA sampled within 24 h post-mortem. The present study also highlighted the need for more research on the roles of mitochondrial genes and non-coding genes in orchestrating muscle tissue processes after death, and how pre-mortem immune status might influence post-mortem meat quality."
https://openalex.org/W3165183094,"Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is increasingly being used for the survey of vocalising wildlife species that are otherwise cryptic and difficult to survey. Our study aimed to develop PAM guidelines for detecting the Yellow-bellied Glider, a highly vocal arboreal marsupial that occurs in native Eucalyptus forests in eastern and south-eastern Australia. To achieve this, we considered the influence of background noise, weather conditions, lunar illumination, time since sunset and season on the probability of detecting vocalisations. We deployed Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) at 43 sites in the Central Highlands of Victoria during two periods: spring/summer (October 2018 to January 2019), and autumn/winter (May to August 2019). ARUs were programmed to record for 11 hours from sunset for 14 consecutive days during each period. Background noise resulted from inclement weather (wind and rain) and masked vocalisations in spectrograms of the recordings, thus having the greatest influence on detection probability. Vocalisations were most common in the four hours after sunset. Rainfall negatively influenced detection probability, especially during the autumn/winter sampling period. Detection of Yellow-bellied Gliders with PAM requires deploying ARUs programmed to record for four hours after sunset, for a minimum of six nights with minimal inclement weather (light or no wind or rain). The survey period should be extended to 12 nights when rain or wind are forecast. Because PAM is less labour intensive than active surveys (i.e., spotlighting and call playbacks with multiple observers and several nights’ survey per site), its use will facilitate broad-scale surveys for Yellow-bellied Gliders."
https://openalex.org/W3165655222,"Stunting undermines economic growth by perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty and labour market performance. Studies have captured the trend in stunting and present distributional evidence of policy effects in the country contexts. We identify the determinants of U5 (under 5 years of age) malnutrition for the poor and the Nonpoor and compare the distribution of stunting at four time points (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015) over a 15-year period between different groups of population. Further, we decompose the gap in malnutrition into causes of differences in stunting between worse-off and better-off socioeconomic groups of the population and estimate the magnitude of distributional differences in stunting between two socioeconomic groups. We also present the inequality trend over time that provides insights into the dynamicity of the effect of different determinants on stunting at different time points. Using 35,490 observations from Armenian Demographic and Health Survey Data [four waves: Year2015,9533; Year2010,8644; Year2005,8919; Year2000,8334], we apply regression-based decomposition method and inequality measures to identify the determinants of malnutrition and distribution of stunting between and within socioeconomic groups. Although the proportional difference in prevalence of stunting between worse-off and better-off children of 13 months and above are reduced by 9.5% in 2015 compared to 2000, the association between socioeconomic position and stunting is statistically significant among children aged 13 months and above in 2000, as well as among children of 36 months and above in 2015. This study demonstrates that the less of socioeconomic distribution of the population, but rather more of the effect from in-country region and settlement of residence are significantly associated with stunting. The approach of our analysis is potentially also a useful tool to generate evidence for decision making towards achieving SDGs 2.2. We conclude that development in childhood is not independent from the distributional effect of region specific development initiatives. Understanding the regional characteristics and resources allocated for the maternal and child health is the necessity to address stunting."
https://openalex.org/W3165692854,"The hostile media effect describes the tendency for partisans to evaluate media content as relatively biased against their positions. The present study investigates what specific contextual elements of a news report contribute to this effect and how it may be mitigated by the depth of content evaluation. A online study of 102 participants revealed that less bias is perceived in a newspaper article when evaluating specific aspects of the article with the text available for reference than when evaluating the overall bias without referring to the text. Moreover, being asked to consider overall article bias increased subsequent ratings of bias in the discrete elements of the text. These results suggest that the perception of media bias may be counteracted by encouraging deep, evidence-based considerations of where the alleged bias might lie, but only if this happens before the reader has the chance to form an opinion based on a cursory assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3113155779,"Introduction The continuum of care is a recommended framework for comprehensive health service delivery for maternal health, and it integrates health system and social determinants of health. There is a current lack of knowledge on a measurement approach to monitor performance on the framework. In this study we aim to develop and test a composite index for assessing the maternal health continuum in a province in South Africa with the possibility of nationwide use. Materials and methods The composite index was computed as a geometric mean of four dimensions of adequacy of the continuum of care. Data was sourced from the district health information system, household surveys and the census. The index formula was tested for robustness when alternative inputs for indicators and standardization methods were used. The index was used to assess performance in service delivery in the North West province of South Africa, as well as its four districts over a five-year period (2013–2017). The index was validated by assessing associations with maternal health and other outcomes. And factor analysis was used to assess the statistical dimensions of the index. Results The provincial level index score increased from 62.3 in 2013 to 74 in 2017, showing general improvement in service delivery over time. The district level scores also improved over time, and our analysis identified areas for performance improvement. These include social determinants of health in some districts, and access and linkages to care in others. The provincial index was correlated with institutional maternal mortality rates (r s = -0.90, 90% CI = (-1.00, -0.25)) and the Human Development Index (r = 0.97, 95% CI = (0.63, 0.99). It was robust to alternative approaches including z-score standardization of indicators. Factor analysis showed three groupings of indicators for the health system and social determinants of health. Conclusions This study demonstrated the development and testing of a composite index to monitor and assess service delivery on the continuum of care for maternal health. The index was shown to be robust and valid, and identified potential areas for service improvement. A contextualised version can be tested in other settings within and outside of South Africa."

Issues, such as the type of data gathered, tools and methods employed, and the size and number of destinations, are addressed, as is the consideration of a specified time period. The proposal is based on the information given by linear regression equations, which not only enables the behaviour of destinations to be observed over time, but also facilitates their comparison. The data employed was from the period 2000-2019. Cluster Analysis was introduced to group destinations according to their performance. Moreover, various aggregation methods are proposed to obtain competitiveness rankings. A comparison between destinations was carried out using the non-aggregative and an aggregative approach. Certain destinations attained better positions than others that are considered as being more competitive in global international rankings. Five clusters were clearly identified. The results were consistent with the World Travel and Tourism Council outputs and underlined the importance attached to tourism development in the destinations from Central America and the Caribbean."

We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of a group of heavy drinkers, without evidence of CLD at baseline.A cohort of 123 long-term heavy drinkers without CLD were prospectively recruited in 2002 and retrospectively followed until 2018.At baseline (2002), median alcohol consumption was 271±203g/day during 21.5±20 years, 65% being abstinent during the previous 1.75±5 months. Patients were followed for 14±3 years. During follow-up, 53% reported any alcohol intake. Alcohol consumption during follow-up associated weakly with either 1- or 6-months previous abstinence at baseline. Until 2018, progression to CLD occurred in 6%, associating with years of alcohol intake during follow-up (OR 1.15 [1.01-1.31]) and baseline alkaline-phosphatase (OR 1.05 [1.01-1.10]). During follow-up, being abstinent for at least 1 year positively associated with CLD-free survival. 27% died (55% of cancer-mostly oropharyngeal cancer, 27% of cardiovascular disease, and 9% of liver disease), with a mean age of 71 years [69-74] (10 years less than the expected in the Portuguese population). Achieving abstinence for at least 1 year positively associated with overall survival, while smoking, and hepatic steatosis at baseline associated negatively.Long-term heavy drinkers seemed to have a decreased life expectancy compared with the overall Portuguese population. Cancer was the main cause of death. Our results suggest that progression to CLD depends mostly on continued alcohol intake. Alcohol abstinence, even if temporary, seems to decrease the risks of CLD and mortality."

A recent report has shown Stockholm to have a lower incidence of stillbirth at term than other parts of Sweden. The risk of antepartum stillbirth increases in late term and postterm pregnancies which is one of the factors contributing to the current discussion regarding the optimal time of induction of labor due to postterm pregnancy.This is a cohort study based on the Stockholm Stillbirth Database which contains all cases of stillbirth from 1998-2018 in Stockholm County. All cases were reviewed systematically and the cause of death was evaluated according to the Stockholm Stillbirth Classification. Stillbirths diagnosed between gestational week (GW) 37+0 and 40+6 n = 605 were compared to stillbirths diagnosed from GW 41+0 and onwards n = 157, according to the cause of stillbirth and pregnancy and maternal characteristics. The aim was to evaluate the incidence of stillbirth over time and the incidence of stillbirth diagnosed from GW 41+0.In Stockholm County the overall incidence of stillbirth has decreased from 4.6/1000 births during the period 1998-2004 to 3.4/1000 births during the period 2014-2018, p-value <0.001. When comparing the same time periods, the incidence of stillbirth diagnosed from GW 41+0 and onwards has decreased from 0.5/1000 births to 0.15/1000 births, p-value <0.001.

Data on the short-term cost were based on a real-world screening programme in which 2025 healthy individuals were screened for hypertension. Data on the long-term cost were based on the short-term outcomes combined with modelling in a Markov cohort model. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess uncertainty.The short-term analysis showed an additional cost of 4,800 SEK (€470) per identified case of hypertension from the payer perspective and from the societal perspective 12,800 SEK (€1,240). The long-term analysis showed a payer cost per QALY of 2.2 million SEK (€210,000) and from the societal perspective 2.8 million SEK per QALY (€270,000).The long-term model results showed that the screening model is unlikely to be cost-effective in a country with a well-developed health-care system and a relatively low prevalence of hypertension."

Coronary artery calcium was assessed through computed tomography of the coronary arteries and with coronary artery scoring, CACS. Main outcome was CACS ≥100 compared to CACS 0. Job demand and control was analysed according to the standard categorization of the two variables into: high strain, active, passive and low strain (reference). Associations between these variables and CACS were calculated with prevalence ratios (PR) using Cox regression with robust variance, 95% confidence intervals (CI) and adjusted for age, smoking, education, socioeconomic area and metabolic syndrome.In total 777 participants were used in our analyses, for which 20% of the men and 5% of the women had CACS ≥100, respectively. The PR of having CACS ≥100 was non-significantly elevated for men in high strain jobs 1.54 (95% CI 0.88-2.69) and in active jobs 1.67 (95% CI 0.92-3.06), adjusted for covariates. For women there was no association between exposure to high strain and having CACS ≥100 PR 1.02 (95% CI 0.24-4.31). Among women reporting passive job, the PR was non-significantly elevated, 2.40 (95% CI 0.83-6.92), adjusted for covariates.The statistical power of the study was limited, but our results suggests the possibility that exposure to a high strain or an active job situation may increase the risk of CACS in men, while in women, it may rather be exposure to passive job."
https://openalex.org/W3165708501,"Variations in health care outcomes and services potentially indicate resource allocation inefficiency. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine variations in mortality and hospitalization cases among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) care from medical facilities located in 13 secondary medical care areas (SMAs) of Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. The research was designed as a retrospective, cross-sectional study using insurance claims data. The subjects of the study were older patients (over 65 years old) insured by the Fukuoka prefecture's Latter-Stage Elderly Healthcare Insurance. Using an electronic claims database, we identified patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who had received HD care from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. The CKD status was identified using International Classification of Disease, 10th revision code, and HD maintenance status was ascertained using specific insurance procedure codes. A total of 5,243 patients met our inclusion criteria and their records were subsequently reviewed. About 73% (n = 3,809) of patients had admission records during the period studied. Thus, the data regarding hospital length of stay (LOS) and admission costs were analyzed separately. Significant differences in terms of increased risks in hospitalization were evident in a number of SMAs. An increase in mortality risk due to heart failure and malignancy was observed in two separate SMAs. Also, analyzed LOS, total hospitalization cost, and cost per day according to SMAs showed statistically significant variations. The findings highlight the magnitude of the burden of CKD and ESRD in the community. The high prevalence of ESRD, associated mortality, and hospitalized HD patients signal the need for clinicians to assume broader roles in measures against chronic kidney disease through involvement in community awareness programs. To improve patient outcomes, improvement of regional health care provision, the level of medical care, and the development of existing human resources are needed."
