Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) that are capable of continuous proliferation and neuronal differentiation are the source of such structural plasticity. Here we report that mice lacking the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in hippocampal NPCs have impaired proliferation and neurogenesis. When exposed to chronic ADs or wheel-running, no increase in proliferation or neurogenesis is observed. Ablation of TrkB also renders these mice behaviorally insensitive to antidepressive treatment in depression- and anxiety-like paradigms. In contrast, mice lacking TrkB only in differentiated DG neurons display typical neurogenesis and respond normally to chronic ADs. Thus, our data establish an essential cell-autonomous role for TrkB in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral sensitivity to antidepressive treatments, and support the notion that impairment of the neurogenic niche is an etiological factor for refractory responses to an antidepressive regimen.

Depression is a significant public health problem due to both its high prevalence and its devastating impact on individuals and society. Despite much excitement generated by recent advances in the knowledge of brain development and function, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of depression, as well as its amelioration by antidepressant (AD) treatment, remain poorly understood (Manji et al., 2001Manji H.K. Drevets W.C. Charney D.S. The cellular neurobiology of depression.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, Nestler et al., 2002Nestler E.J. Barrot M. DiLeone R.J.

Clinical studies demonstrate that 40% of depressed patients fail to respond to first-line ADs and 70% do not undergo full remission (Fagiolini and Kupfer, 2003Fagiolini A. Kupfer D.J. Is treatment-resistant depression a unique subtype of depression?.Biol.

Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress. Raven Press, New York1995: 1081-1098Google Scholar). Such a variable range of effectiveness underscores the heterogeneity of the illness and the urgent need for thorough delineation of the cellular and molecular process involved in the action of ADs. As predicted by their pharmacological characteristics, most ADs appear to act by increasing the activity of serotonergic and noradrenergic circuits (Morilak and Frazer, 2004Morilak D.A. Frazer A. Antidepressants and brain monoaminergic systems: a dimensional approach to understanding their behavioural effects in depression and anxiety disorders.Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2004; 7: 193-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, these medications usually require chronic administration for weeks to months before clinically appreciable effects are achieved. This represents an extended delay compared with the rapid increase of serotonin and noradrenaline elicited by these drugs (Frazer, 1997Frazer A. Pharmacology of antidepressants.J. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 1997; 17: 2S-18SCrossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, gradual yet essential changes to the brain that occur during the period of delay appear to be required for the response to ADs. Animal studies indicate one such delayed response is the increased production of new neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) (Malberg et al., 2000Malberg J.E. Eisch A.J. Nestler E.J. Duman R.S.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4894-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Physical activity such as running, which is considered beneficial for mental health (Salmon, 2001Salmon P. Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress: a unifying theory.Clin. Psychol. Rev. 2001; 21: 33-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), also induces increased production of neurons (van Praag et al., 1999van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). Studies in rodents have shown that upon exposure to chronic ADs or exercise, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG undergo enhanced proliferation, which drives the increase in neurogenesis (Encinas et al., 2006Encinas J.M.

Although the functional significance remains to be proven, the positive association of neurogenesis with ADs and exercise, as well as other beneficial stimulations such as diet, learning, and environmental enrichment (Alvarez-Buylla, 1992Alvarez-Buylla A.

Neurosci. 2000; 15: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), implicates it as a physiologically relevant phenomenon. Indeed, irradiation-mediated ablation of proliferating cells in the hippocampus compromises the ability of certain strains of rodents to display a behavioral response to ADs, suggesting that neurogenesis is an intrinsic requirement (Airan et al., 2007Airan R.D.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1374-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The genetic mechanism underlying this observation remains unclear. Coinciding with the elevation of neurogenesis, chronic AD exposure elicits a variety of molecular adaptations (Tardito et al., 2006Tardito D. Perez J. Tiraboschi E. Musazzi L. Racagni G. Popoli M. Signaling pathways regulating gene expression, neuroplasticity, and neurotrophic mechanisms in the action of antidepressants: a critical overview.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that link these molecular changes to the biological effects of ADs are only beginning to be unveiled. One of the molecules implicated is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose level in the hippocampus is increased by chronic, but not acute, AD exposure (Nibuya et al., 1995Nibuya M. Morinobu S. Duman R.S. Regulation of BDNF and trkB mRNA in rat brain by chronic electroconvulsive seizure and antidepressant drug treatments.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7539-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infusion of BDNF into the DG produces AD-like responses in several behavioral paradigms (Shirayama et al., 2002Shirayama Y. Chen A.C. Nakagawa S. Russell D.S. Duman R.S. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor produces antidepressant effects in behavioral models of depression.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant animals with a global reduction of BDNF have a blunted response to acute AD-induced behavioral changes (Monteggia et al., 2004Monteggia L.M. Barrot M. Powell C.M. Berton O. Galanis V. Gemelli T. Meuth S. Nagy A. Greene R.W. Nestler E.J. Essential role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in adult hippocampal function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 349-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, a single nucleotide polymorphism of the BDNF gene (val66met) that interferes with the activity-dependent secretion of BDNF protein has been associated with cognitive and structural abnormalities of the CNS (Egan et al., 2003Egan M.F. Kojima M. Callicott J.H. Goldberg T.E. Kolachana B.S. Bertolino A. Zaitsev E. Gold B. Goldman D.

Interestingly, recent generation of mutant mice carrying the same polymorphism indicates a causative link between the genetic change and elevated anxiety-like behaviors that are not normalized by ADs (Chen et al., 2006Chen Z.Y. Jing D. Bath K.G. Ieraci A. Khan T. Siao C.J. Herrera D.G. Toth M. Yang C. McEwen B.S. et al.Genetic variant BDNF (Val66Met) polymorphism alters anxiety-related behavior.Science. 2006; 314: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). These observations, coupled with evidence that exogenous BDNF promotes proliferation of hippocampal NPCs (Scharfman et al., 2005Scharfman H. Goodman J. Macleod A. Phani S. Antonelli C. Croll S. Increased neurogenesis and the ectopic granule cells after intrahippocampal BDNF infusion in adult rats.Exp. Neurol. 2005; 192: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), suggest an important role for BDNF in mediating the biological response to chronic AD treatments (Wang et al., 2008bWang J.W. Dranovsky A. Hen R. The when and where of BDNF and the antidepressant response.Biol. Psychiatry. 2008; 63: 640-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whether BDNF acts directly on NPCs in vivo, and whether its effects on NPCs then contribute to the overall influence of BDNF on AD response, is unresolved. In the present study, we conditionally ablated the gene encoding TrkB, the high-affinity receptor for BDNF, in a regional- and cell-type-specific manner. We show that NPC deletion of TrkB, either in embryos or in the adult, results in impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis and prevents behavioral improvements induced by chronic AD administration or wheel-running. In contrast, deleting TrkB in differentiated neurons of the same brain regions does not affect neurogenesis or the behavioral responses to ADs. Our findings provide genetic evidence of a functional, cell-autonomous requirement of TrkB in the neurogenic and behavioral responses to antidepressive treatments. Furthermore, our results support the notion that DG NPCs are a required component in the amelioration of depression (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao C. Deng W. Gage F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis.Cell. 2008; 132: 645-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). We and others have previously demonstrated the presence of TrkB transcripts and protein in the hippocampus (Klein et al., 1990Klein R. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Parada L.F. Expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor gene trkB is confined to the murine embryonic and adult nervous system.Development. 1990; 109: 845-850PubMed Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 1993Zhou X.F. Parada L.F. Soppet D. Rush R.A. Distribution of trkB tyrosine kinase immunoreactivity in the rat central nervous system.Brain Res. 1993; 622: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether transcripts are present in the neurogenic zone, we first examined TrkB expression in the postnatal and adult DG. In situ hybridization analysis showed prominent expression of both BDNF and TrkB in the granular layer and SGZ of the DG (Figure 1A). In particular, TrkB mRNA, represented by silver bromide grains, was detectable throughout the cellular layers of the DG (Figure 1A, right panel). To further examine whether the DG NPCs express TrkB, we utilized Nestin-GFP transgenic mice, in which GFP expression is confined to NPCs (Figure 1B) (Yu et al., 2005Yu T.S. Dandekar M. Monteggia L.M. Parada L.F. Kernie S.G. Temporally regulated expression of Cre recombinase in neural stem cells.Genesis. 2005; 41: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), GFP-positive cells from the DG of transgenic mice at various ages were isolated, and analysis of these cells by RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of NPC markers and the absence of markers from the differentiated lineages (Figure S1 available online). TrkB and BDNF mRNAs were detected in the GFP-positive cells at all ages tested (postnatal day [P] 2, 15 and 60, n = 3 animals for each, Figure 1C). Similarly, TrkB and BDNF mRNAs were also detected in neurospheres derived from the DG of adult wild-type mice (n = 3, Figure 1C). We further analyzed the distribution of TrkB protein in the progenitor population by coimmunostaining. Consistent with its mRNA distribution, TrkB protein was detected in all layers of the adult DG; confocal microscopy revealed its presence in both proliferating progenitors that are Ki67 positive (86.2%, n = 160 cells from three animals) and immature neurons that express Doublecortin (94.9%, n = 177 cells from three animals) (Figure 1D). Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of TrkB mRNA and protein in hippocampal NPCs. Germline homozygous TrkB knockout animals die shortly after birth. To investigate the role of TrkB in postnatal stages, conditional knockout animals were generated by crossing mice harboring the TrkB flox alleles to transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase either under the human GFAP (hGFAP) promoter or the Synapsin I (Syn) promoter (He et al., 2004He X.P. Kotloski R. Nef S. Luikart B.W. Parada L.F. McNamara J.O. Conditional deletion of TrkB but not BDNF prevents epileptogenesis in the kindling model.Neuron. 2004; 43: 31-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, Luikart et al., 2005Luikart B.W. Nef S. Virmani T. Lush M.E. Liu Y. Kavalali E.T. Parada L.F. TrkB has a cell-autonomous role in the establishment of hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3774-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In both the hGFAP-Cre and the Syn-Cre transgenic animals, the pattern of Cre expression allows recombination throughout the forebrain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. In other regions of the brain, such as the midbrain (dopaminergic neurons) and brainstem (serotonergic neurons), Cre expression is minimal (Figure S4 and not shown). When these transgenic animals were interbred with Rosa26-stop-lacZ reporter mice (R26) (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) and analyzed at the age of 2 months, a majority of the neurons in the aforementioned regions appeared to express functional beta-galactosidase (β-gal) (Figure 2A and not shown). However, when such animals were analyzed at a younger age (P10), a distinct anatomical difference in the recombination patterns of the two Cre lines was observed in the DG. In the R26hGFAP animal most cells throughout the DG expressed β-gal, whereas in the R26Syn animal, β-gal expression was confined to the outer layers of the DG, while the SGZ and inner granule layer, where NPCs and immature neurons reside, were essentially spared of recombination (Figure 2A). We next enriched NPCs from 2-month-old mice by culturing primary cells from the DG in neurosphere-forming media (Figure 2B). Upon X-gal staining, neurospheres isolated from the DG of R26hGFAP mice, but not those from the R26Syn or control mice, stained positive for β-gal activity, indicating that recombination only occurred in the hippocampal NPCs from the R26hGFAP mice (Figure 2C). Thus, the masking of X-gal staining difference in the adult DG (Figure 2A, left panels) was likely the result of the considerably reduced numbers of NPCs and immature neuron populations at this age compared with those of P10. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that in adult mice the Syn-Cre transgene can only elicit recombination in differentiated neurons, while the hGFAP-Cre transgene affects both NPCs and neurons. The effective ablation of TrkB with hGFAP-Cre was further demonstrated by immunoblotting for TrkB in the hippocampus of adult mice (Figure 2D), and by RT-PCR detection of TrkB mRNA in FACS-isolated, Nestin-GFP-positive DG NPCs (Figure 2E). Therefore by utilizing these two different Cre transgenic lines, differences between genetic ablation of the TrkB gene in the granule layer of the DG and additional ablation in the SGZ where progenitors reside can be studied. The conditional knockout animals, carrying either the hGFAP-Cre (TrkBhGFAP) or the Syn-Cre (TrkBSyn), are viable at birth and have normal survival rates (up to 15 months recorded) (Luikart et al., 2005Luikart B.W. Nef S. Virmani T. Lush M.E. Liu Y. Kavalali E.T. Parada L.F. TrkB has a cell-autonomous role in the establishment of hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3774-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The TrkBhGFAP mice displayed a significant reduction in the volume of the DG granular layer (Figures 3A and 3B) that first became measurable at P10. The volume reduction stabilized at around 30% after the initial postnatal weeks and persisted throughout adulthood. This abnormality was not caused by changes in cell density or cell size (Figure 3D; p > 0.2), but rather was a result of decrease in the number of granule neurons, evidenced by a significant reduction in the thickness of the DG granular layer (Figure 3C; n = 6 for each, F2,15 = 5.477, p = 0.0164). The number and morphology of glial cells were not appreciably affected in the TrkBhGFAP mice (Figure S3 and not shown). The reduction of volume was most prominently observed in the hippocampus and DG, and did not appear to be a secondary result of a broader developmental defect, because the TrkBhGFAP mice had normal body and brain size at all ages examined (Figure S2). We also measured the volumes of other anatomical regions, such as the striatum, in 2-month-old TrkBhGFAP mice and found normal volume (23.62 ± 0.94 mm3 in controls, 23.32 ± 1.06 mm3 in TrkBhGFAP, n = 6 for each, p > 0.2). The TrkBSyn animals, contrary to the TrkBhGFAP mice, displayed normal development of the DG granular layer (Figures 3A–3C). These observations demonstrate that TrkB expression in the SGZ is required for the normal structural development of the DG. The phenotypic difference between the TrkBhGFAP and TrkBSyn mice suggests a cell-autonomous function of TrkB in the DG NPCs. We have previously reported that conditional deletion of BDNF using the hGFAP-Cre transgene (BDNFhGFAP) resulted in 80% reduction of BDNF protein level in the hippocampus (Monteggia et al., 2007Monteggia L.M. Luikart B. Barrot M. Theobold D. Malkovska I. Nef S. Parada L.F. Nestler E.J. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor conditional knockouts show gender differences in depression-related behaviors.Biol. Psychiatry. 2007; 61: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar); we note that these mice also displayed significantly reduced DG granular layer volume, indicating a ligand-receptor coincidence (Figures 3E and 3F, n = 8–10 for each genotype, p < 0.005). Given the apparent reduction in the number of granule neurons in TrkBhGFAP mice, but not TrkBSyn mice, we examined whether lack of TrkB in the NPCs affected the neurogenic capacity of the SGZ. Control and TrkB mutant animals were evaluated at P15, during a period in which the DG undergoes dynamic morphogenesis (Altman and Bayer, 1990Altman J. Bayer S.A. Migration and distribution of two populations of hippocampal granule cell precursors during the perinatal and postnatal periods.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The number of NeuroD-positive, newly generated neurons was drastically reduced in the TrkBhGFAP mice, whereas the number in TrkBSyn mice was comparable with that of the control mice (Figure 4A). Thus, TrkB ablation in the NPCs, but not in differentiated neurons, impairs hippocampal neurogenesis. Reduced neurogenesis in the absence of TrkB could be caused by increased cell death, decreased proliferation, or a combination of both processes. We first examined programmed cell death using TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for activated caspase 3. At all time points examined, the number of apoptotic cells detected with either method was uniformly low and no measurable increase was observed in the TrkBhGFAP mice, indicating that lack of TrkB did not appreciably affect survival in vivo (Figure S3; n = 6 for each, p > 0.2). We next assessed proliferation by measuring the number of cells that incorporate the DNA synthesis marker 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). P15 mice were treated with pulses of BrdU and sacrificed 24 hr after the first injection. Within the area encompassing the inner granular layer and SGZ, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the TrkBhGFAP mice displayed a 48% reduction compared with that of control mice (Figures 4B and 4C; n = 7–9 for each; F2,21 = 78.39, p < 0.0001; p < 0.001 for post hoc test of control to TrkBhGFAP comparison). Similarly, the number of cells positive for Ki67, an endogenous marker for actively cycling cells, was decreased by 51% in the SGZ of the TrkBhGFAP mice (Figures 4B and 4C; n = 7–9 for each; F2,21 = 51.64, p < 0.0001; p < 0.001 for post hoc test of control to TrkBhGFAP comparison). Again, the numbers of BrdU- or Ki67-positive cells were unaffected in the DG of the TrkBSyn mice (Figures 4B and 4C; p > 0.2 for control to TrkBSyn comparisons). To further investigate the cellular abnormality that leads to the significant decrease of proliferation in the TrkBhGFAP mice, we evaluated cell-cycle exit of BrdU-incorporating cells by examining their expression of Ki67 after a 2 hr chase period, at which point cells that were labeled with BrdU during the S phase but have subsequently left the cycle would lose their Ki67 expression (BrdU+; Ki67−), whereas the ones that remained in active cell cycle would be double positive (BrdU+; Ki67+). In the TrkBhGFAP mice 23.1% ± 3.9 % of all BrdU-positive cells were Ki67-negative, displaying a 208% increase in cell-cycle exit over the control mice, where only 7.5% ± 1.3 % were Ki67-negative (Figures 4D and 4E; 1053 BrdU-positive cells from five control, and 772 from five TrkBhGFAP, p < 0.05). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that TrkB is required for normal precursor proliferation in the hippocampus. Our finding that the TrkBhGFAP mice, but not the TrkBSyn mice, displayed impaired hippocampal neurogenesis suggested a cell-autonomous requirement for TrkB in NPCs. To further examine their intrinsic properties, we cultured NPCs from the DG in serum-free conditions. In the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), DG NPCs formed neurospheres, which expressed TrkB receptor that could be activated by exogenous BDNF (Figure 4F). Although maintaining adult-DG-derived primary neurospheres in media containing BDNF (50 ng/ml) for 7–10 days did not increase the frequency of primary neurosphere formation (not shown), there was a significant increase in the size of the neurospheres, suggesting that activation of TrkB facilitates the expansion of neurosphere-forming cells (Figure 4H; n = 4 for each group, p < 0.05 for post hoc test with or without BDNF comparison in control cells). Primary neurospheres derived from the DG of adult TrkBhGFAP mice, when plated at equal density, displayed reduction in both the number (Figure 4G; n = 4 for each group, p < 0.005) and size (Figure 4H; p < 0.005 for post hoc test of control to TrkBhGFAP comparison without BDNF; F1,12 = 102.2, p < 0.0001 for genotype; F1,12 = 6.994, p = 0.0214 for BDNF). The ability of primary neurospheres to form secondary neurospheres was also impaired in the TrkBhGFAP mice (secondary-to-primary neurosphere ratio: 0.322 ± 0.058 in TrkBhGFAP and 0.843 ± 0.096 in control, n = 4 for each, p < 0.005). In addition, deletion of TrkB abolished neurosphere sensitivity to BDNF stimulation (Figure 4H, p > 0.2). Using an Annexin V labeling assay, we examined the percentage of apoptotic cells in the neurosphere cultures and did not observe significant differences between control and TrkBhGFAP cells with or without BDNF treatment (n = 4 for each; with 50 ng/ml BDNF: 14.95% ± 1.38% in controls, 16.25% ± 2.65% in TrkBhGFAP; without BDNF: 14.46% ± 1.62% in controls, 17.69% ± 2.56% in TrkBhGFAP; F1,8 = 1.136, p = 0.3177 for genotype; F1,8 = 0.0498, p = 0.8290 for BDNF), suggesting that the reduction in the size of neurospheres derived from TrkBhGFAP mice was not due to survival deficits. Thus, BDNF facilitates proliferation by acting directly on NPCs, and the activation of TrkB is solely responsible for this effect. Reduction in hippocampal volume has been observed in animal models of stress (Coe et al., 2003Coe C.L. Kramer M. Czeh B. Gould E. Reeves A.J. Kirschbaum C. Fuchs E.

It has been proposed that C1-type transient receptor potential (TRPC1) channels underlie this synaptic excitation, but our analysis of TRPC1-deficient mice does not support this hypothesis. Here, we show unambiguously that it is TRPC3 that is needed for mGluR-dependent synaptic signaling in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells. TRPC3 is the most abundantly expressed TRPC subunit in Purkinje cells. In mutant mice lacking TRPC3, both slow synaptic potentials and mGluR-mediated inward currents are completely absent, while the synaptically mediated Ca2+ release signals from intracellular stores are unchanged. Importantly, TRPC3 knockout mice exhibit an impaired walking behavior. Taken together, our results establish TRPC3 as a new type of postsynaptic channel that mediates mGluR-dependent synaptic transmission in cerebellar Purkinje cells and is crucial for motor coordination.

Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 1 (mGluR1) are G protein-coupled receptors (Sugiyama et al., 1987Sugiyama H. Ito I. Hirono C. A new type of glutamate receptor linked to inositol phospholipid metabolism.Nature. 1987; 325: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) that are abundantly expressed in the cerebellum (Martin et al., 1992Martin L.J.

They have an essential role for normal motor behavior in mammals. Their absence in knockout mice causes a pronounced ataxia (Aiba et al., 1994Aiba A. Kano M. Chen C. Stanton M.E. Fox G.D. Herrup K.

In Purkinje neurons, activation of mGluR1 mediates a synaptic response consisting of two components, namely a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) (Batchelor and Garthwaite, 1993Batchelor A.M.

The mechanisms underlying synaptically evoked Ca2+ release from stores are well established. Thus, at parallel fiber (PF) synapses, repetitive afferent stimulation leads to the activation of mGluR1 followed by the activation of a signaling cascade consisting of Gαq and Gα11 (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Gαq and Gα11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J.

By contrast, the mechanisms underlying the slow EPSP are less clear. Over the last several years, accumulating evidence indicated an involvement of a TRP-type (Ramsey et al., 2006Ramsey I.S.

In a relatively recent report, Kim et al., 2003Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Worley P.F. Linden D.J. Activation of the TRPC1 cation channel by metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1.Nature. 2003; 426: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar proposed, based on manipulations that interfere with TRPC1 function, that TRPC1 cation channels underlie the slow EPSP. While these experiments provided compelling evidence for a role of TRPC1 in vitro, many questions remained open. These include the role of other TRPC cation channels and, importantly, the relevance of TRPC channels for physiological functions in vivo. Therefore, we set out to analyze mice lacking distinct TRPC channel subtypes. We examined synaptic transmission at PF-Purkinje neuron synapses in acute mouse cerebellar slices by combining whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings and confocal calcium imaging. Afferent PFs were activated by a stimulation pipette that was placed on the slice surface above the dendrites under investigation (Figure 1A). As previously reported (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Gαq and Gα11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J.

A new class of synaptic response involving calcium release in dendritic spines.Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), burst-like repetitive stimulation produces a rapid inward current that is mainly mediated by AMPA receptors and a slow component mediated by mGluR1 (Figure 1C, control, bottom). For a better separation of the two components, these recordings were performed in the presence of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10 μM), which reduced the amplitude of the rapid EPSC by about 90% (Kim et al., 2003Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Worley P.F. Linden D.J. Activation of the TRPC1 cation channel by metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1.Nature. 2003; 426: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition to the compound electrical response, synaptic stimulation evoked a large Ca2+ transient (Figure 1C, control, top) that was confined to a restricted dendritic area near the site of synaptic stimulation (Takechi et al., 1998Takechi H. Eilers J. Konnerth A. A new class of synaptic response involving calcium release in dendritic spines.Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Application of the mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt (200 μM) selectively abolished the slow EPSC and the Ca2+ transient (Figure 1C, red traces). Under our conditions of voltage-clamp recordings and reduced AMPA receptor activation, the Ca2+ transient was almost completely mediated by mGluR1, without a significant contribution of Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Eilers et al., 1995Eilers J. Augustine G.J. Konnerth A. Subthreshold synaptic Ca2+ signalling in fine dendrites and spines of cerebellar Purkinje neurons.Nature. 1995; 373: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Figures 1D–1F show recordings in which we focused exclusively on mGluR1-mediated signaling by performing experiments in the presence of CNQX at a concentration that blocked the rapid EPSC completely (40 μM). Under these conditions, repetitive synaptic stimulation (ten pulses, 100 Hz) evoked in wild-type (WT) mice a slow EPSC and the corresponding Ca2+ transient (Figure 1D, left; n = 16). It is important to stress that this synaptically evoked Ca2+ transient is predominantly the result of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores (Canepari and Ogden, 2006Canepari M. Ogden D. Kinetic, pharmacological and activity-dependent separation of two Ca2+ signalling pathways mediated by type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors in rat Purkinje neurones.J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Takechi et al., 1998Takechi H. Eilers J. Konnerth A. A new class of synaptic response involving calcium release in dendritic spines.Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Figure 1D (right) shows that application of the mGluR1 agonist DHPG, locally to the dendrites, also produced an inward current and a local dendritic Ca2+ transient (n = 38). Figure 1E demonstrates that, to our surprise, TRPC1-deficient mice (Dietrich et al., 2007Dietrich A. Kalwa H. Storch U. Mederos Y.S.M. Salanova B. Pinkenburg O. Dubrovska G. Essin K. Gollasch M. Birnbaumer L. Gudermann T. Pressure-induced and store-operated cation influx in vascular smooth muscle cells is independent of TRPC1.Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) had a normal mGluR1-mediated synaptic transmission and normal DHPG-evoked signaling, with no obvious impairment of the slow EPSC or the Ca2+ transient. Similar results were obtained in all our experiments (n = 22 for synaptic transmission; n = 30 for DHPG applications). Next, we analyzed newly generated TRPC1-TRPC4 double-knockout mice (TRPC1/4 DKO) and TRPC1-TRPC4-TRPC6 triple-knockout mice (TRPC1/4/6 TKO) (Dietrich et al., 2005Dietrich A. Mederos Y.S.M. Gollasch M. Gross V. Storch U. Dubrovska G. Obst M. Yildirim E. Salanova B. Kalwa H. et al.Increased vascular smooth muscle contractility in TRPC6−/− mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6980-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Freichel et al., 2001Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P. Biel M. Philipp S. Freise D. Droogmans G. et al.Lack of an endothelial store-operated Ca2+ current impairs agonist-dependent vasorelaxation in TRP4−/− mice.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar; see also Supplemental Data available online) using 15 pulses at 50 Hz for PF stimulation. In both types of mouse mutants, TRPC1/4 DKO (Figure 1F) and TRPC1/4/6 TKO (Figure S1), we detected normal mGluR1-mediated synaptic transmission. Figures 1G and 1H summarize the results for TRPC1-deficient and TRPC1/4 DKO mice compared to the corresponding WT mice, respectively. In both TRPC1−/− and in TRPC1/4 DKO mice, mGluR-mediated responses were not significantly different from those recorded in WT mice. Furthermore, normal mGluR-mediated responses were also observed in TRPC1/4/6 TKO mice following synaptic stimulation or DHPG-application (Figure S1). Importantly, TRPC1−/− (Figure S3) as well as TRPC1/4 DKO and TRPC1/4/6 TKO mice showed no signs of abnormal motor behavior. Taken together, these results demonstrate that neither TRPC1 nor TRPC4 nor TRPC6 are essential for the mGluR-mediated slow EPSC. The absence of any major role of TRPC1, TRPC4, or TRPC6 for mGluR-mediated signaling fits to the observation that the expression level of these receptors is quite low in Purkinje cells. Instead, there is evidence for a prominent expression of TRPC3 in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Huang et al., 2007Huang W.C. Young J.S. Glitsch M.D. Changes in TRPC channel expression during postnatal development of cerebellar neurons.Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; see also Allen Brain Atlas at http://brain-map.org). For a more accurate assessment of the expression level of TRPC channels in brain, cerebellum, and Purkinje cells, we used a quantitative rapid-cycle RT-PCR approach (Durand et al., 2006Durand G.M. Marandi N. Herberger S.D. Blum R. Konnerth A. Quantitative single-cell RT-PCR and Ca2+ imaging in brain slices.Pflugers Arch. 2006; 451: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Gαq and Gα11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5119-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Figure 2A (left) shows data indicating that in the whole brain the most abundantly expressed TRPC subunit is TRPC1 (Riccio et al., 2002Riccio A. Medhurst A.D. Mattei C. Kelsell R.E. Calver A.R. Randall A.D. Benham C.D. Pangalos M.N. mRNA distribution analysis of human TRPC family in CNS and peripheral tissues.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the cerebellum (Figure 2A, right), TRPC3 is slightly more abundant than TRPC1, while the remaining TRPC channels are expressed at low levels. For the analysis of single Purkinje cells, we used a procedure involving the harvesting of individual cells from acute cerebellar slices by means of a fine suction pipette (Durand et al., 2006Durand G.M. Marandi N. Herberger S.D. Blum R. Konnerth A. Quantitative single-cell RT-PCR and Ca2+ imaging in brain slices.Pflugers Arch. 2006; 451: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With this procedure, we reliably detected transcripts for TRPC3 (Figures 2C and 2D) as well as transcripts for TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7. The analysis of the TRPC2 subunit, which is known to be virtually absent in the brain (Huang et al., 2007Huang W.C. Young J.S. Glitsch M.D. Changes in TRPC channel expression during postnatal development of cerebellar neurons.Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Liman et al., 1999Liman E.R. Corey D.P. Dulac C. TRP2: a candidate transduction channel for mammalian pheromone sensory signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), was not included in this study. Figure 2B illustrates one of our routinely performed control experiments showing the absence of TRPC1, the expected most abundant TRPC channel outside Purkinje cells, in neuropil tissue samples collected near the Purkinje cell layer. Figure 2D (right) shows the results obtained in individual Purkinje cells. These findings indicate that, at least in terms of mRNA, TRPC3 is by far the most abundantly expressed TRPC channel in Purkinje cells. TRPC3 mRNA is eight to ten times more abundant than TRPC1 mRNA, while the amount of mRNA coding for the other TRPC channels is almost negligible. Figure 2E confirms at the protein level the presence of TRPC3 subunits in Purkinje cells (Huang et al., 2007Huang W.C. Young J.S. Glitsch M.D. Changes in TRPC channel expression during postnatal development of cerebellar neurons.Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In view of these results, we generated a mutant mouse that lacks TRPC3. We used a Cre-loxP-based strategy in order to excise exon 7 from the TRPC3 gene (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1). Figure 3A (upper scheme) depicts the result of the first step in this procedure, namely the inclusion of loxP sequences on both sides of exon 7. For the insertion of the Cre recombinase, a mouse line that expresses Cre under the control of a promotor with ubiquitous activity in the early embryo (Mox2; Tallquist and Soriano, 2000Tallquist M.D. Soriano P. Epiblast-restricted Cre expression in MORE mice: a tool to distinguish embryonic vs. extra-embryonic gene function.Genesis. 2000; 26: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) was used. The result of recombination is a general deletion of exon 7 from the TRPC3 gene, shown in the lower scheme of Figure 3A. The expected disruption of the TRPC3 gene was verified by gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR-products (Figure 3B) obtained using the primers indicated in Figure 3A. The resulting TRPC3 knockout mice are viable, fertile, and appear normal with regard to their general appearance. Neither the size nor the layering structure of the cerebellum nor the morphology of Purkinje cells (Figure 3C) are affected by the absence of TRPC3. Fast synaptic transmission at PF synapses in response to single-shock stimulation in the TRPC3 knockouts is, as in the WT, completely blocked by CNQX (Figure 3D, n = 5 cells), indicating the exclusive role of AMPA receptors for fast synaptic excitation (Konnerth et al., 1990Konnerth A. Llano I. Armstrong C.M. Synaptic currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2662-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs had similar monoexponential decay time courses in TRPC3−/− (12.9 ± 0.9 ms, n = 11 cells) and in WT mice (11.6 ± 0.7 ms, n = 8 cells; p = 0.31). Paired-pulse facilitation that is a characteristic feature of PF-Purkinje cell synapses (Konnerth et al., 1990Konnerth A. Llano I. Armstrong C.M. Synaptic currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2662-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) is not altered in the TRPC3 knockout mice (Figure 3E, n = 11 cells in TRPC3−/− and 8 cells in WT mice). Thus, presynaptic glutamate release at this synapse is not affected by the inactivation of the TRPC3 gene. In contrast to TRPC1−/− mice (Figure S2), TRPC3−/− mice exhibited a distinct behavioral defect. Figure 3F shows a foot print analysis from representative WT and TRPC3−/− mice, respectively. In WT mice, the foot prints of both the front (black dots in Figure 3F) and the hindpaws (red symbols) were almost exclusively confined to a path of a width corresponding to the transverse body diameter. By contrast, in TRPC3−/− mice the foot prints of the hindpaws were mostly outside this path (Figure 3F, lower panel) as a result of a deficit in coordination. Similar observations were made in all mice tested (eight of each genotype). These results are summarized in the graph shown in Figure 3G. The movement deficit of the hindpaws was investigated in two additional tests involving walking on an irregularly spaced ladder (Figure 3H), as well as walking on a thin elevated beam (Figure 3I). In all these tests, TRPC3−/− mice performed much poorer than WT control mice. In TRPC3−/− mice, the mGluR1-mediated slow EPSC at PF-Purkinje cell synapses (Figure 4A) was completely abolished in all 14 cells tested (Figures 4B and 4C). Remarkably, however, the synaptically evoked dendritic Ca2+ signal was virtually unaffected (Figures 4A–4C). Control experiments in which we used the mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt (Figure 4D) and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (Figure 4E), a drug that blocks the ATP-dependent uptake of Ca2+ ions into intracellular stores and therefore leads to their depletion (Ehrlich et al., 1994Ehrlich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. The pharmacology of intracellular Ca2+-release channels.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), confirmed that the Ca2+ transient recorded in TRPC3−/− mice is, as in WT, an mGluR1-evoked Ca2+ release signal from internal stores. Consistent with these findings, the DHPG-evoked slow inward current, but not the Ca2+ signal, were absent in TRPC3−/− mice (Figures 4F–4H). Finally, we tested the hypothesis (Kim et al., 2003Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Worley P.F. Linden D.J. Activation of the TRPC1 cation channel by metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1.Nature. 2003; 426: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) that the TRPC-mediated Ca2+ influx associated with the slow EPSC is needed for the replenishment of internal stores depleted by activation of the PLC-InsP3 signaling cascade. For this purpose, we evoked at PF-Purkinje cell synapses repeatedly, at intervals of 2 min, mGluR1-mediated responses both in WT and TRPC3−/− mice (Figure 4I). We found that the amplitude of the mGluR1-mediated Ca2+ transients was robust during multiple stimulations (Figure 4J), indicating that TRPC3 has no decisive role for store replenishment. In conclusion, we provide evidence that TRPC3 is required for both normal motor behavior and normal synaptic function in cerebellar Purkinje cells. In particular, we have shown that TRPC3−/− mice express a distinct defect concerning the normal functioning of the hindpaws during different walking tests (Figure 3). This behavioral phenotype is not as severe as the ataxic phenotypes encountered in mGluR-deficient (Aiba et al., 1994Aiba A. Kano M. Chen C. Stanton M.E. Fox G.D. Herrup K. Zwingman T.A. Tonegawa S. Deficient cerebellar long-term depression and impaired motor learning in mGluR1 mutant mice.Cell. 1994; 79: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) or Gαq-deficient mice (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Gαq and Gα11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J.

USA. 1997; 94: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), in which both the synaptically mediated Ca2+ release signal and the slow EPSC are absent. Instead, it is quite similar to the deficit in cerebellar motor control that we had observed previously in mice lacking calbindin D28k exclusively in Purkinje cells (Barski et al., 2003Barski J.J. Hartmann J. Rose C.R. Hoebeek F. Mörl K. Noll-Hussong M. De Zeeuw C.I. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Calbindin in cerebellar Purkinje cells is a critical determinant of the precision of motor coordination.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3469-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The previously reported particularly high expression levels of TRPC3 in the cerebellum (Riccio et al., 2002Riccio A. Medhurst A.D. Mattei C. Kelsell R.E. Calver A.R. Randall A.D. Benham C.D. Pangalos M.N. mRNA distribution analysis of human TRPC family in CNS and peripheral tissues.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) suggest that the behavioral deficit encountered in TRPC3−/− mice is largely due to an impaired cerebellar function. We find that in TRPC3−/− mice the slow EPSC is totally absent while in mice lacking TRPC1 the slow EPSC is unaffected. This lack of evidence for an involvement of TRPC1 (Kim et al., 2003Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Worley P.F. Linden D.J. Activation of the TRPC1 cation channel by metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1.Nature. 2003; 426: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) in the generation of mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs in adult mice is unexpected. Interestingly, in contrast to the general developmental pattern of TRP channels in the brain with a strong expression around birth followed by a downregulation at later stages (Li et al., 1999Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Activation of a TRPC3-dependent cation current through the neurotrophin BDNF.Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), TRPC3 in Purkinje cells is upregulated during development, reaching its maximum in adulthood (Huang et al., 2007Huang W.C. Young J.S. Glitsch M.D. Changes in TRPC channel expression during postnatal development of cerebellar neurons.Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that TRPC1 contributes to mGluR1-mediated signaling at early postnatal stages, when TRPC1 and TRPC3 are similarly abundantly expressed in Purkinje cells (Huang et al., 2007Huang W.C. Young J.S. Glitsch M.D. Changes in TRPC channel expression during postnatal development of cerebellar neurons.Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the different results obtained by Kim et al., 2003Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Worley P.F. Linden D.J. Activation of the TRPC1 cation channel by metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1.Nature. 2003; 426: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar might also be explained by the fact that for their analysis they mostly used cultured slices, while we used exclusively acute slice preparations. Besides the new role in synaptic transmission, there is evidence for specific roles of TRPC channels in early brain development. Thus, Li et al., 1999Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Activation of a TRPC3-dependent cation current through the neurotrophin BDNF.Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar reported that in most brain areas the expression of TRPC3 protein is particularly high during a narrow developmental time window before and after birth, suggesting an involvement of TRPC3 for the developmental formation of neuronal circuits. In line with this expression peak during early postnatal stages, it was found that TRPC3 channels are activated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cultured pontine neurons from neonatal rat brain (Li et al., 1999Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Activation of a TRPC3-dependent cation current through the neurotrophin BDNF.Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and in cultured hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Amaral and Pozzo-Miller, 2007Amaral M.D. Pozzo-Miller L. TRPC3 channels are necessary for brain-derived neurotrophic factor to activate a nonselective cationic current and to induce dendritic spine formation.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5179-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The BDNF-activated TRPC3 conductance has been implicated in dendritic remodelling (Amaral and Pozzo-Miller, 2007Amaral M.D. Pozzo-Miller L. TRPC3 channels are necessary for brain-derived neurotrophic factor to activate a nonselective cationic current and to induce dendritic spine formation.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5179-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In further support of this view, it has been found that knockdown of TRPC3 expression with siRNAs inhibits BDNF-induced turning of growth cones in cultured cerebellar granule cells (Li et al., 2005Li Y. Jia Y.C. Cui K. Li N. Zheng Z.Y. Wang Y.Z. Yuan X.B. Essential role of TRPC channels in the guidance of nerve growth cones by brain-derived neurotrophic factor.Nature. 2005; 434: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The signaling cascade linking mGluR1 and TRPC3 requires the activation of G proteins of the Gαq type, as indicated by the total absence of the slow EPSC in Gαq-deficient mice, which were analyzed under conditions that were similar to those used here (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Gαq and Gα11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5119-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, recordings performed in Purkinje cells from PLCβ4-deficient mice indicate that activation of the mGluR1-activated inward current requires PLCβ (Sugiyama et al., 1999Sugiyama T. Hirono M. Suzuki K. Nakamura Y. Aiba A. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Katsuki M. Yoshioka T. Localization of phospholipase Cβ isozymes in the mouse cerebellum.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; but see Canepari and Ogden, 2006Canepari M. Ogden D. Kinetic, pharmacological and activity-dependent separation of two Ca2+ signalling pathways mediated by type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors in rat Purkinje neurones.J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further elements of the signaling pathway in in vivo Purkinje cells remain to be elucidated. It is noteworthy that despite the high Ca2+ permeability of TRPC3 channels (Kamouchi et al., 1999Kamouchi M. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. Wissenbach U. Mamin A. Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Properties of heterologously expressed hTRP3 channels in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells.J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), mGluR1-activated Ca2+ entry contributes 2- to 4-fold less than the Ca2+ release from internal stores to the overall Ca2+ signal (Canepari and Ogden, 2006Canepari M. Ogden D. Kinetic, pharmacological and activity-dependent separation of two Ca2+ signalling pathways mediated by type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors in rat Purkinje neurones.J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; J.H., H.A.H., and A.K., unpublished data). Consistent with this result, the synaptically evoked Ca2+ transient is strongly attenuated when blocking InsP3 receptors or when emptying internal stores (Finch and Augustine, 1998Finch E.A. Augustine G.J. Local calcium signalling by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate in Purkinje cell dendrites.Nature. 1998; 396: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, Takechi et al., 1998Takechi H. Eilers J. Konnerth A. A new class of synaptic response involving calcium release in dendritic spines.Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In fact, earlier findings clearly show that the slow EPSC involves a marked influx of Na+ ions (Knöpfel et al., 2000Knöpfel T. Anchisi D. Alojado M.E. Tempia F. Strata P. Elevation of intradendritic sodium concentration mediated by synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2199-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Linden et al., 1994Linden D.J. Smeyne M. Connor J.A. Trans-ACPD, a metabotropic receptor agonist, produces calcium mobilization and an inward current in cultured cerebellar Purkinje neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Staub et al., 1992Staub C. Vranesic I. Knöpfel T. Responses to metabotropic glutamate receptor activation in cerebellar Purkinje cells: induction of an inward current.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, it is remarkable that Ca2+ release from internal stores persists in the absence of TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPC6 (Figure 1), and even in the total absence of the mGluR1-activated inward current in TRPC3−/− mice (Figure 4). These findings indicate that in central neurons Ca2+ entry through TRPC channels is not required for refilling of the internal Ca2+ stores. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that TRPC3 cation channels mediate slow synaptic excitation in cerebellar Purkinje cells and, thus, identify a key mechanism underlying slow synaptic excitation in the adult mammalian nervous system. TRPC1/TRPC4 double-knockout (TRPC1/4 DKO) mice were generated by breeding TRPC1−/− (Dietrich et al., 2007Dietrich A. Kalwa H. Storch U. Mederos Y.S.M. Salanova B. Pinkenburg O. Dubrovska G. Essin K. Gollasch M. Birnbaumer L. Gudermann T. Pressure-induced and store-operated cation influx in vascular smooth muscle cells is independent of TRPC1.Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and TRPC4−/− mice (Freichel et al., 2001Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P. Biel M. Philipp S. Freise D. Droogmans G. et al.Lack of an endothelial store-operated Ca2+ current impairs agonist-dependent vasorelaxation in TRP4−/− mice.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). By crossing TRPC6−/− mice (Dietrich et al., 2005Dietrich A. Mederos Y.S.M. Gollasch M. Gross V. Storch U. Dubrovska G. Obst M. Yildirim E. Salanova B. Kalwa H. et al.Increased vascular smooth muscle contractility in TRPC6−/− mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6980-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and TRPC1/4 DKO mice, we obtained TRPC1/TRPC4/TRPC6 triple-knockout (TRPC1/4/6 TKO) mice. TRPC3−/− mice were generated by disrupting the TRPC3 gene in a three-step process as illustrated in Figure S2 (for details see Supplemental Data). For the behavioral tests, we used mice aged from postnatal day (P) 34 to P51. The mean age of mice used for the other experiments was P107 ± 79 (SD, n = 53). Mice were decapitated following anesthesia, and the cerebella were rapidly removed and placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (0°C–2°C) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were cut using a vibratome slicer (Leica, Germany). After cutting, slices were kept for 1 hr at 34°C and then for up to 8 hr at room temperature in ACSF. Acute slices (200 μM thick) were treated for immunodetection according to standard procedures (4% PFA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5% goat serum). Anti-calbindin (mouse monoclonal 1:500, Swant, Switzerland) and anti-TRPC3 (rabbit polyclonal 1:100, Alomone, Israel) primary antibodies were incubated over night at 4°C. Alexa 488- (goat anti mouse 1:1000) and Alexa 555-labeled (goat anti-rabbit 1:1000, Invitrogen) secondary antibodies were incubated 2 hr at room temperature. Confocal images (LSM510, Zeiss, Germany) were maximum-intensity projected to visualize the immunoreactivity. Whole-cell recordings were performed following standard procedures (Edwards et al., 1989Edwards F.A. Konnerth A. Sakmann B. Takahashi T. A thin slice preparation for patch clamp recordings from neurones of the mammalian central nervous system.Pflugers Arch. 1989; 414: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes (3–4 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Germany) and coated with silicon (RTV 615, GE Silicons). The internal solution contained (in mM) 148 potassium gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na3-GTP, and 0.1 Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (Molecular Probes, USA), pH 7.3. During the recordings, the slices were continuously perfused at room temperature with ACSF that contained 10 μM bicuculline (Sigma, Germany). Afferent stimulation was performed by using a patch pipette filled with 1 M NaCl (1 MΩ resistance). Individual Purkinje cells and control material were harvested under visual control from cerebellar slices. Rapid-cycle PCR reactions were performed as previously described (Durand et al., 2006Durand G.M. Marandi N. Herberger S.D. Blum R. Konnerth A. Quantitative single-cell RT-PCR and Ca2+ imaging in brain slices.Pflugers Arch. 2006; 451: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (for details see Supplemental Data).

https://openalex.org/W2065473485,"Hyperuricemia is a significant factor in a variety of diseases, including gout and cardiovascular diseases. Although renal excretion largely determines plasma urate concentration, the molecular mechanism of renal urate handling remains elusive. Previously, we identified a major urate reabsorptive transporter, URAT1 (SLC22A12), on the apical side of the renal proximal tubular cells. However, it is not known how urate taken up by URAT1 exits from the tubular cell to the systemic circulation. Here, we report that a sugar transport facilitator family member protein GLUT9 (SLC2A9) functions as an efflux transporter of urate from the tubular cell. GLUT9-expressed Xenopus oocytes mediated saturable urate transport (Km: 365 ± 42 μm). The transport was Na+-independent and enhanced at high concentrations of extracellular potassium favoring negative to positive potential direction. Substrate specificity and pyrazinoate sensitivity of GLUT9 was distinct from those of URAT1. The in vivo role of GLUT9 is supported by the fact that a renal hypouricemia patient without any mutations in SLC22A12 was found to have a missense mutation in SLC2A9, which reduced urate transport activity in vitro. Based on these data, we propose a novel model of transcellular urate transport in the kidney; Remunurate is taken up via apically located URAT1 and exits the cell via basolaterally located GLUT9, which we suggest be renamed URATv1 (voltage-driven urate transporter 1).

Urate (uric acid), an end product of purine metabolism in humans because of the genetic silencing of hepatic uricase, is now recognized as a natural antioxidant that has neuroprotective properties (1.Kutzing M.K. Firestein B.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 324: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Despite its beneficial role, elevation of the serum urate level is correlated with gout, hypertension, and cardiovascular and renal diseases (1.Kutzing M.K. Firestein B.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 324: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2.Becker M.A. Jolly M. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 2006; 32: 275-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The kidney plays a dominant role in maintaining plasma urate levels through the excretion process; it eliminates ∼70% of the daily urate production (3.Sica D.A. Schoolwerth A.C. The Kidney. 6th Ed. WB Saunders, Philadelphia2000: 680-700Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of renal urate handling because underexcretion of urate has been demonstrated in the majority of hyperuricemia patients (4.Mount D.B. Kwon C.Y. Zandi-Nejad K. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 2006; 32: 313-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since urate is a weak acid at physiological pH (pKa, 5.75), it hardly permeates the plasma membrane of cells in the absence of transport proteins (3.Sica D.A. Schoolwerth A.C. The Kidney. 6th Ed. WB Saunders, Philadelphia2000: 680-700Google Scholar). In 2002, we identified a long hypothesized urate-anion exchanger, URAT1, 2The abbreviations used are: URAT1, urate transporter 1; URATv1, voltage-driven urate transporter 1; SLC, solute carrier; GLUT9, glucose transporter 9; PZA, pyrazinoate; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: URAT1, urate transporter 1; URATv1, voltage-driven urate transporter 1; SLC, solute carrier; GLUT9, glucose transporter 9; PZA, pyrazinoate; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. encoded by SLC22A12, that localized on the apical side of the renal proximal tubule (5.Enomoto A.

Moreover, there are patients with renal hypouricemia who had no mutation in SLC22A12, suggesting the existence of a non-URAT1-mediated urate reabsorption system (12.Ichida K. Hosoyamada M.

Here we report a previously unknown urate transporter on the basolateral side of the renal proximal tubule, which is likely to act in tandem with URAT1 for urate reabsorption in its physiological role in vivo in humans. Immunohistochemistry in Xenopus Oocytes—cRNA synthesis was performed as described elsewhere (14.Islam R. Anzai N. Ahmed N. Ellapan B. Jin C.J. Srivastava S. Miura D. Fukutomi T. Kanai Y. Endou H. J.

Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with cRNAs were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with the anti-GLUT9 antibody (Alpha Diagnostics) (1:500) followed by Alexa Fluor 546-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) (Wako; diluted 1:200), as described previously (15.Yokoyama H.

Functional Characterization of GLUT9—GLUT9 isoform 1 and 2 cDNAs were purchased from OriGene Technologies (isoform 2) and Open Biosystems (isoform 1). In vitro transcription and injection of capped cRNA into oocytes were performed as described previously (5.Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Takeda M.

The ND96 buffer contained (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). In the 0 Cl– bath, Cl– was replaced with an equimolar amount of gluconate. Kinetic parameter for the uptake of urate was estimated from the following equation: v = Vmax × S/(Km + S), where v is the rate of substrate uptake (pmol/h/oocyte), S is the substrate concentration in the medium (μm), Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (μm), and Vmax is the maximum uptake rate (pmol/h/oocyte). These kinetic parameters were determined by the Eadie-Hofstee plot. The trans-stimulation experiments were done as described previously (17.Anzai N. Jutabha P. Enomoto A. Yokoyama H. Nonoguchi H.

The experiments were performed using three batches of oocytes, and results from the representative experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Mutation Analysis and Construction of Mutant cDNA—For the GLUT9 sequence determination in renal hypouricemia patients and normal control subjects, we used the primers described by S. Li with slight modification (18.Li S. Maschio A. Busonero F. Usala G. Mulas A. Lai S. Dei M. Orrù M. Albai G. Bandinelli S. Schlessinger D. Lakatta E. Scuteri A. Najjar S.S. Guralnik J. Naitza S.

Institutional approval was obtained at each participating site. High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood cells and was amplified by PCR. The PCR products were sequenced in both directions using a 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To generate a GLUT9 mutant (P412R), we performed site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions (19.Sakata T.

The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers for generation of P412R mutant were 5′-CACGCCCCCTGGGTCCGCTACCTGAGTATCGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACGATACTCAGGTAGCGGACCCAGGGGGCGTG-3′ (reverse). Proper construction of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by complete sequencing. To identify novel renal urate transporters, we performed a homology search (Blastp) against the Swiss-Prot protein data base in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the human and mouse sequences for URAT1/Urat1 (SLC22A12/Slc22a12) (5.Enomoto A.

Surprisingly, we found that several members of the facilitated glucose transporter (SLC2) family (GLUT6, -9, -10, -12, and -14) have remote similarities to SLC22A11. Among these molecules, we decided to characterize one of the extended (class II) SLC2 family members named GLUT9 (which is encoded by SLC2A9) because it localizes mainly in the kidney and the liver (22.Uldry M. Thorens B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Human GLUT9 was originally identified as a gene of unknown function (23.Phay J.E. Hussain H.B. Moley J.F. Genomics. 2000; 66: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although glucose transporter activity of GLUT9 was demonstrated, it does not seem as efficient as the classical (class I) glucose transporter GLUT4 (24.Doege H. Bocianski A. Joost H.-G. Schurmann A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25.Augustin R. Carayannopoulos M.O. Dowd L.O. Phay J.E. Moley J.F. Moley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16229-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Human GLUT9 has two splice variants: isoform 1 (NM_020041) and isoform 2 (NM_001001290) (supplemental Fig. S1A). The difference between these two isoforms lies in the presence of the first exon only in isoform 1, which results in differential targeting in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (25.Augustin R. Carayannopoulos M.O. Dowd L.O. Phay J.E. Moley J.F. Moley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16229-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). First, we examined the membrane expression and urate transport activities of both isoforms of GLUT9 using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Both isoforms of GLUT9 were expressed on the plasma membrane when GLUT9 cRNAs were injected into oocytes (supplemental Fig. S2A), and both isoforms had equivalent urate transport activity (supplemental Fig. S2B). We used isoform 2 for further characterization. The uptake rate of [14C]urate in oocytes expressing GLUT9 was 9-fold higher than that in control oocytes, whereas much lower uptake rates of [14C]glucose and [14C]fructose were observed (supplemental Fig. S2C). GLUT9 did not show any significant uptake of representative organic anionic substrates such as para-aminohipurate, estrone sulfate, or salicylate, nor of substrates known as interactors of classical renal urate transport systems (including URAT1) such as lactate, nicotinate, β-hydroxybutyrate, or salicylate (supplemental Fig. S2C). Thus, GLUT9 had a narrower substrate specificity than URAT1. Next, we examined the urate transport properties of GLUT9. Xenopus oocytes expressing GLUT9 exhibited time-dependent transport of [14C]urate (Fig. 1A). The GLUT9-mediated uptake of urate manifested saturable kinetics and followed the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Eadie-Hofstee plot yielded a Km of 365 ± 42 μm and a Vmax of 5,521 ± 291 pmol/h/oocyte (mean ± S.E. of five separate experiments) for urate, indicating that GLUT9 has a high affinity for urate similar to URAT1 (Fig. 1B). Elimination of extracellular Na+ did not affect urate transport by GLUT9, indicating that it did not involve a direct Na+ urate cotransport. GLUT9 activity was sensitive to membrane potential because the elevation of external K+ (which depolarizes the plasma membrane of a Xenopus oocyte) facilitated urate uptake (Fig. 1C). This voltage sensitivity should favor the efflux of urate from the tubular cells because of a net negative charge within the cell. We then measured the effect of an outward Cl– gradient (intracellular to extracellular) on urate uptake. Imposing a Cl– gradient by complete removal of external Cl– did not accelerate the urate uptake via GLUT9, indicating that GLUT9 does not have the exchange mechanism for inorganic Cl– observed in URAT1 (Fig. 1C). In addition, unlike URAT1, a dependence of urate transport activity on extracellular pH was observed for GLUT9 (Fig. 1D). To further investigate the substrate selectivity of GLUT9, an inhibition study was performed. The cis-inhibitory effect of various compounds at 1 mm (except for benzbromarone, at 50 μm) on GLUT9-mediated [14C]urate (10 μm) uptake was examined (Table 1). GLUT9 again exhibited pharmacological properties different from those of URAT1 (5.Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Takeda M. Sekine T. Igarashi T. Matsuo H. Kikuchi Y. Oda T. Ichida K. Hosoya T. Shimokata K. Niwa T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Nature. 2002; 417: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Although the urate transport via GLUT9 was inhibited strongly by urate, hexoses such as glucose and fructose, monocarboxylates such as lactate, nicotinate, and orotate, or ketone bodies such as acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate did not inhibit urate uptake via GLUT9. These results are consistent with the initial observation that urate appeared to be the only substrate for GLUT9 (supplemental Fig. S2C).TABLE 1Inhibition of GLUT9-mediated [14C]urate (20 μm) uptake by various compounds.

Probenecid and benzbromarone (50 μm) cis-inhibited urate uptake moderately. Interestingly, pyrazinoate (PZA), the active metabolite of pyrazinamide widely used as an antituberculosis agent and known as an interactor with URAT1 (5.Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Takeda M. Sekine T. Igarashi T. Matsuo H. Kikuchi Y. Oda T. Ichida K. Hosoya T. Shimokata K. Niwa T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Nature. 2002; 417: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), did not exert any inhibitory effect on urate uptake via GLUT9. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, moderately cis-inhibited urate uptake. These results demonstrated that it exhibited responsiveness to various drugs potentially affecting renal urate handling different from that of URAT1, indicating that GLUT9 can be a potential target for novel uricosuric agents. To clarify the transport mode of GLUT9, we performed trans-stimulation experiments by injecting organic anions into oocytes prior to [14C]urate uptake. Intracellularly loaded urate (2 mm) significantly stimulated [14C]urate uptake via GLUT9 (supplemental Fig. S3A). As expected from the lack of cis-inhibition on urate uptake by glucose, fructose, lactate, nicotinate, PZA, orotate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and salicylate, intracellular loading of these compounds had no trans-stimulatory effect (supplemental Fig. S3A). Consistent with our aforementioned idea that GLUT9 may act as an efflux transporter under a physiological condition, GLUT9-expressing oocytes preloaded with [14C]urate showed a time-dependent efflux of radioactivity when incubated in the standard uptake solution (Fig. 2A). Given its predominantly basolateral membrane localization in proximal tubular cells (25.Augustin R. Carayannopoulos M.O. Dowd L.O. Phay J.E. Moley J.F. Moley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16229-16236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we propose that GLUT9 is responsible for transferring urate from the cell to the peritubular interstitium as a second step in reabsorption following the initial step mediated by URAT1 (Fig. 2B). When the efflux of radioactivity from the oocytes preloaded with [14C]urate was compared in the absence and presence of extracellular urate, glucose, and fructose, the efflux was stimulated by the extracellular urate but not by glucose or fructose (supplemental Fig. S3B). Therefore, urate transport via GLUT9 would not be altered by the normal serum levels of these sugars. Idiopathic renal hypouricemia (or, simply, renal hypouricemia: Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) 220150) is a hereditary disease characterized by abnormally increased renal urate clearance and caused by an isolated inborn error of membrane transport for urate in the renal proximal tubule (27.Sperling O. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, there are renal hypouricemia patients who have no mutation in SLC22A12 (12.Ichida K. Hosoyamada M. Hisatome I. Enomoto A. Hikita M. Endou H. Hosoya T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13.Wakida N. Tuyen D.G. Adachi M. Miyoshi T. Nonoguchi H. Oka T. Ueda O. Tazawa M. Kurihara S. Yoneta Y. Shimada H. Oda T. Kikuchi Y. Matsuo H. Hosoyamada M. Endou H. Otagiri M. Tomita K. Kitamura K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 2169-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If GLUT9 acts in the urate reabsorption pathway in tandem to URAT1, it is possible that such patients carry mutation(s) in the SLC2A9 gene. One of these patients (a 36-year-old female) had a plasma urate level of 2.4 mg/dl (the normal value is ∼5 mg/dl), similar to the values found in renal hypouricemia patients with a URAT1 heterozygous mutation such as W258X. Analysis of the GLUT9-coding region from the genomic DNA of the patient revealed the presence of a heterozygous C to G alteration at nucleotide 1296 within exon 11 of SLC2A9 (supplemental Figs. S1 and 3A), changing proline 412 (CCC) to arginine (CGC). This residue (Pro-412) was located in loop 9 facing the extracellular side (supplemental Fig. S1B) and was conserved in both GLUT5 and GLUT9 in SLC2 family members (28.Joost H.-G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This P412R mutation was not identified in 50 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals. To confirm the function of mutant GLUT9, we analyzed urate transport activity after injection of wild-type or mutated GLUT9 cRNA into oocytes and found that this substitution (P412R) significantly reduced urate transport activity (Fig. 3B). Expression level of both wild-type and mutant GLUT9 was comparable in the plasma membrane by immunostaining (Fig. 3C). In this study, a sugar transport facilitator family protein GLUT9 was found to act as a voltage-driven urate transporter. This characteristic is well suited for urate efflux transporter from the cell. This finding will complete a model of urate reabsorption in the renal tubular cell, where urate in the urinary lumen is taken up via URAT1 and intracellular urate exits from the cell to the interstitium/blood space via GLUT9 (Fig. 2B). Based on our model (Fig. 2B), we predict that intact function of both URAT1 and GLUT9 is necessary for normal urate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule since both transporters act on the same pathway in tandem. This prediction was supported in vivo by the existence of mutations with reduced function in SLC2A9 in a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia who had no mutations in SLC22A12. Because this mutation (P412R) replaces a non-charged residue proline with a positively charged residue arginine, we speculate that it affected the interaction of GLUT9 with its substrate urate. While we were in the process of functional characterization of GLUT9, a few genetic studies have been published that relate variations in/near SLC2A9 to the plasma urate level. For example, Li et al. (18.Li S. Maschio A. Busonero F. Usala G. Mulas A. Lai S. Dei M. Orrù M. Albai G. Bandinelli S. Schlessinger D. Lakatta E. Scuteri A. Najjar S.S. Guralnik J. Naitza S. Crisponi L. Cao A. Abecasis G.

In addition, our results should give strong (patho)physiological support to two recent whole genome association studies that demonstrated that the serum urate levels were correlated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in or very close to SLC2A9 (29.Döring A.

Taken together, proteins encoded by SLC2A9 functioned as urate transporters in the kidney, mainly acting to excrete reabsorbed urate from the tubular cell, and their urate transport activity affected the plasma urate level. Therefore, we propose that the proteins encoded by SLC2A9 be called URATv1 (voltage-driven urate transporter 1), instead of GLUT9. We thank all the patients involved in this study. We thank A.

To characterize the biochemical properties of this membrane protein, two soluble recombinant forms were produced using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. The recombinant proteins consisted of either the CA IX catalytic domain only (CA form) or the extracellular domain, which included both the proteoglycan and catalytic domains (PG + CA form). The produced proteins lacked the small transmembrane and intracytoplasmic regions of CA IX. Stopped-flow spectrophotometry experiments on both proteins demonstrated that in the excess of certain metal ions the PG + CA form exhibited the highest catalytic activity ever measured for any CA isozyme. Investigations on the oligomerization and stability of the enzymes revealed that both recombinant proteins form dimers that are stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bond(s). Mass spectrometry experiments showed that CA IX contains an intramolecular disulfide bridge (Cys119-Cys299) and a unique N-linked glycosylation site (Asn309) that bears high mannose-type glycan structures. Parallel experiments on a recombinant protein obtained by a mammalian cell expression system demonstrated the occurrence of an additional O-linked glycosylation site (Thr78) and characterized the nature of the oligosaccharide structures.

Supuran C.T. Scozzafava A. Conway J. Carbonic Anhydrase: Its Inhibitors and Activators. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2004: 1-23Crossref Google Scholar). To date, CA II has been reported to represent the isozyme with the highest catalytic efficiency, with a kcat/Km = 1.5 × 108 m-1 s-1 (13Khalifah R.G. J. Biol.

Of these two, CA IX is the more exceptional because it has been proposed to contribute to cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and malignant cell invasion (15Pastoreková S. Pastorek J. Supuran C.T.

It is generally expressed in a very limited number of normal tissues (mainly in the gastrointestinal tract), whereas it is highly expressed in several cancers that arise from CA IX-negative tissues, such as renal, lung, cervical, ovarian, esophageal, and breast carcinomas (17Pastoreková S. Zavada J. Cancer Therapy. 2004; 2: 245-262Google Scholar). A cDNA coding for the human CA IX protein was first cloned and investigated by Pastorek et al. (18Pastorek J. Pastoreková S. Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Zelník V. Opavský R. Zat'ovicová M. Liao S. Portetelle D. Stanbridge E.J. Závada J. Burny A. Kettmann R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2877-2888PubMed Google Scholar), and the CA9 gene was characterized in 1996 by the same group (19Opavský R. Pastoreková S. Zelnik V. Gibadulinová A. Stanbridge E.J. Závada J. Kettmann R. Pastorek J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It became evident from this study that CA IX shows significant similarity with the keratan sulfate attachment domain of a large human aggregating proteoglycan, aggrecan (19Opavský R. Pastoreková S. Zelnik V. Gibadulinová A. Stanbridge E.J. Závada J. Kettmann R. Pastorek J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Mature CA IX consists of the following four domains: an N-terminal proteoglycan-like domain (PG), a CA catalytic domain (CA), a transmembrane helical segment, and a short intracytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). However, no studies have proven the occurrence of glycosaminoglycan chains on the PG domain. Recently, CA IX has been suggested to represent a valuable target in cancer diagnostics and treatment. A promising example is Rencarex®, an anti-CA IX antibody that is currently in a phase III clinical trial (www.wilex.com) to treat renal cell carcinomas. Despite all the information on CA IX that has accumulated during the past years, the biochemical characterization of this enzyme has remained incomplete. The main focus of the present study was to fill this gap in knowledge by providing information on the catalytic properties, oligomerization, and post-translational modifications of CA IX. Because it is widely reported that membrane proteins present difficulties for detailed biochemical characterization, soluble CA IX forms were produced using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, which has not been used previously to investigate CA isoenzymes. These recombinant proteins were subsequently characterized by different biophysical and biochemical methods. Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses—Two cDNA constructs were designed to produce the recombinant CA IX forms, both of which lack the small transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains. Both recombinant proteins had a CA IX signal sequence whose codon usage was optimized for Spodoptera frugiperda, eight histidine residues for protein purification and a thrombin cleavage site for tag removal (Fig. 1). The PG + CA form coded for a protein consisting of both the PG and CA domains, encompassing residues 1-377 of the mature CA IX sequence (residues 38-414 of Swiss-Prot entry Q16790). At the N terminus, it contained the removable MAPLCPSPWLPLLIPAPAPGLTVQLLLSLLLLMPVHPQRLHHHHHHHHLVPRGS (thrombin cleavage site underlined) sequence (Fig. 1B). The CA form coded only for the CA domain, encompassing residues 101-354 (residues 138-391 of Swiss-Prot entry Q16790), bearing the cleavable MAPLCPSPWLPLLIPAPAPGLTVQLLLSLLLLMPVHP signal peptide at the N terminus and a LVPRGSHHHHHHHH sequence at the C terminus (Fig. 1C). cDNA sequences were constructed by the stepwise elongation of sequence-PCR (SES-PCR) (20Majumder K. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The baculoviral genomes encoding CA IX recombinant proteins were generated according to the Bac-To-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System instructions (Invitrogen). More detailed description on the SES-PCR and the generation of the baculoviral genomes can be found under supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Production and Purification of Recombinant CA IX—The Sf9 insect cells were maintained in HyQ SFX-Insect serum-free cell culture medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) in an orbital shaker at 27 °C (125 rpm). The cells were centrifuged (2000 × g, 20 °C, 5 min) 72 h after infection, and the medium was collected. Purification was performed with the Probond® Purification System (Invitrogen) under native binding conditions with wash and elution buffers made according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purification procedure per 100 ml of insect cell medium was as follows: 1 liter of native binding buffer and 7 ml of the nickel-chelating resin were added to the insect cell medium, and the His-tagged protein was then allowed to bind to the resin on a magnetic stirrer at 25 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed with 500 ml of washing buffer, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Buffer Change, Thrombin Treatment, and Concentration Measurement—The purified CA form was changed to a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Sigma), using an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Because the PG domain was unstable in Tris buffer (data not shown), the purified PG + CA form was changed to a buffer of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. To remove the His tag, recombinant proteins were treated with 30 μl of resin-coupled thrombin (Thrombin CleanCleave KIT, Sigma) per 1 mg of protein with gentle shaking at 25 °C for 3 h, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The thrombin resin was removed from the protein solution by filtration. The His tag was removed from the protein solution of the PG + CA form by washing the protein using an Amicon Ultra 30-kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The thrombin treatment was effective for the PG + CA form but failed for the CA form, despite using thrombin from three different manufacturers (Novagen, Sigma, and Amersham Biosciences), a large enzyme excess and long incubation times. Protein concentration was measured at three different dilutions by both the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce), and the mean of these results was used as the final value. Production of Polyclonal Antibody, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Anti-human CA IX (ahCAIX) serum was raised by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden) in rabbits against the CA form of CA IX. Purified recombinant CA IX proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) followed either by treatment with the Colloidal Blue Staining Kit (Invitrogen) or Western blotting, which was performed as described previously (22Hilvo M. Rafajová M. Pastoreková S. Pastorek J. Parkkila S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Western blots, both the monoclonal M75 (23Pastoreková S. Závadová Z. Kostál M. Babusiková O. Závada J. Virology. 1992; 187: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the polyclonal ahCAIX antibodies were used to detect CA IX recombinant proteins; the dilutions were 1:200 and 1:1,000, respectively. The secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG for M75 and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG for the ahCA IX antibody, and they were both diluted 1:25,000 in TBST buffer. Oligomer Reduction—To study the covalent oligomerization of CA IX, 7 μg of both recombinant protein samples were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, with different amounts of dithiotreitol (DTT); these samples were then analyzed by 9.5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The gels were stained using PageBlue™ dye (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Size Exclusion Chromatography followed by Light Scattering—The light scattering data were collected using a Superdex 200 10/30 HR size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (GE Healthcare), connected to high performance liquid chromatography system, Alliance 2965 (Waters, Milford, MA), equipped with an autosampler. The elution from SEC was monitored by a photodiode array UV-visible detector 996 (Waters), a differential refractometer (OPTI-Lab or OPTI-rEx Wyatt, Santa Barbara, CA), and a static, multiangle laser light scattering detector (DAWN-EOS, Wyatt). The SEC-UV/LS/RI system was equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl buffer at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Two software packages were used for data collection and analysis: the Millennium software (Waters) controlled the HPLC operation and data collection from the multiwavelength UV-visible detector, whereas the ASTRA software (Wyatt) collected data from the refractive index detector, the light scattering detectors, and recorded the UV trace at 280 nm sent from the PDA detector. The peaks from the SEC were collected also for SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Recombinant CA IX Proteins Produced in the Bacterial and Mammalian Expression Systems—The recombinant glutathione S-transferase-CA construct encoding residues 84-360 of the mature CA IX protein was used in the CA activity assay and has been described previously (24Zat'ovicová M. Tarábková K. Svastová E. Gibadulinová A. Mucha V. Jakubícková L. Biesová Z. Rafajová M. Ortova Gut M. Parkkila S. Parkkila A.K. Waheed A. Sly W.S. Horak I. Pastorek J. Pastoreková S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 282: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The production and purification of this glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli has already been described (25Özensoy Ö. Puccetti L. Fasolis G. Arslan O. Scozzafava A. Supuran C.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A sample of recombinant human CA IX protein produced in murine myeloma cell line NS0 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used in the mass spectrometric analyses. CA Activity Assay—An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument was used to assay CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration activity (13Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction was measured using 0.2 mm phenol red (Amax at 557 nm) as an indicator, in 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 m Na2SO4, pH 7.5, for a period of 10-100 s. To determine the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants, the CO2 concentration ranged from 1.7 to 17 mm. For the inhibitor assay, at least six replicates of the initial reaction were used to determine the initial velocity. A stock solution of 1 mm acetazolamide in 10-20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide was used to prepare acetazolamide dilutions up to 0.01 nm. To form the enzyme-inhibitor complex, inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated at 25 °C for 15 min, prior to inhibition measurements. Inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using PRISM 3, whereas kinetic parameters were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots, as reported earlier, and represent the mean from at least three different determinations. Assays were performed on the PG + CA and CA forms from the baculovirus-insect cell expression system and on the CA domain of CA IX also from the E. coli expression system. The measurements for the proteins produced in the insect cells were also performed in the presence of 50 μm ZnCl2, 50 μm MgCl2, 50 μm CoCl2, or 50 μm MnSO4. In the presence of ZnCl2, the CO2 hydration activity was measured also for other CA isozymes, namely I, II, IV, XII, XIV, and XV, and the references for their production can be found in Ref. 26Hilvo M. Innocenti A. Monti S.M. De Simone G. Supuran C.T. Parkkila S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2008; 14: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. Protein Alkylation—Protein samples for disulfide assignment were alkylated with 1.1 m iodoacetamide in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, and 6 m guanidinium chloride, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for 1 min in the dark. Samples were separated from excess salts and reagents by passing the reaction mixture through a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences), as previously reported (27Grillo C. D'Ambrosio C. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Scaloni A. Maceroni M. Eufemi M. Altieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10299-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein samples were collected and lyophilized. Protein Digestion and Peptide Separation—Bands were excised from the gel after SDS-PAGE, triturated, in-gel reduced, S-alkylated, and digested with trypsin, as previously reported (28Salzano A.M. Arena S. Renzone G. D'Ambrosio C. Rullo R. Bruschi M. Ledda L. Maglione G. Candiano G. Ferrara L. Scaloni A. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 1420-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gel particles were extracted with 25 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) by sonication, and digests were concentrated. Peptide mixtures were either desalted using μZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore) before direct MALDI-TOF MS analysis or resolved on a capillary Hypersil-Keystone Aquasil C18 Kappa column (100 × 0.32 mm, 5-μm particle size) (ThermoElectron, Waltham, MA) using a linear gradient from 10 to 60% of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 65 min. Collected fractions were concentrated and similarly analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. PNGase F, Dithiothreitol, and Phosphatase Treatment—Glycopeptides were deglycosylated by reacting with 0.2 unit of PNGase F (Roche) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, at 37 °C for 12 h. Peptides containing disulfide bonds were reduced by reacting with 10 mm DTT in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, at 37 °C for 3 h. Potential phosphopeptides were dephosphorylated by reacting with 2 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 1 h. 3 μl of 10% (v/v) formic acid was added to the reaction mixtures, and then they were desalted on μZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore) before MALDI-TOF MS analysis. MS Analysis—Intact recombinant proteins were analyzed with a Surveyor HPLC system connected on-line with an LCQ DecaXP Ion Trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron) equipped with an OPTON electrospray source operating at a needle voltage of 4.2 kV and a temperature of 320 °C. Analyses were performed using a narrow bore 250 × 2-mm C4 Jupiter column (300 Å pore size) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a gradient of solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN) to solvent A (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) that ranged from 30 to 70% over a period of 40 min. Mass spectra were recorded within the m/z 400-2000 range in positive mode. Multicharge spectra were deconvoluted using the BioMass program implemented in the Bioworks 3.1 package provided by the manufacturer. Mass calibration was performed by using UltraMark (ThermoElectron) as an internal standard. Whole protein digests or selected peptide fractions were loaded on the MALDI target together with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid) or 2,4,6-trihydroxy-acetophenone (3 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 50% 20 mm diammonium citrate) as matrices, using the dried droplet technique. Samples were analyzed with a Voyager-DE PRO spectrometer (Applera, Norwalk, CT) operating with a 337-nm laser (28Salzano A.M. Arena S. Renzone G. D'Ambrosio C. Rullo R. Bruschi M. Ledda L. Maglione G. Candiano G. Ferrara L. Scaloni A. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 1420-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were acquired in positive (with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) and negative (with 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone) polarities, using the instrument either in reflectron or linear mode. Internal mass calibration was performed with peptides from trypsin autoproteolysis or added molecular markers (Applera). Post-source decay (PSD) fragment ion spectra were acquired after isolation of the appropriate precursor, as previously reported (29Bernardini G. Renzone G. Comanducci M. Mini R. Arena S. D'Ambrosio C. Bambini S. Trabalzini L. Grandi G. Martelli P. Achtman M. Scaloni A. Ratti G. Santucci A. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2893-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In both cases, data were elaborated using the DataExplorer 5.1 software (Applera). Observed MALDI-TOF mass values were assigned to peptides, glycopeptides, or disulfide-linked peptides using the GPMAW 4.23 software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). This software generated a mass/fragment data base output based on protein sequence, protease selectivity, nature of the amino acids susceptible to eventual post-translational modifications, and the molecular mass of the modifying groups. Mass values were matched to protein regions using a 0.02% mass tolerance value. Post-translational modification assignments were always confirmed by additional MS experiments on modified peptides as treated above. All masses are reported as average values. Peptide numbering refers to mature human CA IX. Production of Recombinant CA IX Forms—Two soluble recombinant forms of human CA IX, both of which were missing the small transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains at the C terminus, were produced using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. The PG + CA form consisted of both the PG and CA catalytic domains, which encompass residues 1-377 in the mature CA IX sequence. The CA form included only the CA domain, encompassing residues 101-354 in the mature sequence (Fig. 1). Both recombinant proteins contained the CA IX signal sequence, which targets the protein to the secretory pathway within the cells, and the proteins were secreted into the medium due to the designated truncation at the C terminus. Both forms were purified to homogeneity with a single purification step, as clearly shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2). Only a single or doublet polypeptide band representing each CA IX product were visible on the gel. A thrombin site was included in the recombinant proteins to remove the His tag. Thrombin was active in removing the His tag for the PG + CA form (Fig. 2) but did not work for the CA form (data not shown). Thus, the His tag was removed from the PG + CA form for further analysis, whereas the tag was still present in the CA form. The nature of both CA IX products was assayed by Western blot using two CA IX-specific antibodies, including M75 (a monoclonal antibody recognizing only the PG domain) and a novel polyclonal antibody (anti-human CA IX, ahCAIX) that recognizes only the CA domain. As expected, the PG + CA form was recognized by both antibodies (M75 and ahCAIX), whereas the CA form was only recognized by ahCAIX (Fig. 2). During thrombin treatment of the PG + CA form, a small amount of protein species having an unexpected lower mass (a double band) appeared in the protein fraction. The Western blot showed that the lower mass protein species represented the CA domain, from which the PG domain was missing. This may result from a suboptimal thrombin cleavage site between the PG and CA domains. Another suboptimal thrombin cleavage site at the C terminus is likely to explain the doublet band of the PG + CA form, because the only post-translational modification observed for this protein in the mass spectrometric analysis (as shown later) was an N-linked glycosylation, which was confirmed not to cause the double band, as treatment with PNGase F resulted in a shift of both bands in the Western blot (supplemental Fig. S1). Oligomerization State of the Recombinant Proteins—The oligomerization of the recombinant CA IX proteins was investigated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions, SEC, and SEC combined with laser light scattering (SEC/LS). Both recombinant proteins were incubated with various DTT concentrations and subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE results indicated that both CA IX recombinant proteins existed as oligomeric forms, in addition to monomers. The PG + CA form consisted of ∼60% oligomeric and 34% monomeric species; the CA form consisted of about 54% oligomeric and 46% monomeric species (determined by densitometry). Incubating the samples with increasing concentrations of DTT gradually induced the disappearance of the oligomeric species, with a concomitant increase of the monomers, indicating that the oligomers are stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bond(s). For the CA form, the molecular weight standards indicated clearly that the protein is composed of monomers and dimers. For the PG + CA form, however, the size of the monomers was clearly exaggerated, and the size of the oligomers suggested trimerization rather than dimerization. To investigate further the oligomerization of these proteins under native conditions, SEC and SEC/LS analysis were performed. In the SEC experiments the CA form showed two major peaks, whose molecular mass values (calculated from a calibration curve with protein standards) clearly demonstrated the simultaneous presence of a protein monomer and dimer (data not shown), in accordance with the SDS-PAGE results. For the PG + CA form, the SEC analysis also showed the occurrence of two major peaks (P1 and P2 in Fig. 4A), whose elution position suggested an apparent molecular mass/hydrodynamic radius higher than expected, i.e. 334 kDa/5.5 nm and 121 kDa/4.0 nm, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). These values were much higher than that obtained during mass spectrometry for the monomer (43 kDa, see below), thus suggesting an abnormal SEC migration of this form, probably depending on the presence of"
https://openalex.org/W2038550582,"H9N2 avian influenza A viruses are endemic in poultry of many Eurasian countries and have caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. To evaluate the potential threat of H9N2 viruses to humans, we investigated the replication and transmission efficiency of H9N2 viruses in the ferret model. Five wild-type (WT) H9N2 viruses, isolated from different avian species from 1988 through 2003, were tested in vivo and found to replicate in ferrets. However these viruses achieved mild peak viral titers in nasal washes when compared to those observed with a human H3N2 virus. Two of these H9N2 viruses transmitted to direct contact ferrets, however no aerosol transmission was detected in the virus displaying the most efficient direct contact transmission. A leucine (Leu) residue at amino acid position 226 in the hemagglutinin (HA) receptor-binding site (RBS), responsible for human virus-like receptor specificity, was found to be important for the transmission of the H9N2 viruses in ferrets. In addition, an H9N2 avian-human reassortant virus, which contains the surface glycoprotein genes from an H9N2 virus and the six internal genes of a human H3N2 virus, showed enhanced replication and efficient transmission to direct contacts. Although no aerosol transmission was observed, the virus replicated in multiple respiratory tissues and induced clinical signs similar to those observed with the parental human H3N2 virus. Our results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of H9N2 viruses in poultry pose a significant threat for humans."
https://openalex.org/W2095691290,"Our understanding of how mammalian sensory circuits are organized and develop has long been hindered by the lack of genetic markers of neurons with discrete functions. Here, we report a transgenic mouse selectively expressing GFP in a complete mosaic of transient OFF-alpha retinal ganglion cells (tOFF-alphaRGCs). This enabled us to relate the mosaic spacing, dendritic anatomy, and electrophysiology of these RGCs to their complete map of projections in the brain. We find that tOFF-alphaRGCs project exclusively to the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and are restricted to a specific laminar depth within each of these targets. The axons of tOFF-alphaRGC are also organized into columns in the SC. Both laminar and columnar specificity develop through axon refinement. Disruption of cholinergic retinal waves prevents the emergence of columnar- but not laminar-specific tOFF-alphaRGC connections. Our findings reveal that in a genetically identified sensory map, spontaneous activity promotes synaptic specificity by segregating axons arising from RGCs of the same subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2064374911,"The ability of vertebrates to detect and avoid damaging extremes of temperature depends on activation of ion channels belonging to the thermo-TRP family. Injury or inflammation causes the release of inflammatory mediators which lower the threshold for detection of painful levels of heat, a process known as heat hyperalgesia. These inflammatory mediators act by at least three distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we show that modulation of the sensitivity of the heat-activated ion channel TRPV1 by the protein kinases PKA and PKC and by the phosphatase calcineurin depends on the formation of a signaling complex between these enzymes, the scaffolding protein AKAP79/150 and TRPV1. We identify a critical region in the TRPV1 C-terminal which mediates binding of AKAP79/150. If binding is prevented, then sensitization by both bradykinin and PGE2 is abrogated. AKAP79/150 is therefore a final common element in heat hyperalgesia, on which the effects of multiple proinflammatory mediators converge.

The temperature threshold of TRPV1, the best-studied thermo-TRP channel, is lowered by proinflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and nerve growth factor (NGF). The lowering of the TRPV1 threshold is critical for heat hyperalgesia, the process by which the threshold for heat pain is lowered following inflammation or injury, because heat hyperalgesia is ablated when TRPV1 is genetically deleted (Davis et al., 2000Davis J.B.

In a third pathway leading to sensitization of TRPV1, NGF potentiates TRPV1 by activating PI3 kinase and the tyrosine kinase Src, leading to phosphorylation of TRPV1 at Y200 and to promotion of trafficking of TRPV1 to the neuronal cell membrane (Zhang et al., 2005Zhang X.

The speed and specificity of the action of kinases is in many cases enhanced by the use of scaffolding proteins which preassemble the kinases into signaling complexes with their substrates. The AKAP (A kinase anchoring protein) family of scaffolding proteins were originally named for their ability to target PKA to appropriate substrates but are now known to assemble a wide range of kinases and phosphatases into signaling complexes with appropriate targets (Leiser et al., 1986Leiser M.

AKAP79 is the human homolog, while AKAP150, the rodent homolog, seems to be similar in function to AKAP79 but contains an additional large central domain.

An AKAP may be involved in the modulation of TRPV1 by PKA (Rathee et al., 2002Rathee P.K. Distler C. Obreja O. Neuhuber W. Wang G.K. Wang S.Y. Nau C. Kress M.

Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but neither the AKAP family member involved nor its binding site on TRPV1 have been identified, and the possibility that other kinases such as PKC and Src may also be assembled into a functional signaling complex important in the regulation of TRPV1 has not been explored. These questions are addressed in the present paper. Several AKAPs are expressed in sensory neurons, among them AKAP79/150 (Rathee et al., 2002Rathee P.K. Distler C. Obreja O. Neuhuber W. Wang G.K. Wang S.Y. Nau C. Kress M. PKA/AKAP/VR-1 module: a common link of Gs-mediated signaling to thermal hyperalgesia.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 1A shows that the vast majority of rat DRG neurons which express TRPV1 (left panel) also express AKAP150 (center panel and merged image in right panel). We found that 91.1% ± 1.7% of neurons expressing TRPV1 also expressed AKAP150 (mean ± SEM; n = 352). Evidence for a physical association between the two in sensory neurons was obtained in coimmunoprecipitation experiments in which pull-down of TRPV1, using an antibody raised to the TRPV1 N-terminal domain, also brought down AKAP150 (Figure 1B). In later experiments in this study it was important to be able to manipulate endogenous AKAP79/150 levels in both DRG neurons and in a HEK293 expression system. We constructed an siRNA against AKAP150 and AKAP79, as used by Hoshi et al., 2005Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Distinct enzyme combinations in AKAP signalling complexes permit functional diversity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar but in a vector which coexpresses GFP to enable identification of successfully transfected cells. The siRNA against AKAP150 reduced expression levels in transfected rat DRG neurons to 12.1% ± 1.9% of control (Figure 1C; n = 6), and the siRNA against AKAP79 reduced expression in HEK293 cells to 15.9% ± 2.6% of control (Figure 1D; n = 22). A similar but lesser downregulation was seen in Western blots of HEK293 cell protein (Figure 1E; 30.4% ± 2.5% of control, n = 3), a difference which is expected because not all cells are transfected. In all cases a scrambled siRNA with the same base composition was completely ineffective (Figures 1C–1E). The experiments in Figure 2 show that AKAP79 expressed in HEK293 cells binds to several members of the thermo-TRP family of ion channels. AKAP79 expressed in HEK293 cells coimmunoprecipitates with several thermo-TRPs (Figures 2A and 2B), particularly with TRPV1 and TRPV4, and to a lesser extent TRPM8 and TRPA1. Endogenous AKAP79 can also coimmunoprecipitate lesser amounts of TRPV1 (Figure 2B, top left panel). Figure 2C shows that the binding between TRPV1 and AKAP79 does not depend on the use of the V5 tag attached to the C-terminal as it is also observed when an antibody raised to the N-terminal TRPV1 domain is used. We next localized the TRPV1 binding site for AKAP79 by constructing GST-coupled fragments of the four intracellular domains of TRPV1, expressed in bacteria, and exploring binding to AKAP79 in vitro. The major binding domain is in the C-terminal portion of TRPV1 (Figure 2D), with only weak binding observed to the large N-terminal domain and no detectable binding to either of the intracellular loops. When the GST-coupled C-terminal domain was progressively truncated, there was an increase in binding on removal of the region between amino acids 759 and 777, probably because of removal of an inhibitory region, but more significantly there was a substantial loss of binding on removal of amino acids 736 to 749 (Figure 2E, left panel; note that all residue numbering is for hTRPV1). Deletion of just this region caused a major reduction in binding, while other nearby deletions were much less effective (Figure 2E, right panel). We repeated this deletion in intact TRPV1, expressed in HEK293 cells, and found that removal of this region also caused a substantial reduction in the binding of AKAP79 to intact TRPV1 (see Figure S1A available online). We next constructed a 14 aa peptide, identical to this binding domain, which should be able to compete for the site on AKAP79 to which TRPV1 binds. At a concentration of 200 μM this peptide largely prevented binding of AKAP79 to the GST-coupled C-terminal fragment of TRPV1, while a scrambled peptide of the same composition was ineffective (Figure 2F). The peptide was also highly effective in displacing AKAP79 from binding to intact TRPV1 (Figure 2G). We found that expression of AKAP79 enhanced the sensitivity of TRPV1 to capsaicin even in the absence of overt activation of PKC or PKA by proinflammatory mediators (Figure 3A, compare red points and red curve with black points and black curve). Conversely, expression of AKAP79 with the PKC binding site deleted (Hoshi et al., 2005Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Distinct enzyme combinations in AKAP signalling complexes permit functional diversity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) reduced the sensitivity of TRPV1 to activation by capsaicin (green points and curve). The fact that AKAP79 can enhance sensitivity, while deletion of the PKC binding site on AKAP79 has a dominant-negative effect, shows that phosphorylation by PKC is important in modulating sensitivity of TRPV1 even in the resting cell. The results also show that endogenous AKAP79 does not saturate its binding sites on TRPV1, because overexpression of AKAP79 has an effect greater than that of endogenous AKAP79. Deletion of the PKA binding site had a smaller effect than deletion of the PKC site (gray squares), showing that phosphorylation by constitutively active PKA is less important than PKC in the resting cell. The effect of expression of an AKAP79 with the calcineurin (PP2B) binding site deleted was indistinguishable from that of wild-type AKAP79 (blue points), suggesting that calcineurin bound to AKAP79 makes little contribution to dephosphorylating TRPV1 at resting levels of calcium. TRPV1 ion channels can be opened even in the absence of agonist by strong membrane depolarization (Voets et al., 2004Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. The principle of temperature-dependent gating in cold- and heat-sensitive TRP channels.Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC potentiates this process by enabling opening of TRPV1 at lower membrane potentials (Matta and Ahern, 2007Matta J.A. Ahern G.P. Voltage is a partial activator of rat thermosensitive TRP channels.J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and our demonstration that AKAP79 is involved in potentiation of TRPV1 by PKC suggests that it will have a similar effect. Figure 3B shows that activating PKC or overexpressing AKAP79 both have similar effects in potentiating the opening of TRPV1 by membrane depolarization, and moreover that the actions are to some extent additive. Figures 3C and 3D demonstrate that overexpression of AKAP79 shifts the voltage activation curve to less depolarized potentials by 54 mV, and that subsequent full activation of PKC causes an additional 32 mV negative shift. In summary, the experiments in Figure 3 show that expression of AKAP79 promotes activation of TRPV1 by both capsaicin and membrane potential, and moreover that this action depends mainly on the binding of PKC to AKAP79. We next investigated whether AKAP79/150 mediates the sensitization of TRPV1 caused by proinflammatory mediators. For these experiments, we used a low dose of capsaicin as a convenient activator of TRPV1, because the sensitivity of TRPV1 to heat, capsaicin, low pH, and a range of other activators is known to be enhanced in a similar way by proinflammatory mediators (Vellani et al., 2001Vellani V. Mapplebeck S. Moriondo A. Davis J.B. McNaughton P.A. Protein kinase C activation potentiates gating of the vanilloid receptor VR1 by capsaicin, protons, heat and anandamide.J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In rat sensory neurons, bradykinin caused a substantial enhancement of the inward current mediated by TRPV1 (Figure 4A), a process which has been shown to be due to phosphorylation of serines 502 and 801 by PKCɛ (Cesare and McNaughton, 1996Cesare P.

USA. 2003; 100: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Incorporation of the 14 aa peptide which prevents binding of AKAP150 to TRPV1 completely inhibited sensitization by Bk, while the scrambled peptide was ineffective (Figures 4A and 4B). An alternative way of demonstrating an involvement of AKAP150 is to downregulate endogenous expression using siRNA. Figures 4A and 4B show that removal of AKAP150 in this way almost completely inhibited the action of Bk in sensory neurons, while a scrambled siRNA was ineffective. Finally, simultaneously transfecting with AKAP79, which is insensitive to the siRNA against AKAP150 (Hoshi et al., 2005Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Distinct enzyme combinations in AKAP signalling complexes permit functional diversity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), rescued the sensitization by BK, and in fact the overexpression of AKAP79 causes an enhanced level of sensitization (final bar, Figure 4B). Bradykinin also caused a substantial sensitization of TRPV1 in HEK293 cells transfected with the Gq-coupled B2 receptor (Figure 4C). Sensitization was abolished by deletion of the PKC binding site on AKAP79, by downregulation of endogenous AKAP79 with siRNA, or by mutation of the S502 and S801 sites on TRPV1, which are known targets for phosphorylation by PKC (Numazaki et al., 2002Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Direct phosphorylation of capsaicin receptor VR1 by protein kinase Cepsilon and identification of two target serine residues.J. Biol.

Deletion of the PKA binding site, however, had a lesser effect than deletion of the PKC site (Figure 2C), as expected because PKC is the main kinase activated by bradykinin. The experiments in Figure 4 show that simple activation of PKC by a proinflammatory mediator such as brady"
https://openalex.org/W2018364998,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are highly subject-specific and vary considerably even between recording sessions of the same user within the same experimental paradigm. This challenges a stable operation of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. The classical approach is to train users by neurofeedback to produce fixed stereotypical patterns of brain activity. In the machine learning approach, a widely adapted method for dealing with those variances is to record a so called calibration measurement on the beginning of each session in order to optimize spatial filters and classifiers specifically for each subject and each day. This adaptation of the system to the individual brain signature of each user relieves from the need of extensive user training. In this paper we suggest a new method that overcomes the requirement of these time-consuming calibration recordings for long-term BCI users. The method takes advantage of knowledge collected in previous sessions: By a novel technique, prototypical spatial filters are determined which have better generalization properties compared to single-session filters. In particular, they can be used in follow-up sessions without the need to recalibrate the system. This way the calibration periods can be dramatically shortened or even completely omitted for these ‘experienced’ BCI users. The feasibility of our novel approach is demonstrated with a series of online BCI experiments. Although performed without any calibration measurement at all, no loss of classification performance was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2100701643,"The arrival of an action potential at a synapse triggers neurotransmitter release with a limited probability, p(r). Although p(r) is a fundamental parameter in defining synaptic efficacy, it is not uniform across all synapses, and the mechanisms by which a given synapse sets its basal release probability are unknown. By measuring p(r) at single presynaptic terminals in connected pairs of hippocampal neurons, we show that neighboring synapses on the same dendritic branch have very similar release probabilities, and p(r) is negatively correlated with the number of synapses on the branch. Increasing dendritic depolarization elicits a homeostatic decrease in p(r), and equalizing activity in the dendrite significantly reduces its variability. Our results indicate that local dendritic activity is the major determinant of basal release probability, and we suggest that this feedback regulation might be required to maintain synapses in their operational range."

This cocaine-evoked plasticity depends on NMDA receptor activation, but its behavioral significance in the context of addiction remains elusive. Here, we generated mice lacking the GluR1, GluR2, or NR1 receptor subunits selectively in dopamine neurons. We report that in midbrain slices of cocaine-treated mice, synaptic transmission was no longer strengthened when GluR1 or NR1 was abolished, while in the respective mice the drug still induced normal conditioned place preference and locomotor sensitization. In contrast, extinction of drug-seeking behavior was absent in mice lacking GluR1, while in the NR1 mutant mice reinstatement was abolished. In conclusion, cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity does not mediate concurrent short-term behavioral effects of the drug but may initiate adaptive changes eventually leading to the persistence of drug-seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2092653359,"The protease furin is induced on T cell activation and is a target of Stat-transcription factors in T cells. Studying furin has been hampered by the fact that germline deletion of this gene is embryonically lethal. Here furin's physiological role in T cells is studied using a T cell-specific furin knockout mice. The striking finding is that conditional deletion of furin in T cells results in loss of peripheral tolerance and systemic autoimmune disease. Furin deficiency compromises TGF-β release and Treg function, and is associated with inherently more aggressive effector T cells. This research suggests that inhibiting furin may promote the immune response but may also cause the loss of peripheral tolerance by reducing levels of bioavailable TGF-β-1. Conditional knockout of the protease furin in CD4+ T cells is shown to result in impaired peripheral tolerance and autoimmune disease. Furin deficiency compromises TGF-β release and Treg function, and is associated with inherently more aggressive effector T cells. Furin is one of seven proprotein convertase family members that promote proteolytic maturation of proproteins1. It is induced in activated T cells and is reported to process a variety of substrates including the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (refs 2–4), but the non-redundant functions of furin versus other proprotein convertases in T cells are unclear. Here we show that conditional deletion of furin in T cells allowed for normal T-cell development but impaired the function of regulatory and effector T cells, which produced less TGF-β1. Furin-deficient T regulatory (Treg) cells were less protective in a T-cell transfer colitis model and failed to induce Foxp3 in normal T cells. Additionally, furin-deficient effector cells were inherently over-active and were resistant to suppressive activity of wild-type Treg cells. Thus, our results indicate that furin is indispensable in maintaining peripheral tolerance, which is due, at least in part, to its non-redundant, essential function in regulating TGF-β1 production. Targeting furin has emerged as a strategy in malignant and infectious disease5,6. Our results suggest that inhibiting furin might activate immune responses, but may result in a breakdown in peripheral tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1975626677,"A single exposure to drugs of abuse produces an NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents in DA neurons; however, the importance of LTP for various aspects of drug addiction is unclear. To test the role of NMDAR-dependent plasticity in addictive behavior, we genetically inactivated functional NMDAR signaling exclusively in DA neurons (KO mice). Inactivation of NMDARs results in increased AMPAR-mediated transmission that is indistinguishable from the increases associated with a single cocaine exposure, yet locomotor responses to multiple drugs of abuse were unaltered in the KO mice. The initial phase of locomotor sensitization to cocaine is intact; however, the delayed sensitization that occurs with prolonged cocaine withdrawal did not occur. Conditioned behavioral responses for cocaine-testing environment were also absent in the KO mice. These findings provide evidence for a role of NMDAR signaling in DA neurons for specific behavioral modifications associated with drug seeking behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1982956265,"Previous neurophysiological studies suggest that attention can alter the baseline or gain of neurons in extrastriate visual areas but that it cannot change tuning. This suggests that neurons in visual cortex function as labeled lines whose meaning does not depend on task demands. To test this common assumption, we used a system identification approach to measure spatial frequency and orientation tuning in area V4 during two attentionally demanding visual search tasks, one that required fixation and one that allowed free viewing during search. We found that spatial attention modulates response baseline and gain but does not alter tuning, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, feature-based attention often shifts neuronal tuning. These tuning shifts are inconsistent with the labeled-line model and tend to enhance responses to stimulus features that distinguish the search target. Our data suggest that V4 neurons behave as matched filters that are dynamically tuned to optimize visual search."

CDKL5 is a rather uncharacterized kinase, but its involvement in RTT seems to be explained by the fact that it works upstream of MeCP2, the main cause of Rett syndrome. To understand the role of this kinase for nervous system functions and to address if molecular mechanisms are involved in regulating its distribution and activity, we studied the ontogeny of CDKL5 expression in developing mouse brains by immunostaining and Western blotting. The expression profile of CDKL5 was compared with that of MeCP2. The two proteins share a general expression profile in the adult mouse brain, but CDKL5 levels appear to be highly modulated at the regional level. Its expression is strongly induced in early postnatal stages, and in the adult brain CDKL5 is present in mature neurons, but not in astroglia. Interestingly, the presence of CDKL5 in the cell nucleus varies at the regional level of the adult brain and is developmentally regulated. CDKL5 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and the C-terminal tail is involved in localizing the protein to the cytoplasm in a mechanism depending on active nuclear export.

The current model explaining RTT onset in patients with MECP2 mutations suggests that defects occur in the nervous system due to the deregulation of a number of neuronal genes (20Chahrour M. Zoghbi H.Y. Neuron. 2007; 56: 422-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Accordingly, among other genes, MeCP2 has been shown to regulate the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene in an activity-dependent manner regulated by the specific phosphorylation of the methyl-binding protein (21Chen W.G. Chang Q. Lin X. Meissner A. West A.E. Griffith E.C. Janisch R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2003; 302: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 22Martinowich K. Hattori D. Wu H. Fouse S. He F.

However, since the efforts to identify MeCP2 target genes have not been able to justify the dramatic phenotype associated with the lack of the methyl-binding protein, some authors have proposed that MeCP2 functions other than transcriptional repression might play a role in RTT. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that MeCP2 is also involved in regulation of splicing and that aberrant alternative splicing patterns are observed in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (24Young J.I. Hong E.P. Castle J.C. Crespo-Barreto J. Bowman A.B. Rose M.F. Kang D. Richman R. Johnson J.M. Berget S. Zoghbi H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17551-17558Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the large-scale mapping of neuronal MeCP2 sites has revealed the presence of MeCP2 on a large number of active promoters, an observation, which has recently been reinforced by Ishibashi et al. (25Yasui D.H. Sailaja P. Bieda M.C. Vallero R.O. Hogart A. Nagarajan R.P. Thatcher K.N. Farnham P.J. LaSalle J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eventually, very lately it has been proposed that MeCP2 not only works as a repressor but also as an activator of transcription and that, at least in the hypothalamus, the activating functions are predominant (27Chahrour M. Jung S.Y. Shaw C. Zhou X. Wong S.T. Qin J. Zoghbi H.Y. Science. 2008; 320: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar).The human CDKL5 gene encodes a protein of 1030 amino acids with an N-terminal catalytic domain highly homologous to members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cyclin-dependent (CDK) kinase families (28Montini E. Andolfi G. Caruso A. Brchner G. Walpole S.M. Mariani M. Consalez G. Trump D. Ballabio A. Franco B. Genomics. 1998; 51: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein is rather uncharacterized but its involvement in RTT has been explained by the fact that this kinase seems to function in a molecular pathway common to that of MeCP2 (11Mari F. Azimonti S. Bertani I. Bolognese F. Colombo E. Caselli R. Scala E. Longo I. Grosso S. Pescucci C. Ariani F. Hayek G. Balestri P. Bergo A. Badaracco G. Zappella M. Broccoli V. Renieri A.

Landsberger N. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32048-32056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fact, the two proteins form a protein complex in vivo and the catalytic activity of CDKL5 mediates the phosphorylation of MeCP2 in vitro. Moreover, the two genes share temporal and spatial expression patterns in the brain and are simultaneously activated during neuronal maturation (11Mari F. Azimonti S. Bertani I. Bolognese F. Colombo E. Caselli R. Scala E. Longo I. Grosso S. Pescucci C. Ariani F. Hayek G. Balestri P. Bergo A. Badaracco G. Zappella M. Broccoli V. Renieri A. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Landsberger N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). According to the current model, CDKL5 works upstream of MeCP2 influencing directly or indirectly its phosphorylation state and thereby specific functions of the methyl-binding protein. In the absence of CDKL5, these phosphorylation-dependent activities of MeCP2 would be altered causing a subset of Rett symptoms. In addition, other as yet non-discovered targets of the kinase would also be deregulated, leading to the specific phenotype associated with CDKL5 mutations. In agreement with this model, so far, RTT causing mutations in CDKL5 have been found only in patients with the Hanefeld variant and never associated with classic RTT. The fact that the autonomous nervous system, whose malfunction in patients with MECP2 mutations causes severe respiratory problems and constipation, appears to be better preserved in patients with CDKL5 deficits reinforces also separate functions of the two proteins (30Rosas-Vargas H. Bahi-Buisson N. Philippe C. Nectoux J. Girard B. N′Guyen Morel M.A. Gitaux C. Lazzaro L. Odent S. Jonveaux P. Chelly J. Bienvenu T. J. Med.

MeCP2 is expressed in the embryonic brain but its levels increase significantly during late embryonic stages reaching levels that remain rather uniform during postnatal development where the methyl-binding protein is found in the nucleus of most neurons of the adult brain (31Shahbazian M.D. Antalffy B.

The induction of MeCP2 expression follows that of neuronal maturation, and the precise protein levels have shown to be crucial for correct synapse formation (23Zhou Z. Hong E.J. Cohen S. Zhao W.N.

Our data demonstrate that despite an expression profile generally overlapping that of MeCP2, CDKL5 peaks later in development, and its levels appear to be much more modulated than those of MeCP2. Furthermore, whereas MeCP2 is an exclusively nuclear protein, CDKL5 shuttles between the two main cellular compartments and the relative concentrations in each compartment seem to vary in different brain areas and during development. Eventually, we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of CDKL5, which is frequently deleted in pathogenic mutations, is involved in an active nuclear export mechanism modulating the subcellular distribution of the kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Astroglial cell cultures were prepared from newborn mice. Using a sterile technique, the animals were decapitated, the brains were removed and placed in Petri dishes containing PBS and penicillin-streptomycin. The cortical tissue was separated from the meninges and dissociated by trituration with a Pasteur pipette.

Newborn mice (P0), and mice of postnatal stages 12.5 (P12.5), and P120 were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of chloral hydrate, and the brains were fixed by intracardiac perfusion with NaCl 0,9%, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were removed and postfixed for 4–6 h in 20% sucrose in 4% PFA at 4 °C, placed in 20% sucrose in PBS overnight and frozen in dry ice. Cryostat sections were cut in the saggital or coronal plane at 20 μm and rinsed three times in PBS. Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 10% goat serum (Sigma) and 0,5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C in the same solution. The next day, sections were rinsed three times and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in a secondary antibody solution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:200 in PBS. After three washes, sections were incubated with the avidin-biotin complex in PBS for 1 h using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit, washed three times and the staining visualized by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.3 μl/ml hydrogen peroxide in PBS. Sections were dehydrated in ascending alcohols and mounted with DPX mounting media. To control for the specificity of the signal, sections were run through the entire procedure but without the incubation with the primary antibodies.The human brain samples are an autopsy from a postmortem brain and an operatory biopsy, respectively, from two adult women (ages 63 and 21 years old). Five micrometer sections were cut from the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue and used for immunohistochemistry experiments following the above procedures.Immunofluorescence—Human HeLa cells were seeded on gelatin-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 16-h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma), and the specific GFP signals analyzed with an Olympus BX51 Fluorescence microscope.For fluorescent double labeling, free-floating brain sections from adult C57BLJ6 mice or primary cortical neurons were stained. After 1 h in blocking solution (PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% Triton X-100), sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. Sections were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000, Molecular Probes) and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. After nuclear staining with DAPI for 5 min, they were mounted on glass slides and coverslips were applied using Moviol (Sigma) mounting medium. The slides were analyzed on an Olympus BX51 Fluorescence microscope.Mouse primary neurons were grown for 10 days in vitro and fixed with 4% PFA. After 10 min in permeabilization solution (HEPES 20 mm pH 7.4, sucrose 300 mm, MgCl2 3 mm, Triton X-100 0.2%) and 15 min in PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were rinsed three times, incubated with secondary antibodies, the nuclei stained with DAPI for 5 min, and the coverslips mounted for microscopy.Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Brain tissue fractionation was performed as follows. Differently aged CD1 mice were killed, brains or carefully dissected brain areas were rapidly explanted on ice, and homogenized in cytosolic lysis buffer (HEPES pH 7.5 20 mm; MgCl2 1.5 mm; KCl 10 mm; dithiothreitol 2 mm) by 50 strokes with an automatic Potter.

https://openalex.org/W2044706598,"Background Hepatitis B virus infection remains an important global health concern despite the availability of safe and effective prophylactic vaccines. Limitations to these vaccines include requirement for refrigeration and three immunizations thereby restricting use in the developing world. A new nasal hepatitis B vaccine composed of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in a novel nanoemulsion (NE) adjuvant (HBsAg-NE) could be effective with fewer administrations. Methodology and Principal Findings Physical characterization indicated that HBsAg-NE consists of uniform lipid droplets (349+/−17 nm) associated with HBsAg through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Immunogenicity of HBsAg-NE vaccine was evaluated in mice, rats and guinea pigs. Animals immunized intranasally developed robust and sustained systemic IgG, mucosal IgA and strong antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Serum IgG reached ≥106 titers and was comparable to intramuscular vaccination with alum-adjuvanted vaccine (HBsAg-Alu). Normalization showed that HBsAg-NE vaccination correlates with a protective immunity equivalent or greater than 1000 IU/ml. Th1 polarized immune response was indicated by IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokine production and elevated levels of IgG2 subclass of HBsAg-specific antibodies. The vaccine retains full immunogenicity for a year at 4°C, 6 months at 25°C and 6 weeks at 40°C. Comprehensive pre-clinical toxicology evaluation demonstrated that HBsAg-NE vaccine is safe and well tolerated in multiple animal models. Conclusions Our results suggest that needle-free nasal immunization with HBsAg-NE could be a safe and effective hepatitis B vaccine, or provide an alternative booster administration for the parenteral hepatitis B vaccines. This vaccine induces a Th1 associated cellular immunity and also may provide therapeutic benefit to patients with chronic hepatitis B infection who lack cellular immune responses to adequately control viral replication. Long-term stability of this vaccine formulation at elevated temperatures suggests a direct advantage in the field, since potential excursions from cold chain maintenance could be tolerated without a loss in therapeutic efficacy."

While it is well established that normal inactivation of photoexcited rhodopsin, the GPCR of rod phototransduction, requires arrestin (Arr1), it has been controversial whether the same requirement holds for cone opsin inactivation. Mouse cone photoreceptors express two distinct visual arrestins: Arr1 and Arr4. By means of recordings from cones of mice with one or both arrestins knocked out, this investigation establishes that a visual arrestin is required for normal cone inactivation. Arrestin-independent inactivation is 70-fold more rapid in cones than in rods, however.

Arrestins arrest the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) after they are phosphorylated by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) (Gurevich and Gurevich, 2006aGurevich E.V. Gurevich V.V.

Arrestin 1 (ARR1) was the first member of the family to be discovered and was established in the 1980s to inhibit the activation of transducin by photoactivated rhodopsin after the latter is phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) (Kuhn et al., 1984Kuhn H.

Sci. USA. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The requirement for GRK1 and ARR1 in the normal inactivation of rod photoresponses, including those to single photons, was established definitively in experiments with rods of Grk1−/− (Chen et al., 1999aChen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Abnormal photoresponses and light-induced apoptosis in rods lacking rhodopsin kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and Arr1−/− mice (Xu et al., 1997Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Prolonged photoresponses in transgenic mouse rods lacking arrestin.Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Craft et al., 1994Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. Wiechmann A.F. Cone arrestin identified by targeting expression of a functional family.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4613-4619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar discovered that cone photoreceptors and a subset of pinealocytes express a novel visual arrestin, CARR (hereafter, ARR4), distinct from ARR1 (see Experimental Procedures, “Nomenclature”). It is reasonable to hypothesize that the normal downregulation of cone opsin signaling requires phosphorylation by a GRK and subsequent binding of ARR4, in homology with the GRK1- and ARR1-dependent inactivation of rhodopsin in rods. In support of this hypothesis, Zhu et al., 2003Zhu X. Brown B. Li A. Mears A.J. Swaroop A. Craft C.M. GRK1-dependent phosphorylation of S and M opsins and their binding to cone arrestin during cone phototransduction in the mouse retina.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6152-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar found that mouse cone S- and M-opsins illuminated in vivo were indeed phosphorylated and bound Arr4 and that, in the absence of Grk1 (the only GRK expressed in mouse cone photoreceptors), neither phosphorylation of cone opsins nor Arr4 binding was detectable. The requirement for Grk1 for normal mouse cone inactivation was initially established with paired-flash electroretinographic recordings (Lyubarsky et al., 2000Lyubarsky A.L. Chen C. Simon M.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Mice lacking G-protein receptor kinase 1 have profoundly slowed recovery of cone-driven retinal responses.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later confirmed with recordings of mouse S- and M-opsin photoresponses of single cones of the Nrl−/− mouse (Nikonov et al., 2005Nikonov S.S. Daniele L.L. Zhu X.M. Craft C.M. Swaroop A. Pugh E.N. Photoreceptors of Nrl−/− mice coexpress functional S- and M-cone opsins having distinct inactivation mechanisms.J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, the requirement for Arr4 in normal cone opsin shutoff has seemed doubtful (Shi et al., 2007Shi G. Yau K.W. Chen J. Kefalov V.J. Signaling properties of a short-wave cone visual pigment and its role in phototransduction.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10084-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), due in part to a reportedly very low expression level (∼1:500 relative to cone opsin) (Chan et al., 2007Chan S. Rubin W.W. Mendez A. Liu X. Song X. Hanson S.M. Craft C.M. Gurevich V.V. Burns M.E. Chen J. Functional comparisons of visual arrestins in rod photoreceptors of transgenic mice.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 1968-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and no direct test of the role of Arr4 in the light response of living cones has been reported. To carry out a definitive test of the hypothesis that ARR4 can function in the inactivation of photoactivated cone opsins, we generated an Arr4−/− mouse and compared the light responses of its cones with those of wild-type (WT) mice. An unexpected complexity developed with the discovery that mouse cones express not only Arr4 but also Arr1 (Zhu et al., 2005Zhu X. Wu K. Rife L. Brown B. Craft C.M. Rod Arrestin expression and function in cone photoreceptors.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1179Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We thus also bred Arr4−/− mice into the Arr1−/− background and recorded and compared light responses of single cones of mice of the four genotypes: WT, single knockouts (Arr4−/− and Arr1−/−), and arrestin double knockouts (Arr4−/− Arr1−/−) (hereafter, “Arr-DKO”). Furthermore, because Arr4 in cones, like Arr1 in rods, is widely distributed throughout the cell and is known to undergo light-dependent redistribution between inner-segment and outer-segment compartments (Zhu et al., 2002aZhu X. Li A. Brown B. Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Craft C.M. Mouse cone arrestin expression pattern: light induced translocation in cone photoreceptors.Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 462-471PubMed Google Scholar), we quantified the expression levels and subcellular distributions of both visual arrestins in dark-adapted mouse cones. The strategy used to create mice null for expression of mouse cone arrestin (Arr4−/−) is schematized in Figure 1, along with evidence confirming the absence of Arr4 protein product. Homologous recombination of the targeting vector with the WT gene in mouse ES cells replaced exons 1–5 with the LacZ/Neo cassette. Since all cDNAs encoding Arr4 isoforms have the same translation start ATG codon (Zhu et al., 2002aZhu X. Li A. Brown B. Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Craft C.M. Mouse cone arrestin expression pattern: light induced translocation in cone photoreceptors.Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 462-471PubMed Google Scholar), this strategy resulted in the knockout of all Arr4 isoforms, as confirmed by restriction analysis (see Supplemental Data available online), by immunoblot analysis (Figure 1B), and immunohistochemistry (Figures 1C and 2).Figure 2Distributions of Arr1 and Arr4 in the Dark-Adapted RetinaShow full captionEach row of panels depicts confocal images of cryosections of a single retina of a mouse of the genotype specified at the left of the row.

In all cases, the cryosections were exposed to both Arr4 and Arr1 primaries and secondaries with exactly the same incubation procedure and were imaged with exactly the same settings of the confocal microscope.

The image in the middle column of the Arr-DKO row has been “stretched” so that the lowermost 10% of the intensity range is displayed, revealing negligible nonspecific fluorescence. See Supplemental Data for additional details. Mouse retinas express two distinct visual arrestins, Arr4 (“cone arrestin”) and Arr1 (“rod arrestin”) (Figure 2), and preliminary evidence has suggested both to be expressed in cones (Zhu et al., 2005Zhu X. Wu K. Rife L. Brown B. Craft C.M. Rod Arrestin expression and function in cone photoreceptors.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1179Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As Arr1 and Arr4 are highly homologous, a prerequisite to establishing their coexpression in cones is the availability of antibodies that can discriminate between them. The antibodies LUMIj and D9F2, raised against unique peptides of Arr4 and Arr1, respectively (Supplemental Data), meet the critical test provided by immunohistochemical labeling of retinal sections of mice of the four genotypes: WT, Arr4−/−, Arr1−/−, and Arr-DKO (Figure 2). Thus, LUMIj reacts immunochemically only with cones of genotypes that express Arr4 (WT, Arr1−/−), while D9F2 reacts only with cones of genotypes that express Arr1 (WT, Arr4−/−). Moreover, neither antibody reacts with retinas of Arr-DKO mice. While the specificity of LUMIj and D9F2 for Arr4 and Arr1, respectively, is a necessary condition for establishing Arr1 coexpression in cones, additional hurdles remain to be overcome. Arr1 is highly expressed in rods whose 30 to 1 preponderance over cones and high density in the retina contribute immunofluorescence that may be misinterpreted as originating in cones. To obviate this potential artifact, we employed high-resolution, two-color confocal imaging (Figure 2), which allowed us to probe for Arr1 and Arr4 expression in volume elements (voxels) that lie securely within the boundaries of most segments of the cone. Arr4 and Arr1 are distributed throughout the dark-adapted photoreceptor layer (Figure 2), and so we determined their distributions and quantities in the different subcellular compartments of cones. The ratio of Arr4 to rhodopsin in the mouse retina was estimated with quantitative immunoblot analysis to be ∼1:550 (Table S1). Given that a C57Bl/6 eye has 600 pmol rhodopsin (Lyubarsky et al., 2004Lyubarsky A.L. Daniele L.L. Pugh Jr., E.N.

Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, Jeon et al., 1998Jeon C.J. Strettoi E. Masland R.H. The major cell populations of the mouse retina.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8936-8946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each retina contains ∼1.1 pmol Arr4, or 3.3 × 106 molecules/cone. Since each mouse cone outer segment contains ∼2.7 × 107 opsin molecules (Nikonov et al., 2006Nikonov S.S. Kholodenko R. Lem J. Pugh E.N. Physiological features of the S- and M-cone photoreceptors of wild-type mice from single-cell recordings.J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), Arr4 stands in a 1:8 ratio to the opsin content of a cone. The quantity of Arr1 per cone was estimated to be ∼1.7 × 108 molecules/cone, about 50-fold higher than the quantity of Arr4. This number was obtained by quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence distribution of the Arr1-specific antibody D9F2 in adjacent rods and cones (Figure 3 and Supplemental Data) combined with a previous estimate of the ratio of Arr1 to rhodopsin in the retina (0.78:1) (Strissel et al., 2006Strissel K.J. Sokolov M. Trieu L.H. Arshavsky V.Y. Arrestin translocation is induced at a critical threshold of visual signaling and is superstoichiometric to bleached rhodopsin.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The distributions of the two arrestins over the various cone compartments are somewhat different. In particular, Arr4 appears more concentrated in the cone pedicle than is Arr1 (Table 1). The dark-adapted cone outer segment contains about 10% of the total Arr1 or Arr4, and so the total quantity of arrestins (predominantly Arr1) in the dark-adapted outer segment is about 70% of the quantity of cone opsin.Table 1Estimated Quantities of Arr1 and Arr4 in Subcellular Compartments of WT ConesQuantity (Unit)Whole ConeOuter SegmentInner SegmentCell BodyAxonPedicleVolume (μm3; fraction)950 ± 2200.05aThese volumes are distorted to higher values in part by the small size of the imaged objects relative to the microscope point-spread function; thus, EM data (Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979) lead to a cone OS envelope volume estimate of 14 μm3, while our results yield the OS volume estimate 0.05 × 950 μm3 = 47 μm3; adjusted for this 3-fold over estimate, and for the ∼2-fold ratio of OS water space to OS volume, the concentrations in the dark-adapted cone OS would be about 6-fold higher than those given in the table.0.140.300.20aThese volumes are distorted to higher values in part by the small size of the imaged objects relative to the microscope point-spread function; thus, EM data (Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979) lead to a cone OS envelope volume estimate of 14 μm3, while our results yield the OS volume estimate 0.05 × 950 μm3 = 47 μm3; adjusted for this 3-fold over estimate, and for the ∼2-fold ratio of OS water space to OS volume, the concentrations in the dark-adapted cone OS would be about 6-fold higher than those given in the table.0.30Arr4 (molecules; fractions)3.3 × 1060.100.160.220.100.42Arr1 (molecules; fractions)1.7 × 1080.110.220.180.190.30Arr4 (concentration, μM)126.64.22.98.1Arr1 (concentration, μM)650470180280300The topmost row identifies the regions of the cone characterized, while entries in the leftmost column identify the objects and quantities in that row.

The volumetric quantities were extracted from LUMIj-Alexa 555 fluorescence of cones with the 3D “cookie cutting” method, as illustrated in Figure 3. Given that both Arr1 and Arr4 are expressed in mouse cones, it is natural to inquire whether both arrestins function in the downregulation of cone phototransduction. This issue was addressed by comparing the light responses of cones of mice expressing only Arr1 or only Arr4 with responses of WT cones and of cones of mice lacking both arrestins (Figure 4). Response families of cones of WT, Arr4−/−, and Arr1−/−mice were grossly similar, while those of Arr-DKO mice exhibited greatly slowed recovery from strong flashes, considered further below (Figures 4A, 4D, 4G, and 4J). Analysis of the activation phase of the light responses reveals that the amplification constant (A) of phototransduction is similar across all four genotypes (Figures 4B, 4E, 4H, and 4K and Table 2). Nonetheless, the average value of A for WT cones (4.7 s−2) is reliably lower by 17% than the grand average (5.7 s−2) over all 58 cones, while the average values for cones of the knockout genotypes range from 5% (Arr1-DKO) to 23% (Arr1−/−) above (Table 2). Flash sensitivity (S˜F) also is reliably different among genotypes, such that the mean sensitivity of WT cones is 19% below the grand average, while the mean sensitivities of knockout cone populations range from 4% below average (Arr4−/−) to 28% above (Arr1−/−, Arr1-DKO) (Table 2). These differences among cones of different genotypes in properties characterizing “activation” are modest, however, and support the general conclusion that the initial reactions in cone phototransduction are essentially normal in the knockouts and do not contribute a distinguishing phenotype. It is notable in this context that there are no reliable differences among cones in the time to peak (tpeak) of the dim-flash response.Table 2Physiological Properties of Cones of WT, Arr4−/−, Arr1−/−, and Arr-DKO MiceGenotype, Cell TypeParameterRmaxS˜FAtpeak∗τDI½I′½(Number of Cells∗)UnitpAΔR%/(Photons μm−2)(s−2)(ms)(ms)Photons μm−2s−1Photons μm−2s−1WT (n = 29; 17)7 ± 10.021 ± 0.0034.7 ± 0.669 ± 363 ± 5(2.2 ± 0.4) × 105(1.5 ± 0.3) × 105Arr4−/− (n = 11; 8)7 ± 10.025 ± 0.0066.7 ± 1.866 ± 484 ± 12(1.6 ± 0.3) × 105(1.0 ± 0.2) × 105Arr1−/− (n = 10; 6)10 ± 30.033 ± 0.0067.0 ± 1.265 ± 485 ± 12(1.1 ± 0.3) × 105(0.8 ± 0.2) × 105Arr-DKO (n = 18; 10)9 ± 20.033 ± 0.0076.9 ± 1.064 ± 2NA(0.8 ± 0.2) × 105(0.6 ± 0.1) × 105Column 1 gives the genotypes of the mice and numbers of cones of each genotype from which recordings were made (∗the value of n after the semicolon gives the number from which step-response families were recorded).

(∗The time to peak has not been adjusted for the delay caused by the analog filtering of the recordings with the 8 pole, 20 Hz bandwidth filter used; measurements show this delay to be ∼21 ms.) A clear phenotype in arrestin knockout mice can be seen in comparison of the initial recoveries of responses of cones of the different genotypes from strong, i.e., saturating, flashes (compare Figures 4A, 4D, 4G, and 4J). This phenotype can be quantified by “Pepperberg plot” analysis, in which the time to reach a criterion level of recovery is plotted semilogarithmically as a function of flash intensity (e.g., 40%, as in Figures 4C, 4F, 4I, and 4L) (Pepperberg et al., 1992Pepperberg D.R. Cornwall M.C. Kahlert M. Hofmann K.P. Jin J. Jones G.J. Ripps H. Light-dependent delay in the falling phase of the retinal rod photoresponse.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 8: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A more complete quantification is obtained by plotting the average recovery times of a population of cones of each genotype for several different recovery levels: over the range of saturating intensities, the recovery times of WT cones are approximately linear in semilog coordinates, with slopes almost independent of the recovery level (Figure 5, inset). Such recoveries thus obey the “recovery shape invariance” criterion necessary for being well characterized by a dominant time constant, τD (Nikonov et al., 1998Nikonov S. Engheta N. Pugh Jr., E.N. The kinetics of recovery of the dark adapted salamander rod photoresponse.J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For cones lacking Arr1 or Arr4, recovery times deviate slightly from linearity, but again, as for WT cones, are nearly constant with criterion level (Figure 5, inset). However, in the case of the Arr-DKO cones, the variation in slope with criterion is extreme. These analyses confirm for populations of cones what is seen in the records of individual cones in Figure 4: the expression of either Arr1 or Arr4 is sufficient for a basically normal initial recovery, while the absence of both arrestins results in greatly slowed recovery for saturating flashes. Nonetheless, the reliably higher average value of τD (∼85 ms) of Arr4−/− and Arr1−/− cones over WT cones (63 ms) (Table 2) indicates that the initial phase of recovery from saturating flashes is to some extent slowed by deletion of either arrestin. In WT cones, the initial rapid phase of recovery from saturating flashes is, for the strongest flashes, followed by a second phase, a “slow tail” that increases in amplitude with flash strength (Figure 4A). In Arr-DKO cones, the greatly slowed recoveries from saturating flashes do not exhibit two distinct recovery phases, but slow tails are observed in the responses of Arr4−/− and Arr1−/− c"

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been reported to attenuate inflammatory signaling pathways and, as such, may interfere with cardiac remodeling. Accordingly, the objectives of the present study were to explore the relationship between cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and inflammation and to investigate whether PPARα and PPARδ are able to inhibit NF-κB activation and, consequently, the hypertrophic growth response of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NCM). mRNA levels of markers of both hypertrophy and inflammation were increased following treatment with the pro-hypertrophic factor phenylephrine (PE) or the chemokine TNF-α. Induction of inflammatory genes was found to be fast (within 2 h after stimulation) and transient, while induction of hypertrophic marker genes was more gradual (peaking at 24–48 h). Inflammatory and hypertrophic pathways appeared to converge on NF-κB as both PE and TNF-α increased NF-κB binding activity as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Following transient transfection, the p65-induced transcriptional activation of a NF-κB reporter construct was significantly blunted after co-transfection of PPARα or PPARδ in the presence of their respective ligands. Finally, adenoviral overexpression of PPARα and PPARδ markedly attenuated cell enlargement and the expression of hypertrophic marker genes in PE-stimulated NCM. The collective findings reveal a close relationship between hypertrophic and inflammatory signaling pathways in the cardiomyocyte. It was shown that both PPARα and PPARδ are able to mitigate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro by inhibiting NF-κB activation.

It was shown that both PPARα and PPARδ are able to mitigate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro by inhibiting NF-κB activation. Evidence is accumulating that chronic inflammation plays an important role in cardiac disease. This notion is based, among others, on the observation that heart failure patients show elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 3The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PE, phenylephrine; qPCR, quantitative PCR; TGF, transforming growth factor; NCM, neonatal cardiomyocytes; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor.

In addition, cytokines have been implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy (2Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin.

Circulation. 1997; 95: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), most likely via downstream activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (4Purcell N.H. Tang G. Yu C. Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6668-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of different homo- and heterodimers of which p50/p65 is transcriptionally the most active dimer in the heart (5Hall G. Hasday J.D. Rogers T.B. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 41: 580-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In its inactive state, NF-κB resides within the cytoplasm through its interaction with inhibitor-κBα (IκBα). Upon phosphorylation of IκBα by inhibitor-κB kinase-β (IKKβ), NF-κB dissociates from IκBα allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to NF-κB response cis-elements in target genes. It is proposed that inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways, in general, and NF-κB, in particular, could be beneficial for the diseased heart (6Ogata T. Miyauchi T. Sakai S. Takanashi M.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors acting as modulators of lipid metabolism as well as inflammation (8Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B.

Indeed, treatment of animals with PPAR ligands has been reported to mitigate inflammation following cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (11Wayman N.S. Ellis B.L. Thiemermann C. Med. Sci.

Two of the three PPAR isoforms, i.e. PPARα (NR1C1) and PPARδ (NR1C2), are abundantly expressed in the cardiac muscle cell (15Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H.

Whether the putative anti-inflammatory properties of PPARα and PPARδ affect cardiomyocyte hypertrophy still remains to be established. We hypothesized that growth-promoting stimuli elicit an inflammatory response in cardiomyocytes and that pro-hypertrophic and inflammatory signaling pathways converge on NF-κB. Secondly, it was investigated whether PPARα and PPARδ are able to inhibit NF-κB activation in the cardiomyocyte and whether this provides a molecular mechanism to mitigate cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCM) were stimulated with several growth-promoting neuroendocrine factors or with pro-inflammatory agents for up to 48 h, and time-dependent changes in the expression of established markers of hypertrophy and inflammation were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Activation of NF-κB was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Transient transfection studies with expression vectors and promoter/reporter constructs were performed to investigate the functional interaction of the NF-κB subunit p65 with PPARs. In addition, the ability of PPARs to attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was explored using pharmacological (isoform-specific PPAR ligands) and molecular tools (adenoviral overexpression of PPARα and PPARδ). The collective findings reveal a close relationship between hypertrophic and inflammatory signaling pathways in the cardiomyocyte. We demonstrate for the first time that both PPARα and PPARδ are able to inhibit NF-κB activation in vitro and, in this way, may mitigate hypertrophic remodeling of the cardiac muscle cell. Chemicals—TNF-α and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and angiotensin II (AngII) from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Isoform-specific ligands for PPARα (Wy-14,643) and PPARδ (GW501516) were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The PPAR ligands were dissolved in DMSO; TGF-β and AngII in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); PE in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and all other chemicals in distilled water. Cell Culture—Neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCM) were isolated and cultured as described by de Vries et al. (22de Vries J.E. Vork M.M. Roemen T.H. de Jong Y.F. Cleutjens J.P. van der Vusse G.J. van Bilsen M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1384-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using differential plating to separate myocytes from non-myocytes. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and User Committee of the Maastricht University. Briefly, 1–2-day-old Lewis rats were decapitated, and the hearts removed. The hearts were digested with a collagenase solution (Collagenase Type I, Invitrogen) followed by differential plating. Cells were plated in a density of 2.5 × 104 per well in 6-well plates or 2 × 106 in 10-cm dishes coated with 1% gelatin and cultured overnight in plating medium (4:1 DMEM and Media 199) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% newborn calf serum, 50 mg/liter gentamicine, 10 mm glucose, and 10 μm cytosine β-d-arabino furanoside (Ara C). Ara C was added to suppress growth of remaining fibroblasts. 16 h after cell isolation, NCM were incubated in serum-free medium consisting of a 4:1 mixture of DMEM/M199, gentamicin (50 mg/liter) and glucose (10 mm) as the sole substrate for 24 h. Subsequently, experimental medium was applied to the cells. The experimental medium consisted of serum-free medium enriched with 0.25 mm l-carnitine, 0.25 milliunits/ml insulin, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Ara C was present during the entire cell culture. NCM were stimulated with either hypertrophic growth factors, i.e. the α1-adrenergic agonist PE (10 μm), endothelin-1 (ET-1, 1 nm), AngII (10 μm), TGF-β (10 ng/ml), or with the inflammatory agents lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml) and TNF-α (50 ng/ml), and cells were harvested for RNA or protein isolation 2, 12, 24, and 48 h after exposure. Appropriate vehicles served as controls. At the concentrations used, none of the agents induced significant cell loss. RNA Isolation and qPCR—RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR were performed as previously described (23Teunissen B.E. Smeets P.J. Willemsen P.H. De Windt L.J. Van der Vusse G.J. Van Bilsen M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 100 ng of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis. Primers used are given in supplemental Table S1. Results were normalized to the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A. Relative changes in expression were calculated using GeneX software (Bio-Rad). Plasmids—For transient transfection studies the following promoter/reporter constructs were used; mCPT-I-luc (15Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), mutated mCPT-I-luc construct (23Teunissen B.E.

Expression vectors used were: pSG5 containing cDNA of mouse PPARα or PPARδ (kindly provided by Dr. Staels, Institut Pasteur, Lille, France); pCMV4 containing cDNA of human p65 (kind gift from Dr. Van der Saag) and pON249 containing CMV-β-galactosidase. As a positive control for the transfection assay, we used pSVOAL-luc in which luciferase is driven by the RSV promoter. Transient Transfection—NCM were transfected 24 h after cell isolation using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis IN) with 0.5 μg of promoter/reporter vector (15Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The CMV-β-galactosidase containing vector pON249 (0.25 μg) was co-transfected to check for transfection efficiency. In a subseries of experiments 0.25 μg of expression vectors containing the cDNA of PPARα, PPARδ, or p65 were co-transfected. The total amount of plasmid DNA per well (1.25 μg) was kept constant by adding empty pSG5 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). After 16 h of transfection, experimental medium was added to the cells followed by exposure to PE (10 μm) in the absence or presence of Wy-14,643 (10 μm, EC50 = 0.63 μm) or GW501516 (1 μm, EC50 = 0.024 μm). The affinity and selectivity of these ligands for their PPAR isoforms have been described previously (15Gilde A.J. van der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H. Chinetti G. van der Leij F.R. van der Vusse G.J. Staels B. van Bilsen M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h (m-CPT-I and NF-κB reporter/promoter) or 48 h (ANF reporter/promoter) after start of treatment and immediately processed for the determination of reporter activity. Luciferase activity was determined using a commercial firefly luciferase assay according to the supplier's instructions (Steady Glo, Promega) in white 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc International, Maperville, IL) on a FluorS imager (Bio-Rad) for measuring luminescence. β-Galactosidase activity was assessed spectrophotometrically (Titertek Multiskan Plus MKII, Thermo Lab-Systems, Helsinki, Finland) as described previously (24Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—NCM were exposed to TNF-α or PE for the times indicated. Cells were harvested by scraping in ice-cold PBS supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (125 mm NaF, 250 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 25 mm NaVO3), followed by centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold low-salt buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were allowed to swell at 4 °C for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s. Subsequently, the supernatant fraction was discarded after a short spin. Pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of ice-cold high-salt buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant (containing DNA-binding proteins) was stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined with the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). EMSA—A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus binding site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) was end-labeled at 37 °C in the following reaction mix: 2 μl of ds oligonucleotide (1.75 pmol/μl), 2 μl of 5× kinase buffer, 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl), and 2.5 μl of [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml). After 2 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 90 μl of TE buffer. To separate the labeled probe from unbound ATP, the reaction mixture was eluted on ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (4 μg of protein) were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) Next, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (∼60,000 cpm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Where indicated, p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or specific competitor oligonucleotide were added 10 min prior to incubation with labeled probe at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% acrylamide gel. After drying of the gels, autoradiography was performed using Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) and by scanning on a Phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Adenoviral Infection—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing human PPARα (AdPPARα), human PPARδ (AdPPARδ), and control virus (AdCMV) were kindly provided by Dr. Staels (Institut Pasteur, Lille, France). Adenoviruses were multiplied and purified as previously described (23Teunissen B.E. Smeets P.J. Willemsen P.H. De Windt L.J. Van der Vusse G.J. Van Bilsen M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Prior to treatment with Wy-14,643 or GW501516, NCM were infected with 50 IFU/cell for 24 h in serum-free medium. To check functionality of adenoviral infection of NCM at 50 IFU, the expression of the PPAR-target gene PDK4 was assessed. There was no significant cell death induced by adenoviral infection at 50 IFU. Assessment of Cell Size—NCM were grown on laminin (10 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips and fixated with methanol for 3 min at -20 °C. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, cells were incubated overnight with an antibody against α-actinin (Sigma) dissolved in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Next, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), dissolved in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. Cells were washed again, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Cardiomyocyte surface area (μm2) was determined from randomly selected fields from three independent cell cultures using Quantimet 570 software (Leica, the Netherlands). Statistics—Each experiment was conducted in triplicate in at least three independent cardiomyocyte isolations. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferonni Post-Hoc test or Dunnet's Post-Hoc when appropriate using SPSS 12 software (SPSS Inc.). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy and Inflammation—To investigate the relationship between cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation, NCM were incubated with either neuroendocrine growth factors (AngII, ET-1, PE, or TGF-β) or pro-inflammatory agents (LPS or TNF-α). The early (2 h) and late (24 h) effects of these distinct stimuli on the expression of COX-2 and ANF, markers of inflammation and hypertrophy, respectively, were determined. Already 2 h after administration of pro-hypertrophic as well as inflammatory agents, COX-2 mRNA levels were increased severalfold (Fig. 1A), whereas the mRNA level of ANF was not yet affected to a significant extent (Fig. 1B). After 24 h, however, COX-2 expression had returned to near basal levels, whereas expression of ANF was markedly up-regulated at this later time point. Given the temporal differences in response of COX-2 or ANF to the pro-hypertrophic and pro-inflammatory stimuli, the time course of changes in the expression of an extended set of markers of hypertrophy (the natriuretic proteins ANF and BNP, the sarcomeric protein α-skeletal actin, α-SKA) and inflammation (COX-2, TNF-α) was examined in more detail using PE and TNF-α as hypertrophic and inflammatory stimulus, respectively. Following PE or TNF-α stimulation the expression of ANF showed a gradual increase as a function of time, reaching statistical significance at 12 h (Fig. 2A). After 2 h of stimulation with either PE or TNF-α BNP mRNA was already up-regulated (Fig. 2B). Only in PE-treated cells, BNP expression increased further thereafter. The expression of α-SKA was found to increase slowly during PE and TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the expression of the two inflammatory genes COX-2 and TNF-α (Fig. 2, D and E) rapidly increased within the first 2–12 h and declined thereafter in both PE- and TNF-α-treated cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these findings point to a functional relationship between hypertrophy and inflammation in that established hypertrophic stimuli give rise to the expression of inflammatory genes and, vice versa, that inflammatory stimuli induce expression of established hypertrophic genes. NF-κB Activation during Hypertrophy and Inflammation—To explore whether the early expression of pro-inflammatory genes following application of the α1-adrenergic agonist PE and the cytokine TNF-α was associated with activation of the NF-κB pathway, NF-κB DNA binding activity was monitored by EMSA (Fig. 3). The NF-κB oligonucleotide incubated with nuclear extracts of NCM gave rise to 3 distinct bands. The p65 antibody resulted in a supershift of only one band, indicating that this band contains the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 3A). Exposure of NCM to TNF-α evoked a robust increase in NF-κB DNA binding, reaching maximal intensity after 30 min (Fig. 3B). PE stimulation of NCM also resulted in an early increase in NF-κB DNA binding, albeit that peak levels were lower. At later time points (2–48 h), NF-κB DNA binding activity in PE-stimulated cells returned to control levels, whereas binding activity remained elevated in TNF-α stimulated NCM (Fig. 3C). Interaction of PPAR and NF-κB—Results above demonstrate that hypertrophic stimuli cause NF-κB activation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Previous studies provided evidence that cross-interaction exists between PPARs and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (16Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M.

Jove M. Michalik L. Wahli W. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Cardiovasc Res. 2005; 65: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was examined whether in the cardiomyocyte context PPARα and PPARδ inhibit the activity of NF-κB. Therefore, NCM were co-transfected with a p65 expression vector and the NF-κB reporter construct. Subsequently, the ability of PPARα and PPARδ (in the absence or presence of their cognate ligands) to inhibit the p65-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity was determined. Overexpression of p65 led to a more than 8-fold increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). Treatment of NCM with the PPARα ligand Wy-14,643 or the PPARδ ligand GW501516, or co-transfection with either PPARα or PPARδ, did not alter the p65-mediated transcriptional activity of NF-κB. However, in combination with their cognate ligands co-transfection with PPARα and PPARδ significantly blunted NF-κB activity by 40–50% (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, it was tested whether p65 interferes with PPAR-mediated transactivation of the PPAR-responsive mCPT-1 promoter/reporter construct. Addition of Wy-14,643 and GW501516 resulted in a 3- and 4-fold increase of the transcriptional activity of the mCPT-1 promoter, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, following co-transfection with p65, Wy-14,643, and GW501516-mediated mCPT-1 promoter activation was almost completely abrogated. The experiments were repeated with a mCPT-I promoter in which the PPAR response element (PPRE) binding site was mutated. None of the above conditions affected the transcriptional activity of the mutated promoter, thereby verifying that the effects were dependent on a functional PPRE (Fig. 5, A and B). PPAR Overexpression and Hypertrophy—Subsequently, it was investigated whether PPARα or PPARδ are able to attenuate hypertrophy. NCM were infected with either AdPPARα or AdPPARδ, or with AdCMV (control) prior to stimulation with PE. The functionality of the PPAR viruses was confirmed by showing that the expression of the PPAR-responsive gene PDK4 increased substantially following infection (data not shown). Treatment of AdCMV infected, control NCM with PE for 24 h significantly increased sarcomere organization (Fig. 6A) and cardiomyocyte size (Fig. 6B), indicative of cellular hypertrophy. AdPPARα or AdPPARδ infection significantly attenuated the PE-induced sarcomere formation and cell enlargement, irrespective of the addition of Wy-14,643 or GW501516. Treatment with Wy-14,643 or GW501516 alone did not affect the PE-induced cell morphology (data not shown). Stimulation of NCM with TNF-α did not give rise to a significant increase in NCM size. In line with previous studies (10Ding G. Cheng L. Qin Q. Frontin S. Yang Q. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 821-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Takano H. Nagai T. Asakawa M. Toyozaki T. Oka T. Komuro I. Saito T. Masuda Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), infection with AdPPARα or AdPPARδ blunted the TNF-α induced expression of inflammatory markers like COX-2 (data not shown). Secondly, in AdPPARα or AdPPARδ infected NCM the PE-induced ANF mRNA expression was lowered by almost 50% (Fig. 7, A and B) and induction of BNP was almost completely blunted (Fig. 7, C and D). Treatment of AdPPARα-or AdPPARδ-infected NCM with Wy-14,643 or GW501516 did not result in an additional effect. Finally, transient transfection assays were performed using an ANF promoter/reporter construct as readout for the hypertrophic gene program. PE stimulation led to an almost 15-fold increase in ANF promoter activity (Fig. 8). The PE-induced ANF promoter activity was not affected when cardiomyocytes were exposed to either Wy-14,643 or GW501516. When the cells were co-transfected with PPARα or PPARδ expression vectors, ANF promoter activity was further enhanced. However, in combination with their corresponding ligands overexpression of each PPAR isoform profoundly inhibited PE-induced ANF promoter activity. The collective findings indicate that PPAR overexpression mitigated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In the present study it is demonstrated that, similar to bona fide pro-inflammatory stimuli, a variety of growth-promoting factors elicit a marked inflammatory response, characterized by induction of TNF-α and COX-2 expression by NCM. The pro-hypertrophic and inflammatory signaling pathways in the cardiomyocyte appear to converge on NF-κB. These observations point to a close relationship between the hypertrophic and inflammatory signaling pathways in the cardiac muscle cell and suggest that anti-inflammatory interventions could be therapeutically effective. Accordingly, the ability of PPARα and PPARδ to attenuate inflammation, and thereby hypertrophy, w"
https://openalex.org/W2132520926,"Despite increasing evidence for transcriptional control of neural connectivity, how transcription factors regulate discrete steps in axon guidance remains obscure. Projection neurons in the dorsal spinal cord relay sensory signals to higher brain centers. Some projection neurons send their axons ipsilaterally, whereas others, commissural neurons, send axons contralaterally. We show that two closely related LIM homeodomain proteins, Lhx2 and Lhx9, are expressed by a set of commissural relay neurons (dI1c neurons) and are required for the dI1c axon projection. Midline crossing by dI1c axons is lost in Lhx2/9 double mutants, a defect that results from loss of expression of Rig-1 from dI1c axons. Lhx2 binds to a conserved motif in the Rig-1 gene, suggesting that Lhx2/9 regulate directly the expression of Rig-1. Our findings reveal a link between the transcriptional programs that define neuronal subtype identity and the expression of receptors that guide distinctive aspects of their trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W2008396028,"Two-component signaling systems allow bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Typically, a chemical or other stimulus is detected by the periplasmic sensor domain of a transmembrane histidine kinase sensor, which in turn relays a signal through a phosphotransfer cascade to the cognate cytoplasmic response regulator. Such systems lead ultimately to changes in gene expression or cell motility. Mechanisms of ligand binding and signal transduction through the cell membrane in histidine kinases are not fully understood. In an effort to further understand such processes, we have solved the crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domains of Escherichia coli DcuS and of Vibrio cholerae DctB in complex with the respective cognate ligands, malate and succinate. Both proteins are involved in the regulation of the transport and metabolism of C4-dicarboxylates, but they are not highly related by sequence similarity.

The ability of bacteria to monitor and adapt to their environment is crucial to their survival, and two-component signal transduction systems mediate most of these adaptive responses. One component is a histidine kinase sensor, most commonly part of a homodimeric transmembrane sensor protein, and the second component is a cytoplasmic response regulator. The two components interact in tandem through a phosphotransfer cascade (1West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 2Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct.

A typical transmembrane sensor protein contains a periplasmic sensor domain and a cytoplasmic histidine kinase domain. Upon binding of a ligand to the periplasmic sensor domain, this signal is transduced across the membrane to the cytoplasmic domain where an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue occurs (1West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The phosphate is subsequently transferred to a conserved aspartate residue in the response regulator protein by an auto-catalyzed reaction (2Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), ultimately leading to adaptive modulation of gene expression. In some circumstances, sensor stimulation leads to dephosphorylation. Within the large family of protein histidine kinases, the sequence of the sensor domain is considered to be modular, whereas that of the histidine kinase domain is more conserved. Over the past decade, especially with the determination of numerous bacterial genome sequences, hundreds of new histidine kinase proteins have been identified but remain unstudied.The DcuS-DcuR two component system is involved in the regulation of the anaerobic fumarate respiratory pathway in Escherichia coli (5Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Golby P. Davies S. Kelly D.J. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensor kinase DcuS is a member of the CitA family of histidine kinases, and it responds to C4-dicarboxylates such as fumarate, succinate, malate, and tartrate (5Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Janausch I.G. Zientz E. Tran Q.H. Kroger A. Unden G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Upon detection of its cognate ligand, the DcuS-DcuR system up-regulates the synthesis of both fumarate reductase (frdABCD) and also the anaerobic fumarate-succinate anti-porter DcuB. DcuS is predicted to contain an ∼140-residue periplasmic domain flanked by two hydrophobic transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic portion comprising a coiled-coil domain, a cytoplasmic PAS domain, and a histidine kinase domain (6Golby P. Davies S. Kelly D.J. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown in vitro that the sensing of C4-dicarboxylates by DcuS is through direct binding (8Janausch I.G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39809-39814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the solution structure of the periplasmic domain of DcuS has been solved (9Pappalardo L. Janausch I.G. Vijayan V. Zientz E. Junker J. Peti W. Zweckstetter M. Unden G. Griesinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39185-39188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the mechanism of ligand binding is still unclear.The DctB-DctD two-component system is involved in the regulation of C4-dicarboxylate uptake in rhizobia as part of nitrogen fixation (10Giblin L. Boesten B. Turk S. Hooykaas P. O'Gara F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 126: 25-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DctB, like DcuS, is a transmembrane sensor kinase that has been shown to be involved in the direct sensing of C4-dicarboxylates such as succinate (11Reid C.J. Poole P.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But its periplasmic sensor domain is predicted to contain ∼270 amino acid residues, almost twice that of the DcuS sensor domain (12Giblin L. Archdeacon J. O'Gara F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 19-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The response regulator DctD controls the expression of the dicarboxylate transporter DctA, another integral membrane protein (10Giblin L. Boesten B. Turk S. Hooykaas P. O'Gara F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 126: 25-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have shown that either the ligand specificity or the signaling state of DctB may be modified by DctA, through a possible direct interaction between DctA and DctB (7Janausch I.G. Zientz E.

It shows high sequence similarity to the previously studied rhizobial DctB sensors, and it has been grouped into the NtrB C4-dicarboxylate sensor histidine kinase family (7Janausch I.G. Zientz E. Tran Q.H. Kroger A. Unden G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The exact function of DctB in V. cholerae has yet to be determined.In this study we present high resolution crystal structures of the periplasmic domains of both E. coli DcuS and V. cholerae DctB in complexes with their cognate ligands malate and succinate, respectively. These two sensor domains show similarities in structure and in ligand binding that provide possible clues toward the understanding of signal transduction in two-component histidine kinase proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning—For the generation of the DcuS construct, a DNA fragment corresponding to the periplasmic domain of DcuS from residues 42 to 181 was PCR-amplified from genomic E. coli K12 DNA (ATCC Bioproducts) using the appropriate 5′ and 3′ primers. The primers were engineered to produce a DNA fragment flanked by a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end and an XhoI restriction site at the 3′ end followed by a stop codon. The amplified DNA was subsequently ligated into the ampicillin-selectable pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) expression vector at the BamHI/XhoI sites. The resulting construct allowed for the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation; SeMet, selenomethionyl; PEG MME, polyethylene glycol monoethyl ether. -inducible expression of a soluble N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing an internal thrombin cleavage site that would leave only an additional glycine and serine residue on the N-terminal end of the protein upon cleavage.Generation of the periplasmic DctB construct entailed PCR amplification of a DNA fragment corresponding to residues 28-286 of DctB from genomic V. cholerae MO45 DNA (ATCC Bioproducts). The 5′ primer used in the PCR contained an NdeI restriction site, and the 3′ primer contained a stop codon and an XhoI restriction site. The resulting DNA fragment could be ligated into the ampicillin-resistant Novagen pET22b+ expression vector at the NdeI/XhoI polylinker site for IPTG-inducible expression of the protein. The product of this expression retains the N-terminal methionine residue from the vector ahead of Arg-28.Expression and Purification—Native DcuS-(42-181) protein was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from a 4-liter culture of Novagen E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was originally started as a 1:100 inoculation from an overnight culture grown in LB (100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C. Induction began with the addition of IPTG to 1 mm for 2 h at 37 °C upon reaching an optical density (OD) of 0.6. Selenomethionyl (SeMet) DcuS-(42-181) was produced in the same manner except that 4 liters of minimal media containing SeMet was used instead of LB, and the overnight culture was grown in minimal media containing methionine instead of SeMet. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Cell supernatant was prepared by sonication and cleared by centrifugation, passed through an 8-ml glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (GE Healthcare) column, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The fusion protein was eluted from the column with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm glutathione. The protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 26/60 (GE Healthcare) column previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then cleaved for 4 h at 20 °C by the addition of thrombin to a concentration of 1 unit of thrombin/mg of fusion protein. The cleaved DcuS-(42-181) was then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 (GE Healthcare) column previously equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mml-malate. The protein appeared to be monomeric by gel filtration chromatography and was homogeneous when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE.SeMet DctB-(28-286) was expressed in the same manner as SeMet DcuS-(42-181) except that only a 2-liter culture of cells was used instead with induction at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of Q-buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Cell supernatant was prepared by sonication and cleared by centrifugation. DctB-(28-286) was purified by passing the supernatant through a 5-ml Hi-Trap Q™ column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with Q-buffer, washing with 20 volumes of Q-buffer, and elution using a 50-400 mm NaCl gradient over a total volume of 120 ml. DctB-(28-286) eluted from the column at around 150 mm NaCl and was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 (GE Healthcare) column previously equilibrated with Q-buffer, in which it appeared monomeric. A final purification step was performed by ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ 10/10 (GE Healthcare) column, using a 50-300 mm NaCl gradient over a total volume of 120 ml. The purified fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE.Crystallization—Native DcuS-(42-181) crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir buffer containing 24% polyethylene glycol monoethyl ether (PEG MME) 2000, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 0.2 m ammonium citrate, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5 at 4 °C. A protein concentration of 18.5 mg/ml and a protein to buffer ratio of 1:1 (1 + 1 μl) was used. SeMet DcuS-(42-181) crystals were grown by the same method with the same buffer, except the concentration of PEG MME 2000 was reduced to 20%, and a protein concentration of 16 mg/ml was used. Long hexagonal rod-shaped crystals typically appeared overnight and grew to a reasonable size within a week. Crystals were briefly soaked in cryoprotectant containing 25% PEG MME 2000, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 0.2 m ammonium citrate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 7.5% glycerol prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen.SeMet DctB-(28-286) crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C against a buffer containing 6% isopropyl alcohol, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. A protein concentration of 8.5 mg/ml was used with a protein to buffer ratio of 1:1 (2 μl + 2 μl). Crystals typically appeared overnight and grew to an optimal size within 2 weeks. The crystals were initially soaked in crystallization buffer supplemented with glycerol and ethylene glycol at 7.5 and 5%, respectively; and crystals were then subsequently transferred to a comparable buffer in which the glycerol and ethylene glycol was raised to 15 and 10%, respectively, prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen.Structure Determination of DcuS-(42-181) in Complex with Malate—A four-wavelength MAD experiment at the selenium K-edge was collected on a single frozen SeMet crystal at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Diffraction data to Bragg spacings of 2.0 Å (165 mm detector distance) were collected with 10-s exposure times and 1.2° oscillations at each of the four wavelengths, using inverse beam measurements for the accurate determination of Bijvoet differences. Data were also collected from a single native crystal in two parts, first at a 125-mm detector distance for 15-s exposure times at 1° oscillations and second at a detector distance of 225 mm for 3-s exposure times at 4° oscillations. Two passes were required because very strong reflections at low angles overloaded the detector at the longer exposure times required for the collection of high angle data. The native crystal diffracted to a limit of 1.4-Å spacings. Denzo and Scalepack of the HKL program package (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Purified DcuS-(42-181) was concentrated to 45 mg/ml and loaded into one channel of a two-channel cell of very low path length (24Minton A.P. Lewis M.S. Biophys. Chem. 1981; 14: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (∼0.04 mm) with sapphire windows for absorption measurements at 280 nm. Because of the extremely thin path length of the cell, an air blank was used in the empty channel. The sample was sedimented to equilibrium in an AN-50Ti rotor spun at 17,000, 21,000, and 26,000 rpm at 4 °C, and absorbance scans were taken at 1-h intervals. The program WinMatch (written by J. Lary and D. A. Yphantis, available from the SPIN6 FTP site) was used to verify the attainment of equilibrium, and equilibrium data from all three speeds were fit as a group using the nonlinear least squares program Win-NONLIN (25Johnson M.L.

The asymmetric unit contains one molecule, with clear electron density for residues 46-178 in the initial maps. A total of 133 ordered residues (46-178), 152 water molecules, and one l-malate molecule were refined against native data to a resolution of 1.45 Å with an R and Rfree of 21.9 and 23.2%, respectively (Tables 1 and 3).The structure of DcuS-(42-181) consists of a mixed α/β-structure containing a central β-sheet flanked on either side by α-helices. The central β-sheet is composed of antiparallel strands S1 to S5. N- and C-terminal helices H1 and H6 lie on one side of the sheet; helices H2, H3a, H3b, H4, H5a, and H5b lie on the other side of the sheet, connected to the central sheet through loop regions. Extents of structural elements are shown in Fig. 2. Electron density for malate, a component of the purification buffer, was found in a concave pocket located on the front side of the sheet.FIGURE 2Structure-based sequenced alignments.

Two nearly identical molecules were found in the asymmetric unit, with residues 28-285 ordered in one unit, including the N-terminal Met, and residues 29-286 ordered in the other. A total of 517 residues, two succinate molecules, two calcium ions, and 722 water molecules were refined to a resolution of 1.7 Å to a final R and Rfree of 16.2 and 19.9%, respectively (Tables 2 and 3).The structure of DctB-(28-286) is a mixed α/β-structure containing two subdomains of similar folds, each consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by helices on either side. The overall architecture (Fig. 1, C and D) is such that the distal (relative to the membrane surface) upper subdomain (residues 54-177) is inserted between the first two helices (H1a and H5) of the proximal lower subdomain (residues 28-53 and 178-286). Strands S1 to S5 form the central core of the distal subdomain, and strands S6 to S10 form the core of the proximal subdomain. Helices H1a, H5, H6, H7, and H8 are in the proximal subdomain, whereas helices H1b, H2, H3, and H4 are in the distal subdomain (Fig. 2A). Helices H1-H3 and H5 lie on one side of the central sheet in each subdomain, and the other helices lie on the opposite side. An unusual solvent-exposed Trp in position 259 is found near the apex of the S8 to S9 loop of the proximal subdomain.Four features of non-protein electron density were found in the structure. Equivalent distinctive features, best fit as succinate, were located in concave pockets along the front side of each distal β-sheet. Succinate is an adventitious ligand, presumably from the E. coli cytosol, and was not a crystallization additive. Two additional spherical features were modeled in as calcium ions with well defined coordination by carbonyl, carboxyl, and water oxygens. Both, one near Asp-66 and the other near Asp-263, mediate lattice contacts between protein molecules. Calcium acetate was a required crystallization ingredient.Structural Similarities between DcuS-(42-181) and DctB-(28-286)—The DcuS and DctB sensor domains contain similar protein folds, where the two su"
https://openalex.org/W2130878425,"The liver is the main organ that clears circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and hepatocytes are a major cell type involved in LPS uptake. Little is known about the mechanisms for LPS internalization in hepatocytes and what signaling pathways are involved. We show here that LPS uptake is initiated after formation of a multi-receptor complex within lipid rafts. We find that essential components for LPS uptake are CD14, TLR4, MD2, and the beta2-integrin CD11b/CD18. Activation of p38 MAPK is also essential for the initiation of LPS uptake, and interestingly, we show that this activation is not through TLR4 signaling by MyD88 but through activation of TIRAP via CD11b/CD18. However, TLR4/MD2 remain essential components at the cell surface as part of the LPS receptor complex. We therefore suggest novel roles for TLR4/MD2, CD11b/CD18, TIRAP, and p38 MAPK in LPS uptake by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2041238826,"Gonadal steroid production is stimulated by gonadotropin binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although GPCR-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP are known regulators of steroidogenesis, the roles of other signaling pathways in mediating steroid production are not well characterized. Recent studies suggest that luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor activation leads to trans-activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors in the testes and ovary. This pathway is critical for LH-induced steroid production in ovarian follicles, probably through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated release of EGF receptor (EGFR) binding ectodomains. Here we examined LH and EGF receptor cross-talk in testicular steroidogenesis using mouse MLTC-1 Leydig cells. We demonstrated that, similar to the ovary, trans-activation of the EGF receptor was critical for gonadotropin-induced steroid production in Leydig cells. LH-induced increases in cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity mediated trans-activation of the EGF receptor and subsequent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, ultimately leading to StAR phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation. Steroidogenesis in Leydig cells was unaffected by MMP inhibitors, suggesting that cAMP and PKA trans-activated EGF receptors in an intracellular fashion. Interestingly, although cAMP was always needed for steroidogenesis, the EGFR/MAPK pathway was activated and necessary only for early (30–60 min), but not late (120 min or more), LH-induced steroidogenesis in vitro. In contrast, 36-h EGF receptor inhibition in vivo significantly reduced serum testosterone levels in male mice, demonstrating the physiologic importance of this cross-talk. These results suggest that GPCR-EGF receptor cross-talk is a conserved regulator of gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis in the gonads, although the mechanisms of EGF receptor trans-activation may vary.

These results suggest that GPCR-EGF receptor cross-talk is a conserved regulator of gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis in the gonads, although the mechanisms of EGF receptor trans-activation may vary. Steroid production in the testes begins with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 2The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone; LHR, luteinizing hormone receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIA, radioimmunoassay; MEK, MAPK kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor. secretion from the hypothalamus. GnRH stimulates pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from gonadotrophs in the pituitary, followed by LH binding to G protein-coupled LH receptors on testicular Leydig cells to promote steroidogenesis. In males, LH pulsations occur approximately every 2 h, and this steady rhythm is believed to be important for maximum testosterone production (1Scaglia H.E. Carrere C.A. Mariani V.A.

Hammes S.R. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One of the major mechanisms by which cAMP promotes steroidogenesis is by increasing expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) (7Stocco D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Miller W.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). StAR is needed to bring cholesterol into the mitochondria for conversion to steroid, an event generally believed to be the rate-limiting step in steroid production. Evidence suggests that phosphorylation of StAR is critical for its activation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria (10Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss 3rd, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition to cAMP, several studies have implicated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling as a potential regulator of steroidogenesis in both the ovary and testes. First, EGF increases StAR expression in Leydig cells over the course of several hours (11Manna P.R. Chandrala S.P. Jo Y. Stocco D.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 37: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Manna P.R. Huhtaniemi I.T. Wang X.J. Eubank D.W. Stocco D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1393-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) triggers rapid phosphorylation of the EGFR in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells that are overexpressing LH and EGF receptors (13Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, inhibition of EGFR signaling blocks LH-induced steroid production in MA-10 Leydig cells, as well as in isolated ovarian follicles (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LH receptor signaling triggers activation of the EGFR is still controversial. Several in vitro studies of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have shown that the GPCRs can trans-activate EGFRs through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated release of membrane-bound EGFR-activating ectodomains (e.g. HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and epiregulin) (16Pierce K.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies suggest that such EGFR trans-activation can occur independent of MMPs through intracellular signaling pathways that might include cAMP and/or Src (20Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 21Shah B.H. Baukal A.J. Shah F.B. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In mouse follicles, MMP inhibitors block EGFR phosphorylation, gonadotropin-induced oocyte maturation, and steroidogenesis, suggesting that extracellular signaling is essential for EGFR trans-activation (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Ashkenazi H. Cao X. Motola S. Popliker M. Conti M. Tsafriri A.

Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 924-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In MA-10 mouse Leydig cells, MMP inhibitors also reduce phosphorylation of the EGFR (13Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this reduction in the Leydig cells is only partial, and MMP inhibition does not block gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis in the same cells (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the importance of MMPs in regulating LH actions in the testes remains uncertain. To address the role of LH and EGF receptor cross-talk in the physiologic response to gonadotropin signaling in Leydig cells, steroid production and release, we performed detailed signaling and steroidogenesis studies in the mouse MLTC-1 Leydig cell line. These cells express endogenous LH and EGF receptors and rapidly produce progesterone in response to LH or hCG stimulation. We found that LH receptor activation led to rapid but transient cAMP-dependent activation of the EGFR and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. This gonadotropin-induced kinase cascade was essential for short term (∼30 min), but not prolonged (∼2 h), LH receptor-mediated steroidogenesis. Importantly, both short and long term LH-induced steroidogenesis occurred independent of MMP activation, suggesting that, in Leydig cells, the EGFR pathway was activated through intra- rather than extracellular signals. Tissue Culture and Materials—MLTC-1 mouse Leydig cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher) supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For each study, cells were plated in either 12- or 6-well plates followed by serum starvation overnight to synchronize the cells and reduce background kinase activity. Notably, most of the steroidogenesis experiments were also performed without serum starvation, and the results were identical. Galardin, TAPI-1, AG1478, H-89, PP2, and U0126 (Calbiochem) were added for 30 min prior to hCG (Sigma) stimulation and kept present throughout each experiment. Erlotinib was a gift from Dr. John Minna (University of Texas Southwestern). Forskolin was from Calbiochem and FGF-2 from PeproTech. EGFR/MAPK Activation—After treatment with hCG ± inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends, cells were washed once with cold PBS followed by addition of 125 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The lysis buffer was supplemented with 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Plates were placed on a shaker at 4 °C for 15 min, cells were scraped and microcentrifuged at full speed for 15 min, and supernatants were removed and diluted 1:2 in 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Western blots for phospho- and total-EGF receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) were performed as described below. StAR Expression—Mitochondrial isolation was performed as described (12Manna P.R. Huhtaniemi I.T. Wang X.J. Eubank D.W. Stocco D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1393-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, hCG ± inhibitors were added to cells in 6-well plates for the indicated times, and cells were washed one time with cold PBS and then placed in 250 μl of TSE buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA). After 15 min of gentle shaking in the cold room, the cells were scraped from the plates and homogenized using 20 strokes of a pellet pestle (Kimble Kontes). Lysates were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Finally, supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of TSE, and samples were diluted 1:2 in 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) was used to measure protein concentrations, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis as described below. Primary Leydig Culture—All mice were treated in accord with accepted NIH and University of Texas standards of humane animal care. The primary Leydig cell culture protocol was adapted from Hamra et al. (24Hamra F.K. Gatlin J. Chapman K.M. Grellhesl D.M. Garcia J.V. Hammer R.E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14931-14936Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–4-month-old male C57/B6 mice were used. The testes were removed and added to 20 ml of DMEM:Ham's F-12 (1:1) (Sigma) medium containing 0.5 mg/ml collagenase 1A (Sigma) and 1.0 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min while being rocked by hand every 5 min. After allowing the pellets to settle by gravity for a few minutes, supernatants were filtered through 70-micron mesh (BD Falcon™) twice. The filtrates were centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g, supernatants were removed, and cellular pellets were resuspended in DMEM:Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were placed in 6-well plates and stimulated with hCG ± inhibitors for steroidogenesis as described. Western Blot—Samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for EGFR detection, 10% gels for ERK1/2, or 14% gels for StAR. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). These membranes were blocked with 5% milk (Carnation) in TBST (100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in TBST plus 5% milk. Blots were then washed three times with TBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with (1:4000) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) in TBST plus milk, and washed another three times with TBST. Finally, blots were treated with ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare) to visualize the proteins. For EGFR detection, 1:2000 anti-phospho-EGFR Tyr-1173 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) and 1:1000 anti-total-EGFR (Cell Signaling) were used. For ERK signaling, 1:2000 anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-total-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) antibodies were used (25Lutz L.B. Kim B. Jahani D. Hammes S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For StAR detection, 1:10,000 anti-StAR antibody (Doug Stocco, Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX) and 1:2000 anti-phospho-StAR antibody (Dr. Steven King, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston TX) were used. For StAR detection, 30 μg of total mitochondrial protein was used per well. Steroid Radioimmunoassays—To measure steroid content in the media, a progesterone RIA kit (MP Biomedicals) was used for MLTC-1 cells, whereas a testosterone RIA kit (MP Biomedicals) was used for the primary Leydig cells. Assays were performed as directed in the inserts. In Vivo Steroidogenesis Assays—Seven-week-old male C57/B6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 20 μm AG1478 suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) or PBS/dimethyl sulfoxide alone. Injections were repeated after 24 h, and serum was removed from anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture 8 h after the second injection. Serum testosterone levels were measured by RIA. EGFR Signaling Is Necessary for Short but Not Long Term Gonadotropin-induced Steroidogenesis—To determine the sensitivity of MLTC-1 Leydig cells for gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis, cells were treated with increasing amounts of hCG for 30 min, and progesterone levels in the media were measured by RIA. As shown in Fig. 1A, the EC50 for hCG-induced steroidogenesis was ∼0.01 IU/ml, with saturation occurring at about 0.5 IU/ml. Saturating amounts of hCG (5 IU/ml) were used for all studies shown in this manuscript, although similar results were obtained when using concentrations near the EC50 (data not shown). Importantly, hCG-induced steroid production was consistently detectable as early as 30 min and reached a steady peak at about 2 h (Fig. 1B). Therefore, for all studies in this manuscript, steroid production was measured at both 30 and 120 min. To determine the importance of EGFR signaling in gonadotropin-induced steroid production, MLTC-1 mouse Leydig cells were serum-starved overnight and pretreated for 30 min with the EGFR inhibitors AG1478 or erlotinib. Cells were then incubated with hCG for 30 min or 2 h with the inhibitors still present. EGFR signaling was required for hCG-induced steroidogenesis at 30 min, as both AG1478 and erlotinib almost completely abrogated steroid production (Fig. 2A, open bars). Surprisingly, neither of the EGFR inhibitors had more than a very modest inhibitory effect on hCG-induced steroidogenesis at 2 h (Fig. 2A, closed bars), suggesting that EGFR signaling was no longer required for steroidogenesis at the later time point. Accordingly, gonadotropin-induced EGFR activation was seen only at the early time point, as hCG induced significant phosphorylation of the EGFR at 30 min but virtually none at 2 h (Fig. 2B). This loss of EGFR activation in the setting of persistent steroidogenesis suggested that alternative pathways were being utilized to promote steroid production at 2 h. Notably, both AG1478 and erlotinib abrogated hCG-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR at 30 min and baseline EGFR phosphorylation at 2 h (Fig. 2B), confirming that they were inhibiting EGFR kinase activity as expected and for the duration of the experiment. Interestingly, EGF alone at a concentration that triggers phosphorylation of the EGFR (data not shown) did not promote significant steroid production at either 30 min or 2 h (Fig. 2C), indicating that EGFR signaling is necessary but not sufficient for early gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis in MLTC-1 cells. How is the EGFR being activated in response to hCG? Some studies demonstrate that GPCR-mediated activation of MMPs can promote the shedding of EGFR ligands from the cell surface that then act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to activate EGFRs (16Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 17Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In fact, recent studies suggest that MMP activation may contribute to LH-induced activation of the EGFR in MA-10 Leydig cells (13Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although MMP inhibition did not appear to affect LH-induced steroid production in the same cells (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In MLTC-1 mouse Leydig cells, MMP activation was not required for hCG-induced steroidogenesis at any time point, as the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor galardin had no effect on steroidogenesis (Fig. 2A). Notably, this same batch of galardin could inhibit hCG-induced steroid production in ovarian follicles (data not shown), where MMP activation is clearly important for steroidogenesis (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), indicating that the inhibitor was functioning appropriately. Furthermore, the tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor, TAPI-1, had no effect on hCG-induced steroidogenesis in MLTC-1 Leydig cells (data not shown), indicating that, in addition to MMPs, TACE-mediated release of EGFR-activating ectodomains was not regulating gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis. To confirm the aforementioned results in a more biologically relevant setting, primary Leydig cells were isolated from adult male mice and similarly treated with hCG and an EGFR inhibitor. Similar to the results in the MLTC-1 Leydig tumor cell line, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 significantly blocked steroid production at 30 min but not at 2 h in primary Leydig cells (Fig. 2D). Importantly, although steroidogenesis in primary Leydig cells was not altered by AG1478 at 2 h using an in vitro assay, in vivo treatment of male mice with AG1478 for 36 h significantly reduced serum testosterone levels relative to mock-injected mice (Fig. 2E), confirming the physiologic importance of LH and EGF receptor cross-talk in regulating testicular steroidogenesis. EGFR Signaling Activates the MAPK Cascade to Regulate Gonadotropin-mediated Steroid Production—To determine the role of other intracellular kinases in the regulation of gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis, the effects of both Src and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors on hCG-mediated steroid production were examined. In some systems, Src kinases have been implicated as potential regulators of GPCR-mediated trans-activation of the EGFR (16Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the Src inhibitor PP2 had no effect on hCG-induced steroid production at either 30 min or 2 h in MLTC-1 cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that Src signaling is not necessary for steroid production in Leydig cells. In contrast, similar to the results using EGFR inhibitors, blockade of MEK signaling with U0126 almost completely eliminated steroidogenesis at 30 min but had significantly less of an effect at 2 h (Fig. 3B). As with EGFR signaling, MEK activity was dramatically induced by hCG at 30 min but was barely present at 2 h (Fig. 3C). Notably, U0126 abrogated any detectable MEK activity at both time points, confirming that is was functioning appropriately throughout the time course of the experiment. These findings suggested that, like the EGFR, MEK signaling was important for early, but not late, gonadotropin-induced steroid production. Furthermore, the nearly identical patterns of EGFR and MEK signaling suggested that these two kinases may have been functioning together during early gonadotropin-induced steroid production. In fact, although U0126 blocked MEK activity at 30 min (Fig. 3C), it had no effect on hCG-induced EGFR activation at the same time point (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 significantly blocked both EGFR activation (Fig. 2A) and MEK signaling (Fig. 3E, third lane). These results indicate that MEK signaling is probably downstream of EGFR signaling. Importantly, addition of FGF rescued the inhibitory effects of AG1478 on hCG-induced MEK activation (Fig. 3D, fourth lane), confirming that AG1478 was not directly blocking MEK signaling. However, FGF did not rescue steroidogenesis under these conditions (Fig. 3F, fourth bar). Furthermore, as seen with EGF (Fig. 2C), MEK activation by FGF alone (Fig. 3E, last lane) was not sufficient to promote steroidogenesis at 30 min (Fig. 3F, last bar). Together, these results suggest that activation of both the EGFR and MEK are necessary, but not sufficient, for early gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. cAMP and Protein Kinase A (PKA) Are Required for Activation of the EGFR during Early Gonadotropin-induced Steroid Production—Because cAMP and PKA are known to be critical regulators of steroid production in all steroidogenic tissues (3Dufau M.L. Tsuruhara T. Horner K.A. Podesta E. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3419-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Jamnongjit M. Hammes S.R. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the roles of these signaling molecules in regulating steroidogenesis in the context of EGFR trans-activation were examined. As expected, inhibition of PKA signaling with H-89 significantly reduced hCG-induced steroidogenesis in MLTC-1 cells at both 30 min and 2 h (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, H-89 abrogated hCG-induced phosphorylation of both the EGFR and ERK1/2 at 30 min (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that PKA acted upstream of EGFR signaling. Notably, as seen in Figs. 2 and 3, hCG-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR and ERK1/2 were significantly reduced at 2 h (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, H-89 completely abrogated the small amount of remaining hCG-induced MEK activity at 2 h (Fig. 4C), confirming that the drug was still working at the later time point. To determine whether cAMP and PKA signaling were sufficient to promote activation of the EGFR and downstream MEK, MLTC-1 cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular cAMP levels. This concentration of forskolin was chosen because it promotes similar levels of steroid production as 5 IU/ml hCG. As expected, forskolin promoted significant steroid production at both 30 min and 2 h (Fig. 4D). This forskolin-induced steroidogenesis was PKA-dependent, as H-89 completed abrogated steroid production at both time points (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, similar to hCG stimulation, blockade of EGFR signaling (using erlotinib) or MEK activity (using U0126) almost completely eliminated forskolin-induced steroidogenesis at 30 min but not 2 h. Also similar to hCG, forskolin promoted phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 4E) and activation of MEK (Fig. 4F) at 30 min. Finally, as with hCG stimulation, the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib blocked forskolin-induced MEK activation (Fig. 4F), whereas the MEK inhibitor U0126 had no effect on forskolin-mediated EGFR activation (Fig. 4E). Together, these results confirmed that cAMP/PKA signaling was both upstream of and sufficient to activate EGFR and subsequent MEK signaling and that this pathway was necessary for short term steroidogenesis. EGFR Signaling Regulates Steroidogenesis by Activating StAR—As mentioned, StAR is an important rate-limiting protein in gonadotropin-induced steroid production, and some evidence suggests that StAR may be regulated by EGFR signaling in gonadal tissues (12Manna P.R. Huhtaniemi I.T. Wang X.J. Eubank D.W. Stocco D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1393-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Manna P.R. Chandrala S.P. King S.R. Jo Y. Counis R. Huhtaniemi I.T. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To address the relationship between EGFR signaling and StAR activity in MTLC-1 Leydig cells, the effect of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 on StAR-independent steroidogenesis was examined. Cells were treated for 30 min with 22(R)-cholesterol, which can enter the mitochondria and serve as a substrate for steroidogenesis independent of StAR. 22(R)-Cholesterol stimulated significant steroid production that was unaffected by AG1478 (Fig. 5A), implying that EGFR signaling was not necessary for steroidogenesis if StAR is bypassed. Interestingly, although not yet detectable at 30 min, hCG promoted significant mitochondrial translocation of total StAR at 1 h (Fig. 5B). Similar to its effects on steroidogenesis, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 reduced StAR translocation to the mitochondria at the early time point, but not at 2 h (Fig. 5B). This result was much more dramatic when blotting for the presumably activated, phosphorylated StAR (Fig. 5B, bottom). As expected, inhibition of MEK with U0126 similarly reduced hCG-induced translocation of StAR to the mitochondria at 1 h (data not shown). Together, these findings suggested that hCG-mediated activation of the EGFR regulates phosphorylation of StAR and translocation to the mitochondria at early time points; however, EGFR/MEK signaling is less important for StAR activation at 2 h or later. Many in vitro examples of cross-talk between G protein-coupled and EGF receptors have been described (16Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 17Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Drube S. Stirnweiss J. Valkova C. Liebmann C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Kim J. Eckhart A.D. Eguchi S. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mechanisms regulating this cross-talk vary depending upon both the GPCR and cell type. For example, in COS cells, β2-adrenergic receptor activation triggers activation of the EGFR in an intracellular, ligand-independent, process (20Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 27Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9572-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In contrast, the β2-adrenergic receptor activates the EGFR in an extracellular, ligand-dependent, fashion in cardiac fibroblasts by stimulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to cleave membrane-bound EGFR ligand ectodomains (19Kim J. Eckhart A.D. Eguchi S. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As another example, lysophosphatidic acid trans-activates the EGFR via MMPs and ectodomain shedding in COS cells (18Drube S. Stirnweiss J. Valkova C. Liebmann C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but through intracellular mechanisms in adrenal glomerulosa cells (21Shah B.H. Baukal A.J. Shah F.B. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies of GPCR/EGFR cross-talk have been beautifully characterized, the in vivo importance of this trans-activation is still under investigation. Recent studies in the gonads suggest that MMP-mediated release of EGFR-activating ectodomains from amphiregulin and epiregulin are important for mouse oocyte maturation (22Ashkenazi H. Cao X. Motola S. Popliker M. Conti M. Tsafriri A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), as well as LH-induced steroidogenesis in ovarian follicles (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Gonadotropin-mediated activation of the EGFR may also regulate steroidogenesis in Leydig cells; however, the mechanism by which LH receptor activation initiates EGFR signaling in the testes remains controversial. For example, both Src and MMPs may play partial roles in rapidly trans-activating the EGFR in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells that are overexpressing LH and EGF receptors (13Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, MMP inhibition is not critical for LH-induced steroid production in native MA-10 cells (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here we have attempted to reconcile some of the controversies regarding LHR/EGFR cross-talk in Leydig cells. Rather than use partial changes in intracellular signaling as our end point, we instead focused on the physiologically important end point of gonadotropin-induced steroid production. In addition, to avoid complications due to overexpression of receptors, we used native MLTC-1 mouse Leydig cells that express only endogenous LH and EGF receptors. We found that the EGFR and MEK were activated after 30 min of stimulation with hCG, with MEK signaling occurring downstream of EGFR activation (Fig. 2). Furthermore, EGFR and MEK activation were essential for normal hCG-induced steroidogenesis at 30 min. Similar to previous reports (13Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Shiraishi K. Ascoli M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), MMP inhibition partially blocked hCG-induced EGFR and MEK activation (data not shown). However, MMP inhibitors, including galardin (Fig. 2A) and the tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme inhibitor TAPI-1 (data not shown), had no effect on the final physiologic end point of steroidogenesis, suggesting that both intracellular, as well as MMP-dependent extracellular, activation of the EGFR may be occurring. These observations differ from those in ovarian follicles, where galardin markedly inhibited LH-induced steroid production (15Jamnongjit M. Gill A. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16257-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To explain these results, we propose that LH receptor activation may trigger EGFR trans-activation through both extracellular (MMP-mediated) and intracellular (MMP-independent) mechanisms in both the ovaries and testes. However, the extracellular pathway may be less important in the testes, where all steps of steroidogenesis occur within individual Leydig cells. In contrast, the gonadotropin-induced extracellular pathway might be essential in the ovarian follicle, where paracrine signaling is required for communication between theca and mural granulosa cells, which express LH receptors, and cumulus granulosa cells, which lack LH receptors. If MMPs are not involved, then what signals are triggered by LH receptors to trans-activate the EGFR in Leydig cells? As mentioned, Src has been implicated in rapid EGFR transactivation; however, similar to MMP blockade, inhibition of Src had no effect on the biologic end point of gonadotropin-mediated steroidogenesis (Fig. 3A). Instead, PKA inhibition abrogated hCG-induced EGFR and MEK activation, as well as steroidogenesis, at 30 min (Fig. 4). Furthermore, stimulation of cAMP production with forskolin for 30 min promoted steroidogenesis in an EGFR- and MEK-dependent fashion. These observations indicate that cAMP and PKA are both necessary and sufficient for short term EGFR-mediated steroidogenesis. Interestingly, cAMP/PKA signaling may be a conserved mechanism for regulating LH and EGF receptor cross-talk, as cAMP appears to mediate gonadotropin-induced trans-activation of the EGFR during oocyte maturation (23Panigone S. Hsieh M. Fu M. Persani L. Conti M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 924-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). How PKA activates the EGFR is still unclear. PKA may be able to directly phosphorylate and activate the EGFR under some conditions (28Barbier A.J. Poppleton H.M. Yigzaw Y. Mullenix J.B. Wiepz G.J. Bertics P.J. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Piiper A. Lutz M.P. Cramer H. Elez R. Kronenberger B. Dikic I. Muller-Esterl W. Zeuzem S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the EGFR contains several potential PKA target sequences (RXX(S/T)). However, attempts to use commercial antibodies against these sequences, as well as direct analysis of EGFR phosphorylation sites in response to hCG or forskolin, have so far been unrevealing. LHR/EGFR cross-talk occurred at early (30 min) but not late (120 min) time points (Fig. 2). Accordingly, two different EGFR inhibitors (AG1478 and erlotinib), as well as the MEK inhibitor U0126, blocked gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis at 30, but not 120, min. Together, these data indicate that the EGFR/MEK kinase cascade is essential for short but not long term gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis. How might the EGFR/MEK kinase cascade be regulating short term gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis? The answer may lie in part with StAR, which is the rate-limiting regulator of steroidogenesis in all steroidogenic tissues. As with steroidogenesis, short (30 min) but not long (2 h) term hCG-induced phosphorylation and translocation of StAR to the mitochondria was significantly reduced by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 5). What is the biological importance of this bimodal activation? In humans, the pituitary releases LH every 90–120 min, with serum concentrations varying as much as 2-fold (30Keenan D.M. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: R381-R389Google Scholar, 31Kok S.W. Roelfsema F. Overeem S. Lammers G.J. Frolich M. Meinders A.E. Pijl H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E630-E636Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the EGFR/MEK kinase pathway may be important for androgen production in vivo, as Leydig cells might be constantly resensitizing to LH and therefore reactivating the kinase cascade. Consistent with this interpretation, treatment of male mice with AG1478 for 36 h significantly reduced serum testosterone levels relative to mock-treated mice (Fig. 2), confirming a potentially important physiologic role for LH/EGF receptor cross-talk in testicular steroidogenesis. Notably, decreased LH pulsatility in humans is associated with lower Leydig cell sensitivity and reduced testosterone production (30Keenan D.M. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: R381-R389Google Scholar, 32Chase D.J. Karle J.A. Fogg R.E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1992; 95: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), perhaps due to alterations in the EGFR/MEK kinase pathway. We present the following model to reconcile the observations regarding gonadotropin-induced steroidogenesis in Leydig cells (Fig. 6). In the short term (less than 60 min), LH induces trans-activation of the EGFR through both extracellular (MMP-mediated) and intracellular (cAMP-mediated) means. However, the extracellular activation seems unnecessary for steroid production. Rapid EGFR signaling leads to activation of the MAPK cascade, resulting in phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of small amounts of endogenous StAR protein, followed by increased steroidogenesis. With longer LH stimulation (2 h), LH/EGF receptor cross-talk disappears; however, StAR phosphorylation and translocation to the mitochondria persist. This continued StAR activation might be due to increased StAR production from cAMP/PKA-mediated transcriptional up-regulation, resulting in such high levels of StAR protein expression that phosphorylation and translocation to the mitochondria can occur via other, EGFR/MEK-independent, pathways. Further studies will be necessary to uncover these potential alternative pathways, as well as to confirm the true physiologic importance of LH/EGF receptor cross-talk in testicular androgen production."

The problem inherent to such single-electrode recordings is that the injected current biases the measurement because of the voltage drop through the electrode. This electrode bias imposes restrictions on the use of advanced electrophysiological techniques, such as voltage clamp or dynamic clamp (Robinson and Kawai, 1993Robinson H.P. Kawai N.

The dynamic clamp comes of age.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which require injection of a current dependent on the simultaneously recorded Vm. These techniques are essential for dissecting the role of specific intrinsic and synaptic channels in neuronal function. In the present paper, we introduce Active Electrode Compensation (AEC), a method to compensate for the electrode bias with unprecedented accuracy, based on a model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. AEC opens the way for the improved and simplified use of these advanced techniques in many preparations requiring high resistance and/or capacitance electrodes: for example, in vivo recordings of cortical neurons. Electrode compensation circuits implemented in intracellular amplifiers usually reflect the assumption that the electrode is equivalent to a simple RC (resistor and capacitor) circuit (Thomas, 1977Thomas M.V. Microelectrode amplifier with improved method of input-capacitance neutralization.Med. Biol. Eng. Comput. 1977; 15: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but this simplification does not account for distributed capacitance and the resulting compensation produces artifactual voltage transients (Figure 1A, bridge compensation, middle). In situations where the injected current depends on the Vm, the artifacts are injected back and can be amplified by the control loop, which leads to oscillatory instabilities (Figure 1A, bridge compensation during dynamic clamp, right). An option for voltage clamp, and the only one for dynamic clamp when electrode resistance is high, is to use a discontinuous mode, alternatively injecting current and recording the Vm (Brennecke and Lindemann, 1971Brennecke R.

Methods. 1984; 11: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with a frequency set by the electrode time constant (typically 1.5–3 kHz with sharp electrodes in our experiments in cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo). Unfortunately, the alternation method is valid only when the electrode response is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the recorded phenomena (Finkel and Redman, 1984Finkel A.S. Redman S. Theory and operation of a single microelectrode voltage clamp.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1984; 11: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), because the membrane response must be quasilinear in the sampling interval. Moreover, recordings in discontinuous modes are very noisy and sampling frequency is limited, which makes the precise recording of fast phenomena like spikes impossible (Figure 1B). The AEC method we propose here allows the sampling of the Vm during current injection with a frequency only limited by the speed of the computer used for the digital convolution at the core of the technique (Figure 1C). In the following, we describe and validate the method in demanding experimental situations: high resistance sharp microelectrode recordings for both current-clamp with fast current injection and dynamic-clamp protocols. We performed such recordings in vitro and in vivo in two experimental preparations widely used for the study of mammalian cortical function: in slices of visual cortex from adult animals (in our case, guinea pigs and ferrets) and in the primary visual cortex of the anaesthetized and paralyzed cat. These examples illustrate that with AEC, it is possible, in cases when single high resistance electrodes are used, to inject white noise in a cell at a high sampling frequency and to accurately inject complex conductance stimuli with the goal of precisely analyzing high frequency features of the cell's response, such as the onset of spikes. More generally, AEC will be especially useful for the study of any electrical neuronal phenomenon happening on the timescale of the electrode time constant, and it widens in an important way the repertoire of electrophysiological protocols easily applicable to the study of central mammalian neurons in vivo and of other preparations where very low resistance electrodes cannot be routinely employed. The essential idea behind the AEC method is to represent the electrode by an arbitrarily complex linear circuit, extract the properties of this circuit for each particular recording (Figure 2A), and actively compensate for the effect of the electrode by subtracting the voltage drop through this circuit from the recording (Figure 2B). The classic compensation methods, “bridge” compensation and capacitance neutralization, are equivalent to modeling the electrode as a resistor plus a capacitor (RC circuit), but this model proves too simple in many practical situations. We used a more general model of the electrode as an unknown linear circuit. A particular case of such a linear circuit could be two resistors and two capacitors, as hypothesized by Roelfsema et al., 2001Roelfsema M.R. Steinmeyer R. Hedrich R. Discontinuous single electrode voltage-clamp measurements: assessment of clamp accuracy in Vicia faba guard cells.J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1933-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar. It could also be much more complicated: in fact, our results show that elements of the amplifier (e.g., filters) should be included in the recording circuit. The voltage across the electrode Ue is modeled as the convolution of the injected current Ie and a kernel Ke that characterizes the electrode:Ue(t)=(Ke∗Ie)(t)=∫0+∞Ke(s)Ie(t−s)ds. Thus, the voltage across the electrode depends linearly on all past values of the injected current: it is the sum of all these past values weighted by the coefficients of the kernel Ke. This formulation encompasses any time-invariant linear model, e.g., a circuit with a resistor and a capacitor (the kernel Ke is then an exponential function). For any linear model, the kernel completely characterizes the system, i.e., it allows the calculation of the system's response to any input. For digitally sampled signals, the formula reads:Ue(n)=∑0+∞Ke(p)Ie(n−p)(1) (But, the discrete and continuous kernels are not generally identical. See the Supplemental Data available online.) The procedure consists in two passes: (1) measure the electrode kernel, i.e., the values of Ke(p) (Figure 2A, right), (2) inject and record at the same time in continuous mode, with the true Vm recording obtained by subtracting the voltage across the electrode Ue from the raw recording. The compensation involves the digital convolution of I with Ke to obtain Ue, which is performed in real time by a computer (Figure 2B). For small injected currents, the response of the cell can also be considered linear, so that the recorded potential can be expressed as the linear convolution Vr = Vrest + K ∗ I, where Vrest is the resting potential and K is the total kernel comprising both the electrode kernel Ke and the membrane kernel Km and fully characterizing the system consisting of the electrode and the cell. We derive K from the recorded response to a known injected current and then we separate the contributions of the electrode and the membrane (Figure 2A; see the Experimental Procedures). Electrode properties before and after cell impalement can be quite different (Figure 2C), so it is essential to estimate the electrode kernel in the neuron by means of this separation. We inject 5–20 s of noisy current consisting of a sequence of independent random current steps (white noise) at sampling resolution (0.1 ms) with amplitude uniformly distributed between −0.5 nA and 0.5 nA in most cases. In principle, any current could be used provided it is small enough to prevent spiking and nonlinear effects from the cell (see the Supplemental Data for details about how to set the current intensity), but our choice was not arbitrary: a uniform amplitude distribution makes the best use of the D/A converters in the acquisition board (provided their range is adjusted accordingly), while using a fast-varying current with minimum autocorrelation enhances the electrode contribution in the recording relative to the membrane contribution, because the electrode response is at least one order of magnitude faster than the membrane response. In vivo, we injected, in addition, a constant negative current (Figure 2F) to prevent spiking. The kernel K is then derived mathematically from the autocorrelation of the current and the correlation between the current and the recorded potential (see Experimental Procedures). To split the total kernel K into the electrode kernel Ke and the membrane kernel Km, we use two facts: first, the electrode kernel is very short compared to the membrane kernel, so that after a couple of milliseconds (p > 50, i.e., 5 ms at 10 kHz), Ke(p) vanishes and K(p) ≈ Km(p). Second, if the injected current is small enough, the membrane response is mostly linear and can be approximated on short time scales by a decaying exponential Km(t)=Rτe−t/τ (t = p Δt, where Δt is the sampling step; R and τ are passive membrane parameters). Thus, we estimate the membrane kernel Km from the tail of the total kernel K (least square fitting to an exponential) and deduce the electrode kernel Ke (see the Experimental Procedures; Figure 2A; see also Figure S1). We tested the sensitivity of the method to these two hypotheses in numerical simulations: (1) the estimated electrode kernel degrades continuously as the ratio of electrode and membrane time constants (τe/τm) increases (Figure S1D) and remains acceptable for ratios better than 1/10 (the error in electrode resistance is about 10%, and AEC can still be used for compensating the voltage in dynamic-clamp protocols, see Figure S3, right column); (2) the membrane kernel deviates from a single exponential function in the presence of a dendritic tree, and fast passive dendritic contributions can be confused with the electrode response, but the impact on the estimated electrode kernel remains small (Figure S4). In practice, nonlinear membrane properties (even action potentials if the firing rate is not too large) have a small impact on the estimation of the electrode kernel (see Figure 2F, blue points, and Figure S4H), the important requirement being the linearity of the electrode (see below). In fact, the electrode kernel Ke captures not only the characteristics of the electrode, but also of the recording device, i.e., the whole circuit between the digital output of the computer and the tip of the electrode, including all circuits in the amplifier (e.g., capacitance neutralization) and acquisition filters, but not subsequent digital signal processing. All measured electrode kernels consisted of 3 phases (Figure 2C): (1) a short phase where the kernel vanishes, (2) a sharp but noninstantaneous increase for about 0.2 ms, and (3) a decrease. The first phase corresponds to the feedback delay of the acquisition system and always lasts 2 sampling steps (0.2 ms). The second, noninstantaneous phase also appears when the amplifier is plugged into an electronic circuit, named the model cell, consisting of a resistor modeling the electrode and a resistor plus a capacitor modeling the neuron membrane (data not shown): its nonzero rise time is likely due to the electronics of the acquisition system rather than to the electrode properties per se. The third phase varies between experiments and, when fitted by an exponential, displays a time constant around 0.1 ms (0.11 ± 0.09 ms, n = 67 cells in vitro, for maximal levels of capacitance neutralization by the amplifier). Lowering the level of capacitance neutralization increases this time constant (Figure 2D). In vivo, the time constant estimated in 4 cells was of the same order of magnitude (for example, 0.1 ms for the cell [Figure 2E] with maximal capacitance neutralization). As a first test of the method, we assessed the quality of the estimation of the electrode resistance derived from our measurement of the electrode kernel. The electrode resistance, Re, is defined as the ratio of the stationary voltage across the electrode over the amplitude of a constant injected current. It equals the integral of the electrode kernel (or the sum in the digital formulation). In 67 cortical neurons in vitro, we compared the Re estimated from the kernel with the Re estimated by manually adjusting the “bridge” compensation on the amplifier and found a difference of only 1.4 ± 4.2% (AEC − bridge; n = 67 cells). Bridge compensation only provides an estimate of the electrode resistance, but AEC also deals with the effects of the residual capacitance of the electrode (after maximal neutralization, residual electrode capacitance was 1.3 ± 1.3 pF as assessed from the decay phase of the electrode kernel; n = 67 cells). The linearity of the electrode is an important assumption of the AEC method, since we consider that the electrode response can be fully characterized by the kernel Ke. It has been described that for sharp electrodes, Re can change with the amplitude of injected current, presumably due to differences in ion concentrations inside and around the pipette tip (Purves, 1981Purves R.D. Microelectrode methods for intracellular recording and ionophoresis. Academic Press, London, New York1981Google Scholar). This might be a problem since during AEC, the same kernel, with a fixed Re, is used for predicting the electrode response to all levels of injected current. We systematically tested for this effect in 23 intracellular recordings in vitro (using 20 different electrodes) by estimating the electrode kernel in the recorded cell while simultaneously injecting different levels of constant current in addition to the white noise current (Figure S2). The degree of nonlinearity λ can be expressed in MΩ/nA as a current-dependent change in resistance, and the resulting voltage measurement error for a given depolarization ΔV (induced by constant current injection) is then (λ/Rm2) × ΔV2, where Rm is the membrane resistance. Across all tested electrodes, this slope averaged −2.2 (±5.0) MΩ/nA, giving, for a cell with an Rm of 60 MΩ, a voltage error −0.0006 mV/mV2 (e.g., −0.55 mV for 30 mV depolarization). In 9 out of 23 cases, we found that the correlation between Re and the level of constant injected current was not significant (see Figure S2), meaning that the current-dependent variability of the electrode resistance was comparable to the intrinsic variability of the electrode resistance (for these electrodes, the measured nonlinearity was −0.5 ± 1.1 MΩ/nA). Thus, the kernel estimation procedure provides a fast and automated way to measure electrode nonlinearities in the cell and possibly discard some recordings if the change of Re during given current injections leads to unacceptable errors in the recorded Vm. Electrode nonlinearities are generally described as slow processes (Purves, 1981Purves R.D. Microelectrode methods for intracellular recording and ionophoresis. Academic Press, London, New York1981Google Scholar), which was our working hypothesis, but we also checked in the dynamic-clamp protocols that large, transiently injected currents did not impair the electrode compensation, as could result from fast nonlinearities (see below). In addition, in 4 intracellular recordings (using 3 electrodes), we compared electrode kernels obtained by injecting 0.5 or 1 nA of white noise current and found, on average, a difference of only −0.1 MΩ (range −0.9 to 0.5; Figure S2B), which indicates that possible electrode nonlinearities (i.e., changes in Re) do not manifest themselves for very fast current injections. In vivo, we found that electrode properties could remain stable for up to 2 hours, as assessed with kernel estimations obtained repetitively and also when using different constant current injections and different durations of white noise injection (Figures 2E and 2F). A first application of the AEC method is the possibility to accurately record the response of a neuron to an injection of white noise current sampled at a high frequency (10 kHz with our system). This type of stimulus has been used to characterize neuronal response properties (Bryant and Segundo, 1976Bryant H.L. Segundo J.P. Spike initiation by transmembrane current: a white-noise analysis.J. Physiol. 1976; 260: 279-314PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed (n = 18 injections in 3 cortical cells in vitro and n = 8 in 2 cortical cells in vivo) that the subthreshold response of neurons to such an injection corresponds to the theoretical prediction based on the passive parameters of the cell (Figure 3A). The recorded Vm distributions closely matched the predicted distributions (Figures 3B and 3D) (8.9 ± 9.9% relative error on the standard deviation of the distributions for in vitro recordings), and power spectra of the response matched the theoretical power spectra up to a frequency of 500 Hz (Figure 3C). In addition, spikes occurring during the white noise injection could be recorded with good temporal resolution (Figure 6C; a higher sampling frequency might be required for fast spiking cells). Attempts to inject a white noise current sampled at 10 kHz with DCC at 1 to 2 kHz switching frequency failed to match the prediction (Figures 3B–3D), which was expected since the input current was changing significantly faster than the sampling clock of the DCC. The response to white noise injection can also be characterized using the crosscorrelation between injected current and recorded Vm, which shows unwanted electrode contributions and distortions in both Bridge mode and DCC when compared to AEC (Figure S6).Generally, white noise inputs are an interesting choice for probing the input-output functions of systems due to their lack of autocorrelation, and they could now, with AEC, be more widely applied in single-cell neurophysiology. Our initial motivation for developing the AEC method was to improve the quality of dynamic clamp performed with single high resistance electrodes. Dynamic clamp (Robinson and Kawai, 1993Robinson H.P.

It can be advantageously employed in a variety of contexts, from the addition and subtraction of various intrinsic channels to neurons and the scanning of their kinetic parameters, through the manipulation of synaptic channels activated by various configurations of presynaptic inputs, up to the construction of hybrid networks in which biological cells interact with model cells simulated in real time (see Prinz et al., 2004Prinz A.A. Abbott L.F. Marder E. The dynamic clamp comes of age.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar for a review). The technique relies on a loop in which the current injected into the cell is a function of the recorded Vm. The current flowing through ion channels at time t depends on both the channels' total conductance g(t) and the driving force Vm(t)−Erev (where Erev is the reversal potential for the considered ions): I(t)=g(t)×(Vm(t)−Erev). In dynamic-clamp experiments, intrinsic or synaptic ion channels are modeled by given g(t) and Erev implemented in a computer, and I(t) is calculated in real time using the Vm(t) of the recorded cell. It is crucial, in this equation, to use the real Vm of the cell, uncontaminated by electrode artifacts which can lead to oscillatory instabilities or, simply, inaccurate results. With bridge compensation, dynamic clamp injections are unstable if the conductance is too large; theoretical analysis (see Supplemental Data) shows that this critical conductance is determined by the electrode resistance: gc = 1/Re (same magnitude as the membrane leak conductance in our experiments). With complete digital compensation of the electrode, the critical conductance is theoretically limited by the sampling frequency f: gc = τmf/(4Rm), where τm is the membrane time constant and Rm is the membrane resistance (for typical values in our experiments, gc is 25 times the leak conductance). We tested the performance of the AEC method in cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo with three different dynamic-clamp protocols of increasing complexity: square conductance pulses and fluctuating synaptic conductance input without and with additional discrete AMPA synaptic inputs. We compared AEC to the only alternative method, DCC, and, whenever possible, to theoretical predictions of the response. Dynamic-clamp injections of fluctuating synaptic conductance input provide the way to extend, to real cortical neurons, the study of the integrative properties of cells submitted to a massive synaptic bombardment from the cortical network, a topic extensively investigated using computational models (see Destexhe et al., 2003Destexhe A. Rudolph M. Paré D. The high-conductance state of neocortical neurons in vivo.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar for a review). We first injected a simple conductance stimulus for which the cell's response can be computed analytically, assuming we are in the passive regime and the leak parameters of the cell are known (from the response to small current pulses). This choice enabled us to compare the responses obtained in AEC and in DCC with theoretical predictions, but this time with dynamic clamp rather than current clamp. The stimulus was a square wave of alternating “excitatory” (Eexcitation=Vrest+10) and “inhibitory” (Einhibition=Vrest"

Proteases are ubiquitous enzymes that function in virtually all biological phenomena. Two of the major groups of proteases, Clan CA (papain-like) cysteine proteases and Clan SA (trypsin-like) serine proteases, underwent an evolutionary inversion whereby the more abundant cysteine proteases of primitive eukaryotes gave way to serine proteases with the evolution of arthropods (1Rawlings N.D.

Only four drugs are available to treat human African trypanosomiasis: two for the first stage of the disease when parasites proliferate in the blood (pentamidine and suramin) and two for the second stage when parasites have established infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (melarsoprol and eflornithine).

There is an obvious and urgent need to develop new chemotherapies to treat human African trypanosomiasis.Two Clan CA cysteine proteases have been identified in T. brucei: rhodesain, which is cathepsin L-like and most abundant (3Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney S.L. 2nd, Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem.

Caffrey C.R. Stierhof Y.D. Ruppel A. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Parasites treated with this inhibitor exhibit altered cell morphology, are unable to undergo cytokinesis, and are defective in host protein degradation (5Scory S. Caffrey C.R. Stierhof Y.D. Ruppel A. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Scory S. Stierhof Y.D. Caffrey C.R. Steverding D. Kinetoplastid. Biol. Dis. 2007; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Knockdown of tbcatB expression by RNA interference (RNAi) is also lethal in T. brucei, causing phenotypic defects similar to those seen with the inhibitor (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, knockdown of rhodesain expression produced no abnormal phenotype in cultured parasites (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results led to the hypothesis that whereas tbcatB is less abundant, it is, nonetheless, essential to T. brucei survival in culture and is a key target of the inhibitor. Furthermore, when RNAi targeting tbcatB is induced in a mouse model of T. brucei infection, mice are cured of their infection. 3Abdulla, M. (2008) PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis., in press. 3Abdulla, M. (2008) PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis., in press.One clue to the function of tbcatB comes from the observation that a host iron-transporting protein, transferrin, accumulates in Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2-treated and tbcatB RNAi knockdown parasites (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Scory S. Caffrey C.R. Stierhof Y.D. Ruppel A. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transferrin serves as the sole source of iron for T. brucei and is rapidly degraded in an endosomal or lysosomal compartment in the parasite (7Steverding D. Parasitol. Int. 2000; 48: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulation of transferrin implicates tbcatB in the process of iron acquisition and suggests that transferrin may be a natural substrate of the protease.The RNAi studies showed only modest knockdown of tbcatB mRNA and protein, yet the phenotype was dramatic (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, to validate the previous RNAi data and further our understanding of the functional role of tbcatB, we generated a single allele deletion strain of T. brucei and, together with the inducible-RNAi strain, analyzed the effects of tbcatB deficiency on cell morphology, protease localization, and the iron acquisition pathway. We also expressed recombinant tbcatB and analyzed its substrate specificity profile both for clues as to the identity of natural substrates and as a means to determine subsite characterization that will aid future inhibitor design.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulturing of T. brucei—All bloodstream form strains of T. brucei were incubated in 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific), 10% Serum Plus (JRH Biosciences), 1× penicillin/streptomycin. The pZJMTbCB clones were cultured in media containing, 5.0 μg/ml hygromycin B and 2.5 μg/ml G418, as well as 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin as previously described (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Induction of RNAi was carried out by adding tetracycline to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml.Generation of tbcatb Single-allele Knock-out T. brucei Clones (tbcatb+/–)—To generate the targeting vector, a cassette containing the phleomycin resistance marker flanked by the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions (FR) of the tbcatb gene was constructed. The following primers were used: 5′-FR forward primer, 5′-gcggccgccagaagctccactgcctcgcattg-3′; 5′-FR reverse primer, 5′-gatatccatgtgtcaccggatttggggtctgca-3′; 3′-FR forward primer, 5′-tctagataggttgcacatcgttaaacctagag-3′; 3′-FR reverse primer, 5′-gggcccacatccttatcccttccccgagggcg-3′. The cassette was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) at NotI and ApaI restriction endonuclease sites. For electroporation, 108 strain trypanosomes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 ml of cytomix (8van den Hoff M.J. Christoffels V.M. Labruyere W.T. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar), and finally resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix. One hundred micrograms of the targeting vector was linearized with NotI restriction endonuclease, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 100 μl of cytomix. The parasites and DNA suspensions were mixed in a 4-mm electroporator cuvette and pulsed with 1.7 kV and 25 microfarads. After pulsing, the parasites were transferred to 24 ml of complete medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide. Phleomycin was added to the medium to select for clones having the targeting vector integrated into the genome. Proper integration into the tbcatb locus was verified by PCR.T. brucei Growth Assay—Trypanosomes were cultured at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml and counted using a hemocytometer after 24, 48, and 72 h.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—T. brucei were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/D-PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. All subsequent washes were carried out with excess D-PBS. Fixed cells were washed and applied to 25-mm round coverslips that had been coated with polylysine (0.1% w/v in water, Sigma) and allowed to settle for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized in D-PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min, washed, and blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) prepared in D-PBS. After blocking, cells were incubated in rabbit anti-p67 antiserum (a gift from J. D. Bangs) (9Kelley R.J. Alexander D.L. Cowan C. Balber A.E. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:400 in 1% BSA/D-PBS) for 1 h, washed, incubated in Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) (diluted 1:400 in 1% BSA/D-PBS) for 1 h, washed, and mounted on slides with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). The cells were visualized on an Axio-Imager M1 microscope (Zeiss), equipped with an X-Cite 120 fluorescence illumination system (EXFP Life Sciences).Transmission Electron Microscopy—Approximately 40 million T. brucei were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. Pelleted parasites were resuspended in 1 ml of media for high pressure freezing using either a Bal-Tec HPM 010 or Wohlwend HPF Compact 01 high-pressure freezer (University of California, Berkeley Electron Microscopy Laboratory). The parasites were processed for conventional EM by freeze substitution in 1% OsO4, 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone using a Leica AFS2 and embedded in Eponate 12 resin. Sections were cut with a Leica Ultracut E ultramicrotome using a diamond knife and picked up on Pioloform films on slot grids. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and Sato's lead, and photographed using a Gatan 4k × 4k camera on an FEI Spirit transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV.Immunoelectron Microscopy—T. brucei samples for immuno-EM were prepared by high pressure freezing as indicated above, except freeze substitution was conducted in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone. Following substitution, the samples were infiltrated in LR White resin at 4 °C, and UV-polymerized at –20 °C using benzoin methyl ether as the UV catalyst in the LR White. Sections were picked up on carbon-coated Pioloform films on nickel grids. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-tbcatB (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B.

Janssen H. Calafat J. Engstler M. Ansorge I. Clayton C. Borst P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), both diluted 1:400) and 10 nm gold secondary antibodies (complete antibodies absorbed to gold) (British BioCell International, distributed by Ted Pella) diluted in 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. After labeling, the sections were fixed 5 min with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed with distilled water, and stained with uranyl acetate followed by Sato's lead as indicated above. Control sections were immunostained using this protocol but with omission of the primary antibody. Sections were photographed as indicated above.Cloning and Expression of TbcatB in Pichia pastoris—Methods for cloning and expression of tbcatB in P. pastoris have been described previously. 4Mallari, J. P., Shelat, A., Kosinski, A., Caffrey, C. R., Connelly, M., Zhu, F., McKerrow, J. H., and Guy, R. K. (2008) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 18, 2883–2885. Epub 2008 April 8 Briefly, the sequence encoding the tbcatB zymogen (pro and mature regions of the protease) was amplified from a cDNA vector that contained the entire open reading frame of tbcatB (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers amplified genomic regions 5′-gagtaaacgccgccctcgttgct-3′ and 5′-cgccgtgttgggtgcaagagg-3′, respectively. The amplified DNA was purified and ligated into expression vector pPICZαB (Invitrogen) and subsequent transfection and expression techniques were modified from those given by the manufacturer as previously described (3Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney S.L. 2nd, Roush W.R. Stierhof Y.D. Bogyo M. Steverding D. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Purification of Recombinant tbcatB—Following a 48-h induction, P. pastoris cultures were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant containing recombinant tbcatB was lyophilized. The crude lyophilized protein was resuspended in 10% of the original volume in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) and desalted using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences) by equilibrating in the same buffer. The solution was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/50 anion exchange column using an Akta Purifier-900 chromatography system (both GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences). A 50 mm MES (pH 6.5) buffer was used for column equilibration, sample loading, and protein elution, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m sodium chloride concentration over 20 min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and subsequently checked for purity by SDS-PAGE and activity by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-arginyl-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (Z-FR-AMC) (Peptides International, Inc.) (see enzyme activity assay below).Radiolabeling of Cysteine Protease Active Sites with 125I-Labeled Inhibitors—Ten microliters of Mono Q fractions containing recombinant tbcatB were labeled with the cathepsin B-specific active site label 125I-MB-074 (11Bogyo M. Verhelst S. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V. Toba S. Greenbaum D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature in buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Once the gels were dried, labeling was visualized by autoradiography.Deglycosylation of Recombinant TbcatB—A New England Biolabs PNGase F kit was used for deglycosylation of Mono Q-purified recombinant tbcatB. Methods were followed as described in the instruction manual.Protease Activity Assay—Protease activity was measured using the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-FR-AMC, which is cleaved by the protease to release free 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin fluorogenic leaving group. Enzyme samples were preincubated for 10 min in sodium citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) containing 4 mm DTT, giving a total volume of 100 μl. Following the preincubation period, 100 μl of dilute substrate (20 μm, prepared in the same buffer) was added to the enzyme solution to give a final concentration of 10 μm Z-FR-AMC and a final volume of 200 μl. Hydrolysis was measured at 25 °C using an automated microtiter plate spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices Flex Station). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 and 460 nm, respectively. One unit of activity was defined as that releasing 1 μmol of AMC min–1. To determine the Michaelis constant, Km, a range of substrate concentrations from 0.14 to 300 μm was used and the value estimated using graphics software (Prism4, GraphPad).pH Activity Profiling of Recombinant TbcatB—Mono Q-purified tbcatB was assayed for protease activity with Z-FR-AMC using 50 mm sodium citrate buffers that ranged in pH from 3 to 8, with 0.5 pH unit increments. Protease activity was assayed as described above. Initial velocities were taken and assays were performed in duplicate.Protease Inhibitor Profiling—Mono Q-purified tbcatB was assayed for protease activity with Z-FR-AMC in the presence of various protease-class selective inhibitors. The inhibitors used were K11777 (N-methylpiperazine-Phe-homoPhe-vinylsulfonephenyl) (12Engel J.C. Doyle P.S. Hsieh I. McKerrow J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), CA074 (N-(l-3-trans-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2carbonyl)-l-isoleucyl-l-pro line) (13Buttle D.J. Murata M. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and E64 (N-[N-(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl]-agmatine). Enzyme samples (in 10 μl volume) were preincubated with inhibitor for 5 min in 90 μl of sodium citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) containing 4 mm DTT to give a total volume of 100 μl. The inhibitor concentration range used was 0.01 to 10 μm. Following incubation, the substrate was added in the same buffer to give a final concentration of 10 μm Z-FR-AMC and final volume of 200 μl. Protease activity was assayed as described above.Substrate Specificity Profiling and Substrate Screen—The P1–P4 substrate specificity profile for tbcatB was determined using a completely diverse positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library (PS-SCL) (14Choe Y. Leonetti F. Greenbaum D.C. Lecaille F. Bogyo M. Bromme D. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The library contained substrates that are N-terminal acetylated and possessed 7-amino-4-carbamoyl-methylcoumarin (ACC) as the fluorogenic leaving group. The procedures used to screen the library were modified from those previously described (14Choe Y. Leonetti F. Greenbaum D.C. Lecaille F. Bogyo M. Bromme D. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Crude lyophilized tbcatB was assayed at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, and 1% Me2SO (from the substrates). The concentration of tbcatB in the assays was ∼10 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate.To test the predictive capability of the substrate specificity profile obtained, authentic 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (AMC) peptide substrates that were either “good” or “poor” matches to the profile were selected for screening in the protease activity assay described above. The range of substrate concentrations used was 3.5 to 300μm. The substrates were: Z-FR-AMC (Peptides International, Inc.), Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (Z-RR-AMC) (Peptides International, Inc.), Z-Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg-AMC (Z-REKR-AMC) (Bachem), Ac-Ile-Glu-Pro-Asp-AMC (Ac-IEPD-AMC) (Bachem), Ac-Ala-Ser-Thr-Asp-AMC (Ac-ASTD-AMC) (Bachem), Z-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (Z-LRGG-AMC) (Bachem), H-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-AMC (H-RQRR-AMC) (Bachem), Ac-Lys-Gln-Lys-Leu-Arg-AMC (Ac-KQKLR-AMC) (AnaSpec, Inc.), and Z-Arg-Arg-Leu-Arg-AMC (Z-RRLR-AMC), which was custom synthesized by SynPep. Michaelis constants were estimated for each substrate as described above.Human Serum and T. brucei Protein Database Search—A database of host serum proteins was created by searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (15Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26670) Google Scholar), using the keyword “serum” and limiting the search to “Homo sapiens” proteins. The results of the search were downloaded in FASTA format. The database of serum proteins was then screened using the EMBOSS fuzzpro protein pattern program (16Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6329) Google Scholar) for the amino acid motif: P4, Arg/Lys; P3, Arg/Lys; P2, X; P1, Arg/Lys.T. brucei proteins were also screened for the presence of the optimal substrate motif preference of tbcatB. The screen was carried out using the”Search Using Quick Matrix Method“Database Search option on Scansite's website (scansite.mit.edu) (17Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Once the motif (P4, Arg/Lys; P3, Arg/Lys; P2, X; P1, Arg/Lys) was entered, the following parameters were selected: organism class, invertebrates; database, SWISS-PROT; and single species, brucei. No limits were set for other parameters in the program.In Vitro Digestion of Transferrin by TbcatB—Bovine transferrin was obtained from Invitrogen. 10 nm tbcatB was assayed with 200 nm transferrin in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. After 24 and 48 h incubation at 25 °C, digestive products were separated on a 10% BisTris gel, adsorbed onto polyvinylidene difluoride and stained with PageBlue (Fermentas). Cleavage products were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing (Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis, CA). Three internally quenched fluorescent peptides derived from transferrin, MZ1 (K(Mca)KCACSNHEK(Dnp)), MZ2 (K(Mca)EYVTALQNK(Dnp)), and MZ3 (K(Mca)SRKDKAT CK(Dnp)) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a Symphony Quartet (Protein Technologies). Fluorescent assays were performed as outlined previously except excitation and emission wavelengths were 328 and 393 nm, respectively.Lysate Preparation for Two-dimensional PAGE—T. brucei strain 221 and tbcatb+/– were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in D-PBS, and resuspended at ∼1 × 108 cells/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, and 5 μl/ml Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set II (CalBiochem, stock solution contains 20 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride-hydrochloride, 1.7 mm bestatin, 200 μm E-64 protease inhibitor, 85 mm EDTA-disodium, and 2 mm pepstatin)) that had been supplemented with 0.1 unit/μl of DNase (RNase-free, Roche), 45 μm RNase A (Roche), and 30 mm MgCl2. The lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the cleared lysates was determined by Bradford assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). If not used immediately, lysates were stored at –80 °C. Equal amounts of each lysate (200 μg) were prepared for isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the ReadyPrep Two-dimensional Cleanup Kit (Bio-Rad). The subsequent procedures used for IEF and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were carried out as described in the ReadyPrep Two-dimensional Starter Kit (Bio-Rad) instruction manual. Bio-Rad ReadyStrip IPG strips, pH 4–7, were used for IEF and 8–16% Criterion Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) were used for SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, the gels were immediately transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), using procedures described below.Western Blots of Two-dimensional PAGE Gels—Two-dimensional gels that had been transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked for 1 h (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5% dry milk, and 0.1% BSA, w/v). After blocking, membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-transferrin antiserum (1:2500 dilution) (described above) for 1 h and washed 3 times for 10 min with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Tween 20). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution) (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The blots were washed three times for 10 min with TBST and twice for 10 min with TBS (TBST without 0.4% Tween 20). Finally, the blots were visualized by ECL (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences).Transferrin Starvation—Strain 221 and tbcatb+/– parasites were incubated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml for 36 h in appropriate media (see methods for culturing T. brucei above), containing 10% fetal bovine serum or, instead, dog serum (Innovative Research). After the incubation period, equal numbers of parasites (1 × 107) were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.5, 5 mm DTT). The lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis, using procedures described above and rabbit anti-transferrin receptor antibody (a gift of P. Borst) (10Mussmann R. Janssen H. Calafat J. Engstler M. Ansorge I. Clayton C. Borst P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:250) as primary antibody. Labeling was quantified by densitometry using Image J software (National Institute of Health).RESULTSSingle-allele Deletion of T. brucei Cathepsin B Gene Leads to Decreased Parasite Replication—Silencing of tbcatB by RNAi produced a marked phenotype (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Parasites exhibited endosomal or lysosomal swelling, decreased growth rate, arrest in cytokinesis, and eventual death. However, this dramatic phenotype was associated with only a modest decrease in tbcatB mRNA, protein, and protease activity (4Mackey Z.B. O'Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, to validate and extend the RNAi results, a tbcatB heterozygous knock-out clone (tbcatb+/–) was produced by homologous recombination using a tbcatb targeting vector. The rate of replication of the tbcatb+/– clones was ∼40% less than the control 90-13 strain after 72 h (Fig. 1). tbcatb–/– clones could not be isolated due to presumed lethality.Abnormal Lysosomal and Flagellar Pocket Morphology in TbcatB-deficient Parasites—Treatment of wild-type T. brucei with the diazomethyl ketone cysteine protease inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 lead to enlargement of the lysosome and an increase in total protein content, presumably as a result of decreased protein degradation (6Scory S. Stierhof Y.D. Caffrey C.R. Ste"
https://openalex.org/W2097637665,"Background Selenoproteins are a diverse family of proteins notable for the presence of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine. Until very recently, all metazoan genomes investigated encoded selenoproteins, and these proteins had therefore been believed to be essential for animal life. Challenging this assumption, recent comparative analyses of insect genomes have revealed that some insect genomes appear to have lost selenoprotein genes. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we investigate in detail the fate of selenoproteins, and that of selenoprotein factors, in all available arthropod genomes. We use a variety of in silico comparative genomics approaches to look for known selenoprotein genes and factors involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis. We have found that five insect species have completely lost the ability to encode selenoproteins and that selenoprotein loss in these species, although so far confined to the Endopterygota infraclass, cannot be attributed to a single evolutionary event, but rather to multiple, independent events. Loss of selenoproteins and selenoprotein factors is usually coupled to the deletion of the entire no-longer functional genomic region, rather than to sequence degradation and consequent pseudogenisation. Such dynamics of gene extinction are consistent with the high rate of genome rearrangements observed in Drosophila. We have also found that, while many selenoprotein factors are concomitantly lost with the selenoproteins, others are present and conserved in all investigated genomes, irrespective of whether they code for selenoproteins or not, suggesting that they are involved in additional, non-selenoprotein related functions. Conclusions/Significance Selenoproteins have been independently lost in several insect species, possibly as a consequence of the relaxation in insects of the selective constraints acting across metazoans to maintain selenoproteins. The dispensability of selenoproteins in insects may be related to the fundamental differences in antioxidant defense between these animals and other metazoans."

We tested the hypothesis that inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by high glucose and high insulin induces increase in synthesis of laminin β1 via activation of eIF2Bϵ. Both high glucose and high insulin induced Ser-9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β at 2 h that lasted for up to 48 h. This was associated with dephosphorylation of eIF2Bϵ and eEF2, and increase in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E. Expression of the kinase-dead mutant of GSK3β or constitutively active kinase led to increased and diminished laminin β1 synthesis, respectively. Incubation with selective kinase inhibitors showed that high glucose- and high insulin-induced laminin β1 synthesis and phosphorylation of GSK3β were dependent on PI 3-kinase, Erk, and mTOR. High glucose and high insulin augmented activation of Akt, Erk, and p70S6 kinase. Dominant negative Akt, but not dominant negative p70S6 kinase, inhibited GSK3β phosphorylation induced by high glucose and high insulin, suggesting Akt but not p70S6 kinase was upstream of GSK3β. Status of GSK3β was examined in vivo in renal cortex of db/db mice with type 2 diabetes at 2 weeks and 2 months of diabetes. Diabetic mice showed increased phosphorylation of renal cortical GSK3β and decreased phosphorylation of eIF2Bϵ, which correlated with renal hypertrophy at 2 weeks, and increased laminin β1 and fibronectin protein content at 2 months.

GSK3β acts as a switch that regulates both transcription and mRNA translation by controlling the activity of transcription factors and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Bϵ (eIF2Bϵ), respectively. In the resting cell, GSK3β is unphosphorylated and active, inhibiting the activity of its substrates, e.g. eIF2Bϵ and glycogen synthase. Upon stimulation, GSK3β is phosphorylated on Ser-9 and inactivated, leading to release of inhibition on activity of its substrates. Several kinases are implicated in Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β including p70S6 kinase (8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

In contrast, constitutive signaling mechanisms that counteract the prohypertrophic signaling mechanisms and check unrestricted progression of protein synthesis are not well understood. GSK3β appears to constitutively inhibit protein synthesis by its inhibition of eIF2Bϵ. We hypothesized that inactivation of GSK3β by high glucose and high insulin induces an increase in synthesis of laminin β1 via activation of eIF2Bϵ. We investigated if GSK3β is inactive in the kidney in type 2 diabetes. We employed both in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models of type 2 diabetes in our investigation. Cell Culture—SV-40-immortalized murine kidney proximal tubular epithelial (MCT) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Eric Neilson, Vanderbilt University) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. MCT cells express in vivo properties of proximal tubular epithelial cells (26Haverty T.P. Kelly C.J. Hines W.H. Amenta P.S. Watanabe M. Harper R.A. Kefalides N.A. Neilson E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were growth-arrested for 18 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before experiment (23Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of protein from cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with primary antibody for 3 h (19Mariappan M.M. Senthil D.

Laminin β1 and GSK3β antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, fibronectin antibody was from Sigma, and phospho-eIF2Bϵ (Ser-539) was purchased from Upstate, Lake Placid, NY. After washing, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Images of the bands were scanned by reflectance scanning densitometry, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using Scion Image software (27Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Mummidi S. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cell lysates were heated at 100 °C for 7 min, and treated with 15% trichloroacetic acid. Immunoblotting was performed using an antibody specific for 4E-BP1 phosphorylated at Thr-37/46 (27Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Mummidi S. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GSK3β Immunokinase Activity Assay—Following treatment with high glucose or high insulin, cell lysates were prepared using the lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm Na3VO4, 500 μm NaF, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin. 300 μg of total protein was incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal anti GSK3β (sc-81462) in a rotor for 12 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were isolated by the addition of 25 μl of a slurry of protein A/G-agarose (sc-2003) and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase reaction buffer (8 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin). The kinase activity assays were performed in 40 μl of total reaction buffer containing 62.5 μm GSK3β substrate (BioMol, Plymouth, PA), 20 mm MgCl2, 125 μm ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C, and 15 μl of the supernatant were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. The filter squares were washed five times for 5 min each in 0.75% phosphoric acid. The filters were then briefly rinsed in acetone, dried at room temperature, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting (28van der Velden J.L. Langen R.C. Kelders M.C. Wouters E.F. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Schols A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C453-C462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Real Time RT-PCR—MCT cells were lysed, and their total RNA was isolated by acid phenol extraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Equal amounts of total RNA (1 μg) from MCT cells were converted to first-strand cDNA by using reverse transcriptase. PCR primer sequences for amplification of mouse laminin β1 (Primer Bank ID 21595540a2), mouse fibronectin (Primer Bank ID 4218966a1) and mouse GAPDH (Primer Bank ID 6679937a1) were obtained from Primer Bank, a public resource for PCR primers (29Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). 2 μl of cDNA was amplified using SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) containing 100 nm forward and reverse primers. PCR amplification was performed using 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using the manufacturer's protocol as recently described (21Sataranatarajan K. Mariappan M.M. Lee M.J.

Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dissociation curve analysis was performed following PCR amplification to confirm the specificity of the primers. Relative mRNA expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt method. Transfection Studies—MCT cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged kinase-dead (K85A) and constitutively active (S9A) constructs for GSK3β (Plasmids 14755 and 14754, respectively, Addgene, Cambridge, MA, deposited by Dr. Jim Woodgett) (30Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine-Plus reagent (Invitrogen) (19Mariappan M.M. Senthil D. Natarajan K.S. Choudhury G.G.

Plasmid containing kinase-dead p70S6 kinase was also purchased from Addgene (Plasmid 8985, deposited by Dr. John Blenis) (31Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Infection of MCT cells was carried out with (100 moi) of adenoviral vector expressing dominant negative HA-tagged Akt (Ad-DN-Akt) (32Choudhury G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35636-35643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and adenovirus containing green fluorescence protein (Ad-GFP) was used as the control. Animal Study—The C57BL6/KsJ lepr-/-db/db mice, a model of type 2 diabetes, and its lean littermates (db/m) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), were maintained on regular laboratory chow. Blood glucose concentration was monitored for emergence of diabetes. In the present study, lean littermate control and diabetic mice were studied in the early phase, after 2 weeks of onset of hyperglycemia, and, in the late phase, at 2 months of hyperglycemia. Previously we have reported that db/db mice display renal hypertrophy at 2 weeks (23Senthil D. Choudhury G.G. McLaurin C. Kasinath B.S. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 468-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and increase in laminin content at 2 months of diabetes (33Ha T.S. Barnes J.L. Stewart J.L. Ko C.W. Miner J.H. Abrahamson D.R. Sanes J.R. Kasinath B.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed at the end of each experimental period, and renal cortex was dissected out and processed for further analysis. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. obtained from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparison between multiple groups and posthoc analysis using Student's Newman Keul's multiple comparison tests using Graph Pad Prism 4 software. Statistical comparisons between two groups were performed by the Student's t test. Statistical significance was assigned to values of p < 0.05. High Glucose and High Insulin Stimulate Laminin and Fibronectin Synthesis—Incubation of MCT cells with 30 mm glucose or 1 nm insulin stimulated synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, laminin β1, and fibronectin, starting at 6 h and reaching a peak at 24 h (Fig. 1, A–D). We investigated if induction of synthesis of laminin β1 and fibronectin was due to an increase in their mRNA levels. Quantitative real time RT-PCR showed an increase in their respective mRNA content upon treatment with high glucose and high insulin (Fig. 2, A–D). Preincubation with actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, inhibited laminin β1 synthesis induced by high glucose and high insulin at 24 h but not at 1 and 2 h, suggesting transcriptional regulation at later time points and, possibly, translational regulation at early time points. Actinomycin-D inhibited high glucose- and high insulin-induced fibronectin synthesis at 2 and 24 h but not at 1 h, suggesting transcriptional regulation beyond 1 h of incubation (supplemental Fig. S1). We have previously reported that high glucose, high insulin, high glucose + high insulin increased de novo protein synthesis by about 20–25% (27Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Mummidi S. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled cell protein with lamininβ1 antibody showed significant increment in laminin synthesis under the three conditions. These data showed that although high glucose, high insulin, and both together stimulated global protein synthesis in MCT cells, increments in laminin β1 synthesis were in addition individually stimulated (27Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Mummidi S. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2High glucose and high insulin increase laminin β1 and fibronectin mRNA levels. Total RNA isolated from cells treated with or without high glucose and high insulin was reverse-transcribed to synthesize cDNA. 2μl of the cDNA subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using the SYBR Green method shows an increase in the transcript level of lamininβ1(A and B) and fibronectin (C and D) following incubation with high glucose or high insulin. GAPDH served as an internal control. The ratio of laminin β1 and fibronectin mRNA to GAPDH mRNA is shown. Histograms represent means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Significant differences between control and cells treated with high glucose and high insulin are indicated by #, p < 0.05; §, p < 0.01; and *, p < 0.001 by ANOVA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) High Glucose and High Insulin Promote Phosphorylation and Inactivation of GSK3β and Dephosphorylation of eIF2Bϵ—In cells in the basal state, GSK3β is active and keeps eIF2Bϵ inactive. Both high glucose and high insulin induced phosphorylation of Ser-9 on GSK3β, which is required for its inactivation, starting at about 2 h and lasting up to 48 h (Fig. 3, A and B). Combined incubation with high glucose and high insulin also increased GSK3β phosphorylation following the same time course as that of high glucose alone or high insulin alone (supplemental Fig. S2). We directly studied the effect of high glucose and high insulin on GSK3β activity. In an immunokinase activity assay, treatment of MCT cells with high glucose and high insulin significantly reduced [32P]phosphate incorporation into the GSK3β substrate, demonstrating reduced activity of GSK3β (Fig. 3, C and D). These data show that the increase in Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β correlates with reduction in its enzymatic activity. eIF2Bϵ mediates the antihypertrophic effects of GSK3β. Upon inactivation of GSK3β eIF2Bϵ is dephosphorylated on Ser-539 and is free to promote translation initiation. The binding of eIF2 to the activated initiator methionyl tRNA is promoted by dephosphorylated eIF2Bϵ (34Kasinath B.S. Mariappan M.M. Sataranatarajan K. Lee M.J. Feliers D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 3281-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). High glucose and high insulin reduced eIF2Bϵ Ser-539 phosphorylation starting at 2 h and lasting for up to 48 h (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, GSK3β inactivation and eIF2Bϵ dephosphorylation are temporally associated with high glucose- and high insulin-induced matrix protein synthesis. High Glucose and High Insulin Regulate Initiation and Elongation Phases of Translation—Because translation is the rate-limiting step in gene expression culminating in peptide synthesis, we examined key steps in initiation and elongation phases of translation in the context of GSK3β regulation of matrix protein synthesis. During the initiation phase of mRNA translation, binding of the 43S ribosomal pre-initiation complex to the mRNA is facilitated by eIF4E in association with eIF4G and eIF4A (15Kasinath B.S. Lee M.J. Feliers D. Sonenberg N. Cortes P.M.C. Contemporary Diabetes. The Diabetic Kidney. Humana Press, NJ2003: 97-116Google Scholar). In the resting cell, eIF4E is held in an inactive complex by its binding protein 4E-BP1. Upon stimulation, 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated on several threonine and serine residues, including Thr-37/46 (36Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). This results in dissolution of the complex, freeing eIF4E to bind with mRNA cap to promote translation initiation. High glucose and high insulin augmented phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 4, A and B) and eIF4E (Fig. 4, C and D). During the elongation phase of translation, amino acids are sequentially added to the nascent peptide chain by the participation of aminoacyl tRNA (34Kasinath B.S. Mariappan M.M. Sataranatarajan K. Lee M.J. Feliers D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 3281-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Thornton S. Anand N. Purcell D. Lee J. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Movement of the ribosome along the mRNA, resulting in translocation of aminoacyl tRNA from the A site to the P site on the ribosome, is regulated by eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Activation of eEF2 occurs following dephosphorylation at Thr-56 (38Redpath N.T. Price N.T. Severinov K.V. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). High glucose and high insulin also induced dephosphorylation of Thr-56 on eEF2 (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, high glucose or high insulin activate important steps in both initiation and elongation phases in association with inactivation of GSK3β and increased matrix protein synthesis in MCT cells. High Glucose and High Insulin Activate Akt, Erk and p70S6 Kinase—Several upstream kinases have been implicated in inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylation at Ser-9 (39Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). These include Akt-PKB (40Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A.

We immunoblotted cell lysates treated with phosphospecific antibodies for Akt, Erk, and p70S6 kinase phosphorylated at Ser-473, Thr-202/Tyr-204, and, Thr-389, respectively. High glucose and high insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, and p70S6 kinase that started at 2 h and remained phosphorylated until 24–48 h. (Fig. 5, A–F). Akt but Not p70S6 Kinase Regulates GSK3β Phosphorylation Induced by High Glucose and High Insulin—Next, we examined whether phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 kinase is required for high glucose- and high insulin-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β and laminin β1 synthesis. In cells expressing dominant-negative Akt, high glucose and high insulin failed to stimulate GSK3β phosphorylation and laminin β1 synthesis (Fig. 6, A and B). However, in cells expressing kinasedead p70S6 kinase, only laminin β1 synthesis was blocked but not Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, stimulation of GSK3β phosphorylation by high glucose and high insulin is dependent on Akt but not p70S6 kinase activation in MCT cells, although both kinases are involved in the regulation of laminin β1 synthesis. We examined the role of PI 3-kinase, Erk, and mTOR in GSK3β Ser-9 phosphorylation. Akt activation by high glucose and high insulin is PI 3-kinase-dependent (data not shown) (43King W.G.

Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Preincubation of MCT cells with LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and, rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, blocked GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig. 7, A–F) and laminin β1 synthesis (Fig. 7, G and H) induced by high glucose and high insulin at 24 h. As rapamycin data suggested, mTOR regulates GSK3β, we studied their interaction. Immunoprecipitation with anti-mTOR antibody and immunoblotting with anti-GSK3β antibody suggested that the two proteins exist in a complex; the intensity of binding did not seem to change following exposure to high glucose or high insulin (supplemental Fig. S3). Because PI 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR belong to a linear pathway, it is not surprising that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (LY294002) and mTOR (rapamycin) inhibited GSK3β phosphorylation. We explored if Erk activation was under the regulation of PI 3-kinase. LY294002, abrogated high glucose- and high insulin-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAP kinase (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting the latter was under the control of PI 3-kinase. These data confirm our previous report that Erk is downstream of PI 3-kinase in insulin-treated MCT cells (45Bhandari B.K. Feliers D. Duraisamy S. Stewart J.L. Gingras A.C. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G.

Because PI 3-kinase regulates both mTOR and Erk activation, we see complete inhibition of Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β with each of the three inhibitors. Expression of Kinase Inactive (K85A) and Constitutively Active (S9A) Constructs of GSK3β Alter High Glucose- and High Insulin-induced Changes in Laminin β1 Synthesis—Next, we investigated the requirement of GSK3β inactivation for high glucose- and high insulin-induced synthesis of laminin β1 in MCT cells. Cells were transiently transfected with either a kinase inactive (K85A) or a constitutively active (S9A) construct of GSK3β. Expression of kinase-dead K85A-GSK3β resulted in increased laminin β1 synthesis in control cells (Fig. 8, A and B). However, inactive GSK3β did not add to the incremental effect of high glucose and high insulin on laminin β1 syn"

SK channels constitutively interact with calmodulin (CaM), which serves as Ca2+ sensor, and with protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A, which modulate their Ca2+ gating. By recording coupled activities of Ca2+ and SK2 channels, we showed that SK2 channels can be inhibited by neurotransmitters independently of changes in the activity of the priming Ca2+ channels. This inhibition involves SK2-associated CK2 and results from a 3-fold reduction in the Ca2+ sensitivity of channel gating. CK2 phosphorylated SK2-bound CaM but not KCNQ2-bound CaM, thereby selectively regulating SK2 channels. We extended these observations to sensory neurons by showing that noradrenaline inhibits SK current and increases neuronal excitability in a CK2-dependent fashion. Hence, neurotransmitter-initiated signaling cascades can dynamically regulate Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels and directly influence somatic excitability.

Hence, neurotransmitter-initiated signaling cascades can dynamically regulate Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels and directly influence somatic excitability. The small-conductance, Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) channels are found in both neuronal and nonneuronal tissues (Köhler et al., 1996Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V.

Three homologous SK channels, SK1–3, are expressed in the mammalian brain and display partially overlapping distributions (Stocker et al., 1999Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P.

In many neurons throughout the nervous system, SK channels regulate firing frequency by contributing to medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) that follows action potentials (Bond et al., 2004Bond C.T.

Physiol. 2005; 566: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). SK channels are also important in regulating dendritic excitability (Cai et al., 2004Cai X. Liang C.W. Muralidharan S.

Indeed, SK2 channel plasticity contributes to the increased EPSP underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) (Lin et al., 2008Lin M.T. Luján R. Watanabe M. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. SK2 channel plasticity contributes to LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses.Nat.

Small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels modulate synaptic plasticity and memory encoding.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10163-10171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SK channels are activated by low concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ ions (EC50 of ∼0.3–0.5 μM; Köhler et al., 1996Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels from mammalian brain.Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) and sense Ca2+ via binding of Ca2+ ions to calmodulin (CaM), which is constitutively bound to the C terminus domain of the channel (Xia et al., 1998Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T.

Domains responsible for constitutive and Ca2+-dependent interactions between calmodulin and small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence also indicates that native SK2 channel complexes are comprised of the protein kinase CK2, a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase, and the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Bildl et al., 2004Bildl W. Strassmaier T. Thurm H. Andersen J. Eble S. Oliver D. Knipper M. Mann M. Schulte U. Adelman J.P. Fakler B. Protein kinase CK2 is coassembled with small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels and regulates channel gating.Neuron. 2004; 43: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which serve opposing roles in regulating Ca2+ gating of SK2 channels (Allen et al., 2007Allen D. Fakler B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Organization and regulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel multiprotein complexes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The central role of these enzymes in regulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels suggests that Ca2+ channel-independent pathways might modulate SK channel functions by tuning their Ca2+ gating. Here, we provide evidence that SK channels can be modulated by transmitters, independently of change in Ca2+ channel activity, through CK2- and PP2A-mediated modulation of their apparent Ca2+ sensitivity. Hence, neurotransmitters can dynamically regulate Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels and directly influence spike-frequency adaptation of peripheral and central neurons. We first recorded coupled activities of endogenous Ca2+ and SK channels using perforated outside-out microvesicles pulled-out from somatic membranes of sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons (Figure 1A). Single-channel activities were elicited by stepping from −70 to 0/+5 mV. Out of 12 microvesicles recorded, only two contained SK-like channel activity, suggesting that native SK channels are not homogeneously distributed on the cell surface of SCG neurons. To increase the probability of obtaining Ca2+ and SK channel coupling, cDNA coding for rSK2 channels was intranuclearly microinjected into SCG neurons, and unitary currents were recorded 2 days later. In these experiments, only microvesicles containing a single-channel activity with resolved openings were used. A representative recording of the combined activation of an endogenous Cav2.2 channel together with a SK channel is shown in Figure 1C. With external Ca2+ and K+ set at 20 and 10 mM, respectively, single-channel conductances for Cav2.2 and SK channels were 16.8 ± 1.2 pS (n = 6) and 8.9 ± 0.9 pS (n = 9). The SK channel conductance recorded here was very similar to that of rSK2 expressed in oocytes (Hirschberg et al., 1998Hirschberg B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Marrion N.V. Gating of recombinant small-conductance Ca-activated K+ channels by calcium.J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 571-581Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ca2+ channel activity was abolished by ω-conotoxin GVIA (500 nM, n = 5; Figure 1B), whereas activity of SK was fully blocked by apamin (300 nM, n = 7, Figure 1C). SK channels activated ∼3 ms after the onset of the Cav2.2 current and peaked <19 ms after peak ICa (inset in Figure 1C). On average, SK channel activated with a time constant of 12.9 ± 1.6 ms in response to the opening of a single Cav2.2 channel (n = 7). This is in good agreement with previous studies on rSK2 expressed in oocytes (Hirschberg et al., 1998Hirschberg B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Marrion N.V. Gating of recombinant small-conductance Ca-activated K+ channels by calcium.J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 571-581Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Köhler et al., 1996Köhler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels from mammalian brain.Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), predicting time constants of activation of 20 ms and 6.3 ms in response to 1 and 10 μM intracellular Ca2+, respectively. SK channel activity was not detected when no Ca2+ channel was present in the microvesicle or when Ca2+ channels were blocked by ω-CgTx GVIA (n = 4, Figure 1D). Applying noradrenaline (NE, 1 μM) inhibited both Ca2+ and SK channel activities in 75% (9/12) of microvesicles tested (Figure 1D). Taking the change in the peak of pseudomacroscopic currents as an index for inhibition (Figure 1D), Cav2.2 and SK currents were reduced by 64% ± 4% (n = 5) and 57% ± 5% (n = 4), respectively. We presume that the appropriate adrenergic receptor(s)/transducing pathway(s) were lacking in the unresponsive microvesicles. Cav2.2 channels are inhibited by Gβγ following NE application (Ikeda, 1996Ikeda S.R. Voltage-dependent modulation of N-type calcium channels by G-protein beta gamma subunits.Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), and therefore it is unclear whether it is the Ca2+ channel or the SK channel per se (or both) that are the target(s) for modulation. We therefore replicated the above experiments in neurons preinjected with cDNA coding for the rat Cav2.3 channel subunit (α1E, rbEII) with a short N-terminal sequence (GenBank: L15453 ) that is not inhibited by Gβγ (Bourinet et al., 1996Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Determinants of the G protein-dependent opioid modulation of neuronal calcium channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Page et al., 1998Page K.M. Cantí C. Stephens G.J. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Identification of the amino terminus of neuronal Ca2+ channel alpha1 subunits alpha1B and alpha1E as an essential determinant of G-protein modulation.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Ca2+ channels was then recorded 2 days later in the presence of ω-CgTx GVIA (500 nM) and nifedipine (1 μM) to block endogenous Cav2.2 and Cav2.1 channels, respectively. Ca2+ channels recorded under these conditions could be activated by stepping from a holding potential of −70/−80 but not from −40 mV (n = 9), consistent with the inactivation properties of Cav2.3 channels. NE (1 μM) reduced whole-cell Cav2.3 currents by only 11% ± 2.8% (n = 9, see Figure 4A), whereas ≥60% inhibition was typically observed for whole-cell Cav2.2 currents in sympathetic neurons (Ikeda, 1996Ikeda S.R. Voltage-dependent modulation of N-type calcium channels by G-protein beta gamma subunits.Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, Delmas et al., 2000Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Buckley N.J. Brown D.A. Calcium channel gating and modulation by transmitters depend on cellular compartmentalization.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NE did not cause a significant change in single Cav2.3 channel activity when tested using perforated microvesicles (2%–6% reduction in charge transfer; Figure 2A). Although Cav2.3 channels displayed faster inactivation than Cav2.2 when Ca2+ was used as a charge carrier, they could promote activation of SK2 channels (Figures 2B and 2C). However, it should be noted that the rate of activation of SK2 channels was slower (τ = ∼23 ms) than with Cav2.2 channels, possibly reflecting a smaller rise in Ca2+ at the vicinity of the SK channel (Figure 2C). The activity of Cav2.3-driven SK2 channels was strongly inhibited by bath application of NE (1 μM) (Figures 2B and 2C). Inhibition took 10–40 s to develop, plateaued within 4–5 min, and reversed within 6–13 min (Figures 2D) and was best prevented by a cocktail containing the α1- and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, prazosin (3 μM) and timolol (5 μM) (n = 5). On average, pseudomacroscopic SK currents were inhibited by 69.3% ± 7% compared to only 12.5% ± 4% for Cav2.3 currents (Figure 2E). We next examined whether other neurotransmitters exhibited the ability to modulate SK currents. We found that somatostatin (Sst, 500 nM) inhibited SK currents by 32% ± 6%, whereas bradykinin (BK, 200 nM) and angiotensin II (AGII, 500 nM) caused no significant inhibition of SK currents (Figure 2E). Despite its inability to modulate SK current, AGII produced stronger inhibition (22% ± 6%) of Cav2.3 currents than Sst and BK (11%–13%; Figure 2E). To examine whether the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of SK2 channels is altered during neurotransmitter action, steady-state SK2 channel activity was recorded in microvesicles “artificially” loaded with different concentrations of free Ca2+ using ionomycin (1–3 μM) added to the patch pipette solution (Figure 3). When microvesicles were loaded with 1 μM Ca2+, NE reduced mean po from 0.64 ± 0.06 to 0.27 ± 0.07 (n = 5) (Figure 3A1). In contrast, NE had little detectable effect on SK2 channel activity in microvesicles loaded with 3 μM free Ca2+ (n = 7) (Figure 3A2). Under these conditions, SK2 channels exhibited a high po of 0.71 ± 0.08, which was not altered by NE. This observation suggested that change in the Ca2+ gating of SK channel by Ca2+-bound CaM could be responsible for the agonist action. Consistent with these results, steady-state [Ca2+]i response curves for SK channels showed that the apparent EC50 value was shifted rightward from 0.42 ± 0.06 to 1.37 ± 0.1 μM in the presence of NE (Figure 3B). To test whether CK2-mediated phosphorylation of SK2-associated CaM is involved in the change of apparent EC50, steady-state Ca2+ dose-response relationships were determined in the continued presence of the specific CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole (TBB). Activation curves determined in 10 μM TBB-treated microvesicles yielded an apparent EC50 value of 0.30 ± 0.05 μM (Figure 3C, n = 6) in agreement with Allen et al., 2007Allen D. Fakler B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Organization and regulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel multiprotein complexes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. The presence of TBB strongly reduced the effect of NE since steady-state [Ca2+]i-response curves in the presence of NE yielded an EC50 value of 0.39 ± 0.08 μM (Figure 3C). The predominant form of the CK2 enzyme is a heterotetrameric complex consisting of two catalytic α subunits and two regulatory β subunits (Litchfield, 2005Litchfield D.W. Protein kinase CK2: structure, regulation and role in cellular decisions of life and death.Biochem. J. 2005; 369: 1-15Crossref Scopus (951) Google Scholar). We compared the Ca2+ sensitivity and modulation of SK2 channels in neurons overexpressing the wild-type CK2β/CK2α holoenzyme with those in neurons expressing a site-directed mutant of the catalytic subunit of CK2α that is kinase inactive (CK2αK68M) (Penner et al., 1997Penner C.G.

Saulnier R.B. St Pierre R. Litchfield D.W. Inducible expression of protein kinase CK2 in mammalian cells. Evidence for functional specialization of CK2 isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14406-14414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). SK2 channels coassembled with the CK2β/CK2α holoenzyme showed slightly reduced Ca2+ sensitivity compared to SK channels in neurons expressing CK2β alone (EC50 values of 0.69 ± 0.08 and 0.49 ± 0.06 μM, respectively) (Figure S1 available online). The rather modest decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels in cells overexpressing CK2β/CK2α suggested that SK channels were subjected to tonic protein phosphatase activity. Consistently, expression of CK2β/CK2α in conjunction with treatment with okadaic acid (200 nM for 1 hr), a specific inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, increased the EC50 value to 0.89 ± 0.09 μM (n = 4, data not shown). The Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels assembled with the kinase-dead CK2β/CK2αK68M was 0.38 ± 0.08 μM (n = 13; Figure 3D). Upon coexpression of SK2 with CK2β/CK2αK68M, NE failed to change the Ca2+ response relationship significantly, with an EC50 value of 0.43 ± 0.07 μM (Figure 3D). To test whether modulation was mediated by SK2-associated CK2, we expressed the site-directed K121A mutant of SK2, which has been shown to suppress SK2-bound CK2 activity (Allen et al., 2007Allen D. Fakler B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Organization and regulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel multiprotein complexes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of K121A mutants was left-shifted to 0.36 ± 0.08 μM, consistent with tonic regulation of SK2 channel Ca2+ sensitivity by CK2 and PP2A. NE failed to change significantly the Ca2+ response relationship of SK2 K121A channels, yielding an apparent EC50 of 0.39 ± 0.09 μM (Figure 3E). In addition, the EQRK to AQAA SK2 mutant, which exhibits greatly diminished ability to bind PP2A (Allen et al., 2007Allen D. Fakler B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Organization and regulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel multiprotein complexes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), had a Ca2+ sensitivity shifted to the right (EC50 = 0.71 ± 0.05 μM). Consequently, the effects of NE were partly occluded with an apparent EC50 for Ca2+ of 0.98 ± 0.09 μM (Figure 3E, n = 5; p < 0.05). These data support the idea that NE effects occur through SK2-associated CK2 phosphorylation and that SK2-associated PP2A tonically opposes these effects. To determine whether NE phosphorylates SK2-associated CaM, we performed immunoprecipitations using a specific SK2 antibody (Figure 3F). Two days after transfection of fetal SCG cell cultures, [32Pi] metabolically labeled cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and radiolabeling. Immunocomplexes precipitated by the SK2 antibody contained low levels of 32P-CaM (Figure 3F). NE markedly enhanced 32P-CaM associated with SK2, whereas preincubation with TBB prevented this effect (Figures 3F and 3G). Specificity was monitored by parallel experiments in which we tested whether NE promotes the phosphorylation of CaM when complexed with KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) subunits (Delmas and Brown, 2005Delmas P.

The results presented in the bottom panel of Figure 3F show that CaM precipitated from Flag epitope-tagged KCNQ2 immunocomplexes was not phosphorylated, suggesting that NE phosphorylated CaM in a CK2-dependent manner only when CaM was complexed with SK2 channels. To further demonstrate the essential role of CK2 phosphorylation of CaM in NE-mediated changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels, we coexpressed SK2 with a site-directed mutant of CaM (CaMT80A), which prevents CK2 phosphorylation (Bildl et al., 2004Bildl W. Strassmaier T. Thurm H. Andersen J. Eble S. Oliver D. Knipper M. Mann M. Schulte U. Adelman J.P. Fakler B.

Calcium concentration response relationship of CaMT80A-associated SK2 channels provided an EC50 value of 0.37 ± 0.08 μM (Figure 4B). NE did not significantly affect the Ca2+ sensitivity of SK2 channels assembled with CaMT80A (EC50 = 0.45 ± 0.09 μM, n = 7) (Figure 4B). We next examined the potential for noradrenergic modulation of SK-mediated whole-cell currents using the amphotericin B-perforated patch method. Figures 5B1–5B4 show representative recordings from SCG neurons coexpressing Cav2.3 and SK2 subunits, in which Nav and M/KCNQ K+ channels were blocked by TTX (200 nM) and linopirdine (10 μM), respectively. Linopirdine, up to 200 μM, has been shown to have no effect on rSK2 (Dreixler et al., 2000Dreixler J.C. Bian J.-T. Cao Y.-J. Roberts M.T. Roizen J.D. Houamed K.M. Block of rat brain recombinant SK channels by tricyclic antidepressants and related compounds.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 401: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, bath application of NE produced a slow decrease in peak outward tail currents (IAHP) evoked by brief depolarizing voltage step to 0 mV (Figure 5B1). Similar results were obtained in the eight cells tested, with a mean inhibition of 71% ± 8% (Figures 5C and 5D). Application of apamin (100 nM) blocked IAHP, thus identifying it as SK current, and prevented further inhibition by NE (Figure 5B2). NE inhibition was reduced to 35% ± 6% and 27% ± 7% in TBB-treated cells and CK2β/CK2αK68M-expressing cells, respectively (Figures 5C and 5D). The implication of CK2 was confirmed using two new ATP site-directed inhibitors of CK2, chosen among the most effective and selective compounds, namely 1,8-dihydroxy-4-nitroanthracene-9,10-dione (MNA) and 8-hydroxy-4-methyl-9-nitrobenzo[g]chromen-2-one (NBC) (Meggio et al., 2004Meggio F. Pagano M.A. Moro S. Zagotto G. Ruzzene M. Sarno S. Cozza G. Bain J. Elliott M. Deana A.D. et al.Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 by condensed polyphenolic derivatives. An in vitro and in vivo study.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12931-12936Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One hour preincubation of cells with MNA and NBC reduced NE inhibition of IAHP to 28% ± 6% and 26% ± 6%, respectively (Figure 5D). These values are qualitatively the same as those for TBB and CK2β/CK2αK68M. In some neurons, SK channels contribute to the mAHP that follows action potentials (APs) (Maylie et al., 2003Maylie J. Bond C.T. Herson P.S. Lee W.-S. Adelman J.P. Small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels and calmodulin.J. Physiol. 2003; 554: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Faber and Sah, 2007Faber E.S. Sah P. Functions of SK channels in central neurons.Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2007; 34: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated how NE affected AHP in the absence of linopirdine in neurons coexpressing Cav2.3 and SK2 subunits. Figure 5E illustrates the changes that NE produces on the AHP that follows a single AP elicited at ∼−60 mV with a brief current injection. NE markedly reduced the amplitude of the AHP in control neurons, whereas TBB and expression of CK2αK68M greatly impeded NE action (Figures 5E and 5F). On average, NE reduced AHP peak amplitude from 21.7 ± 2 to 15.4 ± 1.4 mV (p < 0.01) in control neurons and from 21.8 ± 1.6 to 19.5 ± 1.5 mV (p > 0.05) and 19.4 ± 1 to 17.8 ± 0.9 mV (p > 0.05) in neurons treated with TBB or expressing CK2β/CK2αK68M, respectively (Figure 5F). Recently, SK channels have been shown to play a key role in controlling sensory pathways, including nociceptive inputs into the spinal cord (Bahia et al., 2005Bahia P.K. Suzuki R. Benton D.C. Jowett A.J. Chen M.X. Trezise D.J. Dickenson A.H. Moss G.W. A functional role for small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in sensory pathways including nociceptive processes.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3489-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In sensory dorsal root ganglia (DRG), SK1 and SK2 are preferentially expressed in small nociceptive DRG cells, whereas SK3 is expressed both in small and large cells (Bahia et al., 2005Bahia P.K. Suzuki R. Benton D.C. Jowett A.J. Chen M.X. Trezise D.J. Dickenson A.H. Moss G.W.

The distribution of small and intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in the rat sensory nervous system.Neuroscience. 2005; 131: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether NE, which has pronociceptive actions, regulates native SK channels and spike-frequency adaptation in putative nociceptors (Figure 6). We examined NE responses in cultured small DRG neurons expressing Cav2.3 and bathed with ω-CgTx GVIA (200 nM), nifedipine (1 μM), ω-agatoxin IVA (200 nM), and amiloride (250 μM) to block endogenous Ca2+ currents (Coste et al., 2007Coste B. Crest M. Delmas P. Pharmacological dissection and distribution of NaN/Nav1.9, T-type Ca2+ currents, and mechanically activated cation currents in different populations of DRG neurons.J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 57-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Application of NE for 2 min caused an increase in the number of APs elicited by current step injection, which was associated with the suppression of the AHP, essentially mimicking the effects of apamin (Figure 6A). We quantified the effects of NE on excitability by examining the relationship between injected current and AP firing. NE increased by 1.5- to 3-fold the number of APs elicited over a range of injected current amplitudes (Figure 6B). We confirmed that NE had no significant effects on either Cav2.3 or KCNQ/M currents recorded in such cells (Figures 6C1 and 6C2) but inhibited apamin-sensitive K+ currents evoked by repolarizing voltage steps or ramps (Figures 6C3 and 6C4). One hour preincubation of DRG cultures with MNA (1 μM) reduced NE inhibition of IAHP from 41% to 14% (Figure 6D). Most of the cells responding to NE were found to be sensitive to capsaicin (Figure 6E). We have used perforated microvesicles from SCG neurons in order to simultaneously record coupled activities of Ca2+ channels and heterologously expressed SK2 channels and to study their regulation by neurotransmitters. We demonstrated that Ca2+ influx produced by the activation of either Cav2.2 or Cav2.3 channels permits a sufficient rise in intracellular Ca2+ to open expressed SK2 channels. Although we overexpressed SK2 subunits, SK3 and possibly SK1 are natively expressed in rat SCG neurons (Hosseini et al., 2001Hosseini R. Benton D.C.H. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. Moss G.W.J.

Little is known, however, in regard to how the ERK MAPK cascade regulates Th2 cell differentiation. We herein identified Gfi1 (growth factor independent-1) as a downstream target of the ERK MAPK cascade for Th2 cell differentiation. In the absence of Gfi1, interleukin-5 production and the change of histone modification at the interleukin-5 gene locus were severely impaired. Furthermore, the interferon gamma gene showed a striking activation in the Gfi1(-/-) Th2 cells. An enhanced ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of GATA3 protein was observed in Gfi1(-/-) Th2 cells, and the overexpression of GATA3 eliminated the defect of Th2 cell function in Gfi1-deficient Th2 cells. These data suggest that the T cell receptor-mediated induction of Gfi1 controls Th2 cell differentiation through the regulation of GATA3 protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1977177518,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited cause of kidney failure, is caused by mutations in either PKD1 (85%) or PKD2 (15%). The PKD2 protein, polycystin-2 (PC2 or TRPP2), is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily and functions as a non-selective calcium channel. PC2 has been found to form oligomers in native tissues suggesting that it may form functional homo- or heterotetramers with other subunits, similar to other TRP channels. Our experiments unexpectedly revealed that PC2 mutant proteins lacking the known C-terminal dimerization domain were still able to form oligomers and co-immunoprecipitate full-length PC2, implying the possible existence of a proximal dimerization domain. Using yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays, we have mapped an alternative dimerization domain to the N terminus of PC2 (NT2-1-223, L224X). Functional characterization of this domain demonstrated that it was sufficient to induce cyst formation in zebrafish embryos and inhibit PC2 surface currents in mIMCD3 cells probably by a dominant-negative mechanism. In summary, we propose a model for PC2 assembly as a functional tetramer which depends on both C- and N-terminal dimerization domains. These results have significant implications for our understanding of PC2 function and disease pathogenesis in ADPKD and provide a new strategy for studying PC2 function."

There are five PCBPs in mammalian cells: PCBP1-4 and hnRNP K. Each PCBP contains three KH domains: two consecutive domains at the N terminus and a third domain at the C terminus; an intervening sequence of variable length is present between the second and third domains (Fig. 1A). PCBPs regulate gene expression at various levels, including transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stabilization, and translation, among others. For example, specific binding of hnRNP K and PCBP1 to the single-stranded pyrimidine-rich promoter sequence of the human c-myc gene and mu-opioid receptor (MOR) gene, respectively, activates transcription (3Tomonaga T.

In the case of α-globin mRNA, it was established that the stoichiometry of the RNA-protein complex (the α-complex) is 1:1, and a minimum RNA sequence of 20-nt (5′-CCCAACGGGCCCUCCUCCCC-3′) is necessary and sufficient for forming the complex (14Waggoner S.A.

Interaction of two PCBPs, hnRNP K, and PCBP1/2, with a multiply tandem C-rich sequence (differentiation control element, DICE.) within the 3′-UTR of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA leads to translational silencing of the mRNA in erythroid precursor cells (15Ostareck-Lederer A.

A minimum of two repeats is required for efficient translational suppression. PCBPs can also activate translation of cellular mRNAs. For example, binding of PCBP1 to an 18-nt C-rich sequence (5′-CUCCAUUCCCACUCCCU-3′) within the 5′-UTR of folate receptor mRNA up-regulates its translation (18Xiao X. Tang Y.S. Mackins J.Y. Sun X.L.

Besides cellular mRNAs, PCBPs also participate in regulating critical viral RNA functions.

The mechanistic details are not well understood for any of the PCBP functions. What emerges as a common feature is the binding of PCBPs to C-rich sequence motifs (often present in tandem) of the target D/RNAs. The molecular basis of PCBP KH domains-D/RNA interactions has been revealed by a number of crystal structures of individual KH1 or KH3 domain from PCBPs in complex with C-rich D/RNA sequences (25Backe P.H.

RNA. 2007; 13: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, there are no structures with KH2. Little is known about the events subsequent to any KH domain-D/RNA interaction. Pertinent to this point, there are no structures of PCBP constructs containing more than one KH domain. While studies suggest that protein-protein interactions occur and are vital for function, e.g. see Ref. 28Du Z. Lee J.K. Fenn S. Tjhen R. Stroud R.M. James T.L. RNA. 2007; 13: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), knowledge about how PCBPs engage in protein-protein interaction is also very limited. While a protein-D/RNA interaction seems essential for initiating the sequence of events, protein-protein interactions most likely are responsible for connectivity to various functions in most cases. It is therefore important to explore the missing link between protein-D/RNA and protein-protein interactions. To address these critical issues regarding the mechanisms of PCBP functions, we have determined the solution structure of the N terminus-half of human PCBP2 containing the KH1 and KH2 domains (corresponding to residues 11-169 of the full-length protein, referred to as PCBP2 KH1-KH2 herein). The sequence of the construct, as well as homologous sequences from other PCBPs, is shown in Fig. 1B. We have also investigated D/RNA binding properties of the KH1-KH2 construct by chemical shift mapping. Spectral comparison of the KH1-KH2, KH3, and full-length protein constructs provides insights into how the three KH domains might be arranged in the full-length protein. Based on results of our studies and available biochemical data, we propose possible regulatory mechanisms for PCBP functions that involve the interplay of D/RNA binding and conformational rearrangement of the KH domains. Sample Preparation—Three protein constructs of human PCBP2 were prepared containing: KH1-KH2 (residues 11-169 of the full-length sequence), KH3 (residues 285-359), and the “full-length” (residues 11-359). The proteins were expressed with N-terminal His tag (MKH6K; all but the last K could be removed by TAGzyme from Qiagen). The proteins were overexpressed in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene). The preparation of properly folded PCBP2 KH1-KH2 proteins involved refolding from denatured proteins obtained from inclusion bodies. Methods for refolding and isotope labeling of the KH1-KH2 construct have been described previously (28Du Z. Lee J.K. Fenn S. Tjhen R. Stroud R.M. James T.L. RNA. 2007; 13: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For most samples, the final NMR buffer contains 50 mm deuterated sodium acetate (pH 5.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m EDTA, in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O. Preparation of the KH3 construct has also been described previously (27Fenn S. Du Z. Lee J.K. Tjhen R. Stroud R.M. James T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the full-length construct, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.6-0.8 at 10 °C for 48 h before harvest. The His-tagged proteins present in the supernatant were purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The purified proteins were concentrated and buffer-exchanged by centrifugation. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technology. Samples of the KH1-KH2-DNA complexes were prepared by titrating a solution of DNA into a solution of the KH1-KH2 protein (molar ratio 2:1) at low concentration (∼10 μm), and subsequently concentrating to ∼0.5 mm. It was found that mixing the DNA with protein and subsequent concentration of the complex led to some precipitation, presumably due to nonspecific aggregation. For this reason, the accurate DNA/protein molar ration for the NMR sample could not be determined. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Refinement—Data for structure determination of KH1-KH2 were collected on three isotopically labeled samples: uniformly 13C/15N, 13C/15N with 60% random fractional deuteration, and 13C/15N/2H/(Ile/Leu/Val)-methyl-protonated KH1-KH2. For most of the NMR experiments, the MKH6K-tag was not removed. All NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Inova spectrometer, operating at 600 MHz for protons, equipped with a cryoprobe. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe/NMRDraw (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomolec. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (30Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. 3.0 Ed. University of California, San Francisco1998Google Scholar). All NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C. 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments were achieved using standard double and triple resonance experiments. Interproton distance restraints were derived from a number of 15N or 13C-separated NOESY three-dimensional experiments. NOE-derived inter-proton distance restraints were classified into four categories with a lower bound of 1.8 Å and an upper bound of 2.7, 3.5, 5.0, and 6.0 Å corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs, respectively. Torsion angle restraints were derived from TALOS (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Generic hydrogen bond distance restraints were utilized for regions of regular secondary structure that were based on characteristic NOE patterns and chemical shifts characteristic of the secondary structure. Structure refinement was carried out by simulated annealing in torsion angle space using established procedures implemented in the program XPLOR-NIH (32Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Res. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). NMR restraint violations and structure quality were analyzed via the programs AQUA and PROCHECK_NMR (33Laskowski R.A.

The final ensemble of structures contains the twelve lowest energy conformers, from 50 randomized initial structures; all calculated structures converge to the same fold. For the measurements of the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and transverse relaxation time (T2) of the backbone amide 15N nuclei, a series of 15N-HSQC spectra with varied relaxation delays were used (10, 60, 110, 280, 440, 610, 880, 1320 ms for T1; 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150 ms for T2). The relaxation experiments were performed on a 15N-labeled sample at 298 K. Relaxation parameters (reported in Fig. 2) were calculated by fitting peak heights measured with the program SPARKY (30Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. 3.0 Ed. University of California, San Francisco1998Google Scholar). Structure figures were generated using PyMol (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002). PCBP2 KH1-KH2 Exists as a Monomer in Solution—The PCBP2 KH1-KH2 protein (with a removable N-terminal His tag) was expressed in inclusion bodies. Properly folded proteins suitable for structural study were obtained by refolding. To investigate whether refolded KH1-KH2 is in monomeric or multimeric states, we employed the following method. Two KH1-KH2 samples, one unlabeled and the other 15N-labeled, were prepared by refolding. For the 15N-labeled sample, the His tag was removed. Equal amounts of unlabeled (with His tag) and 15N-labeled (without His tag) samples were mixed and denatured in 8 m urea. The denatured protein mixtures were then refolded. The refolded proteins were recovered from the refolding solution by Ni-NTA resin. If the refolded proteins were in multimeric states, the sample recovered by the resin would contain both the His-tagged unlabeled and tag-removed 15N-labeled proteins. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and NMR experiments showed that only the His-tagged unlabeled protein was present in the recovered sample, indicating that no intermolecular protein-protein interaction took place during refolding: the refolded KH1-KH2 is in a monomeric state. Results from gel filtration chromatography also suggested that KH1-KH2 exists as a monomer (data not shown). Structure and Dynamics of PCBP2 KH1-KH2—Nearly complete 1H/13C/15N chemical shifts assignments for PCBP2 KH1-KH2 were obtained and deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB accession number 15049). The structure was determined using distance restraints derived from NOE measurements, torsion angle restraints derived from TALOS, as well as generic hydrogen bond restraints for regular secondary structure elements.

Open table in a new tab In PCBP2 KH1-KH2, both the KH1 and KH2 domains adopt the classical type-I KH fold, which consists of three α-helices and three β-strands arranged in the order β1-α1-α2-β2-β3-α3. The conserved GXXG invariable loop (30GKKG and 114GKGG for KH1 and KH2, respectively) is located between α1 and α2; the variable loop (Ser50-Pro55 and Ala134-Thr142 for KH1 and KH2, respectively) is between β2 and β3 (Fig. 1, B and C). The three β-strands form an antiparallel β-sheet, with a spatial order of β1-β3-β2; the three α-helices are packed against one side of the β-sheet. Regions of the secondary structures and GXXG loops are well defined. But the variable loops within the two KH domains and the linker between the two KH domains are not. These loop regions of the molecule most likely are relatively flexible (Fig. 1C). Our previous work on crystal structures of the PCBP2 KH1 domain in complex with D/RNAs (26Du Z. Lee J.K. Tjhen R. Li S. Pan H. Stroud R.M. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38823-38830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Du Z. Lee J.K. Fenn S. Tjhen R. Stroud R.M. James T.L. RNA. 2007; 13: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that the KH1 domain could engage in KH1-KH1 homodimerization. The protein interaction interface is a large and continuous hydrophobic surface comprised of residues from the β1-strand and α3-helix. It is clear from the present structure that the KH2 domain also has a hydrophobic surface comparable to that of the KH1 domain (Fig. 3A, left and middle). The two hydrophobic surfaces of the KH1 and KH2 domains interact with each other, resulting in an intramolecular KH1-KH2 association that buries 1528 Å2 of molecular surface from the two KH domains. The buried surface area is significantly larger than the estimated minimal area of 1200 Å2 required for a stable protein-protein complex (34Chothia C. Janin J. Nature. 1975; 256: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 35Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The KH1 and KH2 domains are arranged in a head-to-toe manner. The protein-protein interaction is defined by the anti-parallel positioning of the longest α-helix (α3) and β-strand (β1) in the protein domains (Fig. 3B). A number of hydrophobic residues from these structural elements are involved in hydrophobic protein-protein interaction (Fig. 3, A and B). KH1-KH2 association also brings the two three-stranded antiparallel β-sheets of the KH domains together in such a way that a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet is formed (Fig. 1C, right). Amideamide NOEs between Arg17 and Val103, Leu19, and Arg101 were observed (28Du Z. Lee J.K. Fenn S. Tjhen R. Stroud R.M. James T.L. RNA. 2007; 13: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), characteristic of antiparallel β-strands. While hydrophobic forces are clearly the driving impetus for KH1 interaction with KH2, other factors, such as shape complementarities, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions may also play a role. There are two generic hydrogen bonds between backbone carbonyl and amide groups of the Arg17/Val103 and Arg101/Leu19 pairs of the interdomain antiparallel β-sheet. The guanidino groups of Arg17/Arg101, and the ϵ-amino group of Lys160 may mediate electrostatic interactions between the KH1 and KH2 domains (Fig. 3, A and B). Substantial interactions between the KH1 and KH2 domains show that both domains harbor a genuine protein interaction interface. Structures of type-I KH domain-D/RNA complexes (25Backe P.H.

This D/RNA binding interface is located on the molecular surface opposite the protein interaction interface. Interaction of the KH1 and KH2 domains results in placement of the two D/RNA binding interfaces of the KH1 and KH2 domains on opposite molecular surfaces in the structure of PCBP2 KH1-KH2, far from each other (Fig. 4A). Modeling of the bound D/RNA can readily be achieved by comparison with the complexes entailing a single KH domain. The 14-residue long linker (Ser84 to Pro97) between the KH1 and KH2 domains does not assume a regular secondary structure (Fig. 1C). This region of the molecule is the most ill-defined due to lack of constraints. However, chemical shifts for all of the linker residues were assigned. Indeed, residues from the linker region in general yielded stronger resonance signals than residues from the KH domains, indicating that the linker region probably experiences a higher degree of internal mobility. To characterize the backbone dynamics of the PCBP2 KH1-KH2 construct, we measured the 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 and T2) of the protein construct. The experimental T1 and T2 values for 131 residues are shown in Fig. 2. The construct contains 158 native residues including 6 prolines. T1 and T2 values for 21 other residues could not be determined due to either absence of cross-peak or spectral overlap. It is apparent that the measured T1 and T2 values indicate a rather non-uniform dynamic behavior of the protein construct. Excluding the terminal residues, there are four stretches of amino acids that show lower-than-average T1 values, corresponding to the variable loop of KH1, the linker between KH1 and KH2, the GXXG and variable loops of KH2, respectively (Fig. 2, top). Most residues from the two variable loops and the linker also show higher-than-average T2 values (Fig. 2, bottom). These data clearly indicate that the two variable loops within the KH domains and the linker region between the KH domains experience higher backbone mobility than other parts of the molecule. Residues in the linker region exhibit some of the lowest values of T1 and highest values of T2. A stretch of 10 amino acids (Ser86 to Arg95) within the linker has an average T2 value of 176 ms, doubling the average T2 value for the entire protein construct (88 ms). Overall, the relaxation data show that the linker region between the two KH domains is the most flexible part of the molecule. Within the two KH domains, the variable loop in each of the domains experiences increased internal molecular motion. Residues from the other secondary structural elements of the two KH domains in general show higher T1 and lower T2 values than the averages, indicating that these secondary structural elements are tightly packed in the individual KH domains, with reduced molecular mobility. Comparison with the Two Previous Structures of Tandem KH Domains—There are two published structures of tandem type-I KH domains: the KH3-KH4 domains of the FUSE-binding protein (FBP) in complex with single-stranded DNA (38Braddock D.T. Louis J.M. Baber J.L. Levens D. Clore G.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the KH1-KH2 domains of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (42Valverde R. Pozdnyakova I. Kajander T. Venkatraman J. Regan L. Structure. 2007; 15: 1090-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of FMRP KH1-KH2, the linker between the two domains has only one residue (Glu) separating the last α-helix of KH1 and the first β-strand of KH2 (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W1966178308,"Trehalose dimycolate (TDM), also known as cord factor, is a major surface glycolipid of the cell wall of mycobacteria. Because of its potent biological functions in models of infection, adjuvancy, and immunotherapy, it is important to determine how its biosynthesis is regulated. Here we show that glucose, a host-derived product that is not readily available in the environment, causes Mycobacterium avium to down-regulate TDM expression while up-regulating production of another major glycolipid with immunological roles in T cell activation, glucose monomycolate (GMM). In vitro, the mechanism of reciprocal regulation of TDM and GMM involves competitive substrate selection by antigen 85A. The switch from TDM to GMM biosynthesis occurs near the physiological concentration of glucose present in mammalian hosts. We further demonstrate that GMM is produced in vivo by mycobacteria growing in mouse lung. These results establish an enzymatic pathway for GMM production. More generally, these observations provide a specific enzymatic mechanism for dynamic alterations of cell wall glycolipid remodeling in response to the transition from noncellular to cellular growth environments, including factors that are monitored by the host immune system."

The level of p73 is regulated by the E3 ligase Itch. Itch levels are sharply reduced in response to DNA damage with concomitant p73 accumulation and activation. The mechanism of controlling Itch level is not known. We show that the Itch promoter is a target of the transcription activator Runx. Yes-associated protein (Yap1) is a shared transcription co-activator of Runx and p73. Under normal conditions, the Runx-Yap1 complex binds the Itch promoter and supports its transcription and p73 degradation. In response to DNA damage, Yap1 is phosphorylated by c-Abl at the position Tyr-357. The modified Yap1 does not co-activate Runx in supporting Itch transcription. The subsequent reduction in the Itch level gives rise to p73 accumulation.

For example, the level of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is regulated by a number of E3 ligases, the major one being Mdm2 (1Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K.

Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). The mode of cross-talk between the E3 ligase, as was learned from p53 and Mdm2, has a number of attributes, some with broader implications. Firstly, in this process, p53 undergoes constitutive Mdm2-dependent degradation unless p53 escapes Mdm2 interaction. A second characteristic of this pathway is that the promoter of the Mdm2 gene is a target of p53 (6Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 7Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), generating a minimal regulatory circuit whereby the substrate supports the production of its destroyer. A third characteristic of this pathway relies on the fact that Mdm2 binds the N-terminally positioned transcription activation domain of p53 (8Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar). This endows the Mdm2 E3 ligase with the capacity to regulate p53 transcription activity as well (3Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 9Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Overall, the hallmark of this regulatory circuit is that protein degradation is directly linked to transcription activation. Despite the fact that the level of other members of the p53 family, such as p73 and p63, is regulated at the level of protein stability (10Rossi M. Aqeilan R.I. Neale M. Candi E. Salomoni P. Knight R.A. Croce C.M. Melino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H. Cesareni G. Melino G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), no such simple regulatory circuit was identified for either p73 or p63. Similar to p53, the level of p73 is increased in response to DNA damage insults, possibly by escaping the cognate E3 ligases (12Tsai K.K. Yuan Z.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3418-3424PubMed Google Scholar). One of the known p73 E3 ligases is Itch, which belongs to the Nedd4-like E3 family containing a WW domain (13Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Itch, via its WW domain, binds p73 by interacting with the p73 PPPPY motif, a prerequisite step in p73 ubiquitination and sensitization to rapid proteasome-dependent degradation (11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H. Cesareni G. Melino G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the Yes-associated protein (Yap1) stabilizes p73 by competing with Itch for the binding to p73, which allows p73 to escape Itch-mediated ubiquitination (14Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was also suggested for the Nedd4-binding partner 1 (N4BP1) (15Oberst A. Malatesta M. Aqeilan R.I. Rossi M. Salomoni P. Murillas R. Sharma P. Kuehn M.R. Oren M. Croce C.M. Bernassola F. Melino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11280-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in response to DNA damage, Itch protein level is down-regulated, which gives rise to p73 stabilization (11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H. Cesareni G. Melino G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, the question of how Itch expression is regulated under normal and stress conditions was not addressed. As a transcription factor, p73 has an important role in induction of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle arrest genes following DNA damage. An important player in this process is the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl (16Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 20Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, c-Abl is activated, binds p73 via the SH3 domain, and tyrosine-phosphorylates p73 at the residue Tyr-99. Under this condition, p73 accumulates and induces expression of pro-apoptotic genes (12Tsai K.K. Yuan Z.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3418-3424PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 18Sanchez-Prieto R. Sanchez-Arevalo V.J. Servitja J.M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Abl also phosphorylates Yap1 on Tyr-357. The modified Yap1 accumulates to high levels and displays higher affinity to p73 and selectively co-activates the p73 pro-apoptotic target genes (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Yap1 binds other transcription factors, such as all the members of the Runx family. Remarkably, modified Yap1 shows an increased association with p73 but a decreased association with Runx (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this molecular logic may also regulate Itch expression. In this study, we identified a functional Runx-binding site at the Itch promoter. We show that Yap1 under normal conditions enhances the transcriptional activation of Itch via Runx and gives rise to p73 degradation. This process is blunted under DNA damage stress because of the phosphorylation-dependent promoter switching behavior of Yap1 (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage signaling, Yap1 is phosphorylated by c-Abl, and the phosphorylated Yap1 escapes the Itch promoter-associated Runx. These results provide evidence for Runx to negatively regulate p73 stability by enhancing Itch-mediated proteasomal degradation. Cells and Cell Culture—The cell lines used were HEK293 and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells, human non-small cell lung carcinoma H1299 p53-null cells, human HCT-116 p53–/– colorectal carcinoma cells (22Bunz F.

Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), and the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5.6% CO2. H1299 cells were cultured under the same conditions with RPMI medium. Plasmids and Transfection—Overexpression of p73 was achieved by transfection of pSG5-HA-p73α and pEFIRES FLAG-p73α. FLAG pCMV-FLAG-Yap1 was a gift from M. Sudol. pCDNA FLAG wild type, Y357F, and Y357E Yap1 were previously described in Ref. 21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol.

To generate Runx and Itch shRNA plasmids, the pSUPER vector was ligated with annealed oligonucleotides, containing a 19-nucleotide sequence derived from the human Runx transcript (CGCACTGGCGCTGCAACAT), which down-regulates all Runx family members, or from the human Itch transcript (CCAGATCACCTGAAATATT), a 9-nucleotide spacer and the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. The Itch promoter was produced by PCR using genomic DNA from HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells after sonication. Primer sequences for production of the promoter were 5′-ATCCCATCCGCACTCCACC-3′ and 5′-AGGCCTCCGGAAGCCTGTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the SacI and XhoI sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Luciferase Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA in each dish was kept constant by the addition of empty vector wherever necessary. Cell extracts were prepared 36 h later and subjected to determination of luciferase activity using the Lucy3 luminometer (Anthos) as described in Ref. 23Lubelsky Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell.

The sequences of the primers used were 5′-CCTTACGTAGAGGTCACAGTAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCAAGCTGCAAAGTCAC-3′ for Itch and 5′-ACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAG and 5′-CCATCTCGTTCTCGAAGTCCA-3′ for β-actin. Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed according to the protocol of Ainbinder et al. (24Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, formaldehyde cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were precipitated by incubation overnight with the indicated antibodies or with Protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) for negative control. Precipitated DNA fragments were extracted with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) as described (25Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and amplified by PCR or Real-Time PCR (LightCycler 480, Roche Applied Science) with specific primers. The sequences of the primers used were 5′-TGATTTACCACCGCAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-TCCCTCTCCCGAGAACTGC-3′ for the Itch promoter when analyzed in semiquantitative PCR and 5′-CTCAGGCGCCTGCGCTTTAGCTGCT-3′ and 5′-CGACTCCTCAGTCCCTAGACTAAGATG-3′ for the Itch promoter when analyzed by Real-time PCR. Inspection of the sequence of the Itch promoter revealed a consensus TGTGGT-binding site for the transcription factor Runx (26Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) located between positions 28 and 33 upstream of its first exon and the Itch transcription start site (Fig. 1A). The genomic region between positions +291 and –742 of the Itch promoter containing the putative Runx-binding site was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene to evaluate the effect of Runx on the Itch promoter activity. H1299 and HEK293 cells were transfected with the Itch-Luc reporter plasmid together with an increasing amount of Runx. Runx activated the Itch promoter reporter plasmid in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). Next we examined the effect of overexpressed Runx on the endogenous Itch promoter. Cells were transfected with Runx, and the level of Itch mRNA transcript was analyzed by RT-PCR. Remarkably, Runx was sufficient to support Itch expression (Fig. 1D). To demonstrate that endogenous Runx binds the endogenous Itch promoter at the predicted site, we performed ChIP analysis by immunoprecipitating DNA cross-linked protein complexes from HEK293T cells either with specific anti-Runx or with a control antibody. The ChIP analysis revealed that Runx is associated with the Itch promoter at the predicted site (Fig. 1E). Since Yap1 is a known transcription modulator of Runx (27Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), we next asked whether Yap1 regulates Itch activation by Runx. ChIP analysis in HEK293T cells revealed that endogenous Yap1 is associated with the Itch promoter at the region that binds Runx (Fig. 2A). We then analyzed the effect of overexpressed Yap1 and Runx on endogenous levels of Itch mRNA (Fig. 2B). As expected, the level of endogenous Itch transcript was elevated by the transfected Runx. Interestingly, the level of Itch mRNA was also increased by Yap1 alone and had an additive effect when both Runx and Yap1 were overexpressed. The effect of Yap1 alone is likely to be mediated via the endogenous Runx. Similar results were obtained in the context of the Itch-Luciferase reporter plasmid. Overexpression of Runx and Yap1 each increased the luciferase activity of the Itch promoter, which was further augmented when both proteins were overexpressed together (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data show that Yap1 enhances the transcriptional activation of Itch by Runx. Given the fact that Itch induces p73 degradation (11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H. Cesareni G. Melino G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we predicted that the obtained increased expression of Itch by Runx would result in p73 destabilization. To challenge this hypothesis, HEK293 cells were transfected with p73 alone or in combination with Runx. Runx overexpression resulted in a dramatic reduction in p73 protein level (Fig. 3A). Moreover, endogenous p73 was decreased by Runx overexpression in H1299 cells (Fig. 3B), or conversely, induced by specific Runx shRNA in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3C). To examine the possibility that the Runx-mediated decrease in the p73 protein level is the result of increased p73 degradation, we measured p73 protein half-life in the presence and absence of co-transfected Runx. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with p73 either alone or together with Runx. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. Whole cell lysates were prepared at different time points and subjected to immunoblotting with the anti-HA antibody. This experiment revealed that overexpression of Runx dramatically decreases the half-life of the transfected p73 (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained in HCT-116 p53–/– where the level of the endogenous p73 was monitored (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, and in accord with a previous report (17Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), the endogenous p73 half-life is much shorter than the overexpressed one. In a reciprocal approach, knocking down of endogenous Runx by a specific shRNA resulted in a prolonged endogenous p73 protein level in a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 3F). Next we checked whether p73 destabilization by Runx occurs via the Itch-p73 protein degradation pathway (11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H. Cesareni G. Melino G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To this end, we knocked down endogenous Itch expression by co-expressing a control or a plasmid encoding an Itch-specific shRNA. Runx-dependent decrease in the endogenous p73 protein level was diminished when Itch expression was knocked down (Fig. 3G), suggesting that Runx-mediated p73 degradation is Itch-dependent. In a reciprocal experiment, we knocked down the endogenous Runx and measured the level of the endogenous Itch and p73 proteins. Runx knock down resulted in a down-regulation of Itch and accumulation of the endogenous p73 both in H1299 and in HCT-116 cell lines (Fig. 3H). Thus, activation of Itch by Runx gives rise to enhanced degradation of p73. Next we investigated the molecular mechanism of activation of Itch by Runx and Yap1 under DNA damage. We have previously shown that induction of DNA damage by cisplatin or γ irradiation (IR) gives rise to Yap1 phosphorylation on the Tyr-357 residue (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Yap1 shows high affinity to p73 but low affinity to Runx. Thus, it is very likely that the observed activation of Itch transcription by the Runx-Yap1 complex is compromised under DNA damage insults. To challenge this prediction, we first measured Runx-Yap1 physical interaction under DNA damage. HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-Yap1 and Runx, and co-immunoprecipitation was performed before and after exposure to IR. Interestingly, the level of Yap1-Runx complex was dramatically reduced after DNA damage stress (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained when the levels of the endogenous proteins were measured (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that in response to DNA damage, Yap1 escapes Runx. Next we asked whether under this condition Yap1 is in association with the Itch promoter. ChIP analysis revealed that in two different cell lines, HEK293T (Fig. 4C) and MCF-7 (Fig. 4D), the endogenous Yap1 bound the Itch promoter. However, in response to IR, the amount of Yap1 in association with the Itch promoter was reduced by over 6-fold. These results suggest that in response to DNA damage, Yap1 is no longer functional in supporting Itch gene expression. Itch protein level is down-regulated in response to DNA damage (11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H. Cesareni G. Melino G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is not known. The results of the ChIP assay, demonstrating that Yap1 dissociated from the Itch promoter following DNA damage, suggested that the reduction in Itch level following DNA damage may be due to loss of Yap1 co-activation and a reduction in transcription of the Itch gene. To test this possibility, we checked the effect of cisplatin on the Itch mRNA level. Interestingly, the level of Itch mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR, was dramatically decreased after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the reduction in Itch protein after DNA damage is due to a reduction in transcription. As shown above, DNA damage reduced the association of Yap1 with Runx (Fig. 4). Our previous work has shown that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Yap1 by c-Abl prevents its association with Runx (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction in Runx-mediated transcription of Itch following DNA damage is likely to be due to the dissociation of phosphorylated Yap1 from Runx. Therefore, an immediate prediction is that inhibition of c-Abl would improve Itch transcription. In HEK293T IR-treated cells, knockdown of the endogenous c-Abl by expressing c-Abl-specific shRNA resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in the level of the endogenous Itch mRNA, as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 5B). To test whether the kinase activity of c-Abl is involved in this process, we utilized STI-571, the c-Abl-specific kinase inhibitor (28Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). The level of the endogenous Itch mRNA was increased by ∼3-fold in the presence of STI-571 (Fig. 5B). Thus, the kinase activity of c-Abl negatively regulates Itch expression. These results predict that under DNA damage, phosphorylated Yap1 at Tyr-357 is poorly associated with the Itch promoter. We used ChIP analysis to test this prediction. ChIP analysis revealed that both endogenous Runx and endogenous Yap1 are in association with the Itch promoter prior to cisplatin treatment in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5C). However, after cisplatin treatment, whereas Runx binding to the Itch promoter was not affected, Yap1 was no longer detected. Remarkably, however, Yap1 binding to the Itch promoter was at least partially resumed when cells were treated with STI-571 to inhibit c-Abl kinase activity. These results suggest that the modified Yap1 no longer binds and co-activates Runx, the Itch promoter activator. To confirm this conclusion, we tested the effect of different Yap1 mutants at the Tyr-357 residue on the recruitment to the Itch promoter by ChIP analysis (Fig. 5D). As expected, in response to cisplatin treatment, both wild type Yap1, which is phosphorylated in response to cisplatin treatment, and the phospho-mimetic Y357E Yap1 mutant are not associated with the Itch promoter. In sharp contrast, the Y357F mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by c-Abl (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), is associated. To confirm this conclusion, we next tested the effect of different Yap1 constructs on transcription of the endogenous Itch in the presence of Runx (Fig. 5E). As expected, both wild type and Y357F Yap1 augmented Itch mRNA expression, whereas the phospho-mimetic Y357E Yap1 did not. This observation was also tested under DNA damage conditions. Overexpression of Runx and Yap1 in the presence of cisplatin resulted in reduction of Itch mRNA, which was completely restored after the addition of the c-Abl kinase inhibitor STI-571 (Fig. 5F). These results suggest that the modified Yap1 at Tyr-357 escapes the Itch promoter, and as a result, Itch transcription is down-regulated. In this study, we provide evidence for the Itch promoter to be a novel target of Runx. This conclusion is based on the following findings. Firstly, the Itch promoter reporter plasmid was transcriptionally induced by overexpression of Runx. Secondly, overexpressed Runx stimulated the transcription activation of the resident Itch promoter. Thirdly, ChIP analysis revealed that Runx bound the endogenous Itch promoter. Finally, Yap1, a known transcription co-activator of Runx (27Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), augmented the Runx-mediated Itch promoter activation. Although Runx1 is the only family member that was tested, at this stage, we do not discriminate between the different Runx paralogs (Runx2 and Runx3) since they all appear to be functional in this process (data not shown). It has been documented that c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is increased in response to DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation or by drugs, such as cisplatin (reviewed in Ref. 19Shaul Y. Ben-Yehoyada M. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At least two relevant substrates, p73 and Yap1, then undergo tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Abl (16Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 17Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.

Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Unlike the naive Yap1, the modified Yap1 does not bind Runx and does not co-activate Itch and possibly other Runx target genes. We found this process to be responsible for diminished Itch transcription and the consequent p73 accumulation. Our data demonstrate that the transcription induction of Itch by Runx as a transcription activator and Yap1 as a transcription co-activator is of functional significance. We show that induction of the endogenous Itch transcription by overexpression of Runx augments p73 degradation, and conversely, knockdown of Runx induces p73 accumulation. Significantly, this regulatory circuit is down-regulated in response to DNA damage, when there is a demand for p73 accumulation and activation of the pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax (16Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 20Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

However, in other systems, Yap1 overexpression induces anti-apoptotic genes and supports cell proliferation and oncogenesis (30Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J.

Our findings provide an explanation to the observed double-edged sword activity of Yap1. Yap1 acts via Runx to down-regulate p73 and its pro-apoptotic function, but in response to DNA damage, Yap1, by undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation, plays an opposite role of co-activating p73. Thus, our finding that c-Abl helps determine which transcription factor Yap1 will co-activate is an important step in understanding the various aspects of Yap1 activity. Previously, we have reported on another mechanism of p73 accumulation by Yap1 (14Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Yap1 directly binds p73 at the region that Itch binds to polyubiquitinate p73. Under DNA damage stress, Yap1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Abl and accumulates to high levels. The accumulated Yap1 in turn is effective in competing with Itch for binding to p73 to allow p73 to escape degradation. Here we describe a mechanism whereby Runx plays an important role in destabilizing p73. Yap1 increases Itch expression and p73 degradation via co-activation of Itch promoter-associated Runx. Paradoxically, Yap1 may increase p73 level by inhibiting Itch-p73 complex formation (14Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5F). This paradoxical behavior is resolved by c-Abl. c-Abl is activated in response to DNA damage and tyrosine-phosphorylates p73 (16Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 17Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and Yap1 (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The modified Yap1 loses its interaction with Runx but increases its interaction with p73 (21Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Under DNA damage stress, therefore, the circuit is shifted toward p73 accumulation by negating Itch expression and eliminating Itch-p73 complex formation. At the moment, the question of how this process is terminated is open, but a number of models can be proposed. The most trivial one is the involvement of tyrosine phosphatases that would inactivate c-Abl and dephosphorylate Yap1. Itch, the HECT E3 ligase, has a number of other important substrates such as Notch (33Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) c-FLIP (34Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and c-Jun and Jun-B. The latter proteins are important regulators of the immune response (35Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 36Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Jun escapes Itch by a mechanism that involves c-Abl. c-Abl directly modifies c-Jun at the region that blocks c-Jun-Itch interaction (37Gao B. Lee S.M. Fang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29711-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and this process eliminates c-Jun ubiquitination and degradation in T cells. Our finding that c-Abl also down-regulates Itch expression provides another and a complementary explanation for c-Jun stabilization. Furthermore, it has been reported that c-Jun supports Yap1 expression (38Danovi S.A. Rossi M. Gudmundsdottir K. Yuan M. Melino G. Basu S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, under the regulatory circuit described here, the stabilized c-Jun is likely to further support Yap1 accumulation. Although p73 and p53 share a significant structural and functional homology, the molecular circuits regulating their stabilization are substantially different (39Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). Each has its own unique E3 ligase. Although Mdm2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase of p53 (3Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar), binds to p73, it does not promote p73 degradation (40Balint E. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Itch, the p73 E3 ligase, does not bind p53 (11Rossi M. De Laurenzi V. Munarriz E. Green D.R. Liu Y.C. Vousden K.H.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), but Itch gene expression appears not to be p53/p73-responsive, although at the moment, we cannot unequivocally exclude this possibility. Notably, it has been shown that Runx1 and -2 are possible targets of p63 (42Yang A. Zhu Z. Kapranov P. McKeon F. Church G.M. Gingeras T.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and presumably of p73, generating a direct feedback loop between Runx and p73. The cross-talk between p73 and Itch is mediated by a few other components (Fig. 5G). These differences are substantial, and each is predicted to generate a unique output. The p73-Itch regulatory circuit permits a fine-tuning regulation mechanism controlled by c-Abl as a rheostat, with minimal oscillated output. This is not the case with the p53-Mdm2 loop, which acts as a binary switch, giving rise to an oscillating pulse mode of outputs (43Lahav G. Rosenfeld N. Sigal A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Levine A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1976735484,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. Familial aggregation of cardiovascular risk factors is a frequent finding, but genetic factors affecting its presentation are still poorly understood. The calpain 10 gene (CAPN10) has been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), a complex metabolic disorder with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the CAPN10 gene has been associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in T2DM and in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this work, we have analysed whether the polymorphisms UCSNP44, -43, -19 and -63 are related to several cardiovascular risk factors in the context of MS. Molecular analysis of CAPN10 gene was performed in 899 individuals randomly chosen from a cross-sectional population-based epidemiological survey. We have found that CAPN10 gene in our population is mainly associated with two indicators of the presence of insulin resistance: glucose levels two hours after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and HOMA values, although cholesterol levels and blood pressure values are also influenced by CAPN10 variants. In addition, the 1221/1121 haplogenotype is under-represented in individuals that fulfil the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) diagnostic criteria for MS. Our results suggest that CAPN10 gene is associated with insulin resistance phenotypes in the Spanish population."
https://openalex.org/W2043390112,"EDTA has become a major organic pollutant in the environment because of its extreme usage and resistance to biodegradation. Recently, two critical enzymes, EDTA monooxygenase (EmoA) and NADH:FMN oxidoreductase (EmoB), belonging to the newly established two-component flavin-diffusible monooxygenase family, were identified in the EDTA degradation pathway in Mesorhizobium sp. BNC1. EmoA is an FMNH2-dependent enzyme that requires EmoB to provide FMNH2 for the conversion of EDTA to ethylenediaminediacetate. To understand the molecular basis of this FMN-mediated reaction, the crystal structures of the apo-form, FMN.FMN complex, and FMN.NADH complex of EmoB were determined at 2.5 angstroms resolution. The structure of EmoB is a homotetramer consisting of four alpha/beta-single-domain monomers of five parallel beta-strands flanked by five alpha-helices, which is quite different from those of other known two-component flavin-diffusible monooxygenase family members, such as PheA2 and HpaC, in terms of both tertiary and quaternary structures. For the first time, the crystal structures of both the FMN.FMN and FMN.NADH complexes of an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase were determined. Two stacked isoalloxazine rings and nicotinamide/isoalloxazine rings were at a proper distance for hydride transfer. The structures indicated a ping-pong reaction mechanism, which was confirmed by activity assays. Thus, the structural data offer detailed mechanistic information for hydride transfer between NADH to an enzyme-bound FMN and between the bound FMNH2 and a diffusible FMN."
https://openalex.org/W2090422278,"Glaucoma is defined as a chronic and progressive optic nerve neuropathy, characterized by apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) that leads to irreversible blindness. Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor, but in glaucoma RGC death can persist after ocular hypertension is normalized. To understand the mechanism underlying chronic RGC death we identified and characterized a gene product, alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M), whose expression is up-regulated early in ocular hypertension and remains up-regulated long after ocular hypertension is normalized. In ocular hypertension retinal glia up-regulate alpha2M, which binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 receptors in RGCs, and is neurotoxic in a paracrine fashion. Neutralization of alpha2M delayed RGC loss during ocular hypertension; whereas delivery of alpha2M to normal eyes caused progressive apoptosis of RGC mimicking glaucoma without ocular hypertension. This work adds to our understanding of the pathology and molecular mechanisms of glaucoma, and illustrates emerging paradigms for studying chronic neurodegeneration in glaucoma and perhaps other disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2144651134,"The GAL genes, which encode the enzymes required for normal galactose metabolism in yeast, are transcriptionally regulated by three proteins: Gal4p, an activator; Gal80p, an inhibitor; and Gal3p, a galactose sensor. These proteins control the switch between inert and active gene expression. The transcriptional activation function of Gal4p is rendered inactive in the presence of Gal80p. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of a complex between the acidic activation domain of Gal4p and Gal80p. The transactivation domain initiates with an extended region of polypeptide chain followed by two turns of an amphipathic α-helix. It fits into and across a deep cleft within the Gal80p dimer with the protein-protein interface defined primarily by hydrophobic interactions. A disordered loop in the apo-Gal80p structure (Asp-309 to Ser-316) becomes well-defined upon binding of the transactivation domain.

This investigation provides a new molecular scaffold for understanding previous biochemical and genetic studies. In yeast, the GAL genes encode the enzymes of the Leloir pathway, which are required for the conversion of galactose into a metabolically useful form, glucose 6-phosphate (1Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The regulation of these genes in response to the organism being challenged with galactose has served as a research paradigm for eukaryotic transcriptional control for over 50 years (1Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Traven A. Jelicic B. Sopta M.

Three key protein components form the GAL regulatory switch: a transcriptional activator, Gal4p; a transcriptional inhibitor, Gal80p; and an inducer, Gal3p. When yeast cells are grown in the absence of galactose, the GAL genes are, for the most part, transcriptionally inert. Under these conditions, Gal4p is produced in the cell and is tethered upstream of the GAL genes (6Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), but its activity is inhibited by its interaction with Gal80p (7Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When galactose is available as a carbon source, the GAL genes are transcribed, both rapidly and to a high level (8Yarger J.G. Halvorson H.O. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1984; 61: 173-182PubMed Google Scholar). Although the presence of galactose within the cell triggers the activation of Gal4p, neither Gal4p nor Gal80p function as the galactose sensor. Instead, Gal3p serves in this capacity by binding both galactose and ATP and adopting the conformation required for its interaction with Gal80p (1Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Zenke F.T. Engles R. Vollenbroich V. Meyer J. Hollenberg C.P. Breunig K.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The net result of this interaction is that Gal4p becomes active, and transcription of the GAL genes proceeds. Gal4p is a large protein of 881 amino acids with the first ∼100 residues functioning in DNA recognition and dimerization. The last C-terminal residues serve as an acidic transactivation domain (TAD) 3The abbreviations used are: TAD, transactivation domain; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; R.M.S.D., root mean square deviation. that is required, ultimately, for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription (10Ptashne M. Gann A. Genes and Signals. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2002Google Scholar). The amino acid residues comprising the TAD also provide the binding platform for Gal80p (11Lue N.F. Chasman D.I. Buchman A.R. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Both Gal3p and Gal80p are smaller proteins containing ∼520 and ∼450 amino acids, respectively. Until very recently, the only three-dimensional structural information available for any of these key regulatory components of the GAL genetic switch was that of an N-terminal 65-residue fragment of Gal4p bound to DNA (13Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and the dimerization domain of the same protein (residues 50-106) (14Hidalgo P. Ansari A.Z. Schmidt P. Hare B. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Shin E.J. Ptashne M. Wagner G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Through the efforts of our laboratories, however, we now have an excellent homology model for Gal3p based on the structure of the highly similar galactokinase enzyme Gal1p (15Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36905-36911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of Gal80p from Kluyveromyces lactis to 2.1-Å resolution (16Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1534-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the overall architecture of Gal80p is similar to that of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, an enzyme in the sorbitol-gluconate pathway (17Kingston R.L. Scopes R.K. Baker E.N. Structure. 1996; 4: 1413-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). From our combined biochemical and structural studies, we have shown that the K. lactis Gal80p is a dimer with an extensive subunit-subunit interface that buries a total surface area of ∼4400 Å2. Each subunit of the dimeric protein adopts a two-domain architecture with the N-terminal motif containing a classical Rossmann fold and the C-terminal domain dominated by a nine-stranded mixed β-sheet. A pronounced cleft separates the two domains, and on the basis of past mutational studies (18Melcher K. Genetics. 2005; 171: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Pilauri V. Bewley M. Diep C.Q. Hopper J.E. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we postulated in our initial studies that this cleft represents the binding site for the Gal4p TAD. Additionally, in the initial structural analysis of the K. lactis Gal80p, two short loop regions (Asp-245 to Gly-248 and Asp-309 to Ser-316) and two larger regions (Gly-328 to Glu-362 and Leu-394 to Lys-413) were shown to be disordered (16Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1534-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One of these loops, Asp-309 to Ser-316, was situated near the proposed Gal4p binding site. Here, we present the crystal structure of K. lactis Gal80p bound to a peptide that mimics the Gal4p TAD. This study provides a molecular model for understanding the biochemical characteristics of the GAL genetic switch, which, to date, is the best understood system for eukaryotic transcriptional control. X-ray Structural Analysis—The K. lactis Gal80p was cloned, overexpressed, and purified according to previously published procedures (16Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1534-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein utilized for crystallization contained a His tag at the C terminus with the following sequence: LEHHHHHH. Crystals of Gal80p in complex with a 22-mer of the following sequence, TQQLFNTTTMDDVYNYIFDNDE, representing amino acids Thr-844 to Glu-865 of the K. lactis Gal4p TAD (See Fig. 1A), were grown from 20-25% (w/v) pentaerythritol propoxylate 5/4 and 100 mm MES (pH 6.5) via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. They belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 101.1 Å, b = 160.5 Å, c = 132.6, β = 94.7° and eight subunits (or four dimers) in the asymmetric unit. X-ray data from flashed-cooled crystals were collected at the Structural Biology Center Beamline 19-ID to 3.0-Å resolution (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois). These data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of the Gal4p TAD-Gal80p complex was solved by molecular replacement with the software package Phaser (21McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14746) Google Scholar) and using the apo-Gal80p model as the search probe. The electron densities for the eight monomers in the asymmetric unit were averaged with the software package DM (22Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). On the basis of this averaged map, a model for the complex was manually adjusted using Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). At this stage, the peptide was not built into the model, although there was clear electron density for it. The model constructed on the basis of this “averaged” electron density map was placed back into the asymmetric unit in all eight positions and refined with the program TNT (24Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar) using NCS symmetry restraints. After refinement, the electron density map calculated with 2Fo-Fc coefficients was once again averaged, and in this averaged map, the position of the peptide was immediately obvious as was the ordering of the Asp-309/Ser-316 loop. The peptide was then built into the “averaged” electron density. This model, now with bound peptide, was placed back into the eight equivalent positions in the asymmetric unit and manually adjusted with Coot. Subsequent NCS-restrained least-squares refinement of the Gal4p TAD-Gal80p model resulted in an overall R-factor of 23.1% using all x-ray data from 30 to 3.0 Å resolution (R-free of 28.9%).

There was none in the disallowed region. The discussion of the TAD-binding pocket presented below refers to the model built on the basis of the averaged electron density map. Mobility Shift Assay—Reaction mixes (10 μl) containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% w/v glycerol, 10 μm ZnSO4, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 pm 32P-labeled stranded oligonucleotide probe (5′-GATCCCGGGAAGCGCTTCCCGAATT-3′; representing a single Gal4p-binding site), and the indicated proteins (Gal4p(1-93 + 768-881), 1.9 μm; Gal4p(66-93 + 850-881), 0.9-8 μm; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal80p, 1.3 μm; K. lactis Gal80p, 1.7 μm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to electrophoresis through a pre-run 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE, 1% v/v glycerol for 90 min at 150 V. Gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Peptides were synthesized by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Each was dissolved at a final concentration of 14 mg/ml and used in the mobility shift assays at final concentrations of 40-400 μm. To define a minimal peptide from the sequence of the K. lactis Gal4p that is capable of interacting with Gal80p and that might be useful in a structural analysis, we performed a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays using labeled DNA encompassing a single Gal4p-binding site (Fig. 1). The addition of Gal80p to the Gal4p-DNA complex resulted in the formation of a supershifted complex. The presence of this slower migrating complex could be inhibited by versions of Gal4p that were capable of interacting with Gal80p but did not possess a competent DNA binding domain, e.g. a fusion protein composed of amino acids 66-93 + 850-881 of the S. cerevisiae Gal4p sequence (Fig. 1C, lanes 19-21). The ability of peptides to out-compete the Gal4p-Gal80p complex, resulting in a complex composed of DNA and Gal4p alone, was measured. Peptides ending at the C terminus of the K. lactis Gal4p and composed of 21 or more amino acids were found to be capable of interacting with Gal80p in this assay. Shorter peptides, e.g. a 16-mer encompassing residues Thr-850 to Glu-865, were found to be incapable of competitively displacing Gal80p from Gal4p (Fig. 1C, lanes 7-9). We therefore attempted to crystallize Gal80p from K. lactis in the presence of either the 21-mer or the 22-mer peptide. Suitably diffracting crystals were subsequently obtained with the 22-mer peptide. These crystals belonged to the space group P21 and contained eight subunits in the asymmetric unit. The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a nominal resolution of 3.0 Å. Electron densities corresponding to the TAD peptides were visible in all eight subunits in the initial maps. To further improve the quality of the protein phases, the electron densities for the eight monomers were averaged with the software package DM (22Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Unbiased electron density corresponding to the TAD peptide as observed in this “averaged” electron density map is presented in Fig. 2A. Although a 22-mer was utilized in the crystallization trials, only 14 residues of the Gal4p TAD were visible. Given the shapes of the side chain densities as well as their surrounding chemical environments, the observed peptide corresponds to Leu-847 through Ile-860 of the KlGal4p sequence (Fig. 1A). A surface representation of the Gal4p TAD-Gal80p complex is presented in Fig. 3A. Like that observed for the apo-Gal80p structure, the complex crystallizes as a tight dimer with overall dimensions of ∼55 × 75 × 110 Å. The large mixed β-sheets found in the C-terminal domains of the Gal80p subunits provide extensive subunit-subunit interactions. The two Gal4p TAD peptides bind on the same side of the dimer with their N-terminal ends separated by ∼24 Å and their C-terminal ends situated ∼55 Å apart. As displayed in Fig. 3B, the Gal4p peptide adopts a partial helical conformation that binds into, and across, the pronounced cleft that separates the N- and C-terminal domains of Gal80p. A total of 750 Å2 of surface area for the peptide is buried upon binding to Gal80p, which represents ∼40% of its total. The loop within Gal80p, formed by Asp-309 to Ser-316, that was previously unresolved (16Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1534-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) becomes ordered upon peptide binding, and the backbone density for Asp-245 to Gly-248 becomes better defined. With the exception of these two regions, however, the apo- and peptide-bound forms of the K. lactis Gal80p are exceedingly similar such that their α-carbons superimpose with an R.M.S.D. of ∼1.2 Å. A close-up stereo view of the Gal80p TAD binding site is presented in Fig. 2B. As can be seen, the side chain of Phe-848 resides in a hydrophobic patch formed by Val-319 and Val-368 and participates in a stacking interaction with the side chain of His-370. The backbone carbonyl group of Asn-849 appears to play a role in the ordering of the Asp-309/Ser-316 loop by interacting with the side chain of Asn-317. Additionally, the side chain of Thr-850 possibly interacts with the side chain of Asp-309, again helping to order the Asp-309/Ser-316 loop. There are hydrophobic interactions between Gal80p and the Gal4p TAD that most likely function in reducing the flexibility of the Asp-309/Ser-316 loop, namely those formed by the side chains of Val-856 and Tyr-857 with Trp-185 and Phe-312. The side chains of Asp-854, Asp-855, and Asn-858 project away from the Gal80p cleft, whereas the side chains of Met-853 and Tyr-857 participate in an intramolecular stacking interaction. Finally, the side chain of Tyr-859, covered on one side by Lys-34 and on the other by Val-377, forms a T-shaped stacking interaction with Trp-31. With the exception of Trp-31, the C-terminal domain contributes all of the Gal80p residues involved in TAD recognition. Gal80p has a similar molecular structure to that described for glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from Z. mobilis (17Kingston R.L. Scopes R.K. Baker E.N. Structure. 1996; 4: 1413-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This enzyme contains a tightly bound NADP+, which is required for the reduction of fructose to sorbitol with the concomitant oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone. Given that the K. lactis Gal80p has been shown to associate with dinucleotides, 4Dr. Karin D. Breunig, personal communication. we attempted to crystallize it in the presence of NADP+, NADPH, NAD+, or NADH, but have thus far been unsuccessful. Recently, however, the structure of Gal80p from S. cerevisiae was reported in complex with NAD+ and a 9-mer representing the TAD of S. cerevisiae Gal4p (25Kumar P.R. Yu Y. Sternglanz R. Johnston S.A. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2008; 319: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both the K. lactis and S. cerevisiae versions of Gal80p are dimers, and they share a high degree of structural homology (an R.M.S.D. of ∼2.1 Å for 344 α-carbons per subunit) as would be expected from their amino acid sequence similarities (58% amino acid identity and 82% similarity over their entire length). Importantly, however, these two proteins appear to bind the Gal4p TADs in completely different orientations, which may be a function of NAD binding to the S. cerevisiae Gal80p (Fig. 4). In the S. cerevisiae Gal4p TAD-NAD-Gal80p complex, the peptide reportedly interacts with the nicotinamide portion of the dinucleotide (25Kumar P.R. Yu Y. Sternglanz R. Johnston S.A. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2008; 319: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas in K. lactis Gal80p, the Gal4p peptide is situated away from the Rossmann fold. Additionally, in the K. lactis Gal80p, the Asp-309/Ser-316 loop moves toward where the cofactor is located in the S. cerevisiae Gal80p model with Glu-314 from the loop projecting near the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the equivalent Asp-309/Ser-316 loop in the S. cerevisiae Gal80p is still disordered even in the presence of the 9-mer. In the structural analysis of the S. cerevisiae Gal4p TAD-NAD-Gal80p complex, the side chain densities for the 9-mer were not well-defined. As such, it is not possible to highlight in this report the detailed differences in protein-protein interactions observed between the S. cerevisiae and K. lactis Gal4p TAD-Gal80p complexes. The Gal4p TAD is regarded as an archetypal example of an acidic transactivation domain. In addition, nine amino acids of the Gal4p TAD (corresponding to residues 862-870 of the S. cerevisiae Gal4p, DDVYNYLFD) have been identified as a common sequence motif defining the transactivation domain in a variety of proteins from yeast, animal, and viruses (26Piskacek S. Gregor M. Nemethova M. Grabner M. Kovarik P. Piskacek M. Genomics. 2007; 89: 756-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This sequence represents the last seven amino acids of the peptide in our structure (Asp-854 to Ile-860 of the K. lactis Gal4p TAD). It can thus be suggested that archetypal TADs adopt helical conformations in which the acidic side chains are predominantly located on one surface and the hydrophobic residues on another. Acidic RNA pol II transactivation domains invariably contain a preponderance of both acidic and bulky hydrophobic amino acids (27Mapp A.K. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Dervan P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the absence of binding partners, TADs generally do not possess well-defined secondary structures. However, they have been observed to adopt secondary structure on interaction with other proteins, either proteins that inhibit their function or proteins that they interact with as part of the activation process (28Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar, 29Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Previously, activation domain 1 (amino acids 15-29) of p53 was solved in the presence of the inhibitor MDM2 (28Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar) and activation domain 2 of the same protein (amino acids 45-58) solved as a complex with a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH (30Di Lello P. Jenkins L.M. Jones T.N. Nguyen B.D. Hara T. Yamaguchi H. Dikeakos J.D. Appella E. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structures of these activation domains with the Gal4p TAD is shown in Fig. 5. Additional structural information is known for the E1A TAD in complex with Rb (31Liu X. Marmorstein R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2711-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and for the CREB activation domain bound to the KIX domain of CBP (32Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The predominant feature of each of these short TADs is an α-helix, which is approximately amphipathic. However, the length of the helix functioning as a TAD is different in each case, as is the extent of the amphipathic character. Prior to the recent structural analyses of the Gal4p TAD-Gal80p complexes from both K. lactis and S. cerevisiae, the C-terminal region of the S. cerevisiae Gal4p was extensively studied by mutagenic analysis (33Ansari A.Z. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each residue within the Gal4p region between Met-855 and Asp-870 (Fig. 1A) was mutated to a cysteine, and the effects of these changes were monitored both in terms of the ability of the protein to activate transcription and on the ability of the protein to interact with Gal80p. Most single point mutations within this region demonstrated little impact on the ability of Gal4p to activate transcription. However, specific point mutations within Gal4p (e.g. mutations at Phe-856, Thr-859, and Met-861) rendered the protein incapable of interacting with Gal80p (33Ansari A.Z. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These amino acids correspond to Phe-848, Thr-851, and Met-853 in the K. lactis Gal4p TAD sequence. As indicated previously, Phe-848 participates in a series of hydrophobic interactions with Gal80p residues Val-319, Val-368, and His-370. Replacement with a cysteine residue would create a substantial hole in this region. The side chain hydroxyl of Thr-851 is located near the backbone nitrogen of Asn-317 within Gal80p. Its replacement with a cysteine would result in the loss of a potential hydrogen bond that might be critically important in reducing the flexibility of the Asp-309/Ser-316 loop. Finally, Met-853 is deeply buried within the Gal80p cleft and surrounded by the side chains of Trp-185 and Phe-312. Again, the replacement of this residue with a cysteine would create a destabilizing hole in the binding cleft between the peptide and Gal80p. Given that the K. lactis Gal80p reportedly binds dinucleotides, we modeled NAD into our complex structure, based on its location described by Kumar et al. (25Kumar P.R. Yu Y. Sternglanz R. Johnston S.A. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2008; 319: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to examine what types of interactions might occur between the ligand and the Gal4p TAD (Fig. 6). Notably, in the model the side chain of Trp-31 from the Rossmann fold domain forms a stacking interaction with both the peptide (Tyr-859) and the nicotinamide ring of the dinucleotide suggesting a possible route of communication between the two binding sites. Furthermore, it is possible that the unobserved residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide used for this study interact with the NAD in vivo or in the absence of NAD, fold into the dinucleotide binding cleft. What is the purpose of dinucleotide binding to Gal80p? Kumar et al. (25Kumar P.R. Yu Y. Sternglanz R. Johnston S.A. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2008; 319: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have clearly shown the presence of NAD within the structure of the S. cerevisiae Gal80p. They also demonstrate, however, that NAD has no effect on the formation of the Gal4p TAD-Gal80p complex using a pull-down assay. Instead, the presence of NADP has been suggested to be refractory to the formation of this complex. The K. lactis Gal80p has also been shown to associate with dinucleotides, but again it is uncertain as to the physiological role that the dinucleotide plays with respect to either the function of Gal80p or its complex with the Gal4p TAD. It is apparent, however, that Gal80p evolved from an oxidoreductase enzyme (16Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1534-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether Gal80p has simply retained the ability to interact with dinucleotides as part of this evolutionary process or rather dinucleotides play critical roles in the regulation of GAL gene expression is unclear at the present time. What is undeniable in the case of the K. lactis Gal80p, however, is that dinucleotides are not required for Gal4p TAD binding as evidenced by our crystal structure. Taken together, the results described here demonstrate that an archetypal acidic transactivation domain adopts a predominantly helical conformation that is amphipathic in nature. In addition to defining the conformation of the K. lactis Gal4p TAD, our model of the complex suggests that the binding of a dinucleotide to Gal80p, if indeed it is physiologically relevant, need not necessarily preclude the interaction of Gal80p with Gal4p.

It is a type I membrane glycoprotein. The L1 ectodomain, composed of six Ig-like and five fibronectin (Fn) type-III domains, is involved in homophilic binding. Here, co-immunoprecipitation studies between recombinant truncated forms of human L1 expressed and purified from insect Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells, and endogenous full-length L1 from human NT2N neurons, showed that the L1 ectodomain (L1/ECD) and L1/Ig1–4 interacted homophilically in trans, contrary to mutants L1/Ig1–3 and L1/Ig2-Fn5. All mutants were correctly folded as evaluated by combination of far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed comparable dissociation constants of 116 ± 2 and 130 ± 6 nm for L1/ECD-L1/ECD and L1/ECD-L1/Ig1–4, respectively, whereas deletion mutants for Ig1 or Ig4 did not interact. Accordingly, in vivo, Sf9 cells stably expressing L1 were found to adhere only to L1/ECD- and L1/Ig1–4-coated surfaces. Furthermore, only these mutants bound to HEK293 cells overexpressing L1 at the cell surface. Enhancement of neurite outgrowth, which is the consequence of signaling events caused by L1 homophilic binding, was comparable between L1/ECD and L1/Ig1–4. Altogether, these results showed that domains Ig1 to Ig4 are necessary and sufficient for L1 homophilic binding in trans, and that the rest of the molecule does not contribute to the affinity under the conditions of the current study.

Pendergast M. Lemmon V. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The multiple interactions depend on the structure of L1, which consists of a highly glycosylated extracellular region composed by six Ig-like domains (Ig1–6) and five fibronectin type III-like domains (Fn1–5), a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A; reviewed in Ref. 2Bateman A. Jouet M. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Kenwrick S. Chothia C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6050-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). L1 mediates its effects through the interaction with a variety of ligands, which include L1 (homophilic binding), other neuronal members of the Ig superfamily, integrins, and extracellular matrix components (heterophilic binding) (reviewed in Ref. 3Haspel J. Grumet M. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1210-s1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions result in the activation of cellular signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 4Kenwrick S. Watkins A. De Angelis E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Studies have been performed on domain mapping of homophilic binding, as this interaction has proven to be of fundamental importance for many of L1-mediated cellular processes, including neurite outgrowth (reviewed in Ref. 4Kenwrick S. Watkins A. De Angelis E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Siu and co-workers (5Zhao X. Siu C.H. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 960-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) performed a series of experiments based on the use of recombinant L1 mutants produced in the Escherichia coli expression system and have shown that Ig2 is sufficient to induce homophilic interaction in trans and neurite elongation on neural retinal cells or just homophilic interaction on PC12 cells (7Yip P.M. Siu C.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1552-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, Silleti and co-workers (8Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) showed that the bacterial-derived Fn3 domain spontaneously homomultimerizes in vitro, to form trimeric and higher order complexes suggesting that this domain could mediate L1-L1 interaction in cis. However, studies using mammalian-derived glycosylated L1 missense mutants found in the neurological disease X-linked hydrocephalus have shown that homophilic interaction in trans is dependent on many domains, particularly the region encompassing Ig1–6 and the Fn2 domain (9De Angelis E. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Yeo G. Hicks R. Rathjen F.G. Kenwrick S. Brummendorf T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, using Ig1–2, Ig1–3, and Ig1–4 mutants produced in HeLa cells, Haspel and co-workers (10Haspel J. Friedlander D.R. Ivgy-May N. Chickramane S. Roonprapunt C. Chen S. Schachner M. Grumet M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) found that the first four Ig domains of L1 underwent homophilic binding, mediated cell adhesion, and promoted neurite outgrowth, but the whole Ig1–6 region was necessary for optimal neurite outgrowth. Accordingly, studies with L1 missense mutants expressed in COS-7 cells showed that mutations affecting the structure of domains in the Ig1–6 and Fn1–2 regions significantly reduced homophilic binding (11De Angelis E. Watkins A. Schafer M. Brummendorf T. Kenwrick S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurons from a knock-in mouse in which Ig6 was deleted failed to attach and send out neurites on L1-coated surfaces (12Itoh K. Cheng L. Kamei Y. Fushiki S. Kamiguchi H. Gutwein P.

Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), chick axonin-1 (14Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and its human homologue neural TAG-1 (15Mortl M. Sonderegger P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which contains regions homologous to Ig1–4 from L1, showed that Ig1–4 domains adopted a horseshoe-shaped conformation, in the crystal. This suggested that a similar arrangement might occur in the Ig1–4 region of L1. A recently developed homology model of Ig1–4 from L1 further supported this possibility (16Arevalo E. Shanmugasundararaj S. Wilkemeyer M.F. Dou X. Chen S. Charness M.E. Miller K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previously, we have expressed the L1 ectodomain in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells, which was active in promoting neurite outgrowth from human NT2N neurons (17Gouveia R.M. Morais V.A. Peixoto C. Sousa M. Regalla M. Alves P.M. Costa J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Insect cells are adequate host systems for the expression of high amounts of recombinant glycoproteins. These cells perform glycosylation generally of the paucimannosidic-type (reviewed in Ref. 18Altmann F. Staudacher E. Wilson I.B. Marz L. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which is less processed than that observed for human glycoproteins, but which in many instances allows to obtain correctly folded and efficiently secreted glycoproteins. In the present work, the homophilic interaction of the recombinant L1 ectodomain (L1/ECD) from insect cells has been observed by co-immunoprecipitation studies, and it was quantified using surface plasmon resonance analysis. Affinities between L1/ECD and L1/ECD, or L1/ECD and L1/Ig1–4 were found to be comparable, and deletion of domains Ig1 or Ig4 completely abrogated the interaction. Accordingly, cell adhesion was only detected for L1/ECD and L1/Ig1–4, and enhancement of neurite outgrowth was comparable for the two mutants. Cell Culture—S. frugiperda Sf9 cells were grown and maintained in Sf900II medium at 27 °C and 90 rpm. Cultures were passed when they reached a cell density of about 4 × 106 cell/ml, with seeding concentration of 4 × 105 cell/ml. Human NT2N neurons were differentiated and cultured as previously described (19Brito C. Escrevente C. Reis C.A. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Costa J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, NT2– cells were maintained 5 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 μm retinoic acid, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were then plated into new flasks and maintained for 2 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and mitotic inhibitors (1 μm cytosine arabinoside, 10 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, and 10 μm uridine). Post-mitotic human NT2N neurons were then recovered and used for functional assays. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Construction of Expression Vectors—Recombinant L1 truncated mutants comprising the entire ectodomain (L1/ECD), the Ig1 to 4 domains (L1/Ig1–4), the ectodomain without the Ig1 (L1/Ig2-Fn5), and the Ig1 to 3 domains (L1/Ig1–3) (Fig. 1A) were obtained as previously described (17Gouveia R.M. Morais V.A. Peixoto C. Sousa M. Regalla M. Alves P.M. Costa J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas L1/Ig2-Fn5 and L1/Ig1–3 mutants were constructed as previously reported (17Gouveia R.M. Morais V.A. Peixoto C. Sousa M. Regalla M. Alves P.M. Costa J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, they were constructed by PCR, using the pcDNA3L1A plasmid as template (Fig. 1A). The sequence corresponded to the neuronal isoform of L1 (28 exons) (GenBank™ code NM 000425). L1/Ig2-Fn5 was amplified using sense primer 5′-CATGCTAAGCTTGTGGCCAAAGGAGACAGTGAAG-3′ and the 5′-TTAATCCTCGAGCCTCAGTGGCGAAGCCAGC-3′ reverse primer. L1/Ig1–3 was amplified using the 5′-TTTGCTAAGCTTGGAGGAATATGAAGGACACCATGTG-3′ sense primer and the 5′-TTTTTCCTCGAGCAGCCTCCACGGTGACATAG-3′ reverse primer. All primers were designed to include restriction sequences for directional cloning; the forward and reverse primers had a restriction sequence for HindIII and XhoI endonucleases, respectively (first 13 bases, underscored). Fragments were cloned into the pMIB (C) expression vector and positively identified by complete automatic DNA sequencing. Standard molecular biology techniques were used. Transfection and Production of L1 Mutants—Sf9 insect cells were transfected with pMIB-L1/Ig1–4 or pMIB-L1/Ig1–3 plasmids by the calcium phosphate method (17Gouveia R.M. Morais V.A. Peixoto C. Sousa M. Regalla M. Alves P.M. Costa J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and with pMIB-L1, pMIB-L1/ECD, or pMIB-L1/Ig2-Fn5 plasmids using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pMIB-CAT plasmid was transfected as positive control. Transfected cells were selected with 10 mg/liter blasticidin-HCl for 2 weeks. Cell extract of Sf9-L1 cells and supernatants from the other transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot for the expression of L1 mutant proteins, and production was assessed during the days in culture. All mutant proteins were produced in shake flasks, and L1/ECD was also produced in a 2-liter bioreactor (17Gouveia R.M. Morais V.A. Peixoto C. Sousa M. Regalla M. Alves P.M. Costa J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Soluble recombinant L1 mutants were purified from the supernatant of transfected Sf9 cells. The purification was performed by ion metal affinity chromatography using a HiTrap Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 50 ml of protein-containing supernatant was run on 5 ml of Ni2+-loaded columns, washed with start buffer (0.02 m Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m imidazole), and eluted with elution buffer (same but with 0.5 m imidazole). Imidazole was removed from solution by washing eluate fractions with PBS, using Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius). Purified proteins were kept at –80 °C in PBS containing 50% glycerol. Analysis of Purified Proteins—Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Quantification of purified protein was performed by interpolation of the signal obtained in a calibration curve of peak area versus bovine serum albumin (BSA) mass (25–200 ng). Peak area was determined using ImageJ 1.37 gel analysis software (National Institutes of Health). Protein concentration was also determined by spectrophotometry using the extinction coefficient of L1 mutant proteins at 280 nm, calculated using the Protean version 3.11 software (DNAStar). Western blot analysis of purified proteins was performed using the mouse anti-V5 tag as primary antibody at 1:5,000 dilution; as secondary antibody an anti-mouse immunoglobulin G coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used at 1:4,000 dilution. Bands were visualized by the ECL Plus method (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitations—The full-length, membrane bound, native L1 protein from human NT2N neurons (hL1) was co-immunoprecipitated with each of the L1 truncated mutants. For each co-immunoprecipitation, a 20-μl aliquot of Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was incubated with 3 μl of the rabbit anti-V5 polyclonal antibody (serum 1712; a kind gift from Prof. Robert Doms, University of Pennsylvania) for 20 min, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% CHAPSO (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (Complete mixture, Roche). The anti-V5 antibody-coupled beads were incubated with 3 μg of the purified L1 mutants for 1 h. For each co-immunoprecipitation, the cell extract from 1 × 106 NT2N neurons was prepared with lysis buffer as described above. The lysates were then pre-cleared with Protein A/G-agarose beads, and incubated with the L1 mutant-antibody coupled beads for 4 h. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using, as primary antibodies, mouse anti-L1 L1–11A (a kind gift from Prof. Peter Altevogt, DKFZ, Germany), that recognizes the Fn3–5 epitope of L1 between proteolytic cleavage sites of plasmin and ADAM10 (20Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and anti-V5 monoclonal antibodies. Spectroscopic Analysis—The folding and secondary structure of L1 mutants was analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Spectra were measured using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter with Peltier temperature control. Typically, 15 accumulations were recorded in the far-UV region (200–260 nm) at 20 °C using a 0.1-cm path length-polarized quartz cuvette. The lowest limit at 200 nm was imposed by high absorption below this point, which would cause distortions on the measured CD signals. CD units are expressed as mean residue extinction coefficient [Δϵmrw] in m–1, cm–1, which was calculated from the relationship Δϵmrw = S × mrw/(32,980 × c × d), where S represents the measured CD signal in millidegrees, c the protein concentration in mg/ml, d the path length of the cuvette in cm, and mrw the mean residue weight of each mutant. Samples were measured in 1:1 PBS/glycerol (pH 7.2) at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, in the absence or presence of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride. Data analysis was performed using the Jasco software package (Jandel Scientific). The program CDNN (Jasco) was used for deconvolution of the CD spectra and estimation of the secondary structure, from a built-in data base comprising 33 reference spectra. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter equipped with Peltier temperature control. Emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm, setting the excitation at 280 nm and the emission slits at 5 nm. Samples were measured at 5 μm in 1:1 PBS/glycerol (pH 7.2). Dynamic light scattering analysis was performed on a Zetasizer Nano apparatus with temperature control. Samples were assayed at 0.3 mg/ml in PBS (pH 7.2). Diameter values were calculated using the DTSnano software (Malvern Instruments). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Homophilic interaction was tested in the BIAcore 2000 system using the purified recombinant L1 mutants. In this system, binding of soluble analytes to immobilized ligands is measured in arbitrary units (RU). There is a linear relationship between the mass of the analyte bound to the immobilized protein and the RU observed (1000 RU ≈ 1 ng/mm2 bound protein). L1/ECD was coupled to the CM5 chip at 1 mg/ml by the amino coupling procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ligand was immobilized at ≈2.5 ng/mm2 (2500 RU). Each of the L1 mutants were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2 (TBS-MC) and injected in concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 nm. At least one concentration was used as duplicate per experiment, and three independent experiments with two independent chips were performed. Samples were injected using the KInject injection wizard for kinetic parameters determination (flow rate of 20 μl/min for 3 min at 24 °C). The complexes were dissociated by washing with TBS-MC buffer at the same flow rate for 7 min. The regeneration step was performed using 10 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) for 30 s. Interaction curves were obtained after reference flow cell and blank curves subtraction, for major bulk effect correction. The association phase (10–175 s) and dissociation phase (190–360 s) regions were selected for kinetic parameter evaluation. The association rate constant (ka) and the dissociation rate constant (kd) were calculated according to BIAevaluation software version 4.1 provided by the manufacturer. Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated simultaneously using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with drifting baseline correction to determine the fitting curve. The affinity constant (KD) was calculated from the equation KD = kd/ka. Cell Adhesion Assay—For the cell adhesion experiments using immobilized L1 mutants, round glass coverslips (12 mm diameter) were coated with 10 mm poly-d-lysine, washed three times with water, and incubated overnight with 80-μl drops of 2 μm purified proteins (1.4 × 10–10 mol of protein/mm2 surface area). Control coverslips were coated with 2 μm BSA over poly-d-lysine. Following coating, the coverslips were washed with PBS and Sf900II medium. Sf9-CAT (mock transfected) or Sf9-L1 cells (expressing the full-length membrane bound L1) were seeded onto the coated coverslips at 5 × 104 cell/cm2 density. The binding was performed for 24 h at 27 °C, after which slides were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked, and incubated with 1:2000 dilution mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), followed by 1:500 dilution goat anti-mouse Alexa 594 secondary antibody. Cell binding was quantified by counting 10 independent fields per condition, in duplicate, from three independent blind experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 4 software. Soluble L1 Binding Assay—HEK cells stably overexpressing full-length L1 (21Escrevente C. Morais V.A. Keller S. Soares C.M. Altevogt P. Costa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips at 5 × 104 cell/cm2 density and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After washing with PBS, fixed cells were incubated with 80-μl drops of 2 μm purified L1 proteins or BSA as negative control for 24 h. Cells were washed, fixed, and blocked and permeabilized with 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Immunostaining was performed with 1:2000 dilution rabbit anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, followed by 1:500 dilution goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 secondary antibody. Preparations were examined by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, using a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica). The experiment was performed blind three times, in duplicate. Neurite Outgrowth Assay—The neurite outgrowth assay was performed with the human NT2N neurons cultured over glass coverslips (coating as described above) at 5 × 104 cell/cm2 density. Matrigel (0.26 mg/ml) (BD Biosciences) coating was used as positive control. Neurite outgrowth was carried out in conditioned medium with mitotic inhibitors for 24 h. Cells were observed by bright-field microscopy using a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope and images were recorded with an attached Olympus DP11 digital camera. Neurites with a length greater than one cell body diameter (≈15 μm) were measured using the NeuronJ 1.01 plugin (22Meijering E. Jacob M. Sarria J.C. Steiner P. Hirling H. Unser M. Cytometry A. 2004; 58: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) from ImageJ 1.37 software. The experiment was performed blind twice using quadruplicates for each condition. Mean neurite length was calculated by randomly measuring 250 dominant neurite processes for each condition in each experiment. Expression and Purification of L1 Truncated Mutants—To study the molecular basis and kinetics of the homophilic interaction of L1, mutants corresponding to the ectodomain (L1/ECD), domains Ig1 to Ig4 (L1/Ig1–4), Ig2 to Fn5 (L1/Ig2-Fn5), and Ig1 to Ig3 (L1/Ig1–3) were designed (Fig. 1A). The PCR amplified DNA sequences were cloned into the pMIB vector that encodes the V5 and the hexa-histidine tags downstream of the cloned sequences. Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the L1 mutant vectors and selected with 10 mg/ml blasticidin-HCl. Stably transfected Sf9-L1/ECD, Sf9-L1/Ig1–4, Sf9-L1/Ig2-Fn5, and Sf9-L1/Ig1–3 cells were obtained, and corresponding mutant proteins were found to be secreted into the supernatant (Fig. 1B). All mutant proteins were produced in shaker flasks at 3, 11, 3, and 23 mg/liter concentrations, respectively. L1/ECD was further produced in a bioreactor at 13 mg/liter concentration. Mutants were purified by ion metal affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B), showing a high degree of purity. The L1/ECD, L1/Ig1–4, L1/Ig2-Fn5, and L1/Ig1–3 mutants had apparent molecular masses of ≈180, 65, 160, and 50 kDa, respectively. Differences between the apparent mass of the mutants and those expected for the polypeptide chains (Fig. 1A) are probably due to glycosylation, as shown in previous work (17Gouveia R.M. Morais V.A. Peixoto C. Sousa M. Regalla M. Alves P.M. Costa J. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Structural Analysis of L1 Mutants—To investigate the conformation and folding of the produced L1 mutants, the purified proteins were analyzed by CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded in the far-UV region (200–260 nm), which is informative regarding the various types of secondary structure (Fig. 2A, Table 1). The spectrum of L1/ECD is typical of a folded protein, with a single negative band centered at ≈216 nm, denoting a predominant β-sheet structure. This observation is in agreement with that predicted for the extracellular part of L1, because the six Ig and five Fn domains are formed by β-sheets (2Bateman A. Jouet M. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Kenwrick S. Chothia C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6050-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). L1/ECD unfolded upon incubation with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, a strong denaturing agent, which led to the disruption of the secondary structure (Fig. 2A). This data are in agreement with the results obtained by Hall and co-workers (23Hall H. Bozic D. Fauser C. Engel J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for mouse L1 mutants expressed in mammalian cells, suggesting that the overall fold of Sf9-expressed L1 mutants is similar to that of mammalian-derived L1. The far-UV CD spectra of the L1/Ig1–4, L1/Ig2-Fn5, and L1/Ig1–3, which are characterized by a weak negative band (≈1.5 m–1 × cm–1) with minima at 210–220 nm, denote that the truncated mutants are folded, and also β-sheet proteins (Table 1). In fact, both the Ig and Fn domains are all β proteins, although a recent report has identified a small, novel α-helix within human Fn1 (24Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Hernandez-Guzman F.G. Close B.E. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36052-36059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overall, far-UV CD analysis shows that the purified mutants correspond to structured and folded proteins.TABLE 1Estimated secondary structure content for L1 variants determined by far-UV CDProteinSecondary structure contentα-HelixAntiparallel βParallel ββ TurnRandom coil%L1/ECD103261835L1/Ig1-493352035L1/Ig1-393352035L1/Ig2-Fn5103062035 Open table in a new tab The structural conformation of L1/Ig1–4 and L1/Ig1–3 was further analyzed, to investigate if the Ig1–4 region of L1 could adopt a U-shaped structure similar to the one found in TAG-1 protein (15Mortl M. Sonderegger P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such a conformation would involve interactions between the Ig1 and Ig4 domains. L1/Ig1–4 and L1/Ig1–3 contain, respectively, six and four tryptophan residues, whose intrinsic fluorescence is an excellent probe to monitor differences in the conformation of the two variants. Upon excitation at 280 nm, the emission spectra of L1/Ig1–4 and L1/Ig1–3 exhibited maxima at 330 and 335 nm, respectively (Fig. 2B, letter F). The red-shifted emission maximum of L1/Ig1–3 suggests that the emitting residues in this variant are in a more solvent-exposed conformation (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). When thermally denatured, the tryptophan moieties, which were inaccessible to the solvent in the folded state, become solvent exposed, and the emission maxima shifts to 350 nm (Fig. 2B, letter U). In an attempt to discriminate between conformations with differences in compactness and hydrodynamic diameter, these mutants were also analyzed by dynamic light scattering. However, no clear difference was determined in the diameters of L1/Ig1–4 (12.4 ± 0.7 nm) and L1/Ig1–3 (12.8 ± 0.6 nm). It was previously shown that the Ig1–3 region, expressed as a recombinant protein in HEK293 cells, was able to dimerize by intermolecular disulfide bonds (20Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P.

We show that at both the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains, raft-associated proteins diffuse faster than non-raft-associated proteins and that, different from the latter, they become restricted upon depletion of cholesterol. Furthermore, only transmembrane apical proteins are restricted by the actin network. This indicates that cholesterol-dependent domains exist both at the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized cells and that the actin cytoskeleton has a predominant role in the organization of transmembrane proteins independent of their association with rafts at the apical membrane. In the Golgi apparatus apical proteins appear to be segregated from the basolateral ones in a compartment that is sensitive both to cholesterol depletion and actin rearrangements. Furthermore, consistent with the role of actin rearrangements in apical protein sorting, we found that apical proteins exhibit a differential sensitivity to actin depolymerization in the Golgi of polarized and nonpolarized cells. To determine the roles of cholesterol and the actin cytoskeleton in apical and basolateral protein organization and sorting, we have performed comprehensive confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analyses of apical and basolateral and raft- and non-raft-associated proteins, both at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus of polarized MDCK cells.

Raft microdomains are ordered lipid membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). Diverse types of proteins such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), 2The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPI-AP, GPI-anchored protein; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; FR, Folate receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; ROI, regions of interest; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin. acylated proteins and transmembrane proteins are able to segregate into these membrane domains, which have been proposed to be involved in many cellular mechanisms such as protein sorting, endocytosis, virus budding, and bacterial infection (2Cherukuri A.

One biochemical characteristic of the raft components is to be insoluble upon extraction in cold non-ionic detergent like Triton X-100; therefore, rafts have been assimilated to detergent-resistant membrane (DRMs). However, to date it has been very difficult to study rafts in unperturbed cells because their putative size (between 10 and 200 nm) is below the optical resolution (6Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1597-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Several imaging techniques including single particle tracking, FRET, and FRAP have been developed to investigate protein and lipid organization in raft domains and their functions in membrane compartmentalization (7Suzuki K.G. Fujiwara T.K. Edidin M. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki K.G. Fujiwara T.K. Sanematsu F. Iino R. Edidin M. Kusumi A. J.

Moreno M.J. Verkade P. Vaz W.L. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) found that raft and non-raft-associated proteins exhibit different behaviors, suggesting the existence of two environments: raft and non-raft domains at the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells. One of our major interests is to understand the mechanism of apical sorting of GPI-APs in polarized cells. The GPI anchor was one of the first apical sorting signals to be postulated (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar, 14Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J.

A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar); however, this hypothesis has been challenged by the finding that GPI-APs can be either apically or basolaterally sorted in polarized epithelial cells (17Paladino S. Sarnataro D. Pillich R. Tivodar S. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E.

A common characteristic of apical and basolateral GPI-APs is their association with raft microdomains. However, contrary to the basolateral ones, only apical GPI-APs are able to cluster in high molecular weight complexes in the Golgi apparatus prior to their apical sorting (17Paladino S. Sarnataro D. Pillich R. Tivodar S. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Impairment of GPI-AP oligomerization results in mis-sorting to the basolateral surface, thus indicating that in addition to raft association, clustering of GPI-APs is required for apical sorting. The differential sorting (apical or basolateral) of raft-associated proteins can be explained by differences in the nature of the raft domain with which these proteins associate or in differences in the affinity (21Brugger B. Graham C. Leibrecht I. Mombelli E. Jen A. Wieland F. Morris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7530-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 3S. Paladino, S. Lebreton, S. Tivodar, V. Campana, R. Tempre, and C. Zurzolo, submitted for publication. The role of the actin cytoskeleton in organizing and compartmentalizing the plasma membrane appears to be equally important (9Morone N. Fujiwara T. Murase K. Kasai R.S. Ike H. Yuasa S. Usukura J. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Murase K. Fujiwara T. Umemura Y. Suzuki K. Iino R. Yamashita H. Saito M. Murakoshi H. Ritchie K. Kusumi A.

To gain insights into the mechanism of apical sorting and protein compartmentalization, we analyzed the FRAP behavior of raft- and non-raft-associated proteins in apical and basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells, as well as in the Golgi, under conditions of raft and/or actin cytoskeleton perturbation. Our data indicate that (i) raft domains with distinct properties exist in both apical and basolateral membranes of fully polarized MDCK cells, (ii) the actin cytoskeleton has an important role in the organization of apical transmembrane proteins independent of their association with rafts, and (iii) apical and basolateral proteins are segregated in the Golgi apparatus into two different compartments both containing cholesterol-dependent domains. Reagents and Antibodies—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Phalloidin-rhodamine and latrunculin A were purchased from Invitrogen; filipin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, water cholesterol soluble, and mevinolin were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. MDCK cells were transfected with sequences encoding GFP-FR, P75-GFP, GFP-PrP, or GFP-PIT as described previously (17Paladino S. Sarnataro D. Pillich R. Tivodar S. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Depletion or Loading of Cholesterol—To deplete the cells of cholesterol, we used a previously described protocol (24Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 25Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly MDCK cells were plated on filters, and mevinolin (10 μm) was added to the cells 24 h after plating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% delipidated calf serum and mevalonate (250 μm). In supplemental Fig. S2 after 3 days on filter, MβCD (10 mm) was added to medium containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.2% bovine albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. To load the cells with cholesterol after 3 days of polarization on filters, water-soluble cholesterol (10 mm in MβCD) was added to warm medium containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.2% bovine albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. Water-soluble cholesterol was prepared with MβCD. The following ratio between the two chemicals determines whether the mixture will act as a cholesterol donor (ratio 1:6, cholesterol:MβCD) or acceptor (26Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of cholesterol depletion or addition, we measured cellular cholesterol levels by a colorimetric assay (cholesterol/cholesteryl ester quantification; Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Perturbation of the Cytoskeleton Meshwork—To perturb the actin cytoskeleton, we incubated the polarized MDCK cells with latrunculin A (Molecular Probes) (1 μm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 5 or 60 min at 37 °C before FRAP analysis or fixation for immunofluorescence. Velocity Gradients—Velocity gradients were performed using a previously published protocol (17Paladino S. Sarnataro D. Pillich R. Tivodar S. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 and lysed on ice for 30 min in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100. The lysates were scraped from dishes, sheared through a 26-gauge needle, and layered on top of a glycerol gradient (40 to 20%) after removal of nuclei by low speed centrifugation. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 16 h in an ultracentrifuge (model SW 50; Beckman counter), fractions of 300 μl were harvested from the top of the gradient and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The proteins were revealed by Western blot using specific antibodies. Fluorescence Microscopy—MDCK cells were grown on transwell filters for 3-4 days, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing CaCl2 and MgCl2, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl. The actin cytoskeleton was revealed by using phalloidin-rhodamine (1/100). For the filipin staining, we fixed the cells for 60 min, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.075% saponin, and quenched with ammonium chloride (50 mm) before staining for 1 h with filipin (250 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). The images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) equipped with a plan apo 63× oil immersion (NA 1.4) objective lens. FRAP Measurements and Analysis—FRAP enabled the assessment of two parameters, the mobile fraction and the apparent diffusion coefficient. Whereas the mobile fraction corresponds to the fraction of the studied protein that is able to repopulate the bleached area, the apparent diffusion coefficient indicates the speed with which the proteins diffuse. FRAP analysis was performed on a confocal LSM 510 META from Zeiss. Using the plan apo 63× oil immersion (NA 1.4) objective lens, we monitored the fluorescence of our fused GFP protein using low intensity laser excitation (488 nm) (prebleach scans). We always kept an airy unit of 1. As a preliminary analysis to determine the mathematical model to apply for membrane proteins, different sizes of regions of interest (ROI) from 280 nm to 6.2 μm were selectively bleached (29Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). From those analyses it appeared that our model proteins were following a diffusion-coupled FRAP recovery (29Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because we used a circular ROI, we analyzed our raw data using the previously described Soumpasis mathematical equation (30Meder D. Moreno M.J. Verkade P. Vaz W.L. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Soumpasis.Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To compare our data with published studies, we opted for a bleaching ROI of 1.4 μm for all of our experiments. Therefore a circular region of 1.4 μm was photobleached with the same laser excitation at high intensity (decrease of the fluorescence into the ROI by 60-80%), and then the recovering of fluorescence into the bleached region over time was monitored by recording with low intensity laser (post-bleach scans) as before photobleaching. This recovery reflects the ability of unbleached fluorescent proteins around the ROI to repopulate the photobleached ROI. For each FRAP acquisition, we considered two internal controls, one that indicates over time the natural bleaching of the sample and one that gives the level of fluorescence background (29Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The raw data were fitted with the Igor Pro software and an application developed in EMBL with the Soumpasis mathematical equation. FRAP recordings were obtained in CO2-independent medium (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 m CaCl2, 0.1 m MgCl2, 0.2 m Hepes) at room temperature or at 37 °C. Overview of the Studied Proteins and Validation of FRAP Settings in Polarized MDCK Cells—We set up a confocal FRAP analysis and determined the mobile fraction and apparent diffusion coefficients of different proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”) at the level of the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus (supplemental Fig. S1) to correlate the behavior of the studied proteins with the immediate membrane environment. For raft-associated proteins, we studied GFP-FR and GFP-PrP where GFP is fused to the GPI signal attachment of either the folate receptor (GFP-FR) or the prion protein (GFP-PrP) (Fig. 1). These two chimeric proteins are excellent candidates because although both are GPI-anchored and raft-associated, they have an opposite polarity and different capacity to oligomerize.3 As non-raft proteins, we considered two transmembrane proteins fused to GFP: P75-GFP, which is apically sorted and has GFP fused to the human neurotrophin receptor (32Kreitzer G. Schmoranzer J. Low S.H. Li X. Gan Y. Weimbs T. Simon S.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); and GFP-PIT, which is basolaterally sorted and has GFP fused to a truncated form of the low density lipoprotein receptor (extracellular domain deleted) (23Paladino S. Pocard T. Catino M.A. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). All constructs were stably transfected into MDCK cells where we could compare the behavior and therefore the local environment (both at the level of the plasma membrane and in the Golgi) of (i) two differentially sorted raft-associated proteins (GFP-FR versus GFP-PrP), (ii) two apical proteins either raft- or non-raft-associated (GFP-FR or P75-GFP respectively), and (iii) two basolateral proteins either raft- or non-raft-associated (GFP-PrP or GFP-PIT, respectively). We performed all FRAP analyses on polarized MDCK cells grown “upside-down” on small filters for three to four days to obtain fully polarized conditions as previously reported (23Paladino S. Pocard T. Catino M.A. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the behavior at 25 and at 37 °C of our two model apical proteins P75-GFP and GFP-FR was similar to what was previously reported (30Meder D. Moreno M.J. Verkade P. Vaz W.L. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2) and confirmed that different environments were surrounding raft- and non-raft-associated proteins. Having validated our FRAP conditions, we performed the rest of our experiments at physiological temperature (37 °C). Because, as expected, the mobile fraction of all studied proteins at this temperature was 100% (supplemental Fig. S2 and data not shown), we only measured differences in the apparent diffusion coefficient of each fusion protein. Involvement of Cholesterol in the Organization of Raft-associated Proteins at the Apical and Basolateral Plasma Membrane Domains of Polarized MDCK Cells—To understand the role of cholesterol in the organization of proteins at the apical and basolateral plasma membranes in polarized MDCK cells, we analyzed the FRAP behavior of apical and basolateral raft- and non-raft-associated proteins at steady state (referred as control) and upon modification of the cholesterol content. We found that at steady state GPI-anchored, raft-associated proteins have a significantly higher apparent diffusion coefficient compared with non-raft-associated proteins independent of their apical or basolateral localization (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether cholesterol content affects the behavior of these proteins, possibly by changing their local membrane environment, we depleted cholesterol from polarized MDCK cells using methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which sequesters cholesterol in its hydrophobic core. A short incubation of 30 min of polarized MDCK cells with MβCD (10 mm) reduced the content of cholesterol by 30% (see “Experimental Procedures”). By performing FRAP within the first 30 min after removal of the drug, we observed that the apparent diffusion coefficient of all proteins, independent of their raft association and their polarity, was significantly decreased (supplemental Fig. S3). These results are in agreement with what has been published earlier in nonpolarized COS-7 cells (33Kenworthy A.K. Nichols B.J. Remmert C.L. Hendrix G.M. Kumar M. Zimmerberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, because it has been shown that MβCD may induce aspecific effects not related with the depletion of cholesterol (27Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 34Shvartsman D.E. Gutman O. Tietz A. Henis Y.I. Traffic. 2006; 7: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we decided to use an alternative approach and treated the cells with mevinolin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (24Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). MDCK cells plated on filters were treated for 48 h in a delipidated medium with mevinolin (10 μm), resulting in a depletion of cholesterol of 30-40% (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to the methyl-β-cyclodextrin results, upon inhibition of cholesterol synthesis only raft-associated proteins (both apical and basolateral) presented a statistically significant decrease in their apparent diffusion coefficients, whereas non-raft-associated proteins were unaffected (Fig. 2A). These results are in agreement with the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy study performed in COS-7 cells using cholesterol oxidase (35Lenne P.F. Wawrezinieck L. Conchonaud F. Wurtz O. Boned A. Guo X.J. Rigneault H. He H.T. Marguet D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 36Marguet D. Lenne P.F. Rigneault H. He H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3446-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). They indicate that like in nonpolarized cells, cholesterol-dependent domains exist both at the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells. Interestingly, we observed a difference in the statistical significance of the variation of the diffusion coefficient between apical and basolateral GPI-APs after cholesterol depletion (Fig. 2A, compare GFP-FR with GFP-PrP). Indeed, following cholesterol depletion the apparent diffusion coefficient of GFP-FR decreased with a statistical significance of p < 0.005, whereas the apparent diffusion coefficient of GFP-PrP decreased with a statistical significance of p < 0.0001. This supports the hypothesis that apical and basolateral raft domains in polarized cells have specific properties and may differ in lipid composition (37Tivodar S. Paladino S. Pillich R. Prinetti A. Chigorno V. van Meer G. Sonnino S. Zurzolo C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5705-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To fully investigate the requirement for cholesterol in protein organization at the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells, we performed FRAP upon loading of cholesterol. To this end, we incubated polarized MDCK cells with water-soluble cholesterol for a short period of time (30 min) before proceeding to the FRAP analysis within the first 30 min after washing the cells. Measurement of total cholesterol showed an increase of 50% (see “Experimental Procedures”) also shown by the increased fluorescence signal observed by filipin staining (Fig. 2, B and C). Under these conditions, neither apical or basolateral raft-associated proteins were affected by cholesterol addition, suggesting that rafts were probably already saturated with cholesterol both at the apical and basolateral surface. In contrast, we observed a statistically significant increase of the apparent diffusion coefficient of non-raft apical protein P75-GFP upon loading of cholesterol (Fig. 2D). However, under these conditions after extraction at 4 °C in Triton X-100, P75-GFP remained soluble and did not float on sucrose density gradient (supplemental Fig. S4). This suggests that the addition of cholesterol increases the diffusional property of the apical non-raft-associated protein, but it is not enough to change the partition of a non-DRM protein to DRMs. Interestingly, the addition of cholesterol did not affect the basolateral non-raft-associated GFP-PIT, possibly because the basolateral domain is already more enriched in cholesterol compared with the apical one (compare filipin staining in Fig. 2B, panels a and c). Involvement of the Actin Cytoskeleton in the Organization of Transmembrane Proteins at the Apical Membrane of Polarized MDCK Cells—It has been postulated that the plasma membrane of the fibroblast cells like normal rat kidney cells are compartmentalized and that the actin meshwork plays an essential role in the confinement of proteins. More precisely, transmembrane proteins by their interaction with actin fibers contribute to the establishment of membrane compartments in which proteins are able to diffuse. The size of these compartments ranges between 32 and 230 nm depending on the cell type (9Morone N. Fujiwara T. Murase K. Kasai R.S. Ike H. Yuasa S. Usukura J. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Murase K. Fujiwara T. Umemura Y. Suzuki K. Iino R. Yamashita H. Saito M. Murakoshi H. Ritchie K. Kusumi A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 4075-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We wanted to analyze whether the actin cytoskeleton contributed to the organization/compartmentalization of raft-associated proteins (GPI-anchored or transmembrane) at the plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells. As apical transmembrane raft-associated protein, we considered the human LAT (linker for activation of T cells), which is the integral membrane adaptor protein linker for T cells activation. We found that two apical transmembrane raft-associated proteins (30Meder D. Moreno M.J. Verkade P. Vaz W.L. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), LAT-WT-GFP and LAT-TMD-GFP (deleted of its cytoplasmic domain), had a significantly higher apparent diffusion coefficient than P75-GFP our model transmembrane non-raft-associated protein (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.0001, respectively) (Fig. 3B). This supports the hypothesis that the local environment provided by rafts confers a higher lateral mobility to proteins compared with proteins excluded from these lipidic domains (Fig. 2A). To define the putative role of the actin cytoskeleton in organizing raft microdomains, we perturbed the integrity of the actin meshwork by using latrunculin A, which alters the actin-monomer subunit surface and prevents polymerization (38Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). By staining F-actin with phalloidin-rhodamine in polarized MDCK cells grown on filters, we found that a treatment of 60 min with latrunculin A drastically affects the actin cytoskeleton (compare panels a and e or panels b and f of Fig. 3C) and the cell integrity. In contrast, after 5 min of latrunculin A treatment, the overall integrity of the actin meshwork was preserved (Fig. 3C, panels c and d). However, when we performed the FRAP analyses at this time, both apical raft- and non-raft-associated transmembrane proteins possessing a cytoplasmic domain (P75-GFP and LAT-WT-GFP) displayed a statistical significant increase in their apparent diffusion coefficients (Fig. 3B). On the contrary LAT-TMD-GFP is unaffected by latrunculin treatment. Interestingly, at steady state, LAT-TMD-GFP displays a much higher apparent diffusion coefficient than LAT-WT-GFP (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3B), indicating that the cytoplasmic domain is necessary for mediating the restriction of LAT. Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that restriction of the apparent diffusion coefficient of transmembrane proteins derives from the interaction of their cytoplasmic domains with the actin meshwork independent from raft association. Interestingly, in contrast to apical proteins, basolateral proteins were unaffected by the mild latrunculin treatment (Fig. 3B). Involvement of Cholesterol and Actin in the Compartmentalization of Apical and Basolateral Raft- and Non-raft-associated Proteins at the Level of the Golgi Apparatus—Secreted proteins travel through the Golgi apparatus where they are packed in distinct vesicles before being delivered to the cell surface (32Kreitzer G.

These enzymes belong to the GT51 family, are characterized by five conserved motifs, and have some fold similarity with the phage lambda lysozyme. In this work, we have systematically modified all the conserved amino acid residues of the GT module of Escherichia coli class A PBP1b by site-directed mutagenesis and determined their importance for the in vivo and in vitro activity and the thermostability of the protein. To get an insight into the GT active site of this paradigm enzyme, a model of PBP1b GT domain was constructed based on the available crystal structures (PDB codes 2OLV and 2OLU). The data show that in addition to the essential glutamate residues Glu233 of motif 1 and Glu290 of motif 3, the residues Phe237 and His240 of motif 1 and Gly264, Thr267, Gln271, and Lys274 of motif 2, all located in the catalytic cavity of the GT domain, are essential for the in vitro enzymatic activity of the PBP1b and for its in vivo functioning. Thus, the first three conserved motifs contain most of the residues that are required for the GT activity of the PBP1b. The residues Asp234, Phe237, His240, Thr267, and Gln271 are proposed to maintain the structure of the active site and the positioning of the catalytic Glu233."
https://openalex.org/W2010064539,"Background Complex etiology and pathogenesis of pathophysiological components of the cardio-metabolic syndrome have been demonstrated in humans and animal models. Methodology/Principal Findings We have generated extensive physiological, genetic and genome-wide gene expression profiles in a congenic strain of the spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat containing a large region (110 cM, 170 Mb) of rat chromosome 1 (RNO1), which covers diabetes and obesity quantitative trait loci (QTL), introgressed onto the genetic background of the normoglycaemic Brown Norway (BN) strain. This novel disease model, which by the length of the congenic region closely mirrors the situation of a chromosome substitution strain, exhibits a wide range of abnormalities directly relevant to components of the cardio-metabolic syndrome and diabetes complications, including hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, enhanced insulin secretion both in vivo and in vitro, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and altered pancreatic and renal histological structures. Gene transcription data in kidney, liver, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue indicate that a disproportionately high number (43–83%) of genes differentially expressed between congenic and BN rats map to the GK genomic interval targeted in the congenic strain, which represents less than 5% of the total length of the rat genome. Genotype analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains genetically related to the GK highlights clusters of conserved and strain-specific variants in RNO1 that can assist the identification of naturally occurring variants isolated in diabetic and hypertensive strains when different phenotype selection procedures were applied. Conclusions Our results emphasize the importance of rat congenic models for defining the impact of genetic variants in well-characterised QTL regions on in vivo pathophysiological features and cis-/trans- regulation of gene expression. The congenic strain reported here provides a novel and sustainable model for investigating the pathogenesis and genetic basis of risks factors for the cardio-metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2010781861,"The fosfomycin resistance protein FomA inactivates fosfomycin by phosphorylation of the phosphonate group of the antibiotic in the presence of ATP and Mg(II). We report the crystal structure of FomA from the fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces wedmorensis in complex with diphosphate and in ternary complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)-triphosphate (AMPPNP), Mg(II), and fosfomycin, at 1.53 and 2.2 angstroms resolution, respectively. The polypeptide exhibits an open alphabetaalpha sandwich fold characteristic for the amino acid kinase family of enzymes. The diphosphate complex shows significant disorder in loops surrounding the active site. As a result, the nucleotide-binding site is wide open. Binding of the substrates is followed by the partial closure of the active site and ordering of the alpha2-helix. Structural comparison with N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase shows several similarities in the site of phosphoryl transfer: 1) preservation of architecture of the catalytical amino acids of N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (Lys9, Lys216, and Asp150 in FomA); 2) good superposition of the phosphate acceptor groups of the substrates, and 3) good superposition of the diphosphate molecule with the beta- and gamma-phosphates of AMPPNP, suggesting that the reaction could proceed by an associative in-line mechanism. However, differences in conformations of the triphosphate moiety of AMPPNP molecules, the long distance (5.1 angstroms) between the phosphate acceptor and donor groups in FomA, and involvement of Lys18 instead of Lys9 in binding with the gamma-phosphate may indicate a different reaction mechanism. The present work identifies the active site residues of FomA responsible for substrate binding and specificity and proposes their roles in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1985882358,"The fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS-II) pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis generates long chain fatty acids that serve as the precursors to mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall. Enzymes in the FAS-II pathway are thought to form one or more noncovalent multi-enzyme complexes within the cell, and a bacterial two-hybrid screen was used to search for missing components of the pathway and to furnish additional data on interactions involving these enzymes in vivo. Using the FAS-II β-ketoacyl synthase, KasA, as bait, an extensive bacterial two-hybrid screen of a M. tuberculosis genome fragment library unexpectedly revealed a novel interaction between KasA and PpsB as well as PpsD, two polyketide modules involved in the biosynthesis of the virulence lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM). Sequence analysis revealed that KasA interacts with PpsB and PpsD in the region of the acyl carrier domain of each protein, raising the possibility that lipids could be transferred between the FAS-II and PDIM biosynthetic pathways. Subsequent studies utilizing purified proteins and radiolabeled lipids revealed that fatty acids loaded onto PpsB were transferred to KasA and also incorporated into long chain fatty acids synthesized using a Mycobacterium smegmatis lysate. These data suggest that in addition to producing PDIMs, the growing phthiocerol product can also be shuttled into the FAS-II pathway via KasA as an entry point for further elongation.

In the early 1990s the World Health Organization acknowledged the reemergence of tuberculosis as a major global health concern (1World Health OrganizationTreatment of Tuberculosis: Guidelines for National Program, 3rd Ed. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1993Google Scholar). The advent of AIDS and the rise in multi-drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been the impetus for a more complete understanding of the complex nature of the bacteria. After the elucidation of the H37Rv genome sequence in 1998, it was concluded that M. tuberculosis contains roughly 250 distinct proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism (2Cole S.T. Brosch R.

This large number of genes correlates directly with the important role that lipids play in the pathogenic life-style of the bacillus, allowing the bacteria to overcome the harsh environment of the host, dehydration, and other chemical injury (3Barry III, C.E.

The critical role that lipids play in mycobacterial viability is further substantiated by the current anti-tubercular drugs, isoniazid, ethionamide, and ethambutol, which inhibit cell wall biosynthesis (5Banerjee A.

In the post-genomic era there has been an increased focus on drug target validation and in identifying novel protein-protein interactions involving known or suspected drug targets. Both serve as stepping stones for rationally designing new inhibitors and improving the longstanding front line chemotherapeutic agents. Mycolic acids are long chain (C70–C90) α-alkyl, β-hydroxylated fatty acids containing 70–90 carbons in total, and are the hallmark of mycobacteria, comprising an estimated 60% of the cell wall (3Barry III, C.E.

Unlike the large single polypeptide format of the FAS-I synthase, the FAS-II pathway consists of multiple enzymes that each catalyzes a distinct step in the cycle, utilizing substrates presented on an acyl carrier protein, AcpM. The FAS-II pathway generates fatty acids up to C54/56 in length, which are used for mycolic acid biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Complexities in the inhibition of the FAS-II enoyl reductase InhA by isoniazid led us to speculate that enzymes in the FAS-II pathway interact with each other inside the cell (8Rawat R. Whitty A. Tonge P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13881-13886Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).

In the current studies, we have demonstrated substrate transfer from the ACP domain of PpsB to the FAS-II β-ketoacyl synthase, KasA, which initiates each cycle of fatty acid elongation in the FAS-II pathway (Fig. 2). The subsequent incorporation and elongation of this substrate into long chain fatty acids demonstrates the functional nature of this interaction in vitro, and suggests a novel mechanism by which modifications such as hydroxylation could be incorporated into long chain fatty acids and mycolic acids within the cell. PDIM biosynthesis is up-regulated during infection, which may be responsible for causing a subset of Pps side-products to be shuttled into the FAS-II pathway (15Cox J.S. Chen B. McNeil M.

The studies presented here show the intricate interplay that can exist between previously unrelated pathways and open the door for defining alternate lipid modification routes. Bacterial Strains—M. smegmatis mc2155 (ATCC 700084) was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, XL1-Blue MRF′ Kan library-competent cells and BacterioMatch II validation reporter-competent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Bacteria Two-hybrid Library Construction and Cloning—M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv genomic DNA was partially digested with DpnII utilizing a dilution gradient of 0.001 to 10 u of enzyme in triplicate for 15, 30, and 60 min. DNA fragments ranging in size from 0.5 to 5 kb were ligated into the bacterial two-hybrid target vector, pTRG (Stratagene), to produce C-terminal fusions with the N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α-subunit (designated pTRG-MTB). Approximately 100,000 clones were harvested and isolated for use in library screening efforts. The pBT-kasA bait vector, in which KasA is expressed as a C-terminal fusion with the bacterial phage λcl protein, was constructed as described previously (12Kruh N.A. Rawat R. Ruzsicska B.P. Tonge P.J. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Library Screening—The pTRG-MTB library was screened with the pBT-kasA bait vector using a standard co-transformation protocol and using nonselective, selective, or dual selective media as described previously (12Kruh N.A. Rawat R. Ruzsicska B.P. Tonge P.J. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interaction candidates were checked for nonspecific interaction by transformation with control bait proteins. Plasmids that produced a hybrid protein capable of specifically interacting with the λcl-KasA fusion were sequenced using standard dideoxynucleotide methodology. KasA and ppsB PCR and Cloning—The mycobacterial expression vector pFPCA1 was a gift from Scott Franzblau, University of Illinois at Chicago. To generate plasmids for expressing the full-length KasA and PpsB proteins, the M. tuberculosis kasA gene and ppsB gene were PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA. The following primer sets were used for directional cloning: kasA1, 5′-GAAGATCTATGAGTCAGCCTTCCACCGC-3′ (forward); kasA2, 5′-CGGAATTCCCATGGGTAACGCCCGAAGGCAAG-3′ (reverse); ppsB1, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGATGCGAACGGCTTTCAGCCGG-3′ (forward); and ppsB2, 5′-GTGCTCGAGTTGTGTTCCTCTTAGTCG-3′ (reverse). PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and kasA was ligated into the mycobacterial expression vector pFPCA1 (18Changsen C. Franzblau S.G. Palittapongarnpim P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3682-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); ppsB was ligated into the E. coli expression vector pET23b. Recombinant KasA Protein Expression and Purification—The pFPCA1-kasA plasmid was electroporated into electrocompetent M. smegmatis mc2155 cells and plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) (19Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 47Google Scholar). Single colony transformants were grown at 35.5 °C overnight in 10 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with albumin-dextrose saline (19Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 47Google Scholar). The starter culture was then used to inoculate 500 ml of 7H9 medium containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml), 0.5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80. The cells were induced at an A600 of 0.450 with 1 ml of 44% acetamide, and expression was carried out at 35.5 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of standard His-Bind binding buffer, and cells were lysed by passing the cell suspension three times through a French press (1000 psi). Soluble mycobacterial proteins were then isolated by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h at 33,000 rpm. KasA was purified from the supernatant by Ni2+ affinity chromatography on His-Bind resin (Novagen). Fractions containing KasA were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.5 (20Schaeffer M.L. Agnihotri G. Volker C. Kallender H. Brennan P.J. Lonsdale J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47029-47037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the purity of the recombinant KasA was >95%. Recombinant PpsB Protein Expression, Purification, and Modification—The pET29b-Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase expression plasmid was a kind gift from Mike Burkart, University of California, San Diego. The pET23b-ppsB plasmid was transformed into competent BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli cells and plated on LB agar containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-amp). Single colony transformants were cultured in 10 ml of LB-amp medium at 37 °C for 16 h (overnight). This starter culture was subsequently used to inoculate 500 ml of LB-amp medium, which was shaken at 37 °C until an A600 of 1.5 was reached. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (360 μg/ml), and the culture was incubated at 25 °C overnight. Cells were harvested and lysed as described above, and PpsB was purified using His-Bind resin, also as described above. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that recombinant PpsB was >95% pure, and the protein was subsequently exchanged into 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for storage. Modification of apoPpsB Protein—PpsB was obtained in the predominantly apoform in which the phosphopantetheine was missing from the carrier domain. The apoPpsB was subsequently converted into malonyl-PpsB, biotinyl C-12-PpsB, or [1-14C]palmitoyl-PpsB using the Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Modification reactions were performed for 1 h at 37 °C in 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The phosphopantetheinyl donor was 100 μm malonyl-CoA, 12-N-biotinyl(aminododecanoyl)-CoA (Fig. 3, biotinyl C-12-CoA; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.), or 1 μCi (53 mCi/mmol) of [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (Sigma), respectively (21Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 22Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Acylation of KasA—Recombinant KasA protein was acylated in a 250-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 1–2 h with either 100 μm biotinyl C-12-CoA or [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA. In Vitro Acyl Chain Transfer of the Biotinyl C-12 Group from PpsB to KasA—The purified and concentrated biotinyl C-12-PpsB was combined with an equimolar amount of purified KasA protein and incubated at 37 °C. Transfer of the Biotinyl C-12 Group from KasA to PpsB or AcpM—Biotinyl C-12-KasA was generated as described above, and an equimolar amount of malonyl-PpsB or malonyl-AcpM was added. Malonyl-AcpM was synthesized as described previously (23Schaeffer M.L. Agnihotri G. Kallender H. Brennan P.J. Lonsdale J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All transfer reactions were performed for 1 h at 37 °C. Biotinyl C-12 transfer was monitored via Western blot utilizing an anti-biotin-alkaline phosphatase antibody and developed with BCIP/NBT. Preparation of Benzophenone-labeled CoA—A 5 mg/ml solution of benzophenone-4-maleimide (B4M) was prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide and combined at 1:1 with a solution of CoA (9 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, under light-restrictive conditions. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C until titration with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) demonstrated that no free thiol remained. Subsequently, the B4M-CoA (Fig. 3) was purified using an analytical HPLC Phenomenex Luna C18 5 μm (4.6 × 250 mm) column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing the desired product were concentrated in vacuo, redissolved in water, and analyzed using mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Photoreactive Protein Preparation—The B4M-phosphopantetheinyl group was transferred from B4M-CoA to either apoAcpM or apoPpsB using the Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Briefly, 60 μm apoAcpM or apoPpsB was incubated with 200 nm Sfp and 250 μm B4M-CoA for 90 min at 37 °C (24La Clair J.J. Foley T.L. Schegg T.R. Regan C.M. Burkart M.D. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry of B4M-AcpM—The modified AcpM was analyzed by LC/MS with an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD VL instrument using a Phenomenex Jupiter C4 HPLC column (5 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm). Chromatography was performed at 1 ml/min with a column temperature of 35 °C. Solvent A was 0.2% acetic acid, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid, v/v in H2O, and solvent B was 0.2% acetic acid and 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile:2-propanol. Samples were eluted with 25% B for 0 to 2 min followed by a gradient of 25–85% B over 2 to 32 min. The column eluant was analyzed in positive electrospray mode with the following spray chamber parameters: capillary voltage, 4.5 kV; gas temperature, 350 °C; drying gas flow, 13 liters/min; nebulizer pressure, 50 psig. The fragmentor voltage was 125 V, and mass spectra were recorded over the m/z range of 300 to 1500 atomic mass units. The average molecular weight of the proteins was calculated by deconvolution of the averaged mass spectra over the full width at half maximum of the peaks using Agilent ChemStation deconvolution software (supplemental Fig. S2). Mass Spectrometry of B4M-PpsB—Whereas intact B4M-AcpM protein was analyzed directly by LC/MS, PpsB was first digested with trypsin/Glu-C before analysis using the method described previously (12Kruh N.A. Rawat R. Ruzsicska B.P. Tonge P.J. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The digested protein samples were loaded onto a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (3.5 μm, 150 × 0.3 mm; Agilent) and analyzed using a LTQ linear ion trap (Thermo Scientific). Solvent A was 3% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in H2O, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile. Samples were eluted using a flow rate of 15 μl/min with the following gradient profile: 0% B for 0–5 min, 0–15% B for 5–8 min, 15–45% B for 8–50 min, and 45–90% B for 50–55 min. Mass spectra were recorded over the m/z range of 200 to 2000 atomic mass units and processed using both Sequest (Thermo Scientific) and Mascot (Matrix Science) search engines. For the unmodified PpsB protein the sequence coverage was 84%, and the peptide fragment containing Ser-1458 (the site of phosphopantetheinylation) was clearly observed. The sequence coverage for B4M-AcpM was also high (70%). However, although the peptide containing Ser-1458 was now absent in the mass spectrum, a peptide with the expected mass increase resulting from covalent attachment of the B4M-phosphopantetheinyl group was not observed. This is possibly because of a reduction in ionization efficiency caused by the modification. Although the disappearance of the unmodified Ser-1458-containing peptide in the mass spectrum was indirect evidence that modification was successful, the ability of the B4M-PpsB to photocross-link KasA confirmed that Sfp was indeed able to load the B4M-phosphopantetheine onto PpsB. Photo-cross-linking—Purified biotinyl C-12-KasA was combined with an equimolar amount of either B4M-AcpM or B4M-PpsB and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The cross-linking was performed by irradiating the sample with a handheld ultraviolet lamp (365 nm) for 15 min. The resulting cross-linked proteins were concentrated and analyzed by Western blot with either an anti-biotin or anti-His alkaline phosphatase antibody together with the BCIP/NBT phosphatase substrate. In Vitro Reconstitution of PpsB Transfer to the FAS-II Pathway—Previous studies monitored the in vitro synthesis of radiolabeled fatty acids using cell lysates prepared from a strain of M. smegmatis that overexpressed KasA (25Marrakchi H. Laneelle G. Quemard A. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Slayden R.A. Barry III, C.E. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2002; 82: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Slayden R.A. Lee R.E. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used in the present work except that the addition of KasA (10 μm) to the reaction mixture replaced the use of the overexpressing KasA strain. Cell lysates were prepared from 200 ml of M. smegmatis cell culture grown to mid-log phase as described (26Slayden R.A. Barry III, C.E. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2002; 82: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and reactions were performed at pH 8.5 in 2-ml reaction mixtures containing cell lysate, 0.1 mm NADH, 0.1 mm NADPH, 500 mm α-cyclodextrin, 0.2 mm malonyl-CoA, and 150 μg AcpM. Fatty acid biosynthesis was initiated using either [1-14C]palmitoyl-PpsB or [1-14C]palmitoyl-KasA, and reactions were allowed to run at 37 °C overnight. Samples of the starting product, palmitoyl-[1-14C]PpsB, the elongation reaction after 1 h, and the elongation reaction after overnight incubation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 2 ml of 20% tertbutylhydroxide, and the esters were saponified by heating at 120 °C overnight. Reactions were then cooled to room temperature, and the free fatty acids were methylesterified by adding an equal volume of a 40:1 CH2Cl2:MeI solution. The organic layer was separated and dried under air, and the [1-14C]methyl esters were recovered by extraction with ether. Samples were analyzed by C18 reverse-phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) using 1:1 acetonitrile:dioxane as the mobile phase. The separated [1-14C]methyl ester products on the TLC plate and the radiolabeled gel (which was dried using a Bio-Rad gel dryer) were visualized using a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Detection of Interactions between KasA and H37Rv Proteins Using a Bacteria Two-hybrid Screen—The full-length open reading frame of the kasA gene was cloned into the pBT bait plasmid so that KasA was expressed as a fusion protein with a DNA-binding domain (the bacterial phage λcl protein) (28Dove S.L. Joung J.K. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The M. tuberculosis library is composed of random genome fragments cloned into the pTRG target plasmid for expression as a C-terminal fusion with the α-subunit of RNA polymerase, which serves as an activation domain (28Dove S.L. Joung J.K. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Co-transformation of the pBT-kasA plasmid with the pTRG-MTB plasmids into E. coli yielded several colonies on double selective screening media, containing streptomycin and 3-AT, consistent with the activation of the two reporter genes, aadA and HIS3, by a KasA library protein-protein interaction. All library-target plasmids from these colonies were isolated, and the specificity of the interactions with KasA was verified by the absence of growth on double selective LB media upon co-transformation with other bait plasmids such as pBT-LGF2 and pBT-actin. Sequence analysis of the pTRG-MTB plasmids revealed two genes, ppsB and ppsD. Interestingly, both ppsB and ppsD are part of a 50-kb pks gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the virulence lipid PDIM (7Kolattukudy P.E. Fernandes N.D. Azad A.K. Fitzmaurice A.M. Sirakova T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev.

Both ppsB and ppsD encode large multidomain proteins that carry out multiple enzymatic reactions and include an ACP domain that carries the growing acyl product via a phosphopantetheinyl group (22Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 29Walsh C.T. Gehring A.M. Weinreb P.H. Quadri L.E. Flugel R.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The domain boundaries in the PpsB and PpsD proteins were determined utilizing the program NRPS-PKS (17Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Vats A. Ansari M.Z. Tickoo R. Sridharan V. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Ansari M.Z. Yadav G. Gokhale R.S. Mohanty D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W405-W413Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and the region of interaction between KasA and PpsB or PpsD was localized to the C-terminal portion of each protein corresponding to the ACP domain. Because KasA binds substrates attached to the soluble AcpM protein, the observation of an interaction between KasA and the ACP domains of PpsB and PpsD suggested a mechanism for transferring acyl groups between the PDIM and FAS-II biosynthetic pathways. In Vitro Interaction of KasA and PpsB—To demonstrate the functional nature of the interaction between the FAS-II and PDIM pathways, we performed a series of experiments utilizing recombinant KasA and PpsB. KasA was purified from M. smegmatis using an acetamide-inducible mycobacterial expression vector (18Changsen C. Franzblau S.G. Palittapongarnpim P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3682-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and the entire 1538-residue PpsB protein was expressed in E. coli to determine whether KasA was able to interact with the ACP domain in the full-length folded PpsB protein. Peptide digestion and mass spectrometry revealed that the PpsB protein was present in the apoform, indicating that it was not an efficient substrate for the endogenous E. coli phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Consequently, the malonyl-phosphopantetheine and biotinyl C-12-phosphopantetheine groups were subsequently loaded onto PpsB from their respective CoA using the promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferase protein, Sfp, from Bacillus subtilis (17Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Vats A. Ansari M.Z. Tickoo R. Sridharan V. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 22Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Phosphopantetheinylation and the subsequent transfer of the biotinyl C-12 acyl group to KasA were monitored by Western blot using anti-biotin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, the purified biotinyl C-12 group can be transferred from PpsB to KasA (lanes 2 and 3) where it is presumably attached to KasA via the active site Cys-171 residue. Although acyl transfer to KasA involves direct acylation of Cys-171, the second half of the ping-pong reaction catalyzed by KasA involves condensation of the acyl group with malonyl-AcpM to generate a β-ketoacyl-AcpM. Thus, even though the above experiment demonstrates that PpsB can load acyl groups onto KasA, we were also interested in determining whether malonyl-ppsB could act as the second substrate in the KasA reaction. Consequently, malonyl-PpsB was incubated with biotinyl C-12-KasA. However, no biotinylation of the PpsB enzyme was detected, suggesting that the substrate transfer is unidirectional (data not shown). As a control, the ability of KasA to condense the biotinyl C-12 acyl group with malonyl-AcpM was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 4B). To ensure that the proteins interact directly in vitro in order to transfer the substrate, photo-cross-linking experiments were conducted. Using the Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase, the B4M group from B4M-CoA (Fig. 3) was transferred to the ACP domain of PpsB resulting in the generation of a photoreactive B4M-PpsB. Cross-linking was performed in the presence of biotinyl C-12-KasA using 365 nm light, and the biotinyl C-12-KasA·B4M-PpsB complex was detected by Western blot, generating a high molecular mass protein band of more than 200 kDa (Fig. 5A). This observation substantiates the hypothesis that PpsB is capable of transferring an acyl chain into the FAS-II pathway by directly interacting with KasA. Because KasA must interact with AcpM in order to initiate each cycle of elongation in the FAS-II cycle, as a control we also demonstrated that B4M-AcpM was able to photo-cross-link biotinyl C-12-KasA. Fig. 5B indicates the formation of a band on SDS-PAGE of 60 kDa following irradiation of the B4M-AcpM and biotinyl C-12-KasA reaction mixture. As we were able to demonstrate transfer of an acyl group from PpsB to KasA that could then be condensed with malonyl-AcpM, we wanted to determine whether acyl-PpsB could prime fatty acid synthesis in M. smegmatis whole cell lysate. Starting with purified [1-14C]palmitoyl-PpsB, we were able to detect the transfer of the [1-14C] palmitoyl group to both KasA and AcpM by phosphorimaging (Fig. 6A). The elongation of the C16 group by the FAS-II pathway was monitored by reverse-phase TLC and resulted in the same distinctive labeled fatty acid profile observed when [1-14C]palmitoyl-KasA was used as the starting material (Fig. 6, B and C) (26Slayden R.A. Barry III, C.E. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2002; 82: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The FAS-II pathway in mycobacteria is essential for producing long chain fatty acids that serve as the precursors to mycolic acids. Several of the FAS-II components are essential to bacterial survival or replication and have been validated as legitimate drug targets. We have previously hypothesized that enzymes in the FAS-II pathway form a noncovalent complex in vivo (8Rawat R. Whitty A. Tonge P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13881-13886Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and we and others have previously demonstrated the existence of such interactions using two-hybrid techniques (10Veyron-Churlet R. Bigot S. Guerrini O. Verdoux S. Malaga W. Daffe M. Zerbib D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Veyron-Churlet R. Guerrini O. Mourey L. Daffe M. Zerbib D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Kruh N.A. Rawat R. Ruzsicska B.P. Tonge P.J. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The present studies were stimulated by the observation of an unexpected interaction between KasA and proteins involved in PDIM biosynthesis when the full-length KasA protein was used as a bait to screen a mycobacterial library. PpsB is a large, type I, modular polyketide synthase that accepts, elongates, and modifies the fatty acyl chain reaction product of the PpsA enzyme (Fig. 7). Neither PpsA nor PpsB contains an enoyl-reductase or a dehydrase domain, and therefore the product of PpsB contains two hydroxyl groups (a 1,3-diol) (17Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Vats A. Ansari M.Z. Tickoo R. Sridharan V. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The remaining Pps proteins, PpsC–PpsE, all contain both the enoyl-reductase and dehydrase domains and, in turn, are responsible for the addition of saturated alkyl units derived from malonyl or methyl-malonyl-CoA. The hydroxyl groups inserted into the phthiocerol chain by PpsA and PpsB are subsequently coupled with mycocerosic acids, which are in turn synthesized by the Mas polyketide synthase that extends C16–C18 fatty acids with methylmalonyl units, to give the final phthiocerol dimycocerosate (17Trivedi O.A.

Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16741-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although some interactions involved in both FAS-II and PDIM biosynthetic pathways have been identified previously, this is the first evidence of a protein-protein interaction linking the two systems (10Veyron-Churlet R. Bigot S. Guerrini O. Verdoux S. Malaga W. Daffe M. Zerbib D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Veyron-Churlet R. Guerrini O. Mourey L. Daffe M. Zerbib D.

Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is clear from these experiments that the interaction between KasA and PpsB is specific and results in the transfer of substrate from PpsB to KasA. Although the experiments conducted here were conducted with palmitate, the ability of PpsB to load acyl groups onto KasA would result in the incorporation of a dihyroxy group into the long chain fatty acids produced by the mycobacterium. We propose that this is an additional mechanism for increasing the diversity of lipids in the cell and note that there are drastic alterations in the cell wall during the infection process resulting in part from a shift in lipid production (34Jain M.

In this study we have examined the effect of chronic inhibition of spinal cord activity on motoneuron survival and differentiation. Early spinal cord activity in chick embryos was blocked using an avian replication-competent retroviral vector RCASBP (B) carrying the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1. Chicken embryos were infected with one of the following constructs: RCASBP(B), RCASBP(B)-Kir2.1, or RCASBP(B)-GFP. Infection of chicken embryos at E2 resulted in widespread expression of the viral protein marker p27 gag throughout the spinal cord. Electrophysiological recordings revealed the presence of functional Kir2.1 channels in RCASBP(B)-Kir2.1 but not in RCASBP(B)-infected embryos. Kir2.1 expression significantly reduced the generation of spontaneous motor movements in chicken embryos developing in ovo. Suppression of spontaneous electrical activity was not due to a reduction in the number of surviving motoneurons or the number of synapses in hindlimb muscle tissue. Disruption of the normal pattern of activity in chicken embryos resulted in a significant downregulation in the functional expression of large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels. Reduction of spinal cord activity also generates a significant acceleration in the inactivation rate of A-type K(+) currents without any significant change in current density. Kir2.1 expression did not affect the expression of voltage-gated Na(+) channels or cell capacitance. These experiments demonstrate that chronic inhibition of chicken spinal cord activity causes a significant change in the electrical properties of developing motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2080479258,"Stigmatellin, a QP site inhibitor, inhibits electron transfer from iron-sulfur protein (ISP) to cytochrome c1 in the bc1 complex. Stigmatellin raises the midpoint potential of ISP from 290 mV to 540 mV. The binding of stigmatellin to the fully oxidized complex, oxidized completely by catalytic amounts of cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c, results in ISP reduction. The extent of ISP reduction is proportional to the amount of inhibitor used and reaches a maximum when the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme complex reaches unity. A g = 2.005 EPR peak, characteristic of an organic free radical, is also observed when stigmatellin is added to the oxidized complex, and its signal intensity depends on the amount of stigmatellin. Addition of ferricyanide, a strong oxidant, to the oxidized complex also generates a g = 2.005 EPR peak that is oxidant concentration-dependent. Oxygen radicals are generated when stigmatellin is added to the oxidized complex in the absence of the exogenous substrate, ubiquinol. The amount of oxygen radical formed is proportional to the amount of stigmatellin added. Oxygen radicals are not generated when stigmatellin is added to a mutant bc1 complex lacking the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster. Based on these results, it is proposed that ISP becomes a strong oxidant upon stigmatellin binding, extracting electrons from an organic compound, likely an amino acid residue. This results in the reduction of ISP and generation of organic radicals.

Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This enzyme complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cyt c (c2 in bacteria) with concomitant translocation of protons across the membrane to generate a proton electrochemical gradient required for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. The cyt bc1 complexes from all species contain three core subunits, cyt b, cyt c1, and Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), that house two b-type cyts (b566 and b562), one c-type cyt (c1), and a high potential Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster, respectively. Depending on the source, the cyt bc1 complexes contain various numbers (0–8) of nonredox group-containing subunits, also called supernumerary subunits. Recently, the three-dimensional crystal structures of mitochondrial bc1 complexes from bovine (2Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

The structure of the cyt b6f complex, a complex analogous to the cyt bc1 complex, which provides an electronic connection between photosystems I and II, has also been established for the thermophilic cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus (6Kurisu G.

The three-dimensional structural information for the mitochondrial bc1 complex establishes the location of the redox centers, the number of trans-membrane helices, quinone binding at the QN site, and inhibitor binding at both the QP and QN sites (2Xia D.

Strong evidence in support of this movement has been reported (10Tian H. Yu L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) has been favored for describing electron and proton translocation in the cyt bc1 complex. The key feature of this model is the presence of two separate ubiquinol/ubiquinone binding sites; a ubiquinol oxidation site (QP) near the P (intermembranes space) side of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and a ubiquinone reduction site (QN) near the N (matrix) side. X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed binding of ubiquinone at the QN site (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 8Gao X. Wen X. Esser L. Quinn B. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9067-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, ubiquinone or ubiquinol binding at the QP site has not been observed in native crystal structures, thereby preventing establishment of the putative QP site. Therefore, discussions on the mechanisms of electron transfer are based primarily on the positions occupied by inhibitors, and assumptions are made to reflect a similar site for binding of the natural substrate, ubiquinol. Detailed bifurcation of ubiquinol oxidation, the key step in the Q-cycle mechanism, is difficult to establish, although several models have been proposed (22Link T.A.

Acta. 1984; 765: 227-235Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) of the cyt bc1 complex, binds to cyt b at a domain distal from heme bL. It interacts with the Rieske ISP through the formation of a H-bond with His-161, and with cyt b by H-bonding with Glu-272, whose side chain undergoes a rotation of ∼160° from its native position (9Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The H-bonded configuration of quinone and stigmatellin in the bc1 complex were shown to be similar (27Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that the binding of stigmatellin resembles that of a quinol oxidation intermediate (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H.

Herein, we report the effect of stigmatellin on the redox state of oxidized cyt bc1 complexes. The importance of phospholipids for binding of stigmatellin was established. Generation of free radicals, upon addition of stigmatellin, was explored by analysis of the g = 2.005 EPR signal. Production of superoxide by the bc1 complex in the presence of stigmatellin was determined in wild-type cyt bc1 complex and compared with a mutant complex lacking the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster (ISC). Materials—Cyt c (horse heart, type III), stigmatellin, 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methyl-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3 (7H)– one hydrochloride (MCLA), superoxide dismutase, and thermolysin were from Sigma. Azolectin was obtained from Associate Concentrate and purified according to the method of Kagawa and Racker (31Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Octyl-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6 were obtained from GE Healthcare. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DM) and n-dodecyl-β-d-glucopyranoside were from Anatrace. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gel and a Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit were from Qiagen. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-bromodecyl-1,4-benzoquinol (Q0C10BrH2) was prepared in our laboratory as reported previously (11Tian H. White S. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Enzyme Preparations and Activity Assay—Chromatophores and intracytoplasmic membranes were prepared as described previously (10Tian H. Yu L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and stored at –80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. The His6-tagged cyt bc1 complexes were purified from frozen intracytoplasmic membranes or chromatophores by the method of Tian et al. (10Tian H. Yu L. Michael W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Purified cyt bc1 complexes were stored at –80 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol. To assay ubiquinol-cyt c reductase activity, membrane preparations or purified cyt bc1 complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% DM to a final cyt b concentration of 1 μm.5 μl of the diluted samples were added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm EDTA, 50 μm ferricytochrome c, and 25 μm Q0C10BrH2. Activities were determined by measuring the reduction of cyt c, by following the increase in the absorbance at 550 nm, in a Shimadzu UV-2450 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm–1 cm–1 for calculations. The nonenzymatic oxidation of Q0C10BrH2 determined under similar conditions in the absence of the enzyme was subtracted during calculations for specific activity. Potassium cyanide was added to a final concentration of 30 μm in the assay mixture to inhibit cyt c oxidase, when determining the cyt bc1 activity in intracytoplasmic membranes or chromatophores. EPR Experiments—The redox state of the Rieske ISP was determined by EPR (32McCurley J.P. Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an Air Products flow cryostat. Cyt bc1 complex diluted in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% DM, was incubated with 5 mm ascorbate on ice for 20 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cyt bc1 complexes were oxidized by overnight incubation with 1 μm cyt c oxidase and 1 μm cyt c. Variable amounts of stigmatellin were added to oxidized bc1 complexes, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. EPR spectra were recorded at 100 K with the following instrument settings: microwave frequency, 9.39 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 6.3 G; time constant, 655.4 ms; and sweep time, 167.8 s. Each spectrum represents an average of three different traces. Isolation of Rieske ISP from Rhodobacter sphaeroides bc1 Complex—Wild-type cyt bc1 complex was diluted to 50 μm cyt b in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% DM. The mixture was gently shaken at 4 °C for 90 min and applied to an octyl-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.01% DM, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The column was washed with 1 gel volume of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% DM, and 1 mm DTT followed by a stepwise decrease in NaCl concentration to 75 mm and 50 mm. The column was then washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% DM, and 1 mm DTT followed by the same buffer containing only 0.01% DM. The eluates from all five washes were combined and subsequently passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 1 mm MgSO4 and 1 mm DTT. The column was then washed with 1 gel volume of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. The eluates were combined and passed through a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6 column from GE Healthcare that was previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.01% DM and 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% DM, and 1 mm DTT. The Rieske ISP was finally eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, containing 0.01% DM, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Measurement of Superoxide Anion Generation—Superoxide generation by the cyt bc1 complex was determined by measuring the chemiluminescence of MCLA-superoxide anion ( O2·¯) adduct in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer SX.18MV, by leaving the excitation light off and registering light emission (33Denicola A. Souza J.M. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 23 °C, by mixing solutions A and B in a 1:1 ratio. Solution A contained 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCN, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% DM, and 6 μm cyt bc1 complex. Solution B was the same as solution A except that the cyt bc1 complex was replaced with either 50 μm Q0C10BrH2 or 30 μm stigmatellin and 4 μm MCLA. Preparation of Phospholipid-deficient Mitochondrial bc1 Complex—Phospholipid and Q-depleted preparation of mitochondrial bc1 complex was prepared by repeated ammonium sulfate fractionation in the presence of 0.5% sodium cholate in 50 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cyt bc1 complex was diluted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% sodium cholate. Neutralized saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to 48% saturation. After stirring for 5 min, the solution was centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 10 min. The precipitate thus obtained was dissolved in 50 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer containing 0.5% cholate. Neutralized ammonium sulfate solution was added to 45% saturation, stirred for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 44,000 × g for 10 min. This process was repeated three more times with 40% ammonium sulfate saturation. The precipitate was finally dissolved in 50 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol. Extraction of Ubiquinone/Ubiquinol from cyt bc1 Complex—A semimicro assay was employed for extraction of ubiquinol/ubiquinone from mitochondrial and bacterial bc1 complexes (34Pumphrey A.M. Redfearn E.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 76: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1 ml of solution containing 2–5 mg of protein was placed in a 45-ml glass centrifuge tube. Rapid addition of 4 ml of cold methanol using a hypodermic needle was immediately followed by the addition of 5 ml of hexane. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged for 2 min to separate the layers. The upper layer of hexane was transferred to another glass centrifuge tube, and 3 ml of hexane was added to the lower layer for further extraction. After vortexing and centrifugation as described above, the upper hexane layer was collected and combined with the first extraction. The hexane extract was placed in a vacuum desiccator to evaporate the hexane. Residual lipid was dissolved in spectroscopically pure ethanol. The amount of ubiquinone/ubiquinol extracted was determined spectroscopically in a Shimadzu UV-2450 PC spectrophotometer. Other Biochemical and Biophysical Techniques—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyt b (36Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and cyt c1 (37Yu L. Dong J.H. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) concentrations were determined according to published methods. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (38Laemmli V.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad mini-protean dual slab vertical cell. Stigmatellin-induced Reduction of the Rieske ISC—The EPR spectrum of reduced ISC shows rhombic symmetry with three characteristic g values; gz = 2.02, gy = 1.89, and gx = 1.80 (39Orme-Johnson N.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 45: 871-878Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the presence of ascorbate, the EPR spectrum of the cyt bc1 complex from R. sphaeroides displays the characteristic g values signaling ISC reduction (Fig. 1, trace A). Interestingly, the addition of stigmatellin to R. sphaeroides bc1 complex, oxidized by incubation overnight with enzymatic amounts of cyt c oxidase and cyt c, results in reduction of ISC in the absence of an apparent electron source (Fig. 1, trace B). Reduction of ISC is also observed in oxidized cyt bc1 complexes from bovine mitochondria upon the addition of stigmatellin (data not shown). Moreover, addition of stigmatellin to the cyt bc1 complex results in narrowing of EPR line width and, shifts in gy and gx values, as has been reported previously (40von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Complete oxidation of the cyt bc1 complex before the addition of stigmatellin is confirmed by the absence of the characteristic EPR signals of reduced ISC (Fig. 1, trace C). Stigmatellin contains a 5,7-dimethoxy-8-hydroxychromone system with a hydrophobic alkenyl chain at position 2 (29Thierbach G. Kunze B. Reichenbach H. Höfle G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 227-235Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of stigmatellin to cyt bc1 complex increases the redox midpoint potential of the Rieske ISP from 290 mV to 540 mV (40von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, stigmatellin arrests the head domain of ISP at the “fixed” or b-position, proximal to cyt b, as shown by the anomalous diffraction signals indicating dramatic reduction in the mobility of the ISC (9Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the ubiquinol-cyt c reductase activity of R. sphaeroides bc1 complex in the presence of varying amounts of stigmatellin. Stigmatellin inhibits the complex with a stoichiometry of 0.5 mol of inhibitor per mol (monomer) of bc1 complex. Similar stoichiometric values have been demonstrated in cyt bc1 complexes from yeast (41Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in submitochondrial particles (40von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This indicates that the binding of stigmatellin to only one monomer per dimer is sufficient to abolish bc1 complex activity. Binding also exhibits negative cooperativity; i.e. stigmatellin binds to a monomer of every inhibitor-free dimer before it binds to the second monomer (41Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ISP reduction induced by stigmatellin binding to the fully oxidized bc1 complex at various concentrations of the inhibitor is shown in Fig. 2B. Maximal reduction is obtained at a stoichiometry of 1 inhibitor per bc1 complex monomer, indicating that binding to every monomer is necessary for complete ISC reduction. Similarly, one molecule of stigmatellin per bc1 complex monomer was required to obtain maximal spectral shift of dithionite-reduced cyt b (40von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Binding of stigmatellin to the cyt bc1 complex elevates the midpoint potential of the Rieske ISP, thereby generating a strong electron sink that results in reduction of the ISC in the absence of an apparent electron source. Upon increasing the potential from – 0.272 to 0.708 V, electrochemically induced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy difference spectra of stigmatellin-treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyt bc1 complex indicated that the inhibitor itself is redox active: it can undergo reduction but not oxidation (42Ritter M. Palsdottir H. Abe M. Mäntele W. Hunte C. Miyoshi H. Hellwig P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8439-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not likely that stigmatellin can serve as an electron donor for ISP when the oxidized complex is treated with the inhibitor. The possibility that the 8-hydroxy group of the chromone ring system of stigmatellin may directly reduce the Rieske ISC was investigated by adding stigmatellin to pure Rieske ISP isolated from R. sphaeroides bc1 complex. The EPR spectrum of isolated ISP was recorded in the presence of either stigmatellin or ascorbate (Fig. 3B). In the presence of ascorbate, the characteristic EPR spectrum for reduced Rieske ISP with its distinct g values is observed, indicating that the ISC is not lost during purification of ISP from the cyt bc1 complex. The gx signal of the isolated Rieske ISP is broad with g = 1.75–1.77. Similar broadening of the gx signal has been reported in bc1 complexes with either an empty QP site, with reduced ubiquinol present or in the presence of a beta-methoxyacrylate type inhibitor (40von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Addition of stigmatellin to oxidized ISP does not cause any reduction of the ISC as evidenced by a lack of the characteristic EPR signals (Fig. 3B). Therefore, stigmatellin does not reduce the ISC directly, but upon binding to the bc1 complex induces electron transfer to the ISC. Stigmatellin, like other Pf inhibitors of the cyt bc1 complex, does not bind to isolated Rieske ISP, but binds to the cyt b subunit at the QP site proximal to ISP and distal from heme bL (43Snyder C.H. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The necessity of stigmatellin binding to the cyt bc1 complex for ISC reduction was further evaluated in phospholipid-deficient bovine cyt bc1 complexes where 90% of the phospholipids and ubiquinone/ubiquinol molecules are removed by repeated cholate-ammonium acetate fractionation (44Yu L. Yu C.A. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Delipidation of mitochondrial bc1 complex results in loss of ubiquinol-cyt c reductase activity, but reconstitution with exogenous phospholipids restores a significant amount of the inhibitor-sensitive activity (data not shown). The EPR spectrum of phospholipid-deficient bc1 complex in the presence of stigmatellin shows no ISC reduction, whereas ISC reduction is observed in the presence of ascorbate (data not shown). This indicates that stigmatellin is unable to induce ISC reduction in phospholipid-deficient cyt bc1 complexes. However, incubation of the phospholipid-deficient cyt bc1 complex with azolectin, phospholipids from soybean, before adding stigmatellin restores a significant amount of the ISC reduction (data not shown). This demonstrates that phospholipids are essential for binding of stigmatellin to the cyt bc1 complex, and correct binding is necessary for the stigmatellin-induced ISC reduction. Furthermore, endogenous ubiquinol can effectively be ruled out as the electron source for ISP reduction induced by stigmatellin because ISP reduction is observed in phospholipids-supplemented, ubiquinol-deficient mitochondrial bc1 complex. It is possible that the Tris used during purification of the bc1 complex is responsible for stigmatellin-induced reduction of the Rieske ISC. However, stigmatellin-induced reduction of the Rieske ISC is also observed in bc1 complexes purified using Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, thereby unambiguously eliminating the -OH groups of Tris as a possible source of electrons (data not shown). Characterization of Free Radicals Generated by the Cyt bc1 Complex in the Presence of Stigmatellin or Ferricyanide—In addition to reduction of the Rieske ISC, an EPR peak with a symmetrical line shape and g value centered at g = 2.005, typical characteristics of an organic free radical are observed when stigmatellin is added to oxidized cyt bc1 complex. The intensity of the g = 2.005 EPR signal increases with varying amounts of stigmatellin (Fig. 4A). The maximal signal is observed when 15 mol of inhibitor is added per mol of cyt bc1 complex. Stigmatellin increases the midpoint potential of the Rieske ISP by ∼260–540 mV, resulting in the generation of a strong oxidizing agent. Because of its acquired oxidative nature, we speculate that the Rieske ISC extracts an electron from nearby organic residues, leading to its reduction and the subsequent generation of organic free r"

https://openalex.org/W2037577186,"The high affinity of IgE for its receptor, FcϵRI (Ka ∼ 1010 m–1), is responsible for the persistence of mast cell sensitization. Cross-linking of FcϵRI-bound IgE by multivalent allergen leads to cellular activation and release of pro-inflammatory mediators responsible for the symptoms of allergic disease. We previously demonstrated that limiting the IgE-FcϵRI interaction to just one of the two Cϵ3 domains in IgE-Fc, which together constitute the high affinity binding site, results in 1000-fold reduced affinity. Such attenuation, effected by a small molecule binding to part of the IgE:FcϵRI interface or a distant allosteric site, rather than complete blocking of the interaction, may represent a viable approach to the treatment of allergic disease. However, the degree to which the interaction would need to be disrupted is unclear, because the importance of high affinity for immediate hypersensitivity has never been investigated. We have incorporated into human IgE a mutation, R334S, previously characterized in IgE-Fc, which reduces its affinity for FcϵRI ∼50-fold. We have compared the ability of wild type and R334S IgE to stimulate allergen-induced mast cell activation in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed the expected difference in affinity between wild type and mutant IgE for FcϵRI (∼50-fold) and found that, in vitro, mast cell degranulation was reduced proportionately. The effect in vivo was also marked, with a 75% reduction in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis response. We have therefore demonstrated that the high affinity of IgE for FcϵRI is critical to the allergic response, and that even moderate attenuation of this affinity has a substantial effect in vivo.

We have therefore demonstrated that the high affinity of IgE for FcϵRI is critical to the allergic response, and that even moderate attenuation of this affinity has a substantial effect in vivo. The binding of IgE to its high affinity receptor, FcϵRI, is a critical common step in the allergic reaction (1Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). IgE, bound to FcϵRI expressed on the surface of mast cells and basophils, can be cross-linked by specific multivalent antigen to effect the release of inflammatory mediators. These mediators are responsible for the symptoms associated with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction and the subsequent allergic cascade. The affinity of the complex formed between FcϵRI and IgE is extremely high (Ka ∼ 1010 m–1) (2Miller L. Blank U. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Science. 1989; 244: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), with a half-life of ∼16 h on cells in suspension (3Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. Amos B. Progress in Immunology I.

The crystal structure of this complex has revealed two separate and extensive contact sites for FcϵRI on the IgE molecule, one on each chain of the antibody (5Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In previous work we showed that interaction with both sites is critical for high affinity binding and that engagement of only one lowers the affinity by 3 orders of magnitude (6Hunt J. Beavil R.L.

We further suggested that partially blocking the binding of IgE to FcϵRI, for example by a small molecule that inhibits binding to one of the two sites, might have a significant effect on allergic sensitization. However, if this is to have therapeutic potential, it is important to determine the degree to which the affinity of IgE for FcϵRI must be reduced to impact on the allergic reaction. Here we describe an investigation into the properties of an IgE molecule with attenuated affinity for FcϵRI. Specifically, a recombinant hapten-specific IgE molecule was engineered with a single point mutation (R334S) in the FcϵRI-binding site. This mutation has previously been shown to disrupt, but not abrogate, the binding of IgE-Fc fragments to FcϵRI (7Henry A.J. Cook J.P. McDonnell J.M. Mackay G.A. Shi J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, the mutation acts as a model for the effect of partial inhibition on IgE function by a small molecule. There is growing evidence that small molecules can disrupt protein-protein interfaces (8Wells J.A. McClendon C.L. Nature. 2007; 450: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), the binding energies of which are often dominated by a small number of individual amino acid residues or “hot spots” (9Bogan A.A.

It was also tested in vivo in a PCA reaction using a human FcϵRI transgenic mouse model. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE—A new vector, termed pSV-VNP Hϵ R334S, encoding an NP-specific human IgE heavy chain incorporating an R334S mutation, was created using the Quickchange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the vector pSV-VNP Hϵ (11Bruggemann M. Williams G.T. Bindon C.I. Clark M.R. Walker M.R. Jefferis R. Waldmann H. Neuberger M.S. J. Exp.

Cells expressing R334S NP-IgE and NP-IgE (ECACC 87080706) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and IgE was purified by affinity chromatography (11Bruggemann M.

After affinity purification, the eluted IgE was concentrated by microfiltration, and antibody monomer was isolated from the aggregate by gel filtration chromatography using a S200 10/300 GL Superdex column (GE Biosciences) run at 0.75 ml/min in a Tris-saline buffer (0.5 m Tris, 0.25 m NaCl, pH 7.2). The integrity of the protein was further confirmed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. SPR Analysis of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE Using Biacore—SPR assays were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare), as described previously (6Hunt J. Beavil R.L. Calvert R.A. Gould H.J.

Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation package (version 4.1, GE Healthcare) with double referencing applied (13Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In Vitro Degranulation Assays—The ability of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE to cause degranulation was measured in vitro using the RBL-SX38 cell line; this expresses the human tetramer form of FcϵRI (14Wiegand T.W. Williams P.B. Dreskin S.C. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Tasset D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 221-230PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained under standard culture conditions. For degranulation assays, cells were plated overnight (2 × 104 per well in flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates) and the following day sensitized for 2 h with IgE at indicated concentrations. Cells were then washed twice (Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% BSA) and triggered for 30 min with 100 μl of NIP5-BSA (Biosearch Technologies) at 100 ng/ml in wash buffer. Degranulation was terminated by placing the cells on ice. Supernatants were collected, including controls (cells treated with no antigen for background release or wash buffer plus 1% Triton X for total release). Degranulation was measured by release of β-hexosaminidase, assayed using a fluorogenic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide) (15Hammond G. Koffer A. Celis J.E. Carter N. Simons K. Small J.V. Hunter T. Shotton D. Cell Biology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2006: 221-227Google Scholar). Background release, subtracted from all values, was always <10% of total release. Data were fitted to a nonlinear regression model using Prism (GraphPad software) to obtain EC50 values. Stimulation with Immobilized Antigen-IgE Complexes—Cells were stimulated with immobilized antigen-IgE complexes according to a method adapted from Yamasaki et al. (16Yamasaki S. Ishikawa E. Kohno M. Saito T. Blood. 2004; 103: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bone marrow-derived mast cells prepared from hFcϵRI Tg mice were loaded with [3H]serotonin (used as a measure of degranulation) (17Dombrowicz D. Brini A.T. Flamand V. Hicks E. Snouwaert J.N. Kinet J.P. Koller B.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1645-1651PubMed Google Scholar). Resuspended cells (1 × 106/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution, 1% BSA) were centrifuged at 400 × g onto 24-well tissue culture plates coated with antigen-IgE complexes, or antigen alone as a control (200 μl per well), prepared as described (16Yamasaki S. Ishikawa E. Kohno M. Saito T. Blood. 2004; 103: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, degranulation was left to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C; controls and reaction termination were carried out as for RBL-SX38 assays. Radioactivity in the supernatant was assessed by scintillation counting. Detection of IgE Binding to RBL-SX38 Cells by Flow Cytometry—Cells sensitized according to the degranulation protocol were washed and treated, on ice, with the protein-protein cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 15 min, harvested by trypsinization, followed by washing with FACS buffer (PBS with 2% normal goat serum). Cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-IgE (Vector Laboratories), washed, and analyzed for IgE binding relative to untreated controls using a FACSCalibur and Cellquest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Titration of NP-IgE in a hFcϵRI Tg Mouse Model of PCA—The minimal amount of NP-IgE required to give maximal PCA in hFcϵRI Tg mice (17Dombrowicz D. Brini A.T. Flamand V. Hicks E. Snouwaert J.N.

Cell. 1993; 75: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) was measured, using the extravasation of Evans blue dye into IgE sensitized ears following antigen challenge as an indicator. Eighteen mice were divided into six groups of 3; for each mouse one ear was sensitized with a specific concentration of NP-IgE in PBS by intradermal injection (total volume 20 μl) and the other ear with PBS alone. Forty eight hours after sensitization, animals were injected in the tail vein with 200 μl of PBS containing 100 μg of NIP5-BSA and 2% Evans blue dye. Animals were sacrificed 1.5 h after intravenous antigen challenge, and ears amputated, cut to identical sizes, and Evans blue dye extracted into 1 ml of formamide by mincing followed by incubation at 80 °C; dye was measured by absorbance at 620 nm after filtration to remove ear debris. Effect of the R334S Mutation on PCA—Once the appropriate dose of NP-IgE was determined by titration in the PCA model, a further experiment was carried out to assess the effect of the R334S mutation. Intensity of PCA was compared between the ears of mice sensitized with 20 μg of NP-IgE and with 20 μg of R334S NP-IgE in opposite ears. Antigen challenge was then carried out at 24, 48, or 96 h (n = 2–7), and samples were processed as described for the NP-IgE titration. Significant differences between R334S IgE and the wild type were determined for each time point on the basis of a two-tailed t test. Rate of Clearance of NP-IgE from Mouse Ear Tissue—For experiments measuring the rate of IgE diffusion out of ears, 14 μg of NP-IgE or R334S NP-IgE in a 20-μl volume was injected into the dorsal surface of the mouse ear. Mice (n = 9) were sacrificed either 24, 48, or 96 h later without antigen challenge or Evans blue dye injection, and ears were removed and cut to identical sizes. IgE was extracted from ear tissue by homogenization of each individual ear in Lysis Buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5%Nonidet P-40). Supernatants containing IgE extracts were stored at –80 °C until ELISA analysis. IgE ELISA—ELISA was used for detection of human IgE according to a standard method (19McCloskey N. Hunt J. Beavil R.L. Jutton M.R. Grundy G.J. Girardi E. Fabiane S.M. Fear D.J. Conrad D.H. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24083-24091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For detection of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE in mouse ear homogenates, known concentrations of both NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE were used to confirm equal detection of both and to enable adjustment for differences in signal between plates. Expression and Characterization of R334S NP-IgE—R334S NP-IgE was expressed and purified and found to be identical to NP-IgE as judged by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1, A and B). SPR Analysis of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE Using Biacore—Biacore analysis of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE showed distinct differences in their kinetics of binding to sFcϵRIα (Fig. 2, A and B), with the values for NP-IgE in good agreement with those previously published for full-length IgE, and the R334S IgE values in agreement with those for an R334S IgE-Fc fragment (7Henry A.J. Cook J.P. McDonnell J.M. Mackay G.A. Shi J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NP-IgE affinity constants were Ka1 = 0.40 × 107 m–1, Ka2 = 1.53 × 109 m–1, R1/R0 = 0.03 ± 0.01, and for R334S NP-IgE were Ka1 = 0.96 × 107 m–1, Ka2 = 4.68 × 107 m–1, R1/R0 = 0.31 ± 0.04; see Table 1 for complete kinetic data. Two association constant values are presented because IgE binding to sFcϵRIα is fitted to a biphasic kinetic model (7Henry A.J. Cook J.P. McDonnell J.M. Mackay G.A. Shi J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of these higher and lower affinity components are described by the R1/R0 ratio (being the fractional contribution of the first, Ka1 component). The R334S mutation has a significant effect on both the principal component (Ka2), mainly because of a faster off-rate (see Table 1), and the R1/R0 ratio. Overall, this means that the R334S mutation decreases the affinity of IgE for FcϵRI by ∼50-fold if an average weighted affinity is calculated (based on the different contributions of the two affinity constants according to the R1/R0 values) or 33-fold if only the major component is compared (Ka2).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters and affinity constants derived from the SPR analysis of NP-IgE and R334S NP IgE binding to immobilized FcϵRIαConstantNP-IgER334S NP-IgEDeviation of R334S NP-IgE from NP-IgEka1 (m-1 s-1)(0.85 ± 2.7) × 105(1.27 ± 0.24) × 105Within errorkd1 (s-1)(2.14 ± 0.48) × 10-2(1.32 ± 0.16) × 10-2Within errorka2 (m-1 s-1)(1.88 ± 0.51) × 105(8.25 ± 2.3) × 104∼2× slowerkd2 (s-1)(1.23 ± 0.31) × 10-4(1.71 ± 0.12) × 10-3∼10× fasterKa1 (m-1)0.40 × 1070.96 × 107Within errorKa2 (m-1)1.53 × 1094.68 × 107∼33× lowerR1/R00.03 ± 0.010.31 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Comparison of NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE in Vitro Degranulation—The ability of the R334S NP-IgE to initiate the allergic cascade was first measured in vitro using the RBL-SX38 cell line, which expresses the human form of FcϵRI (14Wiegand T.W. Williams P.B. Dreskin S.C. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Tasset D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 221-230PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments a clear difference in the EC50 was observed for the R334S NP-IgE (2.5 μg/ml) when compared with NP-IgE (0.025 μg/ml); see Fig. 3A for a representative plot. The range observed for the difference between R334S NP-IgE and NP-IgE was 40–100-fold, with the mean EC50 (concentration at which 50% of the maximum effect is observed) for NP-IgE 0.11 ± 0.04 nm and for R334S NP-IgE 6.7 ± 5.4 nm (both n = 5). According to SPR measurements the R334S IgE dissociates from FcϵRI on the time scale of the degranulation experiments (compare Fig. 2, A with B). Therefore the differences observed in maximum degranulation, measured for R334S NP-IgE compared with wild type NP-IgE, may be due to R334S IgE-FcϵRI complexes dissociating prior to the completion of downstream signaling cascades necessary for full stimulation. To address this, the amount of FcϵRI-bound IgE present at the time of antigen challenge was estimated by flow cytometry, to correlate it with the level of degranulation produced. Cells used for flow cytometric analyses were treated in an identical manner to those used for degranulation experiments, except that instead of antigen challenge, they were treated with a chemical cross-linker to covalently couple receptor-bound IgE to the cell, but not IgE free in solution (Fig. 3B and inset). In the flow cytometry experiment 0.1 μg/ml NP-IgE resulted in a level of receptor occupancy equivalent to sensitization with 10 μg/ml R334S NP-IgE, and these concentrations yielded similar degranulation values (compare orange and green columns and flow cytometry plots in Fig. 3B). Finally, it was investigated whether indeed R334S NP-IgE was capable of producing equivalent levels of degranulation as NP-IgE when receptor occupancy was equal. This was achieved by using avidity to overcome the effect of the R334S mutation. To ensure that all antigen was engaged simultaneously, cells were spun onto either wild type or R334S IgE that had been captured on a tissue culture plate coated with NIP-BSA. In these experiments the R334S NP-IgE and NP-IgE were found to be equivalent; see Fig. 3C. Comparison of Wild Type NP-IgE and R334S NP-IgE in Vivo—The in vitro assays indicate that the lower affinity of R334S NP-IgE hinders its ability to induce an allergic response compared with wild type NP-IgE. To discover whether these results are translated in vivo, the mutant and wild type IgE were compared in a transgenic human FcϵRI mouse model of PCA. First, the wild type molecule was titrated to establish the level at which maximal degranulation was achieved after 48 h of sensitization (10 μg of IgE per ear; see Fig. 4A, inset panel). Mice were then injected with either NP-IgE or R334S NP-IgE in excess of this concentration (20 μg), and the PCA reaction was monitored after 24, 48, and 96 h (see Fig. 4A, main panel). At doses in excess of those identified as necessary to yield maximal degranulation 48 h after sensitization, the R334S mutant was only ∼25% as effective as the wild type IgE in eliciting a PCA reaction (differences were significant to p = 0.002). Significant differences were also noted at 24 h (p = 0.02) and 96 h (p = 0.001). To determine whether this reduction was the result of an increased rate of clearance of the R334S NP-IgE from the ear, resulting from its lower affinity for FcϵRI, or the result of a difference in the ability of the IgE to sensitize the effector cells in the ear, dosing was repeated, and the relative amount of IgE present in the ear was assayed at each time point (Fig. 4B). ELISA analysis from unchallenged sensitized ears indicated that, within a 96-h time frame, the rate of loss of IgE from the ear did not differ between the wild type and R334S molecules; values for each time point were compared on the basis of a t test (not shown). The experiments described in this study were carried out to ascertain the degree to which the allergic response is susceptible to changes in the IgE:FcϵRI affinity constant. We engineered an anti-NP-specific IgE molecule containing the R334S mutation and demonstrated a reduction in affinity for FcϵRI of between 33- and 50-fold (SPR data, Fig. 2). This is consistent with earlier studies in which the R334S mutation in IgE-Fc led to a decrease in affinity of between 15-fold (cell binding data) and 120-fold (SPR data) (7Henry A.J. Cook J.P. McDonnell J.M. Mackay G.A. Shi J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The creation of a full-length R334S IgE enabled us to study the functional consequences of a reduction in IgE-FcϵRI interaction affinity following allergen challenge both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro degranulation assays demonstrated that the presence of the R334S mutation led to an ∼60-fold increase in the EC50 compared with wild type IgE (Fig. 3A). The difference in potency between R334S and wild type IgE simply reflects a difference in FcϵRI occupancy at the time of allergen challenge, rather than the degree of cross-linking, as the change in affinity constant parallels that for the reduction in effector cell response. This was confirmed by in vitro experiments that showed a correlation between levels of R334S and wild type IgE bound to the cell, and subsequent degranulation (Fig. 3B). Indeed, when equal FcϵRI occupancy by R334S to wild type IgE was forced (Fig. 3C), degranulation responses were equal. However, this situation does not reflect how allergen would be encountered in vivo. Using an in vivo model of PCA, a 75% reduction in cellular activation was observed with R334S IgE relative to its wild type counterpart (Fig. 4A). This is despite the fact that equivalent amounts of IgE were present in the tissue at the time of antigen challenge (Fig. 4B). The similarity in the slow clearance rates of wild type and mutant IgE is unsurprising, given that the half-life of free immunoglobulin injected into skin is ∼2.5 days (20Tada T. Okumura K. Platteau B. Beckers A. Bazin H. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1975; 48: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a function of the size of the molecule and restricted diffusion in tissue. Therefore, at all times within the time frame of our experiments, the reduced PCA mediated by R334S IgE is not the result of preferential clearance from the tissue but is reduced receptor occupancy. Our data thus demonstrate that the effect of the R334S mutation is to shift the response curve for effector cell stimulation to the right. Critically, a mere 50-fold reduction in affinity leads to a marked reduction in an in vivo allergic response. The importance of these observations is that they demonstrate that the allergic response is titratable. It is well established that IgE: FcϵRI-stimulated effector mechanisms are sensitive to blocking by antibodies (21Chang T.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), as exemplified by the successful introduction of an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody therapy, omalizumab. Anti-IgE functions by lowering the amount of IgE that is free in serum to bind FcϵRI. As a consequence, the number of IgE-FcϵRI complexes present on effector cells is reduced, such that they are below the critical level for effective antigenic stimulation (22MacGlashan Jr., D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1050: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). (Indeed, reduced IgE occupancy of FcϵRI leads to down-regulation of surface-expressed receptor, further amplifying this effect (23MacGlashan Jr., D. Lichtenstein L.M. Kenzie-White J. Chichester K. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 492-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).) We now show that an IgE molecule with reduced affinity for receptor has a similar outcome. A small molecule inhibitor of the FcϵRI-IgE interaction would create such a population of attenuated molecules, thereby presenting a route to low cost allergy therapy. The crystal structure of the complex between a sub-fragment of IgE-Fc (consisting of a dimer of the Cϵ3 and Cϵ4 domains, Fcϵ3–4) with FcϵRI shows that the interface consists of two distinct binding sites, each comprising residues from the Cϵ3 domain of each chain (5Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The extensive surface area (∼1850 Å2) is very much greater than that occupied by a typical small molecule inhibitor (∼300 Å2) (25Cheng A.C. Coleman R.G. Smyth K.T. Cao Q. Soulard P. Caffrey D.R. Salzberg A.C. Huang E.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), which might therefore be expected to be incapable of blocking IgE binding to FcϵRI completely. However, if the small molecule could restrict IgE binding to a single sub-site, we have shown in previous studies that the affinity of the complex would be reduced 1000-fold (6Hunt J. Beavil R.L.

This is far in excess of the effect of the R334S mutation and reveals the potential for inhibitors that prevent full engagement of IgE with FcϵRI, an effect that could also be achieved by allosteric mechanisms, given the known requirement for conformational changes within IgE and the receptor (5Garman S.C.

In summary, we have demonstrated that even a moderate attenuation of the interaction between IgE and FcϵRI is sufficient to cause a physiological effect and that this encourages a small molecule strategy for inhibition of this interaction. If such a molecule were to create a population of R334S-like IgE molecules, this would raise the threshold for cellular activation sufficiently to dampen the allergic response.

https://openalex.org/W2002398814,"The widely used blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal during brain activation, as measured in typical fMRI methods, is composed of several distinct phases, the last of which, and perhaps the least understood, is the post-stimulus undershoot. Although this undershoot has been consistently observed, its hemodynamic and metabolic sources are still under debate, as evidences for sustained blood volume increases and metabolic activities have been presented. In order to help differentiate the origins of the undershoot from vascular and neuronal perspectives, we applied progressing diffusion weighting gradients to investigate the BOLD signals during visual stimulation. Three distinct regions were established and found to have fundamentally different properties in post-stimulus signal undershoot. The first region, with a small but focal spatial extent, shows a clear undershoot with decreasing magnitude under increasing diffusion weighting, which is inferred to represent intravascular signal from larger vessels with large apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), or high mobility. The second region, with a large continuous spatial extent in which some surrounds the first region while some spreads beyond, also shows a clear undershoot but no change in undershoot amplitude with progressing diffusion weighting. This would indicate a source based on extravascular and small vessel signal with smaller ADC, or lower mobility. The third region shows no significant undershoot, and is largely confined to higher order visual areas. Given their intermediate ADC, it would likely include both large and small vessels. Thus the consistent observation of this third region would argue against a vascular origin but support a metabolic basis for the post-stimulus undershoot, and would appear to indicate a lack of sustained metabolic rate likely due to a lower oxygen metabolism in these higher visual areas. Our results are the first, to our knowledge, to suggest that the post-stimulus undershoots have a spatial dependence on the vascular and neuronal hierarchy, and that progressing flow-sensitized diffusion weighting can help delineate these dependences."
