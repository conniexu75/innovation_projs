https://openalex.org/W1968673134,"Amino acids have distinct conformational preferences that influence the stabilities of protein secondary and tertiary structures. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of each of the 20 commonly occurring amino acids in the α-helical versus random coil states have been determined through the design of a peptide that forms a noncovalent α-helical dimer, which is in equilibrium with a randomly coiled monomeric state. The α helices in the dimer contain a single solvent-exposed site that is surrounded by small, neutral amino acid side chains. Each of the commonly occurring amino acids was substituted into this guest site, and the resulting equilibrium constants for the monomer-dimer equilibrium were determined to provide a list of free energy difference (ΔΔG°) values."
https://openalex.org/W2044823601,"Estimates of the upper limits to human longevity have important policy implications that directly affect forecasts of life expectancy, active life expectancy, population aging, and social and medical programs tied to the size and health status of the elderly population. In the past, investigators have based speculations about the upper limits of human longevity on observations of past trends in mortality. Here the estimate of the upper bound is based on hypothesized reductions in current mortality rates necessary to achieve a life expectancy at birth from 80 to 120 years and an expectation of life at age 50 from 30 to 70 years. With the use of conditional probabilities of death from complete life tables for the United States, reductions in mortality required to achieve extreme longevity (that is, 80 to 120 years) were compared with those resulting from hypothetical cures for all cardiovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Results indicate that in order for life expectancy at birth to increase from present levels to what has been referred to as the average biological limit to life (age 85), mortality rates from all causes of death would need to decline at all ages by 55%, and at ages 50 and over by 60%. Given that hypothetical cures for major degenerative diseases would reduce overall mortality by 75%, it seems highly unlikely that life expectancy at birth will exceed the age of 85."
https://openalex.org/W2024734793,Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. The gene for outer surface protein A (OspA) from B. burgdorferi strain N40 was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. C3H/HeJ mice actively immunized with live transformed E. coli or purified recombinant OspA protein produced antibodies to OspA and were protected from challenge with several strains of B. burgdorferi. Recombinant OspA is a candidate for a vaccine for Lyme borreliosis.
https://openalex.org/W1995938191,"Short peptides that contain significant alpha-helical structure in aqueous solution allow the investigation of the role of amino acid side chains in stabilizing or destabilizing alpha-helix structure. A host-guest system of soluble synthetic peptides was designed that consisted of chains with the block sequence TyrSerGlu4Lys4X3Glu4Lys4, denoted EXK, in which X represents any ""guest"" amino acid residue. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that the extent of helicity of these peptides follows the order Ala greater than Leu greater than Met greater than Gln greater than Ile greater than Val greater than Ser greater than Thr greater than Asn greater than Gly. This order differs from both host-guest copolymer values (Met greater than Ile greater than Leu greater than Ala greater than Gln greater than Val greater than Thr greater than Asn greater than Ser greater than Gly) and the tendencies of these amino acids to occur in helices in globular proteins (Ala greater than Met greater than Leu greater than Gln greater than Ile greater than Val greater than Asn, Thr greater than Ser greater than Gly), but matches the order found in a series of synthetic coiled-coil alpha helices, except for Ser. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of several EXK peptides indicates that these peptides are partially helical, with the helical residues favoring the amino terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2082301173,"Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation. The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods, each with specific limitations. Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded (ds) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or κB consensus sequences. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor (NF)-κB. The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner. Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-κB-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line. Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer. The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral, immunosuppressive, or other therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2043122788,"Chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by fusion of the bcr and abl genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. In most cases, the fusion involves a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which produces the cytogenetically distinctive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Fusion can be detected by Southern (DNA) analysis or by in vitro amplification of the messenger RNA from the fusion gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques are sensitive but cannot be applied to single cells. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients. The fusion event was detected in all samples analyzed, of which three were cytogenetically Ph1-negative. One of the Ph1-negative samples was also PCR-negative. This approach is fast and sensitive, and provides potential for determining the frequency of the abnormality in different cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1982878977,"High sequence selectivity in DNA-protein interactions was analyzed by measuring discrimination by Eco RI endonuclease between the recognition site GAATTC and systematically altered DNA sites. Base analogue substitutions that preserve the sequence-dependent conformational motif of the GAATTC site permit deletion of single sites of protein-base contact at a cost of +1 to +2 kcal/mol. However, the introduction of any one incorrect natural base pair costs +6 to +13 kcal/mol in transition state interaction energy, the resultant of the following interdependent factors: deletion of one or two hydrogen bonds between the protein and a purine base; unfavourable steric apposition between a group on the protein and an incorrectly placed functional group on a base; disruption of a pyrimidine contact with the protein; loss of some crucial interactions between protein and DNA phosphates; and an increased energetic cost of attaining the required DNA conformation in the transition state complex. Eco RI endonuclease thus achieves stringent discrimination by both direct readout (protein-base contracts) and indirect readout (protein-phosphate contacts and DNA conformation) of the DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2094922096,"The yeast protein RAP1, initially described as a transcriptional regulator, binds in vitro to sequences found in a number of seemingly unrelated genomic loci. These include the silencers at the transcriptionally repressed mating-type genes, the promoters of many genes important for cell growth, and the poly[(cytosine)1-3 adenine] [poly(C1-3A)] repeats of telomeres. Because RAP1 binds in vitro to the poly(C1-3A) repeats of telomeres, it has been suggested that RAP1 may be involved in telomere function in vivo. In order to test this hypothesis, the telomere tract lengths of yeast strains that contained conditionally lethal (ts) rap1 mutations were analyzed. Several rap1ts alleles reduced telomere length in a temperature-dependent manner. In addition, plasmids that contain small, synthetic telomeres with intact or mutant RAP1 binding sites were tested for their ability to function as substrates for poly(C1-3A) addition in vivo. Mutations in the RAP1 binding sites reduced the efficiency of the addition reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2058992020,"The complement system contributes to host defenses against invasion by infectious agents. A 35-kilodalton protein, encoded by vaccinia virus and secreted from infected cells, has sequence similarities to members of a gene family that includes complement control proteins. Biochemical and genetic studies showed that the viral protein binds to derivatives of the fourth component of complement and inhibits the classical complement cascade, suggesting that it serves as a defense molecule to help the virus evade the consequences of complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W2084981578,"The floor plate is a specialized group of midline neuroepithelial cells that appears to regulate cell differentiation and axonal growth in the developing vertebrate nervous system. A floor plate-specific chemoattractant was used as a marker to examine the role of the notochord in avian floor plate development. Expression of this chemoattractant in lateral cells of the neural plate and neural tube was induced by an ectopic notochord, and midline neural tube cells did not express the chemoattractant after removal of the notochord early in development. These results provide evidence that a local signal from the notochord induces the functional properties of the floor plate."
https://openalex.org/W1546003942,"The effect of varying concentrations of Pi and Ca2+ on isometric force and on the rate of force development in skinned rabbit psoas muscle fibers has been investigated. Steady-state results show that the three parameters that define the force-pCa relation (Po, pK, and n) all vary linearly with log [Pi]. As [Pi] increases, Po and pK decrease while n increases. The kinetics of force generation in isometrically contracting fibers were studied by laser flash photolysis of caged phosphate. The observed rate of the resulting tension transient, kPi, is 23.5 +/- 1.7 s-1 at 10 degrees C, 0.7 mM Pi, and is independent of [Ca2+] over the range pCa 4.5-7.2. By contrast, kTR, the rate of tension redevelopment following a period of isotonic shortening, is sensitive to [Ca2+] and is slower than kPi (kTR = 13.6 +/- 0.2 s-1 at pCa 4.5, 0.7 mM Pi). The results show that [Ca2+] does not directly affect the Pi release or force-generating steps of the cross-bridge cycle and show that the observed rate of force development depends on how the measurement is made. The data can be interpreted in terms of a model in which strong cross-bridges activate the thin filament, this activation being modulated by Ca2+ binding to troponin."
https://openalex.org/W2017278106,"Expression of the L-arabinose BAD operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by AraC protein which acts both positively in the presence of arabinose to induce transcription and negatively in the absence of arabinose to repress transcription. The repression of the araBAD promoter is mediated by DNA looping between AraC protein bound at two sites near the promoter separated by 210 base pairs, araI and araO2. In vivo and in vitro experiments presented here show that an AraC dimer, with binding to half of araI and to araO2, maintains the repressed state of the operon. The addition of arabinose, which induces the operon, breaks the loop, and shifts the interactions from the distal araO2 site to the previously unoccupied half of the araI site. The conversion between the two states does not require additional binding of AraC protein and appears to be driven largely by properties of the protein rather than being specified by the slightly different DNA sequences of the binding sites. Slight reorientation of the subunits of AraC could specify looping or unlooping by the protein. Such a mechanism could account for regulation of DNA looping in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2091821452,"Maps of sensory surfaces are a fundamental feature of sensory cortical areas of the brain. The relative roles of afferents and targets in forming neocortical maps in higher mammals can be examined in ferrets in which retinal inputs are directed into the auditory pathway. In these animals, the primary auditory cortex contains a systematic representation of the retina (and of visual space) rather than a representation of the cochlea (and of sound frequency). A representation of a two-dimensional sensory epithelium, the retina, in cortex that normally represents a one-dimensional epithelium, the cochlea, suggests that the same cortical area can support different types of maps. Topography in the visual map arises both from thalamocortical projections that are characteristic of the auditory pathway and from patterns of retinal activity that provide the input to the map."
https://openalex.org/W1996775753,"The single-minded (sim) gene of Drosophila encodes a nuclear protein that plays a critical role in the development of the neurons, glia, and other nonneuronal cells that lie along the midline of the embryonic CNS. Using distinct cell fate markers, we observe that in sim mutant embryos the midline cells fail to differentiate properly into their mature CNS cell types and do not take their appropriate positions within the developing CNS. We further present evidence that sim is required for midline expression of a group of genes including slit, Toll, rhomboid, engrailed, and a gene at 91F; that the sim mutant CNS defect may be largely due to loss of midline slit expression; and that the snail gene is required to repress sim and other midline genes in the presumptive mesoderm."

https://openalex.org/W2061044132,"Expression of the human T cell receptor (TCR) alpha gene is regulated by a T cell-specific transcriptional enhancer that is located 4.5 kilobases (kb) 3' to the C alpha gene segment. The core enhancer contains two nuclear protein binding sites, T alpha 1 and T alpha 2, which are essential for full enhancer activity. T alpha 1 contains a consensus cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element (CRE) and binds a set of ubiquitously expressed CRE binding proteins. In contrast, the transcription factors that interact with the T alpha 2 site have not been defined. In this report, a lambda gt11 expression protocol was used to isolate a complementary DNA (cDNA) that programs the expression of a T alpha 2 binding protein. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that this clone encodes the human ets-1 proto-oncogene. Lysogen extracts produced with this cDNA clone contained a beta-galactosidase-Ets-1 fusion protein that bound specifically to a synthetic T alpha 2 oligonucleotide. The Ets-1 binding site was localized to a 17-base pair (bp) region from the 3' end of T alpha 2. Mutation of five nucleotides within this sequence abolished both Ets-1 binding and the activity of the TCR alpha enhancer in T cells. These results demonstrate that Ets-1 binds in a sequence-specific fashion to the human TCR alpha enhancer and suggest that this developmentally regulated proto-oncogene functions in regulating TCR alpha gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1977496565,"The product of the cdc2 gene, designated p34cdc2, is a serine-threonine protein kinase that controls entry of eukaryotic cells into mitosis. Freshly isolated human T lymphocytes (G0 phase) were found to have very low amounts of p34cdc2 and cdc2 messenger RNA. Expression of cdc2 increased 18 to 24 hours after exposure of T cells to phytohemagglutinin, coincident with the G1 to S transition. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides could reduce the increase in cdc2 expression and inhibited DNA synthesis, but had no effect on several early and mid-G1 events, including blastogenesis and expression of interleukin-2 receptors, transferrin receptors, c-myb, and c-myc. Induction of cdc2 required prior induction of c-myb and c-myc. These results suggest that cdc2 induction is part of an orderly sequence of events that occurs at the G1 to S transition in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988178015,"The role of defective glucose transport in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) was examined in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of NIDDM. As in human NIDDM, insulin secretion was unresponsive to 20 mM glucose. Uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by islet cells was less than 19% of controls. The beta cell glucose transporter (GLUT-2) immunoreactivity and amount of GLUT-2 messenger RNA were profoundly reduced. Whenever fewer than 60% of beta cells were GLUT-2-positive, the response to glucose was absent and hyperglycemia exceeded 11 mM plasma glucose. We conclude that in NIDDM underexpression of GLUT-2 messenger RNA lowers high Km glucose transport in beta cells, and thereby impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and prevents correction of hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2043617261,"Laser confocal microscopy was used to monitor calcium ion (Ca2+) liberation from highly localized (micrometer) regions of intact Xenopus oocytes in response to photo-released inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). Local Ca2+ release varied in an all-or-none manner with increasing amount of InsP3, in contrast to signals recorded from larger areas, which grew progressively as the concentration of InsP3 was raised above a threshold. Liberation of Ca2+ was restricted to within a few microns of the site of InsP3 release and, in response to agonist activation, localized regions of the oocyte showed asynchronous oscillations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ release. Results obtained with this technique provided direct evidence that InsP3-induced Ca2+ liberation was quantized and suggest that the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool may be a collection of independent, localized compartments that release Ca2+ in an all-or-none manner."
https://openalex.org/W1530952467,"In this work, we examine the cellular localization and protein interactions of mouse glucocorticoid receptors that have been overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Hirst, M. A., Northrop, J. P., Danielsen, M., and Ringold, G. M. (1990) Mol. Endocrinol. 4, 162-170). We demonstrate that wild-type unliganded mouse glucocorticoid receptor, which is expressed in CHO cells to a level approximately 10 times that of L cells, is localized entirely to the nucleus by indirect immunofluorescence with the BuGR antireceptor monoclonal antibody. Overexpressed receptors that have either no hormone binding activity or no DNA binding activity because of point mutations also localize to the nucleus, providing genetic proof that the nuclear localization cannot reflect a steroid-mediated shift of the receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and that DNA binding activity is not required for nuclear localization. Like unliganded progesterone receptors, which also associate in a loosely bound docking complex with the nucleus, the mouse glucocorticoid receptor overexpressed in CHO cells is associated with both hsp90 and hsp70. This is in contrast to the untransformed mouse glucocorticoid receptor in L cell cytosol, which is associated with hsp90 but not hsp70. The difference in hsp70 association between cell types could reflect overexpression of the receptor in CHO cells. However, like receptors in CHO cells selected for very high levels of overexpression, receptors in CHO cells selected for an intermediate level of receptor expression that is comparable to that of L cells are also bound to hsp70. This observation argues against an explanation of hsp70 association based purely on receptor overexpression, and we speculate that association of the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor with hsp70 might be a consequence of its nuclear localization in the CHO cells. Although there are differences between the mouse receptor in CHO cells and L cells, the nuclear localization signal of the untransformed mouse receptor reacts equivalently with the AP64 antibody against NL1 in cytosols prepared from both cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1546597339,"Abstract Three beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase (3 beta-HSD) catalyze the oxidative conversion of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-keto configuration and is therefore essential for the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids, namely progesterone, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. Using human 3 beta-HSD cDNA as probe, a human 3 beta-HSD gene was isolated from a lambda-EMBL3 library of leucocyte genomic DNA. A fragment of 3 beta-HSD genomic DNA was also obtained by amplification of genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. The 3 beta-HSD gene contains a 5'-untranslated exon of 53 base pairs (bp) and three successive translated exons of 232, 165, and 1218 bp, respectively, separated by introns of 129, 3883, and 2162 bp. The transcription start site is situated 267 nucleotides upstream from the ATG initiating codon. DNA sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region reveals the existence of a putative TATA box (ATAAA) situated 28 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site while a putative CAAT binding sequence is located 57 nucleotides upstream from the TATA box. Expression of a cDNA insert containing the coding region of 3 beta-HSD in nonsteroidogenic cells shows that the gene encodes a single 42-kDa protein containing both 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and delta 5-delta 4-isomerase activities. Moreover, all natural steroid substrates tested are transformed with comparable efficiency by the enzyme. In addition to its importance for studies of the regulation of expression of 3 beta-HSD in gonadal as well as peripheral tissues, knowledge of the structure of the human 3 beta-HSD gene should permit investigation of the molecular defects responsible for 3 beta-HSD deficiency, the second most common cause of adrenal hyperplasia in children."
https://openalex.org/W2081809068,"A cytoplasmic protein has been identified that inhibits the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of bacterially synthesized, cellular H-Ras protein. This GTPase inhibiting protein is able to counteract the activity of GTPase activating protein (GAP), which has been postulated to function as a negative regulator of Ras activity. The potential biological importance of the GTPase inhibiting protein is further supported by its interaction with lipids. Phospholipids produced in cells as a consequence of mitogenic stimulation increase the activity of the GTPase inhibiting protein, as well as inhibit the activity of GAP. The interaction of such lipids with each of these two regulatory proteins would, therefore, tend to increase the biological activity of Ras and stimulate cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2088375015,"The function of the c-myc gene and its role in tumorigenesis are poorly understood. In order to elucidate the role of c-myc oncogene activation in B cell malignancy, the phenotypic changes caused by the expression of c-myc oncogenes in human B lymphoblastoid cells immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus were analyzed. C-myc oncogenes caused the down-regulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) adhesion molecules (alpha L/beta 2 integrin) and loss of homotypic B cell adhesion in vitro. Down-regulation of LFA-1 occurred by (i) posttranscriptional modulation of LFA-1 alpha L-chain RNA soon after acute c-myc induction, and (ii) transcriptional modulation in cells that chronically express c-myc oncogenes. Analogous reductions in LFA-1 expression were detectable in Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying activated c-myc oncogenes. Since LFA-1 is involved in B cell adhesion to cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and vascular endothelium, these results imply functions for c-myc in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1514659673,"HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytic cells by dimethyl sulfoxide, and structures of Asn-linked oligosaccharides attached to lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lamp-1 and lamp-2) were elucidated before and after differentiation. Lamp-1 and lamp-2 were immunoprecipitated from the cells after labeling with radioactive sugars, and glycopeptides were prepared. The structures of glycopeptides obtained after serial lectin-affinity chromatography were elucidated by endo-beta-galactoside and methylation analysis. Glycopeptides bound to tomato lectin-Sepharose were found to be tetraantennary oligosaccharides that contain two or three poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl chains, of which one side chain contains three or more N-acetyllactosaminyl repeats, whereas those bound to Datura stramonium agglutinin-Sepharose were found to be tetraantennary oligosaccharides containing one or two short poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl side chains. Glycopeptides that were not bound to concanavalin A, tomato lectin, or D. stramonium agglutinin were found to be triantennary oligosaccharides with a negligible amount of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl side chains. Comparison of Asn-linked oligosaccharides from undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells reveals the following features. First, the number of Asn-linked oligosaccharides containing poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl side chains increases dramatically with a concomitant decrease in less complex Asn-linked oligosaccharides after differentiation. Second, the number of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl side chains per Asn-linked oligosaccharides increases significantly. These increases in poly-N-acetyllactosamine were associated with increased activity of UDP-GlcNAc:beta-D-Gal-beta 1----3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase extension enzyme, a key enzyme in the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamines. Furthermore, the increased amount of poly-N-acetyllactosamine in lamp-1 and lamp-2 resulted in longer half-lives of lamp-1 and lamp-2 in differentiated HL-60 cells. These results suggest strongly that the differentiation of HL-60 cells into more phagocytic cells is associated with an increase in the complexity of Asn-linked oligosaccharides attached to lysosomal membrane glycoproteins, which in turn may play a role in stabilizing lysosomes."

In 1 molar NaCl at low temperatures, these molecules do not behave like single strands, but rather exhibit properties consistent with tetraplex formation. The standard state enthalpies, entropies, and free energies for formation of each tetraplex have been measured, as have preliminary nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. In 1 molar KCl, the melting behavior of the structure or structures is more complex than in 1 molar NaCl. This observation may be related to the recently proposed ""sodium-potassium switch."""
https://openalex.org/W1507250903,"The tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activates viral gene expression and is essential for HIV replication in vitro. It has also been shown that the tat gene product specifically inhibits antigen-induced proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In order to understand the growth and immunomodulatory roles of HIV-1 tat, we have examined the effect of the tat gene on the expression of tumor necrosis factors in a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line (Raji). We report here that the HIV-1 tat gene introduced into Raji cells by retroviral-mediated transformation induces production of tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta). The tat-mediated induction of TNF-beta seems to be both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels because, concurrent with a 30-fold increase in the levels of TNF-beta protein, an approximate 8-fold increase in mRNA was observed in tat-transformed Raji cells. It is recently reported that tat protein of HIV-1 stimulates growth of cells derived from Kaposi's sarcoma lesions of AIDS patients (Ensoli, B., Barillari, G., Salahuddin, S.Z., Gallo, R.C., and Wong-Staal, F. (1990) Nature 345, 84-86). Since TNF has been shown to function as a growth factor for several cell types, our results showing induction of TNF-beta by tat indicate the possibility that a growth-stimulatory role of HIV-1 tat on Kaposi's sarcoma cells is mediated through TNF-beta."
https://openalex.org/W2072415380,"Immunoglobulin rearrangement is central to generating antibody diversity because of heterogeneity generated during recombination by deletion or addition of nucleotides at coding joints by the recombinase machinery. Examination of these junctional modifications revealed that the addition of nongermline-encoded nucleotides was more prevalent in adult versus fetal B cells, thus partially limiting the fetal antibody repertoire. In contrast, deletion of nucleotides occurs equivalently in B cells at different stages of development and at different points in B cell ontogeny. Finally, the bias in murine immunoglobulins for one DH segment reading frame occurs at the DHJH intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1517655803,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the human thymidylate synthase (TS) gene was determined. The biologically active unit spans about 16 kilobase pairs (kbp) and is composed of seven exons and six introns. The promoter region and the major transcriptional start sites were located within about 400 base pairs (bp) and 160-180 bp, respectively, upstream from the ATG initiation codon. A minigene consisting of a 5'-flanking sequence of about 4 kbp, a coding sequence of about 1.7 kpb was sufficient for cell cycle-dependent expression of TS when introduced into a TS-deficient mutant of rodent cells. The 5'-flanking region does not contain a TATA, CAAT, or the consensus sequence for Sp1 binding (GC box), whereas intron 1 contains three GC boxes. The gene is G + C-rich and the CpG-rich region extends from 5'-flanking region to intron 1. These sequence characteristics were compared with those of the mouse TS gene and other cell cycle-regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W1658546299,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) messenger RNA (mRNA) undergoes posttranscriptional (C to U) editing, producing tissue-specific forms of apoB from the unedited (apoB100) and edited (apoB48) transcripts. ApoB mRNA editing is developmentally regulated in human fetal small intestine, producing parallel changes in the synthesis and secretion of apoB100 and apoB48. Neither fetal nor adult liver contained detectable levels (less than 1%) of edited apoB mRNA. By contrast, apoB mRNA is incrementally edited during development in several extraintestinal fetal tissues. These tissues demonstrated significant differences, however, in both the extent and developmental profile of apoB mRNA editing. Additionally, while apoB100 synthesis and secretion was demonstrated in these tissues, apoB48 synthesis was confined to the small intestine. Thus, although the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unclear, the capacity to edit apoB mRNA is widely distributed among both fetal and adult tissues. We speculate that the asynchronous and developmentally modulated induction of apoB mRNA editing may provide a novel mechanism for regulating lipoprotein biogenesis in both the developing fetus and adult human."
https://openalex.org/W2030871047,"Stage-specific gene regulation is important in determining cell function during development. Immature B cells expressing membrane-bound immunoglobulin M (mIgM) are sensitive to antigen-induced tolerance, whereas mature B cells are activated by antigen. Previous studies have established an association between Egr-1 gene induction and antigen receptor (mIgM)-mediated activation of mature B cells. Here it is shown that the immature B cell line WEHI-231 and tolerance-sensitive bone marrow-derived B cells do not express Egr-1. It is further shown that lack of inducible expression in these cells is due to specific methylation of the Egr-1 gene. Thus, covalent inactivation of an activation-associated gene may explain tolerance sensitivity at specific stages of B cell development."
https://openalex.org/W1534151687,"A full-length Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA that encodes the alpha subunit of casein kinase II was inserted into the inducible bacterial expression vector pET3a to generate the plasmid pCK alpha. Escherichia coli DE21 lysozyme S that was transformed with pCK alpha expressed soluble, catalytically active casein kinase II alpha upon induction with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed alpha subunit was purified to homogeneity with a 60% yield by chromatography on CM-Sephadex, P-11 phosphocellulose, and heparin-agarose. The Mr values estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 42,000) or calculated from hydrodynamic measurements (s20,w = 3.3 S, Stokes radius = 2.8 nm, Mr = 37,000) were similar, thereby indicating that the expressed enzyme is monomeric. The native holoenzyme and the expressed alpha subunit exhibited several similar properties including the utilization of both ATP and GTP as substrates and the susceptibility to inhibition of phosphotransferase activity by low concentrations of heparin. However, the kcat for E. coli-derived alpha was only 9% of the kcat for the native holoenzyme, and catalytic activity was not stimulated by polyamines. Recombinant casein kinase II alpha aggregates at low ionic strength, and the aggregation is partially reversible. A mutant alpha subunit in which Lys74 and Lys75 were substituted by glutamic acid residues was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme was not inhibited by typically effective concentrations of heparin (e.g. IC50 = 0.3 micrograms/ml) because the affinity of modified recombinant casein kinase II Glu-74Glu-75 for heparin decreased approximately 70-fold. Thus, Lys74 and Lys75 are implicated in the heparin binding, inhibitory domain. The successful expression of casein kinase II alpha in E. coli will facilitate the analysis of the structural basis for functional domains in this enzyme."

The first region spans from -123 to -674 base pairs (bp), the second from -2.6 to -3.1 kilobases, and the third from -3.1 to -8.8 kilobases. Linker-scanning mutants generated using the polymerase chain reaction and modified oligonucleotides have identified the OXBOX (5'-GGCTCTAAAGAGG) as the positive element within the -123 to -674-bp region. This element enhances transcription in muscle cells but not in HeLa cells, suggesting that it is muscle-specific. Gel retardation experiments have revealed a factor from C2C12 cells which specifically binds to a 40-bp piece of the ANT1 promoter containing the OXBOX. Since the OXBOX is also found in the promoter of the human ATP synthase beta subunit gene, it is the first tissue-specific element identified which could coordinately regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes."
https://openalex.org/W2112695745,"Abstract Lysosome membrane glycoproteins, lamp-1 and lamp-2, have been shown to contain 18 and 16 N-glycans, some of which are modified by poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine. We have localized the polylactosaminoglycans to specific sites on lamp-1 and lamp-2 purified from human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Polylactosaminoglycan-containing glycopeptides, obtained by trypsin, pepsin, and V8 protease digestion of the glycoproteins, were isolated by Datura stramonium agglutinin affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl structures of isolated glycopeptides were confirmed by the susceptibility of their released oligosaccharides to endo-beta-galactosidase. Amino acid analysis and sequencing demonstrated that polylactosaminoglycans were located at Asn-34, Asn-93 and/or Asn-102, and Asn-195 and/or Asn-200 in lamp-1, and at Asn-4 and/or Asn-10, and Asn-279 in lamp-2. These results indicated that only certain glycosylation sites can be selectively modified by poly-N-acetyllactosamine, and those sites may confer the requirement by beta 1----3-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1554748597,"The minimum substrate sequence recognized by signal peptidase I (SPase I or leader peptidase) was defined by measuring the kinetic parameters for a set of chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to the cleavage site of the precursor maltose binding protein (pro-MBP). The minimum sequence of a substrate hydrolyzed by SPase I at a measurable rate was the pentapeptide Ala-Leu-Ala decreases Lys-Ile. The rates of hydrolysis of this substrate, however, were several hundred-fold lower than those observed for the maturation of MBP in Escherichia coli, suggesting that in addition to these minimal sites involved in recognition, other features of pro-MBP are also needed for the optimal rate of signal peptide cleavage by SPase I. One parameter may be the length of the polypeptide chain. Studies of the synthetic peptides showed that decreasing the length of the polypeptide chain of substrates decreased the substrate efficiency measured as kcat/Km. However, in one case a decrease in the length of a peptide corresponding to -7 to +3 positions of pro-MBP to a nonapeptide (-7 to +2) increased the substrate efficiency by about 900-fold. The nonapeptide is the most efficient substrate for the enzyme in vitro so far reported. It is speculated that better peptide substrates are the ones which are able to adopt folded structures."
https://openalex.org/W1553163060,"A gene encoding PMP47, a peroxisomal integral membrane protein of the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii, was isolated from a genomic library. DNA sequencing of PMP47 revealed an open reading frame of 1269 base pairs capable of encoding a protein of 46,873 Da. At least two membrane-spanning regions in the protein are predicted from the sequence. Since the 3 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus are -AKE, PMP47 lacks a typical peroxisomal sorting signal. No significant similarities in primary structure between PMP47 and known proteins were observed, including PMP70, a rat peroxisomal membrane protein whose sequence has recently been reported (Kamijo, K., Taketani, S., Yokota, S., Osumi, T., and Hashimoto, T. (1990). J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4534-4540). In order to study the import and assembly of PMP47 into peroxisomes by genetic approaches, the gene was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When PMP47 was expressed in cells grown on oleic acid to induce peroxisomes, the protein was observed exclusively in peroxisomes as determined by marker enzyme analysis of organelle fractions. Most of the PMP47 co-purified with the endogenous peroxisomal membrane proteins on isopycnic sucrose gradients. Either in the native host or when expressed in S. cerevisiae, PMP47 was not extractable from peroxisomal membranes by sodium carbonate at pH 11, indicating an integral membrane association. These results indicate that PMP47 is competent for sorting to and assembling into peroxisomal membranes in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1511331055,"Species-specific adhesion of dissociated cells from the marine sponge Microciona prolifera is mediated by a Mr = 2 x 10(7) proteoglycan-like aggregation factor (MAF) via two highly polyvalent functional domains, a cell-binding and a self-interaction domain. Glycopeptide N-glycosidase F release of a major glycan of Mr = 6.3 gamma 10(3) (G-6) from the MAF protein core resulted in the loss of cell binding activity, indicating a role of this polysaccharide molecule in MAF-cell association. The G-6 glycan was isolated and purified after complete Pronase digestion of MAF using gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. Quantification of the amount of carbohydrate recovered in G-6 showed that one MAF molecule has about 950 repeats of this glycan. In its monomeric state G-6 did not display any measurable binding to cells (K alpha less than or equal to 10(3) M-1). Intermolecular cross-linking of the G-6 glycan with glutaraldehyde resulted, however, in the concomitant recovery of polyvalency (about 2200 repeats of G-6 per polymer of Mr greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10(7) and species-specific high cell binding affinity (K alpha = 1.6 x 10(9) M-1) but not of the MAF-MAF self-interaction activity. Thus, the G-6 glycan is the multiple low affinity cell-binding site involved in cell-cell recognition and adhesion of sponge cells. The G-6 glycan has 7 glucuronic acids, 3 fucoses, 2 mannoses, 5 galactoses, 14 N-acetylglucosamines, 2 sulfates, and 1 asparagine. Such a unique chemical composition indicates a new type of structure which includes features of glycosaminolycans and N-linked polysaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1520864002,"Abstract Suicide inactivation occurs during catalysis by thromboxane synthase. Loss of enzymatic activity, accompanying thromboxane B2 formation, was proportional to the substrate concentration. Inactivation was directly related to product formation: for several different experimental protocols 50% loss of thromboxane synthase activity corresponded with formation of 454 +/- 79 ng of thromboxane B2/mg protein. The time course of inactivation was pseudo-first-order and obeyed saturation kinetics. Inactivation (KI) and first-order rate constants (ki) were 18 microM and 0.18 s-1 for prostaglandin H2. Prostaglandin H1, a poor substrate for turnover, was also a site-directed inactivator with KI = 28 microM and ki = 0.09 s-1. Competitive inhibitors, typified by U63557a and U46619, preserved the enzyme activity by slowing the rate of inactivation from 0.18 to 0.05 s-1. Loss of the hemoprotein Soret absorbance did not correlate quantitatively or temporally with the loss of thromboxane synthase activity. A similar, irreversible inactivation accompanied thromboxane formation by intact platelets. Loss of activity was proportional to substrate concentration and catalytic activity. For a pool of 25 separate donors, thromboxane synthase activity declined exponentially as a function of thromboxane B2 formation: 50% loss of activity corresponded to 23 ng of thromboxane B2/10(7) platelets. The data conform to criteria for a specific, mechanism-based process in which thromboxane synthase participates in two parallel reactions, one leading to thromboxane formation and the other to suicide inactivation. The specific, rather than indiscriminate, nature of the process, and its occurrence in intact platelets may have implications for the cell biology of thrombosis. Depletion of thromboxane synthase activity may be a factor in the choice and effectiveness of antithrombotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1576293077,"To understand the mechanism of Na+ movement through the force-generating units of the Na(+)-driven flagellar motors of Vibrio alginolyticus, the effect of intracellular Na+ concentration on motor rotation was investigated. Control cells containing about 50 mM Na+ showed good motility even at 10 mM Na+ in the medium, i.e. in the absence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. In contrast, Na(+)-loaded cells containing about 400 mM Na+ showed very poor motility at 500 mM Na+ in the medium, i.e. even in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. The membrane potential of the cells, which is a major driving force for the motor under these conditions, was not detectably altered, and consistently with this, Na(+)-coupled sucrose transport was only partly reduced in the Na(+)-loaded cells. Motility of the Na(+)-loaded cells was restored by decreasing the intracellular Na+ concentration, and the rate of restoration of motility correlated with the rate of the Na+ decrease. These results indicate that the absolute concentration of the intracellular Na+ is a determinant of the rotation rate of the Na(+)-driven flagellar motors of V. alginolyticus. A simple explanation for this phenomenon is that the force-generating unit of the motor has an intracellular Na(+)-binding site, at which the intracellular Na+ kinetically interferes with the rate of Na+ influx for motor rotation."
https://openalex.org/W1508549696,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) encodes a 40-kDa nuclear protein, Tax, which stimulates transcription from three 21-base pair (bp) repeats in its U3 region. Tax trans-activation is mediated via cellular factors that interact with the TGACGT motifs in the 21-bp repeats. Gel mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking analysis show that two proteins of 52 and 46 kDa in size bind the 21-bp repeat specifically. Base substitutions in the TGACGT motif which abolished Tax trans-activation abrogated factor binding whereas the repeats containing mutations that did not affect Tax trans-activation supported factor binding as the wild-type repeat. The 52- and 46-kDa factors are present in human T-cell lines Jurkat and MT4 (HTLV-I transformed) and in HeLa cells but are undetectable in a human placental cell line JEG-3, which gave a reduced level of trans-activation. JEG-3 extracts contain a distinct DNA binding activity that shows analogous sequence requirements as the 52- and 46-kDa proteins in interacting with the various 21-bp repeats. c-Jun and CREB (cAMP-responsive element binding factor) can stimulate transcription from HTLV-I long terminal repeats in JEG-3 cells. At least two copies of the 21-bp repeats are required for optimal trans-activation by c-Jun and CREB. Most single point mutations in the TGACGT motif that abolished Tax trans-activation, however, did not affect c-Jun- or CREB-directed transcriptional enhancement. These data indicate that many transcription factors including c-Jun and CREB exert stimulatory effects on HTLV-I transcription although they do not directly respond to Tax. The 52- and 46-kDa cellular proteins most likely are involved directly in Tax-mediated trans-activation, and they are tentatively named Tax activation factors I and II, respectively."

The antisera were used to probe the accessibility of various HMG domains in chromatin. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicate that the central region of the proteins, which contains their DNA binding domain and is positively charged, is exposed to a smaller degree than the C-terminal region of the proteins, which has a net negative charge. The C-terminal regions of the HMG-14 and HMG-17 proteins are exposed and available to interact with other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1561041749,"In order to analyze the role of the pro-sequence in folding of the alkaline serine protease subtilisin, localized random mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction with Taq DNA polymerase was employed to obtain mutations in the pro-sequence which prevent production of active protease. The unique aspect of this procedure is that random mutations can be easily generated in vitro over large but defined regions of a specific gene. The method was applied to a 458-base pair fragment encompassing the coding region of the pro-sequence of subtilisin, a region of the protein which has been shown to be required for proper folding. Protease-deficient mutants containing a variety of amino acid substitutions were isolated with a frequency of 4.3%. From analysis of these mutants, four independent amino acid substitution mutations in the pro-sequence were identified. The present results demonstrate that polymerase chain reaction is an efficient and simple method for obtaining random mutations within a localized region of a given gene."
https://openalex.org/W1500893409,"The present study describes the pathophysiology, at the cellular level, of the mouse beta thalassemia and shows the pertinence of this model for the human disease. The homozygous state of mouse beta thalassemia is characterized by a clinical syndrome similar to the human beta thalassemia intermedia, but it cannot be explained by the small deficiency in beta chain synthesis. The small pool of unpaired and soluble alpha chains present in mouse reticulocytes contrasts with the large amount of insoluble alpha chains in erythrocytes which is induced by the high instability of mouse alpha chains and the absence of significant proteolysis. The amount of insoluble alpha chains associated with red cell ghosts is similar in human and mouse disease of similar severity. The study of membrane protein defects showed a decreased amount of spectrin (alpha and beta chains) and dramatic changes in the distribution of the most reactive thiol groups of membrane proteins. These results were similar to that previously described in the human disease (Rouyer-Fessard, P., Garel, M. C., Domenget, C., Guetarni, D., Bachir, D., Colonna, P., and Beuzard, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19092-19098). Abnormal density distribution curves of erythrocytes and oxidant-induced lysis of red blood cells used as functional tests were similar in the human and mouse beta thalessemia. We conclude from the present study that 1) mouse beta thalassemia is an excellent model for the membrane defects occurring in the human disease; 2) disease expression is not the reflection of the globin chain unbalance only nor of the soluble pool of alpha hemoglobin chain but mainly is a reflection of insoluble alpha chains; and 3) the rate of proteolysis and instability of alpha chains are important factors which must be taken into consideration in the pathophysiology and the clinical heterogeneity of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1947449479,"We have established the minimal sequence and factor requirements for both constitutive and viral-induced transcription from an atypical, TATATAA box-containing human housekeeping promoter. Utilizing a transient cotransfection protocol, we have found that efficient transactivation of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) gene transcription by the immediate early proteins of adenovirus and pseudorabies virus is dependent upon the same assembly of sequence elements that collectively confer minimal TPI promoter function in the absence of viral protein. These elements span TPI promoter positions -65 and -6 (where +1 is the transcription initiation site) and include not only a TFIID-responsive TATATAA box (-27 to -21) but a single GC box (-53 to -48) that binds Spl, and a novel cap proximal element (-18 to -6) that binds a 110-kDa nuclear factor that is present in HeLa cells. We demonstrate that these elements function in an interdependent fashion; deleting either GC box 1 or the cap proximal element completely or nearly abolished both basal transcription and viral transactivation. Therefore, these elements and their cognate factors represent the basal transcription initiation complex through which the immediate early protein of adenovirus or pseudorabies virus mediates the stimulation of TPI gene transcription. We discuss the implications of these data for both constitutive and viral-induced transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1567715681,"The beta subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is in a dimer-monomer equilibrium at physiological beta concentrations. Dissociation is accompanied by the fluorescence enhancement of a fluorophore attached to a unique sulfhydryl group of beta (Griep, M. A., and McHenry, C. S. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 5210-5215). Sequencing of the isolated tryptic peptides of beta revealed that the fluorescent maleimide group was attached to cysteine 333. The 2 residues, lysine 332 and glutamate 334, that flank this residue are hydrophilic and may place cysteine 333 on the surface of beta, explaining its high reactivity. Fluorescence energy transfer permitted us to locate the uniquely labeled cysteines 333 of beta at the distal ends of the beta dimer. When the beta dimer was dissociated to monomers, the accompanying alteration of the conformational state was reported by the fluorescein-5-maleimide (fluorescein)-labeled cysteines which were located far from the dimer interface. The carboxyl of fluorescein had a fluorescence pKa of 6.9 when beta was in its dimeric state. The pKa decreased by 0.3 pH unit upon dissociation to monomers and resulted in the fluorescence enhancement that was observed when the signal was monitored at constant pH. The adjacent glutamate 334 apparently increased the pKa of the attached fluorescein when beta was in its dimeric state. Movement of either the adjacent lysine 332 amino side chain to a closer position or glutamate 334 to a position further away could lower the pKa upon beta monomerization. Thus, beta undergoes a conformational change concomitant with dimer dissociation that was transmitted to the opposite ends of the beta dimer. The pKa of fluorescein attached to the distal cysteines was shifted, leading to greater ionization and enhanced fluorescence."

https://openalex.org/W1595436464,"The murine 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase ME-12 gene regulatory region AB forms six complexes with protein factors in murine BALB/c 3T3 cells as demonstrated by the mobility shift electrophoresis assay under the reaction conditions used. The complexes, designated C1-C6 in order of their decreasing electrophoretic mobility, showed three distinctive specificities with regulatory region AB, element A, and element B as probes or competing DNA: 1) C1 is region AB-specific (this complex did not form with either element A or B used alone or as a mixture); 2) C5 formed both with element A and element B; 3) C2, C3, C4, and C6 formed with element B, but not A. The protein factors that give rise to these complexes show differential DNA binding activities in various buffer solutions at different pH values. The C4-forming protein factor is the interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta-stimulated response factor (ISRF) which shows element B specificity. It preexists in the cytoplasm. ISRF appears to be complexed to an inhibitor (ISRFI) in the cytoplasm and to dissociate from the inhibitor and to translocate into the nucleus upon treatment of cells with IFN-alpha/beta. We propose that IFN-alpha/beta treatment of BALB/c 3T3 can trigger at least two events: 1) loosening of a tight inhibitor-ISRF complex with the release of free ISRF; this may be mediated via phosphorylation of ISRF or ISRFI; 2) translocation of ISRF into the nucleus and binding to the enhancer element B, which results in the activation of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2291328861,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the function of three putative active site residues (C278, G279, and G281) of the vitamin B6 enzyme D-serine dehydratase. These residues lie in or adjacent to a conserved glycine-rich loop that is known to interact with the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor in several B6 enzymes and that resembles the GXGXXG loop of nucleotide-binding sites. The cofactor affinity, catalytic properties, and spectral properties (UV, CD, fluorescence, and 31P NMR) of alanine variants C278A, G279A, and G281A were measured as well as the susceptibility of each variant to thiol modification by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The specific thiols modified in each variant and wild type D-serine dehydratase were identified by amino acid sequencing of labeled tryptic peptides. C278A, G279A, and G281A displayed 10-, 33-, and 22-fold lower affinities for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate than did wild type D-serine dehydratase and turnover numbers with D-serine that were 50, 6, and 60% of normal, respectively. The introduction of a methyl side chain into G281 enhanced catalytic efficiency with the substrates D-threonine, D-allo-threonine, and L-serine, whereas the methyl side chain at position 279 impaired catalysis of all substrates as well as cofactor affinity. The 31P NMR spectrum of D-serine dehydratase was minimally perturbed by the alanine substitutions, consistent with the view that neither G279 nor G281 interacts with the phosphate group of the cofactor (in contrast to the arrangement found in several other B6 enzymes). C311 was the single thiol modified by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in wild type D-serine dehydratase. Two normally inaccessible thiol groups, C233 and C278, were rendered susceptible to modification as a consequence of either G----A substitution, and modification of C278 was associated with inactivation of G279A and G281A. These observations suggest that small perturbations in the glycine-rich loop induce conformational changes spanning a considerable area around the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1574685077,"A truncated soluble form of the human interleukin-2 receptor p55 chain (T-S-IL-2R) was expressed to high levels in RODENT (mammalian) cells and affinity-purified. Its biochemical behavior was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), gel filtration, and sucrose gradient centrifugation. It migrated as a single 40-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (reducing or nonreducing conditions), whereas it ran as a 80-kDa component on native PAGE or as a 86-kDa component on gel filtration. The combination of gel filtration and density gradient sedimentation gave a Stokes radius of 4.0 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 3.72 S. The deduced molecular mass was 67 kDa, and the fractional ratio was 1.516. These data therefore indicated that the T-S-IL-2R was secreted as an homodimer of two noncovalently associated 40-kDa subunits. Cross-linking experiments using bifunctional reagents enabled the materialization of the dimeric structure on sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Stoichiometric binding studies using two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 33B3.1 and 11H2) reacting with separate epitopes on the p55 chain also strongly supported the dimeric structure. Indeed, there was one binding site for the 33B3.1 mAb (and Fab fragment) per T-S-IL-2R 40-kDa subunit, whereas the 11H2 mAb (or Fab fragment) could bind only half a site per subunit, a result which could only be explained when assuming more than one subunit for the native T-S-IL-2R. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor species were also purified from culture supernatants of either L cells transfected with the full-length p55 cDNA or a normal alloreactive T cell clone. Similar biochemical behavior and reactivities with the two mAbs were found. Finally, cell-surface p55 chains expressed either by pgL21 or 4AS cells bound the 33B3.1 and 11H2 mAbs in a 2:1 ratio, suggesting that the p55 chains are also associated as homodimers when imbedded in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1568098252,"Abstract The process of ATP or GTP synthesis by bovine heart submitochondrial particles involves the binding of ADP or GDP to 3 exchangeable sites I, II, and III, and only upon substrate occupation of site III does rapid ATP or GTP synthesis take place. The dissociation constants determined for ADP were KADPI less than or equal to 10(-8) M, KADPII approximately 10(-7) M, and KADPIII (equivalent to KADPm), approximately 3 x 10(-6) M in the low Km mode and KADPIII approximately 150 x 10(-6) M in the high Km mode. For GDP, these constants were KGDPI approximately 10(-6)-10(-5) M, KGDPII approximately 10(-4) M, and KGDPIII approximately 10(-3) M when NADH was the respiratory substrate (Matsuno-Yagi, A., and Hatefi, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 82-88). Because of its low affinity for the above binding sites, GDP at micromolar concentrations does not lead to GTP synthesis. However, as shown in this paper, micromolar [GDP] undergoes phosphorylation in the presence of micromolar concentrations of ADP. Under these conditions, both ATP and GTP are synthesized. GDP inhibits ATP synthesis with KGDPi congruent to 7 microM, while ADP promotes GTP synthesis in a reaction that requires inorganic phosphate (apparent KPim = 2-3 mM) and is inhibited by uncouplers and inhibitors of the ATP synthase complex. The ADP-promoted GTP synthesis exhibited an apparent KGDPm = 4 microM and an apparent Vmax = 11 nmol of GTP (min.mg of protein)-1. These results were interpreted to mean that (a) micromolar [ADP] occupies sites I and II, allowing site III to bind and phosphorylate GDP, and (b) the KGDPm and Vmax calculated under these conditions represent values for the low Km-low Vmax mode of GTP synthesis, which in the absence of ADP is not detectable because of the positive cooperativity phase of GTP synthesis with the high KGDPII approximately 10(-4) M."
