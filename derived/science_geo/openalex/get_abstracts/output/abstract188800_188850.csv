https://openalex.org/W2148239264,"Various chronic antidepressant treatments increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but the functional importance of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, using genetic and radiological methods, we show that disrupting antidepressant-induced neurogenesis blocks behavioral responses to antidepressants. Serotonin 1A receptor null mice were insensitive to the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine, a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor. X-irradiation of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus prevented the neurogenic and behavioral effects of two classes of antidepressants. These findings suggest that the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants may be mediated by the stimulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus."

The pulse control of the biexciton dynamics, combined with previously demonstrated control of the single-exciton Rabi rotation, serves as the physical basis for a two-bit conditional quantum logic gate. The truth table of the gate shows the features of an all-optical quantum gate with interacting yet distinguishable excitons as qubits. Evaluation of the fidelity yields a value of 0.7 for the gate operation. Such experimental capability is essential to a scheme for scalable quantum computation by means of the optical control of spin qubits in dots."

We find that successful social search is conducted primarily through intermediate to weak strength ties, does not require highly connected “hubs” to succeed, and, in contrast to unsuccessful social search, disproportionately relies on professional relationships. By accounting for the attrition of message chains, we estimate that social searches can reach their targets in a median of five to seven steps, depending on the separation of source and target, although small variations in chain lengths and participation rates generate large differences in target reachability. We conclude that although global social networks are, in principle, searchable, actual success depends sensitively on individual incentives."

Although an experimental vaccine has successfully protected non-human primates against disease, more than six months was required to complete the immunizations, making it impractical to limit an acute epidemic. Here, we report the development of accelerated vaccination against Ebola virus in non-human primates. The antibody response to immunization with an adenoviral (ADV) vector encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) was induced more rapidly than with DNA priming and ADV boosting, but it was of lower magnitude. To determine whether this earlier immune response could nonetheless protect against disease, cynomolgus macaques were challenged with Ebola virus after vaccination with ADV-GP and nucleoprotein (NP) vectors. Protection was highly effective and correlated with the generation of Ebola-specific CD8(+) T-cell and antibody responses. Even when animals were immunized once with ADV-GP/NP and challenged 28 days later, they remained resistant to challenge with either low or high doses of virus. This accelerated vaccine provides an intervention that may help to limit the epidemic spread of Ebola, and is applicable to other viruses."

We report a direct, selective, oxidative condensation of two methane molecules to acetic acid at 180 degrees C in liquid sulfuric acid. Carbon-13 isotopic labeling studies show that both carbons of acetic acid originate from methane. The reaction is catalyzed by palladium, and the results are consistent with the reaction occurring by tandem catalysis, involving methane C-H activation to generate Pd-CH3 species, followed by efficient oxidative carbonylation with methanol, generated in situ from methane, to produce acetic acid."

Regional broadband recordings of this event provide an opportunity to accurately observe the speed at which a fault ruptures during an earthquake, which has important implications for seismic risk and for understanding earthquake physics. We determined that rupture propagated on the 400-km-long fault at an average speed of 3.7 to 3.9 km/s, which exceeds the shear velocity of the brittle part of the crust. Rupture started at sub-Rayleigh wave velocity and became supershear, probably approaching 5 km/s, after about 100 km of propagation."

ADAMTS-1 mRNA is induced in granulosa cells of periovulatory follicles by the luteinizing hormone surge through a progesterone receptor-dependent mechanism. Female progesterone receptor knockout (PRKO) mice are infertile primarily due to ovulatory failure and lack the normal periovulatory induction of ADAMTS-1 mRNA. We therefore investigated the protein localization and function of ADAMTS-1 in ovulating ovaries. Antibodies against two specific peptide regions, the pro-domain and the metalloprotease domain of ADAMTS-1, were generated. Pro-ADAMTS-1 of 110 kDa was identified in mural granulosa cells and appears localized to cytoplasmic secretory vesicles. The mature (85-kDa pro-domain truncated) form accumulated in the extracellular matrix of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) during the process of matrix expansion. Each form of ADAMTS-1 protein increased >10-fold after the ovulatory luteinizing hormone surge in wild-type but not PRKO mice. Versican is also localized selectively to the ovulating COC matrix and was found to be cleaved yielding a 70-kDa N-terminal fragment immunopositive for the neoepitope DPEAAE generated by ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 protease activity. This extracellular processing of versican was reduced in ADAMTS-1-deficient PRKO mouse ovaries. These observations suggest that one function of ADAMTS-1 in ovulation is to cleave versican in the expanded COC matrix and that the anovulatory phenotype of PRKO mice is at least partially due to loss of this function.

Versican is member of the lectican/hyalectan family that includes aggrecan, brevican, and neurocan, all of which possess large glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment domains substituted with chondroitin sulfate or keratan sulfate (24LeBaron R.G.

The proteases ADAMTS-1/4 have been shown to cleave versican V0 and V1 in the GAGβ domain in vitro and in human aortic intima in vivo (32Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L.

This cleavage releases a 70-kDa N-terminal fragment from V1, thus severing the matrix cross-linking properties of the N- and C-terminal globular domains. This may result in a functional alteration in versican interactions, matrix structure, and adhesive properties (31Wu Y. Chen L. Zheng P.S. Yang B.B. J. Biol.

Because the production of ADAMTS-1 is temporally related to ovulation and is deficient in anovulatory PRKO mice, the present study was undertaken to investigate the localization and function of ADAMTS-1 protein in ovulating ovaries. Novel specific antibodies were generated against peptides corresponding to two regions of mouse ADAMTS-1. The localization of precursor and mature forms of the protease were examined using these antibodies in ovulating ovaries of wild type mice. The product of ADAMTS-1/4-mediated cleavage of versican was identified using a recently developed neoepitope antibody (32Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C.

We found a positive correlation between neoepitope abundance and ADAMTS-1 protein expression and localization in the expanding COC matrix during ovulation. Versican processing was compared in wild type mice, ADAMTS-1-deficient PRKO mice, and COX-2 null mice that fail to ovulate but have normal ADAMTS-1 mRNA expression. The results indicate that ADAMTS-1 specifically accumulates on the COC matrix and that versican V1 is a substrate cleaved by ADAMTS-1 during COC expansion and ovulation.

Generation of Mouse ADAMTS-1 Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against two distinct peptides derived from ADAMTS-1 corresponding to a region of the pro-peptide or the metalloprotease domain (Fig. 1). These sequences were selected for their unique specificity for ADAMTS-1 compared with other ADAMTS and metalloprotease family members. Polyclonal antibodies were generated by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Briefly, peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for subcutaneous inoculation of rabbits. After 4 and 6 weeks, the serum was harvested and affinity purified over a column of the immobilized peptide. The titer of the affinity-purified IgG was measured against the immunogen peptide.

Follicular growth and ovulation were stimulated in mice at 21 days of age by a hormonal regimen in which 4 IU of PMSG was injected intra-peritoneally followed 48 h later with 5 IU of hCG injected intra-peritoneally. Ovaries were isolated from untreated, PMSG-treated, or PMSG- and hCG-treated mice at selected time intervals as indicated under “Results” and in the legends to Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5. Expanded COCs were isolated from PMSG/hCG-stimulated (12 h) ovaries by selective puncture of preovulatory follicles with a fine 27.5-gauge needle. After collection of the expanded COCs, the remaining granulosa cells were harvested by further repeated puncture of follicles. Ovulated COCs were isolated from the oviducts of mice 16 h after hCG administration by locating and cutting the oviduct near the COC mass, releasing the COC into a small amount of culture medium. Non-ovulated granulosa cells present in the ovaries of PMSG/hCG-treated (16 h) mice were then isolated by needle puncture of the ovary as described above. Each sample of isolated granulosa cells or COC represents a pool from four or five mice.Fig. 3Expression of ADAMTS-1 mRNA and abundance of pro- and mature ADAMTS-1 mural granulosa cells or COCs. A, isolated RNA from COC, granulosa cells (GC), and the residual ovarian compartments of PMSG/hCG-treated (12 h) mice were analyzed by ADAMTS-1-specific RT-PCR. RNA isolated from five mice and analyzed in three repeated RT-PCR assays is shown as mean ± S.E. Predominant ADAMTS-1 expression was observed in the mural granulosa compartment. Some of the message detected in residual compartment likely represents granulosa cell contamination. B, protein extracts (10 μg) of granulosa cells (GC) and COC were specifically isolated from immature ovaries of either unstimulated (U), PMSG (P) (48 h), or PMSG/hCG-treated mice for the indicated times and analyzed in Western blots using antibodies to the pro- or metalloprotease domains as indicated. The pro form of ADAMTS-1 of 110 kDa (black arrowhead) was specifically detected in hCG-stimulated granulosa cells and COC using either the pro-domain antibody or the MP antibody. The mature (pro-domain truncated) form of ADAMTS-1 of ∼85 kDa (open arrowhead) was detected after hCG treatment only with the metalloprotease antibody and was predominantly localized in COC extracts after 12 or 16 h of hCG treatment. Each lane represents pooled extracts from five mice. C, RNA from ovulated COC and whole ovaries (WO) after PMSG + hCG-treatment (16 h) was analyzed by specific RT-PCR. Relative expression of ADAMTS-1, COX-2, TSG-6, and Vc as well as the ribosomal protein L-19 RNA loading control was analyzed. Amplification of ADAMTS-1 and L-19 was performed in the same tube.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Immunohistochemical localization of pro- and mature ADAMTS-1 in mouse ovaries. A, sections of ovaries from untreated, PMSG-, and PMSG/hCG-treated (12 h) mice were immunostained with antibodies against pro-ADAMTS-1 followed by counterstain with hematoxylin (left panels) or the anti-MP domain of ADAMTS-1 without counterstain (right panels). Each antibody detected an intense specific signal in PMSG/hCG-treated (12 h) samples. Pro-ADAMTS-1 was most intensely detected in distinct cytoplasmic vesicles of mural granulosa cells (mGC). The metalloprotease domain antibody detected ADAMTS-1 predominantly in the extracellular matrix and cumulus cell surfaces of COCs. The specificity of this staining is confirmed by the lack of detectable staining in wild type (WT) ovaries after PMSG stimulation alone or in PMSG/hCG-treated (12 h) progesterone receptor null (PRKO) ovaries. The staining pattern with each antibody was essentially identical in wild type (not shown), COX-2+/-, and PR+/- ovaries but was slightly different in COX-2-/- ovaries that had aberrant cumulus expansion. These ovaries showed staining in the COC matrix as well as the basal region of the granulosa layers, possibly indicative of a secondary site of ADAMTS-1 localization.

Pro-ADAMTS-1 was most strongly detected in mural granulosa cells with a specific intracellular localization. Staining with anti-MP-ADAMTS-1 of ovaries from two individual animals are shown that emphasize the distinct immunostaining in matrix and cumulus cell surfaces, whereas mural granulosa cells stain weakly. mGC, mural granulosa cells; o, oocyte; tc, theca cells. C, sections of ovaries from wild type mice collected after PMSG/hCG treatment (16 h). Ovulated luteinizing follicles (OF; shown at 5×, left panels and 40×, middle panels) contained intracellular protein detected with the anti-pro-ADAMTS-1 antibody as well as cell surface MP-ADAMTS-1 staining. Ovulated COC present in oviducts (O; right panels) contained intracellular pro-ADAMTS-1 in some cumulus cells as well as cell surface staining for the mature protein. Staining of the inter-cellular matrix between cumulus cells was diffuse in ovulated COC. Arrows indicate punctate intracellular pro-ADAMTS-1 staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Versican fragments containing the neoepitope DPEAAE are generated in cumulus oocyte complexes during ovulation. Granulosa cells or COCs were isolated from ovaries of untreated mice (U) or mice stimulated with PMSG (P) or PMSG/hCG for the indicated times. Extracts (10 μg) were analyzed in Western blots with antibodies against full-length versican or the DPEAAE peptide as indicated. High molecular mass (>300 kDa) versican immunoreactive bands corresponding to intact V0 and V1 isoforms are indicated. Both antibodies also identified a 70-kDa band specifically in COC after hCG treatment (filled arrowheads) that corresponds to the V1 N-terminal fragment ending in DPEAAE. A larger band of DPEAAE immunoreactivity of ∼300 kDa in COC (open arrowhead) corresponds to a band of Vc immunoreactivity and may represent intact V1 detected because of the high versican concentration in these lanes. A DPEAAE immunoreactive band of ∼240 kDa was nonspecifically detected. Specificity of the 70 kDa DPEAAE-positive band in COC was confirmed by preadsorption of the antibody with the peptide (10 μm) prior to Western blotting, resulting in dramatically reduced reactivity with COC extracts from hCG 12- and 16-h treated COC (right-hand panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All animals were provided food and water ad libitum and housed under a 12-h light, 12-h dark schedule and treated in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Western Blot—Whole mouse ovary or isolated granulosa, residual, and COC extracts were prepared by homogenization in 6 m urea and 0.1% Triton buffer containing protease inhibitors EDTA, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin. Prestained protein size markers from Invitrogen as well as Bio-Rad were included in most Western blots. For ADAMTS-1 Western blots, 20 μg of protein from each extract were separated on 12% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by a 1-h room temperature incubation of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST; 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat milk. Blots were then incubated for 1 h with anti-ADAMTS-1 primary antibodies 1:5000 in 3% milk then washed in TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG 1:10,000 (Amersham Biosciences) then washed with TBST. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed using Pierce Super Signal according to the manufacturer's specifications (Pierce). Western blots for ADAMTS-4 using 10 μg of isolated COC or granulosa cell extracts employed an antibody (JSCYNH) at 1:1000 as described previously (34Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For Western analysis with antibodies Vc and JSCDPE, COC extracts (10 μg) were diluted 1:10 in 0.08 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 0.02 units/ml chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then resolved on 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions and then processed as for ADAMTS-1 Western blots. The versican antibody (Vc) was used at 1:500 dilution and JSCDPE was used at 1:100 dilution in 3% nonfat milk. Western blots were quantitated by densitometry of autoradiographs using a scanning laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry—Tissue and cellular localization of ADAMTS-1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on sections of 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded ovaries. Rehydrated sections were boiled for 10 min in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, and then treated for 10 min with 1 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 10 min of treatment with 0.1% H2O2 followed by a phosphate-buffered saline wash. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by 1 h of incubation with 10% normal goat serum followed by incubation with rabbit anti-ADAMTS-1 antibodies (1:500) in 10% goat serum overnight at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% Tween 20, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added for 30 min, slides were washed, and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was applied for 30 min. Sections were incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (Vector Laboratories) for 2 min and then dehydrated. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from isolated COC, granulosa cells, and residual tissue using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by RNA precipitation in isopropanol. RT-PCR primers were designed against the mouse ADAMTS-1 cDNA sequence using a web-based primer prediction algorithm (35Rozen, S., and Skaletsky, H.

Briefly, RT-PCR was performed using 250 ng of total RNA reverse transcribed using 1× thermocycle buffer and 250 ng of oligo(dT) primer, 1 mm dNTP, 4 mm MgCl2, 20 units of RNasin, and 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) at 42 °C for 90 min. After completion of the RT reactions, 250 ng of each primer, 2 μCi of [32P]dCTP (ICN Radiochemicals, Los Angeles, CA), and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase in 1× thermocycle buffer and 2.5 mm MgCl2 were added. PCR conditions were 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with a 72 °C final extension for 5 min (36Arakawa T. Laneuville O. Miller C.A. Lakkides K.M.

https://openalex.org/W1978759815,"The neural representations associated with learned auditory behaviours, such as recognizing individuals based on their vocalizations, are not well described. Higher vertebrates learn to recognize complex conspecific vocalizations that comprise sequences of easily identified, naturally occurring auditory objects, which should facilitate the analysis of higher auditory pathways. Here we describe the first example of neurons selective for learned conspecific vocalizations in adult animals--in starlings that have been trained operantly to recognize conspecific songs. The neuronal population is found in a non-primary forebrain auditory region, exhibits increased responses to the set of learned songs compared with novel songs, and shows differential responses to categories of learned songs based on recognition training contingencies. Within the population, many cells respond highly selectively to a subset of specific motifs (acoustic objects) present only in the learned songs. Such neuronal selectivity may contribute to song-recognition behaviour, which in starlings is sensitive to motif identity. In this system, both top-down and bottom-up processes may modify the tuning properties of neurons during recognition learning, giving rise to plastic representations of behaviourally meaningful auditory objects."
https://openalex.org/W2128516823,"We present acoustic images of oceanic thermohaline structure created from marine seismic reflection profiles across the major oceanographic front between the Labrador Current and the North Atlantic Current. The images show that distinct water masses can be mapped, and their internal structure imaged, using low-frequency acoustic reflections from sound speed contrasts at interfaces across which temperature changes. The warm/cold front is characterized by east-dipping reflections generated by thermohaline intrusions in the uppermost 1000 meters of the ocean. Our results imply that marine seismic reflection techniques can provide excellent spatial resolution of important oceanic phenomena, including thermohaline intrusions, internal waves, and eddies."

Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane of nerve and muscle, they stabilize the resting potential and inhibit electrical excitability. In epithelia, they play essential roles in fluid and electrolyte transport. Another role for chloride channels is seen in the acidification of intracellular organelles such as endosomes. To maintain electrical neutrality, the inward pumping of protons must be accompanied by a chloride current (4Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzead F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A variation on this theme appears to underlie the essential role of chloride channels in the extreme acid response of enteric bacteria (5Iyer R. Iverson T.M. Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2002; 419: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of the original roles of chloride channels may have been in promoting microbial survival at low pH. Over the past 25 years, three distinct families of chloride channels have been molecularly characterized: the ClC family, the ligand-gated chloride channels of the γ-aminobutyric acid/glycine receptor family, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. In mammals there are nine members of the ClC family, and these function as dimers with a complex transmembrane topography (6Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor gene families are composed, respectively, of 5 and at least 15 homologous subunits (7Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Betz H. Kuhse J. Schmieden V. Laube B. Kirsch J. Harvey R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and within each family the subunits coassemble to form pentameric ligand-gated chloride channels. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is distinctive in being the only ATP-binding cassette transporter that is also a channel; its expression is mostly in epithelia (9Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A fourth type of chloride channel, corresponding to a chloride conductance in tracheal epithelium, has been described (10Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K.

At present, the extent to which the known chloride channel families account for the diversity of observed chloride conductances remains an open question. The most recent additions to the list of molecularly defined chloride channels are the bestrophins. Bestrophins were originally defined as a family of over 20 related sequences in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome with no homology to any proteins of known function. The first mammalian bestrophin was identified as the protein product of the gene responsible for autosomal dominant vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD), 1The abbreviations used are: VMD, vitelliform macular dystrophy; MTSEA, 2-aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate; MTSET, methanethio-sulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; TEVP, tobacco etch virus protease; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; hBest1, human bestrophin1; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; hGH, human growth hormone.1The abbreviations used are: VMD, vitelliform macular dystrophy; MTSEA, 2-aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate; MTSET, methanethio-sulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; TEVP, tobacco etch virus protease; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; hBest1, human bestrophin1; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; hGH, human growth hormone. also known as Best disease (12Marquardt A.

VMD is characterized by the following symptoms: (a) a diminution or loss of the late light peak of the electro-oculogram, caused by a defect within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE); (b) a progressive loss of central vision; and (c) an accumulation of debris within and beneath the RPE (14Francois J.

A. 2000; 97: 12758-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Evidence that the bestrophins function as chloride channels comes from their expression in transfected 293 cells (22Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate the following: (a) each of four different bestrophin family members, two from human, one from Drosophila, and one from C. elegans, produces a chloride conductance with a distinct I-V relationship and/or ion selectivity; (b) the chloride current conferred by wild type human bestrophin (hBest1) is rapidly inactivated by sulfhydryl-reactive agents, whereas the current conferred by a cysteine-less hBest1 is resistant to such inactivation; (c) the bestrophins oligomerize to form tetramers or pentamers; (d) the chloride conductance observed upon expression of hBest1 is calcium-sensitive; and (e) multiple hBest1 mutants responsible for VMD dominantly inhibit the chloride conductance associated with wild type hBest1, consistent with their dominance in vivo. The most straightforward interpretation of these diverse observations is that the bestrophins function directly as chloride channels, although they do not exclude the possibility that the bestrophins may coassemble with additional subunits in the RPE or in 293 cells. In the present paper we report the primary sequence and functional expression of the remaining two members of the human bestrophin family, an analysis of the functional and transmembrane topographies of hBest1 using cysteine-substitution mutagenesis and whole-cell recording, and a map of the transmembrane topography of hBest1 using insertional mutagenesis of N-glycosylation and protease cleavage sites. These data reveal an intriguing pattern of allosteric channel regulation and an unusual transmembrane disposition for the bestrophins. They also lend further support to the conclusion that the bestrophins function as bona fide chloride channels. Amplification and Cloning of Bestrophin cDNAs—PCR amplification was performed using putative coding region and 3′-untranslated region primers based on the hBest3 and hBest4 genomic sequences. Human testis, fetal brain cDNA, and DNA prepared from a human retina cDNA library (23Nathans J. Thomas D. Hogness D.S. Science. 1986; 232: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) were used as templates. PCR products were cloned, sequenced, assembled to reconstruct the complete coding regions, engineered to carry an optimal translation initiation sequence (CCAC-CATG) upstream of the initiator methionine, and inserted into mammalian expression vector pRK5. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were constructed in an hBest1 variant carrying a C-terminal Rim3F4 epitope tag (22Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR amplification, and all DNA segments that were amplified by PCR were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation and to rule out spurious ones. Mapping of Transmembrane Topography by N-Glycosylation—293 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), harvested 24 h later by detachment in 1× PBS and 5 mm EDTA, and pelleted at 3,000 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet from one well of a 6-well plate was dissolved in 100 μl of solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1× PBS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, each at 1 mg/ml). After incubating on ice for 30 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. 10 μl of supernatant was mixed with 40 μl of solubilization buffer with or without 125 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with mAb Rim3F4. Mapping of Transmembrane Topography by Tobacco Etch Virus Protease (TEVP) Cleavage—TEVP, tagged with 6 histidines, was expressed in Escherichia coli, denatured in urea, purified by metal chelate chromatography to apparent homogeneity, and refolded by dialysis, essentially as described (25Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently transfected with hBest1 expression plasmids and harvested as described above. The cell pellet from 1 well of a 6-well plate was resuspended in 100 μl of cold TEVP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA). Cells were broken using a small motor-driven homogenizer for 1 min, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 600 × g rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. 10 μl of the supernatant was added to 40 μl of TEVP buffer without TEVP, with 1 μg of TEVP, or with 1 μg of TEVP and 1% Triton X-100. After 3 h of incubation at 30 °C, an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer was added to stop the reaction. TEVP cleavage was monitored by immunoblotting as described above. The human growth hormone (hGH)-TEVP site-Myc epitope-human epidermal growth factor receptor3 extracellular domain (HER3EC) fusion protein was constructed by inserting a Myc epitope between the TEVP site and a HER3EC coding region that had been inserted into the mammalian expression vector pSVGH-0 (26Leahy D.J. Dann C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For experiments with this hGH fusion protein, the secreted protein was removed from the medium by washing the transfected cells with serum-free medium prior to harvesting. Whole-cell Recordings—293 cells were transfected with a bestrophin expression plasmid mixed with an EGFP plasmid at a 10:1 ratio by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at 2 μg of DNA per 3.5-cm plate. The EGFP plasmid alone (2 μg) was used as a transfection control. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the cells were detached from the plates with 5 mm EDTA in 1× PBS and were replated at lower density. Approximately 60 h after transfection, whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C) on single, isolated green cells identified under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Isolated cells were chosen because electrical coupling between adjacent cells would otherwise lead to space-clamp problems and incomplete dialysis of the coupled cell interior with the pipette solution. Standard extracellular solution contained (in millimolar): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Na-Hepes, pH 7.4. Standard pipette solution contained (in millimolar): 148 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 EGTA, and 10 Na-Hepes, pH 7.3, giving 40 nm free [Ca2+]. CsCl was chosen to block endogenous K+ currents. In some of the sulfhydryl modification experiments, 20 mm cysteine was added to the pipette solution in order to test the effect of intracellular cysteine. In this case, the pipette solution contained (in millimolar): 20 cysteine, 128 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 EGTA, and 10 Na-Hepes, pH 7.3. Xenopus Oocyte Recordings—Xenopus laevis oocytes were obtained surgically under anesthesia in 0.3% tricaine methanesulfonate solution. After enzymatic treatment for defolliculation (2 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma), 2–3 h at room temperature in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin)), stage V–VI oocytes were selected and maintained for 1 day in modified Barth's saline at 17 °C before cRNA injection (50 nl/oocyte) using a Nanoject microinjector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA). Whole-cell currents of oocytes were measured within 1–5 days after injection using a standard two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with micropipettes of 0.5–3-megohm resistance filled with 3 m KCl. The recordings were performed in solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 5mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Current and voltage data were acquired and analyzed with DIGIDATA 1321A and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Sulfhydryl Modification—After establishment of a stable whole-cell recording, 2-trimethylammonioethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSET) as the bromide salt (Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada) in standard extracellular solution was added to the recording chamber in place of the standard solution. For these experiments, a 0.1 m MTSET stock solution was prepared in distilled water, stored on ice, and used within 90 min. The standard extracellular solution with MTSET diluted to the indicated working concentration was made immediately prior to use. Identification of Four Bestrophin Family Members in the Human Genome—Homology searches of the nearly complete human genome sequence revealed four sequences with high homology to human bestrophin. One of these corresponds to bestrophin itself, referred to here as hBest1. A second sequence corresponds to hBest2, a bestrophin family member that was functionally characterized by Sun et al.

The remaining two sequences, referred to here as hBest3 and hBest4, are divided into putative introns and exons in a manner that closely resembles the gene organization of hBest1. Transcripts derived from hBest3 and hBest4 appear to be rare in the major human tissues, as they were undetectable by hybridization to RNA blots of adrenal, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, retina, skeletal muscle, testis, fibroblasts, and white blood cells (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, hBest3 and hBest4 were represented in the November, 2002, EST data base by only 18 and 4 entries, respectively, out of a total of 4.9 million human EST entries. Stohr et al. (27Stohr H. Marquardt A. Nanda I. Schmid M. Weber B.H. Eur. J. Hum.

To verify the predicted intron-exon structure of the hBest3 and hBest4 genes and to obtain cDNA sequences suitable for functional expression in transfected cells, the coding regions of hBest3 and hBest4 were assembled by a combination of reverse transcriptase-PCR and library screening of cDNA from human testis and retina (hBest3) or human testis and fetal brain (hBest4; Fig. 1). The resulting cDNA sequences show hBest3 and hBest4 to be 668 and 474 amino acids in length, respectively. The cDNA sequences also confirm the intron-exon structures predicted from the hBest1 homology search of the human genome. In pairwise comparisons, the four human bestrophins share between 56 and 66% sequence identity within the conserved N-terminal ∼360 amino acids but show minimal homology within the C-terminal domain (Table I).Table IPercent amino acid identity among human and murine bestrophins, divided into N- and C-terminal domainsPercent amino acid identity in the N-terminal domainhBest1hBest2hBest3hBest4mBest1mBest2mBest3hBest263hbest36566hBest4566359mBest182606356mbest26495676360mbest3616393596064mbest445514569445143Percent amino acid identity in the C-terminal domainhBest1hBest2hBest3hBest4mBest1mBest2mBest3hBest219hBest398hbest461010mBest1361999mBest2187481319mbest38856988mbest447734567 Open table in a new tab Evolution of the Bestrophin Family—Homology searches of the nearly complete mouse and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) genome sequences reveal four and three bestrophin homologues, respectively. Among the currently complete invertebrate genomes, 4 bestrophins are found in Drosophila melanogaster, 2 in mosquito (Aenopheles gambia), and 25 in Caenorhabditis elegans. As noted above in the context of the human sequences, bestrophins in all of these species are divided into a conserved N-terminal domain that includes the putative transmembrane regions, and a C-terminal domain that is highly variable in both length and sequence (Table I). Based on this differential conservation, we have assigned position 364 in hBest1 as the border between the N- and C-terminal domains. In comparing the four pairs of human and mouse bestrophin orthologues, the N- and C-terminal domains show 69–95 and 34–74% identity, respectively (Table I). In pairwise comparisons among all non-orthologous human and mouse bestrophins, the N- and C-terminal domains show 44–67 and 4–19% identity, respectively (Table I). Fig. 1B shows an unrooted dendrogram depicting the amino acid sequence divergence among human, mouse, and pufferfish N-terminal domains. In comparing N-terminal domain sequences among mouse and human orthologues, Best2 and Best3 are nearly identical, whereas Best1 and Best4 show considerably greater divergence. Similar analyses with both vertebrate and invertebrate bestrophin N-terminal domains place most of the vertebrate bestrophins on a separate and relatively conserved branch within the larger bestrophin family. Interestingly, almost all of the VMD-associated mutations reported to date are single amino acid substitutions that cluster within the N-terminal domain (28Bakall B. Marknell T. Ingvast S.

However, within this domain these mutations show only modest colocalization with evolutionarily conserved positions (Fig. 1C). Functional Properties of hBest3 and hBest4 —To determine whether hBest3 and hBest4 can function as chloride channels, as has been shown for hBest1 and hBest2, each was expressed together with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in transiently transfected 293 cells, as described (22Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In whole-cell recordings, hBest3 and hBest4 transfected cells each exhibited a distinctive conductance that was not observed in control cells transfected with EGFP alone (Fig. 2). In Fig. 2, the mean whole-cell currents 1 day after transient transfection were 1831 ± 501 pA (n = 5 cells) for hBest3 and 1248 ± 788 pA (n = 4 cells) for hBest4 when measured 5 s (hBest3) or 320 ms (hBest4) after stepping from 0 to –150 mV. However, considerably larger whole-cell currents are typically seen for cells transfected with hBest4; indeed, for many of these cells the currents were too large to permit reliable whole-cell measurements. As seen in Fig. 2, the I-V relation of hBest4 resembles that seen for hBest1, whereas the I-V relation of hBest3 is the most strongly rectifying of any bestrophin tested thus far. Cells expressing hBest3 or hBest4 exhibit a characteristic time course of whole-cell current in response to a negative voltage step (Fig. 2). Cells expressing hBest3 respond with a prolonged and steady increase in conductance that continues for at least 20 s. The measured time constant of this current increase is 9.4 ± 0.8 s (n = 3 cells). When hBest3-expressing cells are returned from –150 to –50 mV, they exhibit a slow tail current. Cells expressing hBest4 respond to a negative voltage step with a rapid and roughly linear current response which then decreases by ∼20% over the ensuing several hundred milliseconds. In earlier work, we observed that cells expressing hBest1, hBest2, and the Drosophila bestrophin dmB-est1 show minimal changes in current amplitude during a 320-ms voltage step, and that cells expressing the C. elegans bestrophin ceBest1 show little time dependence of the current response except at large negative voltages (22Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point to hBest3 as the most atypical of the four human bestrophins. In preliminary experiments aimed at exploring alternate expression systems for the bestrophins, we were unable to detect new chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes following injection of synthetic hBest1 mRNA, whereas control injections of ClC-0 mRNA with identical 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions produced large chloride currents. These data suggest that 293 cells may contain chaperones, trafficking proteins, and/or channel subunits that are required for bestrophin function or plasma membrane localization. Identification of Cys-69 as the Principal Target for Wild Type hBest1 Channel Modification by MTSET—In earlier work, we observed that cells expressing hBest1 exhibit a rapid loss of whole-cell current upon exposure to the cysteine modification reagent 2-aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate (MTSEA), whereas cells expressing an hBest1 mutant in which all five cysteines were simultaneously mutated to alanine are resistant to inactivation by MTSEA (22Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Inactivation by MTSEA almost certainly involves covalent modification of one or more cysteines that are accessible to the extracellular space because exposure to MTSET, a cysteine modification reagent with a fixed positive charge and therefore even greater membrane impermeability, produces nearly identical kinetics of inactivation (Fig. 3A; compare with Fig. 3 of Ref. 22Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To determine which cysteine(s) within hBest1 are responsible for inactivation, we determined the effect of MTSET exposure on five hBest1 mutants, each of which retains only one of the five cysteines. These five hBest1 mutants, referred to as “C23-retained,” “C42-retained,” “C69-retained,” “C221-retained,” and “C251-retained,” carry alanines in place of the remaining four cysteines. Importantly, none of the five cysteines is conserved across the bestrophin family, indicating that they are unlikely to be involved in disulfide bonds. As seen in Fig. 3, B and C, each of the five single cysteine mutants confers a readily measurable whole-cell current, but only C69-retained is inactivated by MTSET. The importance of Cys-69 in conferring sensitivity to MTSET is further strengthened by the observation that mutating this residue to alanine (C69A) in the context of an otherwise wild type hBest1 sequence results in resistance to MTSET-dependent inactivation (Fig. 3B). These data place Cys-69 in or accessible to the extracellular space and indicate that covalent modification of Cys-69 with the bulky and positively charged trimethyl adduct derived from MTSET either blocks the channel pore directly or induces an allosteric transition that results in channel closure. Channel Activation and Inhibition by MTSET following Cysteine-substitution Mutagenesis—Covalent modification of cysteines that have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis is a widely used method for mapping the functional and transmembrane topography of ion channels (32Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). As described below, we have used this approach to explore the accessibility of"

In order for zeolites to find applications as innovative materials, they need to be organized into large two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) arrays. We report that uniformly aligned polyurethane films can serve as templates for the synthesis of uniformly aligned 2D and possibly 3D arrays of silicalite-1 crystals, in which the orientations of the crystals are controlled by the nature of the polymers. We propose that the supramolecularly organized organic-inorganic composites that consist of the hydrolyzed organic products and the seed crystals are responsible for this phenomenon."

This is dependent on the E3 activity of the HECT E3s but not on that of Cbl. Consistent with these observations, in cells expressing the epidermal growth factor receptor, Nedd4 reverses Cbl-b effects on receptor down-regulation, ubiquitylation, and proximal events in signaling.

These mediate the transfer of Ub from Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2s) to substrates or to a Ub that is already linked to substrate. There are two major classes of E3s: those that are homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) and RING finger and RING finger-like E3s (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar, 3Patterson, C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As part of the ubiquitylation process, HECT E3s form thiol-ester catalytic intermediates with Ub. For RING finger and related E3s, there is no evidence for such intermediates (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). A large number of yeast and metazoan plasma membrane receptors and transporters are substrates for ubiquitylation, which generally leads to their degradation in the yeast vacuole or metazoan lysosome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the HECT domain E3, Rsp5p, is implicated in the ubiquitylation of many membrane proteins (5Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). This E3 also contains multiple WW domains in its amino-terminal half that are responsible for substrate binding. WW domains interact with a variety of proline-based motifs, and certain WW domains also recognize proline-containing phosphoserine/phosphothreonine sequences (7Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). There are several metazoan Rsp5p homologs. The most closely related to Rsp5 and also the best characterized is Nedd4 (also known as Nedd4-1). A highly homologous protein, Nedd4-2, which is the product of a different gene, has more recently been identified (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are implicated in the ubiquitylation and lysosomal targeting of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), as is the related family member WWP2 (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M.

Closely related to these are WWP1 and Itch, also known as Alp4, which has been implicated in the Notch signaling pathway (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Other WW domain HECT E3s that share significant homology with these include SMURF-1 and -2, which are involved in degradation of SMAD proteins (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Most WW-HECT E3s also have a calcium-dependent lipid-binding (C2) domain at the extreme amino terminus that mediates plasma membrane association (14Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In addition to ENaC, Nedd4 ubiquitylates other substrates including some that reside at, or transit through, the plasma membrane such as the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (15Pham N. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46995-47003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

For another class of membrane proteins, the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the Cbl family of RING finger E3s are generally implicated in down-regulation with evidence that they mediate RTK ubiquitylation as part of this process (20Sanjay, A., Horne, W.

Mammalian Cbl proteins include c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c (also known as Cbl-3). c-Cbl has also been shown to play a role in the degradation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases including Src, Fyn, and Syk (20Sanjay, A., Horne, W. C., and Baron, R. (2001) Science's STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/sigtrans;2001/110/pe40.pdf.Google Scholar, 21Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Mutant forms of c-Cbl that function as “dominant negatives” have been shown to have transforming activity, presumably as a consequence of decreased turnover and thus increased activity of tyrosine kinases (20Sanjay, A., Horne, W. C., and Baron, R. (2001) Science's STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/sigtrans;2001/110/pe40.pdf.Google Scholar, 21Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Recruitment of Cbl family members to activated RTKs occurs through interactions involving the highly conserved amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domains of the Cbl proteins. c-Cbl and Cbl-b are closely related proteins with extensive proline-rich regions that can bind a variety of Src homology 3-containing proteins implicated in signaling and receptor down-regulation (20Sanjay, A., Horne, W.

Since Nedd4 and Cbl both ubiquitylate plasma membrane proteins and Cbl proteins all include potential sites of interaction with WW domains, we asked whether they might physically and functionally interact. We report here that Nedd4, as well as Itch, associates with all three mammalian Cbl proteins and regulates Cbl protein levels by targeting them for ubiquitindependent proteasomal degradation. Consequently, Nedd4 inhibits Cbl-b-mediated ubiquitylation and down-regulation of the EGFR and reverses effects on proximal events in signaling through this receptor. Similarly, Nedd4 reverses Cbl-mediated down-regulation of activated Src. These data demonstrate negative regulation of RING finger E3s by HECT family E3s and point to the potential for an additional level of complexity in the regulation of protein-tyrosine kinases. Plasmids—HA epitope-tagged Cbl-b, Cbl-bC373A, and Cbl-b N1/3 have been described (35Ettenberg S.A. Magnifico A. Cuello M. Nau M.M. Rubinstein Y.R. Yarden Y. Weissman A.M. Lipkowitz S. J. Biol.

Plasmid encoding the Cbl-b proline-rich (PR) domain (aa 482–721) was generated by digestion of wild type Cbl-b with BamHI and EcoRI and ligation into pCEV29N from BglII to EcoRI to generate pCEV29N-Cbl-b PR. Plasmid encoding the Cbl-b RING finger (aa 327–483) was generated by digestion of Cbl-b C-terminal 2/3 (35Ettenberg S.A. Magnifico A. Cuello M. Nau M.M. Rubinstein Y.R. Yarden Y. Weissman A.M.

Plasmid encoding Nedd4 in which the active site cysteine was mutated to serine (pc-HA-Nedd4C744S) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene, La Jolla CA). N-terminal Myc-tagged mouse Itch was generated by subcloning of full-length Itch (12Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat.

Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-Cbl-b (H121; H454), anti-GFP (FL), anti-c-Cbl (C-15), anti-Src (N16), anti-EGFR (1005), anti-Myc 9E10 (SC-40), and anti-MAPK (C-14) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-EGFR (Ab-3) was from Oncogene Science (Boston, MA); anti-phospho MAPK was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); and anti-HA epitope (12CA5) was from culture supernatant. Anti-Ub has been described (41Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.J. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Anti-Nedd4 was raised in rabbit by immunization with a GST fusion of mouse Nedd4 (36Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, reagents were used at the following concentrations in cell experiments: lactacystin, 20 μm (Calbiochem); cycloheximide, 100 μm; ammonium chloride, 20 mm; recombinant human EGF, 100 ng/ml (Pepro Tech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Cell Experiments—The Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cell line (41Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.J. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and 293T human embryonic kidney cells expressing SV40 large T antigen (37Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) were maintained as described. Transfections in 293T cells were with calcium phosphate (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfections into HeLa were with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). For experiments involving Cbl-c, cells were plated at 0.25 × 106 in 100-mm dishes. For all other experiments, 0.5 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes. Transfections were carried out the following day. Cbl constructs expressed at a considerably better level than Nedd4; therefore, in general, 0.5–3.0 μg of Cbl encoding plasmid and 5–12 μg of Nedd4 plasmids were used for transfections. In all transfection experiments, the total amount of plasmid was equalized among samples using the appropriate expression vector without insert (V) so that equivalent amounts of promoter were also expressed in each point. Cells were washed at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and, unless otherwise indicated, lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% β-octyl glucoside (Sigma), 10% glycerol, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors as described) (41Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.J. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were either first subjected to immunoprecipitation or directly resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using antibodies and protein A-agarose. The wash buffer used in immunoprecipitation differed from the lysis buffer in being 0.1% in both Triton X-100 and β-octyl glucoside. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using standard methods, either ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or 125I-protein A after incubation with primary antibodies. 125I quantification was by Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Proteasome and lysosomal inhibitors were added to cells for 8 h beginning 36 h after transfection. For experiments involving EGF, 293T cells (70% confluence) were incubated overnight in serum-free medium (reduced from 10%). To evaluate Cbl-b ubiquitylation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% SDS to disrupt protein-protein interactions. After clearing of lysates, SDS was diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer. For Cbl-b ubiquitylation, HA-Ub was co-expressed to increase signal, but immunoblotting was with polyclonal anti-Ub. In Vitro Binding and Ubiquitylation—GST fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were prepared, stained using Coomassie Blue, and quantified by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards. Proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose as described (42Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (37Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, in vitro translation products were incubated with bead-bound GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C prior to washing in lysis buffer. In vitro ubiquitylation was carried out using glutathione-Sepharose-bound fusion proteins and added translation products as described (43Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) and was modified to include 100 μm MG132 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 1 μm Ub aldehyde (Boston Biochemicals, Cambridge, MA). Nedd4 and Cbl-b Bind in Vitro—To ascertain whether Nedd4 and Cbl-b interact, GST fusion proteins of murine Nedd4 (36Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were evaluated for binding to in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Cbl-b (Fig. 1B, upper panel; see Fig. 1A for schematics of Cbl-b and Nedd4). Significant binding of Cbl-b to Nedd4 (GST-Nedd4; aa 52–777) was observed. The N-terminal portion of Nedd4 (GST-Nedd4-N; aa 52–422), which contains the three WW domains but lacks the HECT domain, similarly bound Cbl-b, whereas there was no specific binding to the C-terminal HECT domain (GST-Nedd4-C; aa 423–777). The domains of Cbl-b required for Nedd4 binding were next mapped (Fig. 1C). Nedd4 and Nedd4-N but not Nedd4-C demonstrated substantial binding to the proline-rich region of Cbl-b (Cbl-b PR) and to the nonoverlapping N-terminal third of Cbl-b (Cbl-b N1/3), which includes the phosphotyrosine binding domain as well as several noncanonical WW domain binding sites and a potential site of serine phosphorylation-dependent WW domain binding. In contrast, the RING finger and surrounding regions of Cbl-b did not bind Nedd4. Thus, Cbl-b and Nedd4 associate in a manner that does not require either protein's Ub ligase domain. Nedd4 and Cbl-b Associate in Cells—To evaluate whether Nedd4 and Cbl-b associate in cells, lysates from the Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell line, which expresses easily detectable levels of both Nedd4 and Cbl-b, were immunoprecipitated with either a polyclonal antibody raised against Nedd4 or anti-Cbl-b, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against one or the other (Fig. 2A). Substantial specific immunoprecipitation of Nedd4 using anti-Cbl-b was detected (lane 1), as was immunoprecipitation of Cbl-b with anti-Nedd4 (lane 3). Both Cbl-b and Nedd4 associate with lipid rafts (5Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 45Lafont F. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation was not affected by the presence or absence of β-octylglucoside, which disrupts lipid rafts. The co-immunoprecipitation of Cbl-b and Nedd4 suggests that a significant percentage of these molecules associate with each other in cells. If this is the case, preclearing of cell lysates with anti-Nedd4 would deplete a substantial percentage of Cbl-b. To evaluate this, lysates were first subject to immunoprecipitation either with anti-Nedd4 or with a nonspecific antibody followed by reimmunoprecipitation with anti-Cbl-b or with nonspecific antibody. As can be seen by comparing Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5, substantially less Cbl-b is immunoprecipitated after first preclearing with anti-Nedd4. Association of Nedd4 and Cbl-b was also observed in 293T human embryonic kidney cells (293T cells) when Nedd4 and Cbl-b were co-transfected, since there is significant specific immunoprecipitation of Nedd4 with anti-Cbl-b (Fig. 2C, lane 4, middle panel). Thus, Cbl-b and Nedd4 demonstrate a strong physical association both in vitro and in cells. Nedd4 Down-regulates Cbl Protein Levels—In transfected 293T cells, we noted that Cbl-b levels decreased when Nedd4 was co-expressed (Fig. 2C, upper panel, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, Nedd4 levels were unaffected by co-expression of Cbl-b (Fig. 2C, lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 4). This suggested that Nedd4 might mediate loss of Cbl-b. As shown in Fig. 3A, Cbl-b levels did not decrease when co-expressed with Nedd4 in which the catalytic cysteine was mutated (Nedd4C744S). In contrast, expression of wild type Nedd4 at a comparable level markedly decreased Cbl-b. Thus, the loss of Cbl-b that we observe requires the Ub ligase activity of Nedd4. The most likely explanation for our findings is that Cbl-b is being targeted for degradation by Nedd4. However, to exclude the possibility that the effect observed was occurring prior to protein synthesis, we measured the rate of loss of Cbl-b in the absence or presence of Nedd4, using cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis (Fig. 3B). As is evident (Fig. 3B), in addition to decreasing the level of Cbl-b at the beginning of the cycloheximide treatment, expression of Nedd4 markedly accelerated the rate of Cbl loss (t > 20 h without Nedd4, ∼5 h with Nedd4). Levels of co-expressed c-Cbl as well as the smaller Cbl-c protein (data not shown and Fig. 3C) were similarly affected by Nedd4, and consistent with this, both of these proteins also bound Nedd4 (data not shown). Thus, Nedd4 functionally and physically interacts with all three mammalian Cbl proteins. To determine whether the Nedd4-mediated loss of transfected Cbl extends to endogenous Cbl proteins, we examined endogenous Cbl levels in HeLa cells transfected with Nedd4. Under conditions where >70% transfection efficiency was achieved, Nedd4, but not catalytically inactive Nedd4C744S, resulted in a striking loss of endogenous Cbl-b and c-Cbl (Fig. 3D, middle panels). Similar results were obtained in 293T cells for endogenous c-Cbl (data not shown), which is the only Cbl family member readily detectable in these cells. To evaluate whether the Nedd4-mediated loss of Cbl-b requires the E3 activity of Cbl-b, wild type Cbl-b and RING mutant Cbl-b (Cb1-bC373A), which is inactive as an E3, were compared. As is evident (Fig. 4A), Nedd4 enhanced the loss of RING finger mutant Cbl-b (Cb1-bC373A) as well as wild type Cbl-b. This establishes that the E3 activity of Cbl-b is not required for Nedd4 to target it for degradation. Nedd4 Ubiquitylates Cbl-b and Targets It for Proteasomal Degradation—To determine whether Nedd4-mediated loss of Cbl-b involves the Ub-proteasome pathway, we first assessed whether Nedd4 ubiquitylates Cbl-b. To preclude autoubiquitylation of Cbl-b, cells were transfected with RING mutant Cbl-b (Cb1-bC373A), with or without co-transfection of Nedd4. After treatment with lactacystin to inhibit proteasome function and lysis of cells in 1% SDS to disrupt the association between Cbl-b and Nedd4, Cbl-b and Nedd4 immunoprecipitates were evaluated for ubiquitylation by immunoblotting with anti-Ub (Fig. 4B). Expression of Nedd4 resulted in a marked increase in ubiquitylated species immunoprecipitated with anti-Cbl-b (Fig. 4B, left upper panel). Nedd4 was not detected on reprobing of blots (data not shown), indicating that the SDS did disrupt protein-protein interactions as expected and that the ubiquitylation observed does not represent co-associated Nedd4 (data not shown). As further confirmation that the ubiquitylation seen with Nedd4 co-expression was of Cbl-b and not Nedd4, anti-Nedd4 immunoprecipitates from an equal amount of the same lysates were evaluated for ubiquitylation. No increase in ubiquitylation was observed with Nedd4 expression (right upper panel). Similar results were obtained with co-expression of w"

We have determined the temporal order of gene activation induced by NO in mammalian cells and have examined the signaling pathways that mediate the action of NO. Using microarrays to study the kinetics of gene activation by NO, we have determined that NO induces three distinct waves of gene activity. The first wave is induced within 30 min of exposure to NO and represents the primary gene targets of NO. It is followed by subsequent waves of gene activity that may reflect further cascades of NO-induced gene expression. We verified our results using quantitative real time PCR and further validated our conclusions about the effects of NO by using cytokines to induce endogenous NO production. We next applied pharmacological and genetic approaches to determine the signaling pathways that are used by NO to regulate gene expression. We used inhibitors of particular signaling pathways, as well as cells from animals with a deleted p53 gene, to define groups of genes that require phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, NF-κB, p53, or combinations thereof for activation by NO.

Our results demonstrate that NO utilizes several independent signaling pathways to induce gene expression. Nitric oxide regulates a wide range of physiological responses (1Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. 1st ed. Academic Press, San Diego2000Google Scholar). Most of the studies of NO action in animals have focused on its activity as an effector of rapid responses, such as regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle contraction, and neurotransmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In these contexts, NO action is mediated by fast acting signaling cascades, which rapidly subside after the disappearance of the original stimulus (e.g. calcium influx). NO can also stimulate signaling pathways that elicit long lasting changes in the cell, and it can also reset genetic programs. This function of NO is manifested in its ability to regulate gene expression (2Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), to mediate immune response and inflammation (3Nathan C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and to act as an antiproliferative factor to mediate tissue differentiation and organ development (4Enikolopov G. Banerji J. Kuzin B. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Peunova N. Scheinker V. Cline H. Enikolopov G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8809-8818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of these long lasting effects of NO is still unclear. To reveal the targets of NO in the cell, it will be important to understand the signaling pathways that are activated in response to NO. To investigate mechanisms underlying the long term action of NO, we used DNA microarrays to determine the temporal expression profiles of genes that respond to NO. We identified genes that are affected by NO and analyzed the temporal patterns of their expression to reveal cascades of NO-dependent gene regulation events. These results were verified by using quantitative real time PCR and validated by demonstrating that similar genes are activated in an NO-dependent manner in response to cytokines. We next used chemical inhibitors of specific signaling molecules and a mutant cell line to determine the signaling pathways that lead to the activation of specific gene targets of NO. Our results show that NO employs a variety of signaling pathways to induce gene expression; these pathways may mediate the long lasting effects of NO during cell division, tissue differentiation, response to pathogens, and disease. Cell Culture and Treatment—NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. The fibroblasts were treated with 250 μm of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; ODQ, 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinolxalin-1-one; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKC, protein kinase C; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; l-NAME, N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride; Q-PCR, quantitative real time PCR; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1.; Calbiochem) or 0.05% Me2SO (Sigma) for 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h. Pharmacological inhibitors, SN50 (6 μm; Calbiochem), 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinolxalin-1-one (ODQ) (50 μm; Calbiochem), wortmannin (500 nm; Calbiochem), and calphostin (500 nm; Calbiochem), which inhibit NF-κB, soluble guanylate cyclase, PI 3-kinase, and PKC, respectively, were added to cell cultures 30 min prior to the addition of the NO donor, SNAP. The mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from the wild type and p53-/- animals were a gift from S. Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). They were propagated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. iNOS Induction—NIH3T3 cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/35-mm dish and grown for 12 h before the addition of cytokines: tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), interferon-γ (200 units/ml; Calbiochem), and interleukin-1β (200 pg/ml; R&D Systems). In some experiments, iNOS activity was inhibited by the presence of 5 mm N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME; Sigma), added 30 min before exposure to the cytokines. RNA Extraction and Probe Generation—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and poly(A)+ RNA was selected with FastTrack 2.0 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. A common reference was generated by combining equal portions of poly(A)+ RNA from all of the untreated control samples obtained with each time point analyzed. The probes were synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) to incorporate amine-modified nucleotides (amino allyl-dUTP; Sigma). cDNA samples were purified and concentrated using Microcon 30 spin columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA), dried, and stored at -20 °C until hybridization. Microarray Hybridization—Gene expression changes were detected by using custom printed slide arrays produced by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Genome Center (intron.cshl.org/msr/). Each slide was comprised of 9,600 features, encompassing both expressed sequence tags (∼47%) and known genes (∼53%) (acquired from the NIA, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; Igsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/cDNA/cDNA.html), along with appropriate controls, such as housekeeping genes and marker genes to monitor by us predicted gene expression profiles. cDNAs of NO-inducible genes identified by us previously were incorporated into the array. For hybridization, the slides were hydrated by exposure to 1× saline sodium citrate for 1.5 min at 30 °C in a humid chamber, snap-dried on a 100 °C heating plate, rinsed in 0.1% SDS for 30 s, rinsed in distilled water for 30 s, boiled in distilled water for 5 min, then rinsed in -20 °C benzene-free ethanol, and spun dry at 2,000 × g for 5 min. cDNA samples were resuspended in buffer (0.3 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0), coupled to monofunctional NHS-Cy5 or Cy3 dye (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 25 °C, purified using Microcon 30 columns, and combined with mouse Cot-1 DNA (20 μg), poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg), and tRNA (2 μg). The microarrays were hybridized using GlassHyb hybridization solution (Clontech Laboratories) and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridizations for the complete time course were performed in triplicate with color reversals for each individual time point, resulting in a total of six replicates/time point. To minimize variability, all of the samples from each experimental treatment were simultaneously hybridized, washed, and scanned. Microarray Image Analysis—The microarray slides were scanned using GenePix scanner and software (version 3.0; Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Fluorescence intensities for all spots were exported to the data analysis software, GeneSpring 4.2 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) and normalized by the “per chip normalization” method. Expression ratio values obtained from the six independent replicates were averaged for each experimental time point and filtered for changes that were statistically significant (p < 0.05, compared with reference by Student's t test for each time point) and either up-regulated or down-regulated 1.3-fold. Expression profiles of the filtered data set were further analyzed for coordinated expression patterns and functional information by using the hierarchical clustering program in the GeneSpring program suite. Functional annotation was performed by searching NCBI Protein Database and SOURCE database (source.stanford.edu). Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Taqman probe kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for selected genes were designed via the Primer Express software (version 1.0; PE Applied Biosystems) and are listed in Table 1 of the supplemental material. Quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) included the following: diluted cDNA sample, 0.5 μmol/liter primers, nucleotides, Taq DNA polymerase, and buffer included in the SYBR Green I Mastermix (PE Applied Biosystems). Using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems), PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Sequence Detector Software (version 1.6.3; PE Applied Biosystems) was used to extract the PCR data, which were then exported to Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for further analysis. Expression of target genes were measured in triplicate and were normalized to β-actin expression levels. Western Blot Analysis—Following exposure to a cytokine mixture, the cells were harvested on ice and resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for 25 min. Following a 30-min spin at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), and all of the samples were normalized by diluting with the lysis buffer. The protein samples were mixed with the sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred from the gel to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry blotting. The membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% dry milk. The membranes were incubated with antibodies to iNOS (1:2000; N32030; Transduction Labs) and β-actin (1:2000; A-5441; Sigma) followed by anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the signal was detected using chemiluminescent substrate for horseradish peroxidase (Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate; Pierce) and Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements of NOS Activity in Cellular Extracts—The cell extracts were prepared from NIH3T3 fibroblasts at 4, 12, 16, 24, and 30 h after the addition of the cytokines, as well as from untreated cells. The extracts were prepared as follows. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and subjected to six rounds of freezing and thawing. After centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, the supernatants were collected and used for the NOS assay as described (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). NOS assay reactions contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 μml-arginine, 1 mm NADPH, 20 μm tetrahydro-l-biopterin, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 2 μl of l-[3H]arginine (2.29 terabecquerel/mmol, 62.0 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) and 50 μl (100-150 μg/ml) of a soluble protein extract in a 150-μl reaction mixture. All of the reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then processed to assess the amount of [3H]arginine converted to [3H]citrulline. The BCA reagent system (Pierce) was used to determine the protein concentration in the extracts, and the results were used to normalize the arginine-citrulline conversion assays. Temporal Patterns of Gene Activation in Response to NO—To identify the gene targets of NO, we determined the temporal gene expression profile of cells exposed to NO by using cDNA microarrays. We used NIH3T3 cells as a test cell line; these are well characterized cells that have served for many years as a standard for biochemical and genetic experiments. To produce NO, we used an NO donor compound SNAP whose chemical and pharmacological properties have been thoroughly described (1Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. 1st ed. Academic Press, San Diego2000Google Scholar, 7Wang P.G. Xian M. Tang X. Wu X. Wen Z. Cai T. Janczuk A.J. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1091-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). An additional consideration for choosing a well characterized fibroblast line and a well studied donor of NO was to establish a “base-line” data base that will assist in future studies describing gene activation by NO and dissecting the signaling pathways in specialized cell types. We added NO donor SNAP (250 μm) to exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells, harvested the cells at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, and isolated the RNA (Fig. 1A). This concentration of SNAP was determined to induce cell cycle arrest; this arrest was followed by renewed cell division ∼40 h after the addition of the chemical (data not shown). Importantly, even higher concentrations of SNAP (>500 μm) did not induce detectable cell death (data not shown). The time points were chosen to identify (a) the very early responses of cells to NO, which reflect activation of immediate gene targets; (b) the intermediate and long term responses that may reflect multiple cascades of gene activation triggered by NO; and (c) the late responses when the levels of NO have decreased enough for the cells to resume division. cDNAs prepared from SNAP-treated samples and the corresponding controls were labeled with either Cy5 or Cy3 and hybridized to microarrays containing ∼10,000 cDNA probes, (further supplemented with NO-induced target genes that we had previously identified in independent experiments (8Nakaya N. Lowe S.W. Taya Y. Chenchik A. Enikolopov G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6369-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2N. Nakaya, J. Hemish, and G. Enikolopov, unpublished data. Each comparison was performed in triplicate with reciprocal labeling (color reversals); thus, each time point is a result of at least six independent measurements. After normalizing and averaging the replicate hybridizations for each time point, the data set was analyzed for genes that were up-regulated and down-regulated more than 1.3-fold in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.05). Approximately 560 genes were selected (gene identities and associated changes in mRNA levels are provided in Table 2 of the supplemental material) and further analyzed by hierarchical clustering to reveal sets of genes that share expression patterns over the examined time points (Fig. 1B). The dendrogram reveals clusters of genes whose expression patterns changed in a similar manner after exposure to NO. A summary of the changes evoked by NO is presented by histograms (Fig. 1C), which show the number of genes activated by NO at each time point. Three distinct waves of gene induction were observed (see Table 2 of the supplemental material for genes included in groups I, II, and III). The first group of genes (group I) is induced very rapidly, as early as 30 min after exposure to the NO donor; these genes may belong to the class of immediate-early genes that do not require protein synthesis for activation. The second group (group II) is induced 4 h following the addition of the NO donor. This group may include genes that require production of new proteins for their activation. Because some of the genes in group I code for transcription factors (e.g. c-fos and egr-1), it is likely that some of the genes in group II correspond to the transcriptional targets of the factors belonging to group I. Finally, a large number of genes (group III) is activated 12 h after the addition of SNAP. These genes may include the targets of group II genes as well as genes whose expression reflects the cell cycle arrest at that time point. Interestingly, not only the number of up-regulated genes but also the magnitude of change in the expression levels was greater for genes in group III compared with genes in groups I and II. Together, these data clearly show that there are distinct temporal cascades of gene activation events induced by NO. A large number of the NO-regulated genes were binned into categories based on functional annotation (as determined by the NCBI Protein Database and SOURCE). These genes are involved in signaling (3% of the analyzed genes), metabolism (7%), cell cycle (3%), stress response (1%), transcription (6%), protein degradation (3%), iron homeostasis (1%), adhesion (2%), as well as transport, apoptosis, and formation of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2A). The remaining genes are present as expressed sequence tags in the collection of the tested genes (54% of the genes analyzed by temporal clustering). Examples of genes assigned to the functional categories are provided in Fig. 1 of the supplemental material. A wide range of functional groups revealed by this classification suggests that NO has a broad impact on cell physiology, affecting genes involved in a variety of biochemical pathways and diverse cellular functions. We next examined the temporal profile of the changes within the functional categories (Fig. 1 of the supplemental material and Fig. 2B). Although in some functional groups the majority of genes changed their expression in a coordinated manner (e.g. stress response genes), genes in other groups showed few signs of coordinated changes (e.g. genes related to cell cycle or iron regulation). Our results show that NO-inducible genes can be grouped into distinct clusters based on similar changes in expression pattern; these clusters may represent targets of the same NO-activated signaling pathways. At the same time, the diversity of the expression patterns indicates that NO activates a complex cascade of signaling events. Verification of the Identified Changes—We sought to confirm the changes in selected candidate transcripts levels identified by the micorarray experiments by using Q-PCR. The same RNA samples used for the microarray experiments were used in Q-PCR to analyze three groups of genes: those induced early (within 30 min) after addition of the NO donor (egr-1, gly96, c-myc, and c-fos), those induced after 2-4 h (heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), thioredoxin reductase, BNIP3, and transferrin receptor), and those induced 8-12 h after the addition of the donor (cyclin G, mdm2, nidogen 1, and p21Cip1) (Fig. 3). These results show a good correlation between the kinetics of changes demonstrated by the two methods. Interestingly, Q-PCR also revealed some subtle features of the response patterns that were not apparent from the microarray analysis. For instance, a number of the immediate-early genes (egr-1, gly96, c-myc, and c-fos) showed a biphasic pattern of expression; a very rapid response (within 30 min after addition of the NO donor) was later accompanied by a second wave of increase in RNA levels. This second increase started 2-4 h after the initial exposure to NO and may represent protein synthesis-dependent changes in the expression of these genes. Validation of the Identified Changes—We have demonstrated that the NO-induced changes identified using microarrays can be confirmed using an alternative approach. We next sought to validate the identified targets of NO by comparing the changes generated by exposure to an external source of NO (SNAP) with the changes induced by NO that is enzymatically produced by NO synthases in the cells in vivo. To this end, we stimulated expression of the iNOS and production of endogenous NO by treating NIH3T3 cells with a mixture of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and interleukin-1β). This mixture is known as a potent inducer of iNOS gene expression in a variety of cells (1Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. 1st ed. Academic Press, San Diego2000Google Scholar, 9Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 10Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3257) Google Scholar). Expression of iNOS protein was clearly seen on the Western blots 12 h after the addition of the cytokines (Fig. 4A), with or without a specific NOS inhibitor l-NAME. Analysis of iNOS RNA using Q-PCR confirmed that there was a strong response to the addition of the cytokine mixture (Fig. 4B). Finally, we confirmed the induction of iNOS by measuring its enzymatic activity, which strongly increased over time from the undetectable levels in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4C). We next examined whether the cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS also induced the expression of genes that we had identified previously. We used Q-PCR to determine the changes invoked by the cytokines on NO-inducible genes identified in the microarray screen. We also evaluated the contribution of NO to cytokine action on gene expression by adding a NOS inhibitor (l-NAME) along with the cytokines. Examples of the changes induced by the cytokines are shown in Fig. 4D. Expression of HO-1 gene was strongly induced by the cytokines and gradually increased from 4 to 30 h after the addition of the cytokines. Expression of mdm2 was also strongly induced by the cytokines and was further augmented after 24 h of treatment. The addition of NOS inhibitor strongly reduced the response for both cases; this was particularly apparent at the later time points. This suggests that the largest component of the response of HO-1 and mdm2 to the cytokines is NO-dependent. However, it also suggests that a small part of the response, particularly at the earlier time points, may be independent of NO production and may reflect gene activation by NO-independent pathways. Fig. 4D also presents examples of genes (BNIP3 and gly96) whose activation by cytokines is less dependent on NO than that of HO-1 and mdm2. In this case a large part of the response cannot be eliminated by the addition of the NOS inhibitor, indicating that for these genes the NO signal mediates only a small part of the response to the cytokines. For all of the genes tested in this series of experiments, incubation with NOS inhibitors alone (in the absence of the cytokines) does not change their expression (data not shown). Importantly, in each case tested, those genes that have been previously identified as inducible by the NO donor were also induced by the addition of the cytokines, and at least part of that response was dependent on NO. These data suggest that endogenously produced NO activates a set of genes similar to that activated by the exogenously added NO and further validates the gene targets of NO we have identified. Signaling Pathways Employed by NO to Activate Gene Expression—We next sought to determine the signaling pathways that mediate the action of NO on gene expression by using pharmacological and genetic approaches. In a pharmacological approach, we exposed the cells to NO in the presence of selective inhibitors of specific signaling pathways: wortmannin, which inhibits PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling; calphostin, which inhibits PKC signaling; SN50, which inhibits NF-κB action; and ODQ, which inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase. Additionally, we used a genetic approach to compare the response to NO in normal cells and in cells lacking the tumor suppressor gene p53 (which has been implicated in the action of NO in several settings) (8Nakaya N. Lowe S.W. Taya Y. Chenchik A. Enikolopov G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6369-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E. Kapust R.B. Spillare E.A. Weinberg W.C.

For this series of experiments, we used Q-PCR on a subset of NO-inducible genes, because we expected that in some cases only a part of the response may be affected by the inhibitors and because this technique is more likely to reveal subtle changes. The data for these experiments (each data point determined by at least three independent measurements) are summarized in Table I.Table IEffect of signaling pathway blockades on NO-stimulated gene expression in NIH3T3 fibroblastsGene nameAccessionUntreatedWortmanninCalphostinUntreatedSN50UntreatedODQWT MEFP53−/− MEFIMAGE 524571A115736012.27 ± 1.485.36 ± 0.31ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.8.24 ± 0.82bp < 0.05 compared with reference using Student's t test.7.59 ± 0.806.30 ± 0.7710.51 ± 1.557.50 ± 1.084.15 ± 0.602.01 ± 0.38ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.mdm2X588768.81 ± 0.603.45 ± 0.52ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.6.82 ± 1.057.70 ± 0.516.13 ± 0.579.14 ± 1.318.35 ± 1.484.57 ± 0.841.12 ± 0.11bp < 0.05 compared with reference using Student's t test.p21/WAF1U0950711.49 ± 1.476.89 ± 0.61ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.7.67 ± 0.66bp < 0.05 compared with reference using Student's t test.5.69 ± 0.525.51 ± 0.598.19 ± 0.6510.76 ± 1.502.45 ± 0.061.23 ± 0.46bp < 0.05 compared with reference using Student's t test.gadd45L281778.11 ± 0.624.69 ± 0.83ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.6.85 ± 0.784.79 ± 0.433.91 ± 0.727.70 ± 0.634.55 ± 0.61ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.1.87 ± 0.161.46 ± 0.03cycGZ371106.15 ± 0.665.44 ± 0.615.53 ± 0.745.51 ± 0.566.76 ± 0.725.73 ± 0.424.80 ± 1.151.74 ± 0.221.14 ± 0.25reprimoAB043586NDNDNDNDND4.92 ± 1.569.06 ± 6.244.20 ± 0.281.43 ± 0.12ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.transferrin receptorX573496.10 ± 0.453.47 ± 0.30ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.3.39 ± 0.24ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.6.91 ± 1.134.62 ± 0.384.49 ± 0.814.52 ± 0.622.66 ± 0.223.81 ± 0.72c-mycX010233.22 ± 0.212.95 ± 0.462.84 ± 0.48NDND3.43 ± 0.382.12 ± 0.25NDNDbaxL224723.05 ± 0.403.30 ± 0.373.58 ± 0.503.64 ± 0.422.05 ± 0.25ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.3.35 ± 0.464.33 ± 0.601.95 ± 0.261.49 ± 0.06ornithine decarboxylaseM106242.21 ± 0.171.95 ± 0.213.21 ± 0.303.19 ± 0.102.58 ± 0.273.14 ± 0.321.50 ± 0.22ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.NDNDmcp3S712514.39 ± 0.902.20 ± 0.30bp < 0.05 compared with reference using Student's t test.2.71 ± 0.561.89 ± 0.211.34 ± 0.133.09 ± 0.382.11 ± 0.67NDNDIMAGE 334547W184093.30 ± 0.532.61 ± 0.273.88 ± 0.54NDND2.97 ± 0.382.17 ± 0.39NDNDpRBM263913.16 ± 0.761.93 ± 0.131.91 ± 0.21NDND2.89 ± 0.702.29 ± 0.361.79 ± 0.201.74 ± 0.73Bcl-XLL350492.66 ± 0.115.12 ± 0.72ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.3.11 ± 0.623.83 ± 0.382.36 ± 0.21ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.2.83 ± 0.542.74 ± 0.432.11 ± 0.762.06 ± 0.80gly96X676443.26 ± 0.435.26 ± 0.64bp < 0.05 compared with reference using Student's t test.5.17 ± 0.962.08 ± 0.121.54 ± 0.07ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.2.76 ± 0.163.06 ± 0.332.31 ± 0.242.14 ± 0.28Protein kinase ζ zeta-interacting proteinNM_0110182.71 ± 0.280.91 ± 0.08ap < 0.01 compared with reference using Student's t test.2.07 ±"

https://openalex.org/W2045512872,"Recent insights into bacterial genome organization and function have improved our understanding of the nature of pathogenic bacteria and their ability to cause disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that the bacterial chromosome constantly undergoes structural changes due to gene acquisition and loss, recombination, and mutational events that have an impact on the pathogenic potential of the bacterium. Even though the bacterial genome includes additional genetic elements, the chromosome represents the most important entity in this context. Here, we will show that various processes of genomic instability have an influence on the many manifestations of infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2009321521,"We report a method for compensating the birefringence of optical polymers by doping them with inorganic birefringent crystals. In this method, an inorganic birefringent material is chosen that has the opposite birefringence to that of the polymer and has rod-shaped crystals that are oriented when the polymer chains are oriented. The birefringence of the polymer is thus compensated by the opposing birefringence of the crystal. Birefringence is minimized in various polymer optical devices by adjusting process conditions, because it degrades the performance of devices. This method minimizes it, independent of process conditions, which potentially improves the productivity of devices."

The periplasmic domain of the histidine autokinase CitA works as a highly specific citrate receptor, whereas DcuS uses any type of C4-dicarboxylate, like fumarate, succinate, and malate, as a stimulus (1Janausch G.

The periplasmic citrate binding domain of CitA is conserved in DcuS and presumably responsible for binding of fumarate and other C4-dicarboxylates. Preliminary results suggest that fumarate sensing occurs by this domain in the periplasm (2Janausch G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. J. Biol.

Despite their prevalence no structural information is available for transmembranous sensory kinases, in particular not for signal perception and transmission across the membrane. Only the structures of cytoplasmic sensory kinases, or of domains not involved in transmembrane signaling, have been determined. Purified DcuS is active after reconstitution in proteoliposomes and capable of transmembranous stimulation of the kinase by fumarate (2Janausch G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. J. Biol.

For a more detailed understanding of signal perception representing the first step of signal transduction in transmembranous histidine kinases of two-component systems, the structure of the periplasmic C4-dicarboxylate binding domain of DcuS (DcuS-pd) was determined after stable over-production of the domain.

Overproduction of His6-DcuS-pd was performed in E. coli BL21DE3(pMW145) grown aerobically in LB broth or supplemented M9 medium containing [13C]glucose (6 mm) and/or [15N]NH4Cl (7 mm) as suitable, after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-α-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The washed cells (1.2 g) were broken by two passages through a French press. The soluble protein fraction was used for isolation of His6-DcuS-pd on a column of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (3 ml bed volume). His6-DcuS-pd was eluted in 6-9 ml of buffer containing 500 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer and 200 mm NaCl at pH 7.0. Sample Preparation for NMR—Isolated His6-DcuS-pd (10-20 mg) was dialyzed (molecular weight 10,000, ZelluTrans, Roth) for 3 h against 100 volumes of buffer containing 5 mm imidazole and 200 mm NaCl in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate at pH 6.5. The sample (6 ml) was then concentrated by centrifugation at max. 5000 × g in a Vivaspin concentrator tube (exclusion limit 10,000, Vivaspin, Sartorius) to a final concentration of 10-25 mg of protein/ml. The sample (300-900 μl, in fractions of 300 μl each) was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. For the NMR measurement the His6 tag was removed by incubation of 300-μl samples with thrombin (20 units/mg DcuS) (Amersham Biosciences) in 700 μl of buffer for 1 h at 20 °C. The digested sample was passed through a Ni2+-NTA column to remove the His6 tag. The eluate (6-9 ml) was concentrated in a Vivaspin concentrator tube as described above. Overall 3-7.5 mg of periplasmic domain of DcuS-pd with a Gly-Ser-His-Met extension at the N-terminal end in front of Ser45 of DcuS was obtained in 300 μl of buffer. When required, for complete exchange of H2O against D2O (99.9%, Deutero GmbH, Kastellaun, Germany), the protein solution was frozen in liquid N2, freeze-dried for 45 min, and resuspended in 1 ml D2O followed by lyophilization as described for 3 cycles. The last suspension was kept for 1 h at 4 °C and freeze-dried. The dry sample was dissolved at a final concentration of 30 mg of protein/ml of D2O, and stored at -80 °C till use. Assignment—The assignment of His-tagged DcuS-pd has been published previously (7Parac T.N. Coligaev B. Zientz E. Unden G. Peti W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); it was put into BRMB (BioMagResBank) under the accession number 4821. The assignment of DcuS-pd without the His tag differs only slightly from the one with the His tag. Restraints—Distance restraints were obtained from the intensities of NOE cross-peaks extracted from 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESYHSQC, two-dimensional NOESY, and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra. Analysis, assignment and integration of NOESY spectra were accomplished with XEASY (8Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). NOEs were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak with an upper distance restraint of 3.0, 3.8, 4.6, and 5.4 Å, respectively. No lower distance limit was applied during initial runs. The lower limit was restrained to 2 Å at a later stage of the calculations. Hydrogen bond restraints were applied in a standard way to slowly exchanging amide protons involved in α-helix and antiparallel β-sheet structures. Restraints for ([phis],ψ) = (-57 ± 20, -47 ± 20) and ([phis],ψ) = (-139 ± 20, 135 ± 20) were applied to the amino acid residues involved in α-helix and antiparallel β-sheet secondary structures, respectively, as determined by NOE patterns and TALOS prediction using 13C chemical shifts (9Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar) for non-regular secundary structure elements. A set of 1DNH, 1DNC′, 1DC′Cα, and 1DCαHα residual dipolar couplings of DcuS were calculated from the difference in the corresponding J splitting measured in protein sample containing 10 mg/ml Pf1 filamentous phage (10Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) 2Asla Laboratories (orion.imm.ki.se/asla/asla-phage.html). and in protein sample in the absence of phage (12Hansen M.R. Rance M. Pardi A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11210-11211Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 1DNH and 1DNC′ residual dipolar couplings were measured simultaneously using a modified interleaved three-dimensional TROSY-HNCO experiment (13Chou J.J. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and 1DCαHα and 1DC′Cα residual dipolar couplings using a modified interleaved three-dimensional CBCACONH experiment (14Chou J.J. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3844-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The data sets were processed and analyzed using the NMRPipe/NMRDraw (15Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11443) Google Scholar) software package. The magnitude of the alignment tensor (Da) obtained from the histogram of measured dipolar couplings is 10.7 Hz for 1DNH and the corresponding rhombicity (R) is 0.63. Dipolar couplings were applied in the structure calculation with different weight factors 1.0 (1DNH), 0.4 (1DCαHα), 44 (1DNC′), and 2.5 (1DC′Cα). Structure Calculation and Analysis—Structures were calculated using the Xplor-NIH program package (16Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). A standard four-stage molecular dynamics protocol was used with an initial high temperature annealing stage (1000 step/15-ps torsion angle molecular dynamics at T = 50,000), followed by a first (1000 step/15-ps cooling to 0) and a second (3000 step/15-ps Cartesian molecular dynamics cooling from T = 2000 to 0) slow-cool annealing stage and a final minimization stage. The final structures were analyzed by the programs MOLMOL (17Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) and ProCheck (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Effect of Mutations in the Putative Fumarate Binding Site of DcuS on the Fumarate Plus DcuR-dependent Expression of dcuB′-′lacZ—The activity of the DcuS/DcuR two-component system was measured by the dcuB′-′lacZ reporter gene fusion. Expression of dcuB depends strongly on the presence of active DcuS/DcuR two-component system. Expression was measured after growth of the bacteria under anaerobic conditions (A 578 nm = 0.5) with 50 mm fumarate as the substrates to achieve optimal induction of dcuB. All strains contain a chromosomal dcuB′-′lacZ reporter gene fusion. E. coli IMW260 is a derivative of E. coli K-12 with a chromosomal dcuS mutation (MC4100, but dcuS::camR dcuB′-′lacZ). The other strains were the same as IMW260, but contained various mutant forms of dcuS cloned in plasmid pET28a. Secondary Structure of DcuS-pd—The secondary structure of DcuS-pd (Fig. 1) consists of a long N-terminal α-helix (α1) ranging from amino acid 46 to 64 with a continuation from 68 to 72 (α2). After a short loop there is another α-helix (α3a: 77-79) and (α3b: 83-92) that is connected to the first β-strand (β1: 97-102) of the four stranded antiparallel β-sheet. β1 is connected via an α-helix (α4: 126-128) and a long loop to the second β-strand (β2: 134-138), which is connected by a short loop to the third strand (β3: 145-153). Yet, another turn connects to the fourth β-strand (β4: 159-167). From this strand the C-terminal helix follows after a short helix (α5: 174-179). The secondary structural elements have been established by secondary chemical shifts as well as characteristic sequential NOEs and the connectivity of the four stranded antiparallel β-sheet by HN,Hα and Hα,Hα cross-strand NOEs (Fig. 1). The secondary structure of DcuS including the transmembrane helices most probably is as follows: transmembrane helix 1 (21-42) to form a contiguous helix from 21 to 64. By the same token, it is expected that the C-terminal helix (α5) extends into the membrane uninterruptedly via transmembrane helix 2 forming a helix from 174 to 202. Structure Determination—The total number of non-ambiguos NOEs is 2245 (16.5 per residue) with 1074 (8 per residue) being inter-residual. We measured 382 dipolar couplings including 107 NH, 95 HαCα, 114 NC′, and 66 CαC′. 46 hydrogen bonds have been included as described above. 187 [phis] and ψ angles were derived from the carbon chemical shifts using Talos. 1J(Cα,Hα) couplings were used to define the [phis] angle: negative for 1J(Cα,Hα) > 137 Hz and in the α-helix (19Vuister G.W. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 9674-9675Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) range for 1J(Cα,Hα)> 145 Hz. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of NOEs and the resulting backbone r.m.s.d. as a function of sequence position. The backbone r.m.s.d. clearly anticorrelates with the number of NOE restraints per amino acid identifying several loops with reduced restraint density. Out of the 200 structures we took 10 structures that had the lowest energies and displayed them using the program MOLMOL (17Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6477) Google Scholar). They had converged with an r.m.s.d. to the average structure of 0.68 Å in the backbone of the structured regions. The structure is well ordered in the region 46-168, while the first residues at the N terminus and the C-terminal residues (169-178) are not well ordered. Especially the C-terminal helix does not show long range NOEs. Fig. 3 shows a stereo view of the mean structure derived from the 10 structures with the lowest energy, fitted for minimal r.m.s.d. (backbone rmsd 0.582, heavy r.m.s.d. 1.035) of the region with secondary structure elements (residues 55-88, 94-105, 123-136, 144-154, and 158-167). These structures were submitted to the Protein Data Bank as PDB ID 1ojg. The 1N,15N NOEs (Fig. 2) do not vary strongly over the structure of DcuS, except for the C-terminal helix. Discussion of the Structure—The structure is a novel α,β-fold completely dissimilar of the four helix bundle structure of the aspartate sensor (20Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Pandit J. Koshland D.E. Kim S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9787-9792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the structure is a monomer in solution dissimilar to the aspartate sensor. From relaxation data the dimer content can be estimated to be below 10%, which is in agreement with gel shift data. In a DALI (22Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) search the closest match (score = 5) is photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospirahalophila (11Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), which also shows an α,β-fold, however, with 5 instead of 4 β-strands (Fig. 1). The topology of strands β3, β4, and β5 of PYP is similar to the strands β2, β3, and β4 of DcuS. However, the rest of the secondary structure is quite dissimilar. While in PYP the PAS core domain connects the strands β2 and β3 by crossing the whole β-sheet in a diagonal manner there is no PAS core domain in DcuS and the connection between sheets β1 and β2 is achieved on one side of the β-sheet. Similar to PYP, there are two hydrophobic cores on both sides of the β-sheet formed. Helices α1 and α3b bind to the bottom side of the β-sheet, while helix α4 and the connector attach to the upper half of the β-sheet. In PYP the chromophore binding site is formed by the PAS core domain. Dissimilar to PYP, in DcuS residues located in the β-sheet (Arg147) as well as in the connector (Arg107 and His110) across the β-sheet contribute to the putative binding site of fumarate. Relevance of the Structure—The periplasmic domain used in this study is folded and the residues Arg107, His110, and Arg147 found from mutation to be essential for fumarate binding are in close proximity in the structure, suggesting that the binding motif is retained in the periplasmic domain. Conservation of His and Arg residues in DcuS-pd, which have been assigned in citrate binding in CitA by mutagenesis (Table I), suggest that the same residues are important for fumarate binding in DcuS-pd. After mutagenesis of Arg107, His110, or Arg147 functional data were obtained by measuring the activity of the DcuS/DcuR two-component system via a dcuB′-′lacZ reporter gene fusion (Table I), the expression of which depends on the presence of active DcuS/DcuR two-component system (2Janausch G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39809-39814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Replacement of the Arg residues 107 and 147 and of the His residue 110 by Ala by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the stimulation by fumarate to the same extent as complete deletion of the dcuS gene (Table I), although the mutated protein was formed at normal levels.Table IInactivation of DcuS in vivo by mutation of DcuS-pdStrain (genotype)β-GalactosidaseWild-type/mutant activityMiller unitsIMW260 (dcuS −)70.033IMW260 p(dcuS +)2091IMW260 p(dcuS-R107A)60.029IMW260 p(dcuS-H110A)50.024IMW260 p(dcuS-R147A)110.053 Open table in a new tab"

In this study, we investigated the effects of the actin cytoskeletal architecture on NO-induced dedifferentiation, apoptosis, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression, and prostaglandin E2 production in articular chondrocytes, with a focus on ERK-1/-2, p38 kinase, and PKC signaling. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D (CD) inhibited NO-induced apoptosis, dedifferentiation, COX-2 expression, and prostaglandin E2 production in chondrocytes cultured on plastic or during cartilage explants culture. CD treatment did not affect ERK-1/-2 activation but blocked the signaling events necessary for NO-induced dedifferentiation, apoptosis, and COX-2 expression such as activation of p38 kinase and inhibition of PKCα and -ζ. CD also suppressed activation of downstream signaling of p38 kinase and PKC, such as NF-κB activation, p53 accumulation, and caspase-3 activation, which are necessary for NO-induced apoptosis. NO production in articular chondrocytes caused down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt activities. The down-regulation of PI 3-kinase and Akt was blocked by CD treatment, and the CD effects on apoptosis, p38 kinase, and PKCα and -ζ were abolished by the inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY294002.

For example, NO-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) promotes dedifferentiation, COX-2 expression, and inhibition of apoptosis, whereas NO-induced p38 kinase activation triggers apoptosis, COX-2 expression, and maintains differentiated phenotypes (12Kim S.-J.

PKCα activity is inhibited due to blockage of expression independent of MAP kinase signaling, whereas PKCζ activity is suppressed as a result of p38 kinase activation that follows proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3. Inhibition of PKCα and -ζ is necessary for NO-induced dedifferentiation and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation (15Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB has dual functions, specifically induction of COX-2 expression and subsequent PGE2 production, and apoptosis by stimulating p53 transcription. A previous study by our group (14Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.-Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

The actin cytoskeletal architecture is believed to be an important modulator of chondrocyte phenotype. Dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by retinoic acid or serial monolayer culture is accompanied by significant changes in actin cytoskeletal architecture. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by dihydrocytochalasin B promotes redifferentiation of chondrocytes (16Benya P.D. Brown P.D. Padilla S.R. J.

However, to date, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of chondrocyte phenotype by actin cytoskeletal architecture has yet to be fully elucidated. In addition to regulating chondrocyte phenotype, the actin cytoskeleton modulates apoptosis either positively or negatively in a variety of cell types, depending on the experimental system (24Huot J.

Commun. 2002; 290: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether actin cytoskeleton also regulates apoptosis of articular chondrocytes. In view of the evident significance of the actin cytoskeletal architecture in the physiology of chondrocytes and cartilage, we initially investigated its role in NO-induced dedifferentiation, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in primary culture rabbit articular chondrocytes. We additionally characterized the molecular mechanism of regulation of chondrocyte function by the actin cytoskeleton, focusing on the roles of MAP kinase and PKC. Here we report that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by CD results in the inhibition of NO-induced dedifferentiation, apoptosis, COX-2 expression, and PGE2 production in articular chondrocytes via modulation of MAP kinase activation and inhibition of PKCα and -ζ signaling. Culture of Articular Chondrocytes—Articular chondrocytes were isolated from knee joint cartilage slices of 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits by enzymatic digestion with collagenase type II in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (9Yoon Y.-M.

Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin by plating on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 with medium replacement every 2 days. At 3.5 days in culture, cells were treated with the specified pharmacological reagents for 1 h prior to SNP treatment, including CD to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton, jasplakinolide to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton, PD98059 (Calbiochem) to inhibit MEK-1/-2 (34Alessi D.R.

Where indicated, chondrocytes at day 3 in culture were infected with either control adenovirus or adenovirus coding for wild-type rabbit PKCα or mouse PKCζ inserted into a cosmid cassette. Infected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h and treated with 1 mm SNP for an additional 24 h. Cartilage Explants Culture—Cartilage slices (∼125 mm3) were obtained from rabbit knee joints and maintained in DMEM in the absence or presence of various pharmacological reagents specified in individual experiments. Cartilage explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, dehydrated with graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4-μm slices. Sections were stained with Alcian blue to detect accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan using standard procedures as described previously (38Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were determined using the method described below. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine F-actin organization in primary culture articular chondrocytes or cartilage explants, which were either left untreated or treated with various pharmacological reagents. Briefly, primary culture chondrocytes were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% fetal calf serum for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, re-washed, and then observed under a standard fluorescence microscope (38Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H.

Determination of Cell Death—NO induces apoptosis in chondrocytes, as demonstrated previously by DNA fragmentation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays (12Kim S.-J.

Apoptotic cell death in cartilage explants was determined by the TUNEL method using an assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Apoptotic cells were additionally quantified using ∼1 × 104 cells on a FACSort flow cytometer with the Cellquest analysis program (BD Biosciences), as described previously (12Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Assay of Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activation in SNP-treated chondrocytes was determined by measuring the absorbance of a cleaved synthetic substrate of caspase-3, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chromophore p-nitroaniline (12Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondrocytes were lysed on ice for 10 min in cell lysis buffer provided in the Clontech A ApoAlert™ CPP32 colorimetric assay kit. Lysates were reacted with 50 μm Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chromophore p-nitroaniline in reaction buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 20% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (pH 7.4)). Mixtures were maintained at 37 °C for 1 h in a water bath and subsequently analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Enzyme activity was calculated from a standard curve prepared using p-nitroaniline. The relative levels of p-nitroaniline were normalized against the protein concentration of each extract. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—NF-κB activation was examined indirectly by analyzing the degradation of inhibitor protein κB (I-κB) by using Western blot analysis and directly with a reporter gene assay. For a reporter gene assay, chondrocytes were transfected with a plasmid containing luciferase and three tandem repeats of serum-response element or a control vector, using LipofectAMINE PLUS (12Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h, either left untreated or treated with various pharmacological reagents, and used to determine luciferase activity with an assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—To determine the activities of PKCα, PKCζ and p38 kinase, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were precipitated with polyclonal antibody against p38 kinase, PKCζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or PKCα (Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads, and the kinase reaction was performed in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of substrate (activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2)) for p38 kinase or myelin basic protein for PKCα and -ζ. Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography (13Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

PGE 2 Assay—PGE2 production in articular chondrocytes was determined by measuring the levels of cellular and secreted PGE2 with an assay kit purchased from Amersham Biosciences, as reported previously (39Huh Y.-H. Kim S.-H. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9691-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondrocytes were seeded in standard 96-well microtiter plates and treated with various pharmacological reagents. Total cell lysates were used to quantify the amount of PGE2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. PGE2 levels were calculated against a standard curve. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors, as described above. Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected using the following antibodies: anti-type II collagen from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), polyclonal anti-p53 and phosphorylation-specific antibody for ERK from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), monoclonal PKCα, PKCζ, and ERK-1/-2 from Transduction Laboratories, and polyclonal p38 kinase from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with an ECL system. Disruption of the Actin Cytoskeleton Inhibits NO-induced Apoptosis of Articular Chondrocytes—We have shown previously that direct production of NO by SNP in primary culture articular chondrocytes results in apoptosis and dedifferentiation (12Kim S.-J.

Prior to determining the role of the actin cytoskeleton in NO-induced apoptosis, we examined the organization of actin filaments in articular chondrocytes. The actin cytoskeleton in primary culture chondrocytes at passage 0 comprised a stress fiber-like structure or thick struts of actin fiber extended across the length of the chondrocytes (Fig. 1A). NO induced a typical peripheral distribution of actin filaments that is consistent with their mechanical supporting function for shrinking apoptotic cells. Treatment with CD led to the collapse of the filamentous actin structure to amorphous clots of depolymerized protein and a more round shape of cells (Fig. 1A). The effects of actin cytoskeleton disruption on NO-induced apoptosis were determined by staining cell nuclei with propidium iodide and TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, NO induced apoptotic cell death, and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by CD significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that CD inhibits NO-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The role of the actin cytoskeleton in NO-induced apoptosis was further investigated using jasplakinolide, which is a potent inducer of actin polymerization and selectively locks actin in a polymeric state. Treatment with jasplakinolide led to the formation of relatively fine stress fiber and large aggregations of actin filaments (Fig. 2A). Jasplakinolide also increased the number of cells that show NO-induced peripheral distribution of actin filaments (Fig. 2A). Indeed, jasplakinolide dramatically enhanced NO-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the above results clearly indicate that disruption of actin filaments reduces NO-induced apoptosis, whereas stabilization of actin cytoskeleton enhances apoptotic cell death.Fig. 2Stabilization of actin filaments with jasplakinolide potentiates NO-induced apoptosis. A, articular chondrocytes were treated for 24 h with Me2SO as a control, 50 nm jasplakinolide, 1 mm SNP without (SNP) or with 50 nm jasplakinolide. Cells were stained for F-actin with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. B, articular chondrocytes were left untreated (Control) or treated with the indicated concentrations of jasplakinolide and 1 mm SNP for 24 h. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Data are presented as results of a typical experiment (A) and as mean values with standard deviation (B) (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the next series of experiments, we investigated the molecular mechanism of apoptosis regulation by the actin cytoskeleton. Because NO induces chondrocyte apoptosis via NF-κB-dependent accumulation of p53 that in turn leads to caspase-3 activation (12Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J.

Commun. 2003; 303: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the effects of actin cytoskeleton disruption on the activation of caspase-3 and NF-κB and on the accumulation of p53 were determined. CD treatment blocked NO-induced activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3A) and NF-κB (as demonstrated by a NF-κB reporter gene assay and inhibition of I-κB degradation (Fig. 3, B and C)) and accumulation of pro-apoptotic p53 protein (Fig. 3C) in a dose-dependent manner. Because treatment with SN-50 (a NF-κB inhibitor) and benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD peptide (a caspase-3 inhibitor) blocked NO-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D), the above results indicate that inhibition of these activities by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton is responsible for the suppression of cell death. We previously (13Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrated that protein levels and activities of PKCα and -ζ, signaling molecules upstream of NF-κB activation and p53 accumulation, decrease upon NO production. Moreover, these events are necessary for apoptosis and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. We additionally showed that PKCζ activity is inhibited as a result of p38 kinase activation, whereas suppression of PKCα activity is independent of MAP kinase signaling (12Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D.

Accordingly, we examined whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton blocks NO-induced apoptosis via the modulation of MAP kinase and PKCα and -ζ signaling. As depicted in Fig. 4A, expression and activity of PKCα and -ζ decreased in SNP-treated chondrocytes. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton abolished the observed decrease in PKCα and -ζ expression and activity. In addition, ectopic expression of PKCα or -ζ by adenovirus infection suppressed NO-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B), indicating that the inhibitory effects of CD on NO-induced apoptosis are a result of blockage of inhibition of PKCα and -ζ activity. As expected, SNP treatment in articular chondrocytes also activated ERK-1/-2 and p38 kinase, as determined by Western blotting and kinase assays, respectively (Fig. 4C). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton did not significantly affect NO-induced ERK-1/-2 activation (Fig. 4C, upper panel), but activation of p38 kinase by NO was completely blocked (Fig. 4C, lower panel).

However, it remains elusive whether the machinery of mitochondrial calcium signaling displays plasticity similar to the synaptic transmission. Here we studied the relationship between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-linked cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) oscillations and the associated rise in mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m) in RBL-2H3 mast cells. We observed that the second [Ca2+]c spike is often associated with a larger rise in the [Ca2+]m than the first. It would appear that this phenomenon was not due to a change in the driving force for Ca2+ uptake and therefore must be due to an enhanced Ca2+ permeability of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites (uniporter). To investigate the activation and deactivation kinetics of the uniporter during IP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, we established novel methods. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that the IP3-induced increase in the permeability of the uniporter lasted longer than the Ca2+ signal. The sustained increase in Ca2+ permeability was bidirectional. Furthermore, the addition of Ca2+ during the decay of the IP3 effect evoked a large further increase in the uniporter permeability. Calmodulin inhibitors did not interfere with the IP3-induced initial activation of the uniporter but inhibited the sustained phase. These results suggest that the uniporter displays a calmodulin-mediated facilitation. This plasticity may allow cooperation among sequential IP3 receptor-mediated [Ca2+] transients in the control of calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria.

Since the mid-1990s, several lines of investigation have challenged the classic view that the only physiological role of mitochondria is in energy production. Mitochondria have been emerging as key players in cellular signaling. In particular, the role of mitochondria has been established in the release of apoptotic factors to the cytosol (reviewed in Refs. 1Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), and more Ca2+ puff sites were visualized in close association with the mitochondria than expected if Ca2+ release sites were randomly distributed (22Marchant J.S. Ramos V. Parker I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1374-C1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Evidence has also been presented that the localized and short lasting Ca2+ release during fundamental Ca2+ release events (calcium sparks) results in depolarization (23Duchen M.R. Leyssens A. Crompton M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and a [Ca2+]m rise (referred to as calcium marks) in a neighboring mitochondrion (24Pacher P. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2380-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that synchronized activation of the reticular Ca2+ release sites evokes an almost maximal activation of the entire population of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we proposed that the reticular Ca2+ release sites and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites are concentrated at the ER/sarcoplasmic reticulum mitochondrial interface, providing the molecules for a “fast track” of calcium signal delivery between the two organelles (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 26Csordas G. Hajnóczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that the local communication exhibits plasticity that may add a new dimension to decoding of the local Ca2+ signals by the mitochondria. Dynamic reorganization of the ER/sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial morphology (27Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Smith A.J. Oliver J.M. Oberdorf J.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) provides a means for rearrangement of the close associations between ER and mitochondria. In addition, the IP3Rs (28Bezprozvanny I.

Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has also proposed a relatively slow, allosteric activation of the mitochondrial uniporter by Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 34Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along this line, up-regulation of the mitochondrial response to [Ca2+]c oscillations has been observed in hepatocytes (35Pralong W.F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in H9c2 myoblasts (36Szalai G. Csordas G. Hantash B.M. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, in insulin-secreting cells, desensitization of the [Ca2+]m signal was shown during repetitive stimulation with the mitochondrial substrate, methyl succinate (37Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20770-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in HeLa cells, desensitization of the [Ca2+]m signal was documented during IP3-linked [Ca2+]c oscillations (38Collins T.J. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26411-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although the results with isolated mitochondria and various cells seem to be in conflict with each other, these studies raise the possibility that the uniporter-mediated Ca2+ transport may exhibit a memory function during IP3R or ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release. However, despite the exciting implications, it has not yet been possible to monitor the uniporter Ca2+ permeability in cells. Here we use novel fluorescent methods to determine the time course of the uniporter Ca2+ permeability during IP3-induced ER Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in RBL-2H3 mast cells. We demonstrate delayed deactivation of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites and sensitization to Ca2+ during repetitive stimulation. Our studies provide evidence that a memory switch of the uniporter is triggered by exposure of the uniporter to high local Ca2+ and that the Ca2+ rise is sensed by a calmodulin/calmodulin-like element associated with the uniporter. Based on these data, we propose that the uniporter exhibits a memory function, providing a means to optimize the mitochondrial Ca2+ signal and increase in metabolism elicited by IP3 and ryanodine receptor-dependent [Ca2+]c signals. Materials—IP3 and thapsigargin were from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA); ionomycin, W7, calmidazolium, human brain calmodulin, and calmodulin (CaM) kinase II-like inhibitory peptide (CaM kinase II 290-309) were from Calbiochem; E6-berbamine was from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); Chelex 100 was from Bio-Rad. Fura2FF, fluo3, and rhod2 were from Teflabs (Austin, TX); Calcium Green-C18, rhod5F, JC1, and pluronic acid (Pluronic F-127) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher or Sigma. Imaging Experiments—RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cells were cultured and plated for experiments as previously described (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). For imaging of [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m in intact cells, the cells were first loaded with fura2FF/AM (5 μm) or rhod2/AM (3 μm) for 50-60 min at 37 °C in extracellular medium composed of 121 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.003% pluronic acid. Subsequently, fura2FF/AM or rhod2/AM was washed out, and the cells were loaded with fluo3/AM (5 μm) for 40-50 min at room temperature in extracellular medium supplemented with pluronic acid and sulfinpyrazone (200 μm). After dye loading, the cells were rinsed with extracellular medium, and the coverslip was mounted to a heated (35 °C) open incubator chamber in 1 ml of extracellular medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin and sulfinpyrazone. Fluorescence imaging of [Ca2+]m (fura2FF) and [Ca2+]c (fluo3) was carried out using a beam splitter (510 nm)/emission filter (520-nm long pass) combination optimized for simultaneous recording of fura and fluo type fluorophores (Chroma Technology Co., Brattleboro, VT) and a high quantum efficiency cooled CCD camera as described earlier (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Fura2FF was excited at 340/380 nm ([Ca2+]m), and fluo3 ([Ca2+]c) was excited at 485 nm. The imaged area was 126 × 126 μm (70 × 70 pixels), and image triplets (or pairs) were obtained in every 2.2-3 s. Confocal imaging of [Ca2+]m (rhod2) simultaneously with [Ca2+]c (fluo3) was carried out using a Bio-Rad MRC1024/2P system with a krypton/argon ion laser source fitted to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (24Pacher P. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2380-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 488- and 568-nm excitation were used to follow fluo3 ([Ca2+]c) and rhod2 ([Ca2+]m) fluorescence, respectively. Using both distinct excitation wavelengths and separate emission filters for fluo3 and rhod2 (HQ525/50 and HQ590/50 nm, respectively), no significant cross-talk was noticed between the rhod2 and fluo3 signals. For imaging of Mn2+ quench simultaneously with [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m after fura2FF loading, cells were rinsed with Ca2+-free extracellular buffer containing 100 μm EGTA. Permeabilization was carried out in 1 ml of intracellular medium (ICM) (120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-HEPES, 2 mm MgATP, and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin at pH 7.2) supplemented with digitonin (15-20 μg/ml), 20 μm EGTA/Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.75 μm CaGreen-C18 in the incubation chamber for 5 min (35 °C). Subsequently, cells were put to fresh ICM supplemented with succinate (2 mm). Fluorescence imaging of [Ca2+]m and [Ca2+]c and Mn+ quenching of fura2FF were carried out using a multiwavelength beam splitter/emission filter combination and a high quantum efficiency cooled CCD camera as described earlier (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The imaged area was 126 × 126 μm (70 × 70 pixels), and image quadriplets were obtained in every 3 s. Fura2FF was excited at 340/380 nm ([Ca2+]m) and 355 nm (Mn2+ quench), and CaGreen-C18 ([Ca2+]c) was excited at 485 nm. Image analysis was performed using custom-made software. Fluorescence (averaged from pixels covering whole cell areas) (Figs. 1A and 3B) was determined separately for each individual cell (∼35-50 cells/field) on the field after subtraction of the background fluorescence measured at cell-free areas. In confocal images, pixels covering individual or small groups of mitochondria were averaged (Fig. 1B).Fig. 3Sustained elevation of the uniporter Mn2 + permeability during IP3-induced Ca2+ release. A, IP3-induced [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m responses (left, upper panels) and Mn2+ quench of mitochondrial fura2FF (left, lower panels) in suspensions of permeabilized cells. First derivative of the [Ca2+]c increase is also shown to illustrate the time course of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release recorded in the presence of uncoupler and Tg (right, upper panel; single exponential fit, black line). The release rate peaks in <1 s and decays in ∼3 s. To induce Mn2+ quench, MnCl2 (50 μm) was added either at the time of the IP3 addition (0 s) or 10 or 90 s after IP3 stimulation (dashed lines in the upper panels). For reference, the time control (No IP 3) is also shown (hairline) in the panels showing the 10- and 90-s traces. Similar [Ca2+]c, [Ca2+]m and Mn2+-quench measurements were also carried out by the addition of Ca2+ (CaCl2 10 μm → 10 μm CaCl2) instead of IP3. The increases in [Ca2+]c and in the Mn2+ quench rate at the time of IP3 stimulation or Ca2+ addition are compared in the bar chart (right, lower panel). Data are normalized to the peak [Ca2+]c increase evoked by IP3 or the increase in the Mn2+ quench rate evoked by IP3 (-10 s). B, imaging of IP3-induced sustained stimulation of the Mn2+ quench in individual adherent permeabilized cells. The gray images show the fura2FF fluorescence recorded at an excitation of 357 nm in permeabilized single cells. The cells were stimulated with a suboptimal dose of IP3 (loIP 3, 150 nm; upper), or instead a small Ca2+ pulse was applied (1Ca → CaCl2 1 μm; bottom) to mimic the still slightly increased [Ca2+]c following the IP3 stimulation at the time of the Mn2+ addition. The red overlays show the fluorescence decrease at each time point (calculated for 4.4-s intervals) and thus represent the Mn2+-induced quench. The Mn2+ quench rates in the two conditions and in the absolute control (Mn2+ added to naive cells) are compared in the bar charts (means ± S.E.; n = 5-8; right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorometric Measurements of [Ca2 + ] c , [Ca2 + ] m , Mn2 + Quench and Δψm in Suspensions of Permeabilized Cells—RBL-2H3 cells were loaded with fura2FF for measurements of [Ca2+]m, permeabilized with digitonin using a protocol that preserves the functional integrity of the calcium coupling between ER and mitochondria, and incubated as described earlier (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 39Csordas G. Madesh M. Antonsson B. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, fura2FF-loaded cells (5.5 × 106 cells/ml) were permeabilized in ICM supplemented with 25-35 μg/ml digitonin (50% (w/w); Sigma) for 5 min at 35 °C, followed by washout of the released cytosolic fura2FF (125 × g for 4 min). Cell permeabilization was evaluated by Trypan blue exclusion, and after a 5-min incubation, >95% of the cells were Trypan-positive. Compartmentalized fura2FF has been shown to occur in the mitochondria of RBL-2H3 cells (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were resuspended in ICM supplemented with 2 mm succinate and 0.25 μm rhod2/FA or rhod5F/FA (Fig. 4) and maintained in a stirred thermostated cuvette at 35 °C. Rhod2/FA or rhod5F/FA was added to monitor [Ca2+] in the intracellular medium that exchanges readily with the cytosolic space. Fluorescence was monitored in a multiwavelength excitation dual wavelength emission fluorimeter using 340- and 380-nm excitation and 500-nm emission for fura2FF and 540-nm excitation and 580-nm emission for rhod2. In every experiment, five data triplets were obtained per second. In the Mn2+ quench experiments, excitation of fura2FF was also carried out at 357 nm (5 data points/s), where the fura2FF-fluorescence was insensitive to Ca2+ changes. At the end of each Mn2+ quench measurement, a high concentration of Mn2+ (500 μm MnCl2) was added in the presence of ionomycin to quench compartmentalized fura2FF completely. Before normalization to the initial fluorescence, the residual signal, autofluorescence of the cells was subtracted from the fluorescence signal. Calibration of the Ca2+ signals was carried out at the end of the measurements as described previously (26Csordas G. Hajnóczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although calibration of fura2FF and rhod2 fluorescence in terms of concentration (nm) of Ca2+ was not feasible in the presence of Mn2+, the IP3-induced changes in Rfura2FF and Frhod2 were highly reproducible in every experiment and were translated to a [Ca2+]m increase of 3.79 ± 0.36 μm and a [Ca2+]c increase of 898 ± 35 nm, respectively (n = 4-6) (26Csordas G. Hajnóczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric measurements of Δψm were carried out as described previously (39Csordas G. Madesh M. Antonsson B. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out with 3-6 different cell preparations, and the data are shown as mean ± S.E. Significance of differences from the relevant controls was calculated by Student's t test. Improvement of the ER-mitochondrial Ca2 + Signal Transmission during [Ca2 + ] c Oscillations—First, [Ca2+]m responses associated with IP3R-mediated [Ca2+]c oscillations were studied in intact individual RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated by the adenosine receptor (A3) agonist, 5′-(N-ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine (10 μm) (16Hajnóczky G. Csordas G. Madesh M. Pacher P. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 40Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence imaging of [Ca2+]m with fura2FF compartmentalized to the mitochondria was carried out simultaneously with fluo3 imaging of [Ca2+]c (Fig. 1A). Using a range of morphological, functional, and pharmacological assays, it has been shown previously that fura2FF is compartmentalized into the mitochondria and can be used to measure [Ca2+]m in RBL-2H3 cells (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 26Csordas G. Hajnóczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]c responses recorded from individual whole cells showed oscillations that consisted of relatively uniform [Ca2+]c spikes in every cell (shown in green). By contrast, only a small [Ca2+]m response was associated with the first [Ca2+]c spike, and the second [Ca2+]c spike gave rise to a substantially larger [Ca2+]m increase in some cells (upper two graphs, shown in red). In the RBL-2H3 cells, the mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux pathways display low activity (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), allowing sequential [Ca2+]c transients to bring about a stepwise increase in the [Ca2+]m signal. During [Ca2+]c oscillations, the increase in step size was also observed when the fura2FF ratio was calibrated and expressed as μm (not shown). Thus, in the cells that display a relatively small [Ca2+]m response in association with the first [Ca2+]c spike, the efficacy of ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ signal transmission could have improved from the first to the second [Ca2+]c spike. Alternatively, a part of the mitochondrial population of the cells might have remained “silent” during the first spikes and become activated only by the second spikes. To address this point, we evaluated the subcellular distribution of [Ca2+]m responses associated with IP3R-mediated [Ca2+]c oscillations by confocal imaging of [Ca2+]c (fluo3) and [Ca2+]m (rhod2 compartmentalized into the mitochondria). Fig. 1B shows a cell displaying two consecutive [Ca2+]c spikes associated with a small first and a substantially larger second step in [Ca2+]m (cell at the left, mitochondrial areas 1-3) and a cell displaying relatively large [Ca2+]m response to the first [Ca2+]c spike (cell at the right, mitochondrial areas 4-6). Inspection of the [Ca2+]m responses exhibited by subsets of mitochondria confirmed that individual mitochondria also display enhancement of sequential [Ca2+]m responses during repetitive [Ca2+]c spikes (Fig. 1B, upper right). Furthermore, subgroups of mitochondria showed an essentially homogenous increase of [Ca2+]m in each cell (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results support the idea that the Ca2+ signal transmission between the ER and mitochondria may be optimized during repetitive IP3R-linked [Ca2+] spikes. Summary of the single cell data also indicates that improvement of the Ca2+ signal transmission to the mitochondria is most significant in cells that display a small second [Ca2+]c spike as compared with the first [Ca2+]c spike (Fig. 1A, lower panel). In other words, during the second [Ca2+]c spike, less Ca2+ release was sufficient to increase [Ca2+]m. However, an increased [Ca2+]m response during the second [Ca2+]c spike was not present in every cell (e.g. cell at the bottom in Fig. 1A). Interestingly, correlation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release directly with the activity of the uniporter indicated that sensitization occurred in most of the cells (Fig. 3B; see below). Several mechanisms may explain how sensitization of the activity of the uniporter does not appear as a progressive increase in the size of the [Ca2+]m spikes in every cell. For example, a rapid increase in the mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ buffer species could attenuate the [Ca2+]m elevation during the second [Ca2+]c spike (41David G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7495-7506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chalmers S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19062-19070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The following experiments were designed to test how the permeability of the mitochondrial uniporter changes during IP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Probing the Uniporter Ca2 + Permeability by Mn2 + Quench of Fura2FF Compartmentalized into the Mitochondria—We have used compartmentalized fura2FF to visualize the [Ca2+]m rise evoked by IP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells (25Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Based on the following considerations, Mn2+ quench of compartmentalized fura2FF can also be used to monitor the Ca2+ permeability of the uniporter: 1) similar to fura2, fura2FF is insensitive to the changes in [Ca2+] when excited at 360 nm (isosbestic point); 2) Mn2+ quenches fura2FF fluorescence, and the Mn2+ quench is relatively insensitive to changes in [Ca2+] when fura2FF is excited at the isosbestic point (Fig. 2A, bottom); 3) fura2FF is 20-fold less sensitive to Ca2+ than fura2 (K d = 4-5 μm versus 224 nm) (Fig. 2A, top), but only 2-fold higher [Mn2+] is required to quench fura2FF than fura2 (Fig. 2A, middle); 4) Mn2+ is transported through the mitochondrial uniporter (43Vinogradov A. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5527-5531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 34Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J.

Thus, Mn2+ added to fura2FF-loaded permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells enters the mitochondria through the uniporter and quenches the fura2FF fluorescence in an essentially stoichiometric manner until the dye becomes saturated, providing a means to estimate the permeability of the uniporter. Importantly, the low concentrations of Mn2+ required to induce the quench of mitochondrial fura2FF have been sho"

We report here a novel human gene (GenBank™ accession number AB086062) that possesses a sequence homologous with the human chondroitin sulfate synthase-1 (CSS1) gene, formerly known as chondroitin synthase. The full-length open reading frame consists of 882 amino acids and encodes a typical type II membrane protein. This enzyme contains a β3-glycosyltransferase motif and a β4-glycosyltransferase motif similar to that found in CSS1. Both the enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells as soluble proteins, and their enzymatic natures were characterized. Both glucuronyltransferase and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities were observed when chondroitin, CS polymer, and their corresponding oligosaccharides were used as the acceptor substrates, but no polymerization reaction was observed as in the case of CSS1. The new enzyme was thus designated chondroitin sulfate synthase-3 (CSS3). However, the specific activity of CSS3 was much lower than that of CSS1. The reaction products were shown to have a GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc linkage and a GalNAcβ1–4GlcUA linkage in the nonreducing terminus of chondroitin resulting from glucuronyltransferase activity and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed that the transcript level of CSS3 was much lower than that of CSS1, although it was ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues. These results indicate that CSS3 is a glycosyltransferase having both glucuronyltransferase and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. It may make a contribution to CS biosynthesis that differs from that of CSS1.

Some CS proteoglycans provide high osmotic pressure and water retention, and others may modulate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, proliferation, and morphogenesis (1Schwartz N.B. Domowicz M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R57-R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic assembly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans is characterized by the following sequential processes: (i) synthesis of the core protein; (ii) xylosylation of specific Ser moieties of the core protein; (iii) addition of two Gal residues to the Xyl; (iv) completion of common tetrasaccharide linkage region by the addition of a glucuronic acid (GlcUA) residue; (v) addition of an GalNAc residue to initiate the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis; (vi) repeated addition of GlcUA residues alternating with GalNAc residues to grow the large heteropolymer glycosaminoglycan chains; and (vii) modification of these growing glycosaminoglycan chains by variable O-sulfation and by variable epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA.The assembly of the linkage region on the core protein followed by glycosaminoglycan polymerization and modification occurs in the intracellular membrane system, which is composed of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (3Kimata K.

We have been interested in characterizing the modification reactions, especially sulfations, because specific regional structures created by these modifications allow chondroitin sulfate to interact with other molecules, including cytokines. The modifications also allow regulation of the assembly and activities of other proteins in extracellular and pericellular matrices (12Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol.

The sulfation of chondroitin sulfate ordinarily proceeds along with polymerization at the Golgi apparatus. Thus, in order to address control mechanisms of the sulfation reaction, the enzymes involved in the chain synthesis should also be studied, especially the chondroitin sulfate elongation enzymes.Recent progress with the human genome project and the expansion of other data bases, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs, have enabled a wider search for novel genes that are homologous to known genes. Kitagawa et al. (22Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) identified a human chondroitin synthase from the HUGE (human unidentified gene-encoded large proteins) protein data base by screening with the keywords: “one trans-membrane domain” and “galactosyltransferase family.” This enzyme had the dual glycosyltransferase activities of glucuronyltransferase II (GlcUAT-II) and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II (GalNAcT-II) that are responsible for synthesizing the repeated disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate (22Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). By a similar search of the data base for homologues, five enzymes were found, including chondroitin synthase, which have been cloned and characterized. Thus the enzyme that contributes to the synthesis of repeated disaccharide units on chondroitin sulfate was designated chondroitin sulfate synthase-1 (CSS1), and the others were named CSGalNAcT-1, CSGalN-AcT-2, CSGlcUAT, and CSS2. Chondroitin sulfate GalNAcT-1 (CSGalNAcT-1) and chondroitin sulfate GalNAcT-2 (CSGalN-AcT-2), the second and fourth chondroitin sulfate glycosyltransferases cloned, respectively, exhibit both GalNAcT-II activity for chain elongation and GalNAcT-I activity that determines and initiates the synthesis of the common linkage region of chondroitin sulfate (23Uyama T.

Chondroitin sulfate GlcUA transferase (CSGlcUAT), the third chondroitin sulfate glycosyltransferase cloned, has only GlcUAT-II activity, which is involved in chain elongation (27Gotoh M. Yada T.

Therefore, more than five enzymes are likely responsible for chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, and they form a gene family analogous to the EXT family for heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis (28Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).In the present study, a search of several data bases using the amino acid sequences of CS glycosyltransferases revealed a novel gene whose product was characterized as the sixth enzyme having a high homology to CSS1. Interestingly, as implied by its homology to CSS1, this enzyme, designated CSS3, shows both GlcUAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities toward the nonreducing terminal residue of chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate, which has a specific linkage structure but shows no polymerization reaction activity. However, its expression level was much lower than that of CSS1, and its specific activity was about one-tenth the activity of CSS1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—UDP-[14C]GlcUA (313 mCi/mmol) and UDP-[3H]Gal (20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA) and ARC (St. Louis, MO), respectively.

As the sequence was not complete, a GENSCAN search of human genomic databases was performed. The predicted sequence was confirmed by PCR with the following two sets of primers: set 1, 5′-ATGGCTGTGCGCTCTCGCCGCCCGT-3′ and 5′-CGTCCCCGCTGCCGTTGTGGCTACT-3′; set 2, 5′-AGTAGCCACAACGGCAGCGGGGACG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGAGAGAGTTCGATTGTACCT-3′ (GenBank™ accession number AB086062). The putative catalytic domain of CSS3 (amino acids 130–883) was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a FLAG peptide in COS-7 cells. An ∼2.3-kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the Marathon-Ready™ cDNA derived from human brain (Clontech) as a template, with two primers, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCCGAGGGGGAGCCCGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTGTCAGGAGAGAGTTCGATT-3′.

The amplified fragment was inserted between the NotI and XbaI sites of pFLAG-CMV-1.Purification of FLAG-tagged Recombinant Enzymes from Culture Supernatant—COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were co-transfected with the expression plasmid and pcDNA3.1 by using TransFast™ (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected using 600 μg/ml G418 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G and cloned by limiting dilution. Cloned cell lines were tested for synthesis and secretion of the recombinant protein by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of supernatants using an anti-FLAG BioM2 antibody (Sigma). The secreted enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography using an anti-FLAG M2-agarose gel (Sigma). The conditioned medium and gel were mixed overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The gel was washed five times with 10 ml of 20% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) to produce a 50% slurry. The immobilized enzyme was stable at 4 °C for at least 4 weeks. The amount of recombinant protein recovered was estimated by immunoblotting. It was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore), and probed with an anti-FLAG peptide antibody BioM2 (Sigma). FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (FLAG-BAP, molecular mass 49 kDa) was used as a standard to estimate the relative amount, as described previously (27Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Blotting and probing were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Immune complexes were detected as positive bands using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) with 10-s exposures. The CSS3, CSS1, and BAP protein bands were quantified by densitometric scanning of the digitized image using NIH image (version 1.61) software. The standard curve for each substrate was generated by increasing the amount of FLAG-tagged BAP protein on the same blotting membrane as the CSS samples. The band intensity and the concentration of the recombinant CSS proteins (90 kDa) in the medium exhibited a linear correlation. The amounts of recombinant CSS proteins could therefore be estimated accurately from the standard curve, which was generated using known amounts of FLAG-tagged BAP protein (49 kDa). The amount of recombinant enzyme protein is expressed in arbitrary units, with each unit of intensity equivalent to 10 ng of FLAG-BAP protein (27Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H.

Keloid and normal fibroblasts exhibit accelerated proliferation and collagen I and III production in co-culture with KKs compared with single cell culture or co-culture with normal keratinocytes. ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation has been observed in excessively proliferating KFs in co-culture with KKs. We hypothesized that ERK and PI3K pathways might be involved in collagen and extracellular matrix production in KFs. To test our hypothesis, four samples of KFs were co-cultured in defined serum-free medium with KKs for 2–5 days. KF cell lysate was subjected to Western blot analysis. Compared with KF single cell culture, phospho-ERK1/2 and downstream phospho-Elk-1 showed up-regulation in the co-culture groups, as did phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt-1, indicating ERK and PI3K pathway activation. Western blotting of the conditioned medium demonstrated increased collagen I–III, laminin β2, and fibronectin levels. Addition of the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126 or the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (but not p38 kinase and JNK inhibitors) completely nullified collagen I–III production and significantly decreased laminin β2 and fibronectin secretion. In the presence of the MEK1/2 or PI3K inhibitor, fibronectin demonstrated changes in molecular mass reflected by faster in-gel migration. These data strongly suggest that synchronous activation of both the ERK and PI3K pathways is essential for collagen I–III and laminin β2 production. These pathways additionally appear to affect the side chain attachments of fibronectin. Modulation of these pathways may suggest a direction for keloid therapy.

The keloid scar is well known clinically for its unique semiautonomous nature, with lesions that “overflow” the original wound margins and recur after excision. That they are notoriously resistant to therapy can be seen by the numerous treatment modalities available, none of which can be said to be truly effective (2Niessen F.B. Spauwen P.H. Schalkwijk J. Kon M. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1999; 104: 1435-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 4Urioste S.S. Arndt K.A. Dover J.S. Semin. Cutan. Med.

Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1990: 732-747Google Scholar), has traditionally been the subject of study in keloid pathogenesis. It is, however, under continuous paracrine signal bombardment from neighboring cells, which influences its behavior and vice versa. This phenomenon was first studied in normal skin (6Mackenzie I.C. Leigh I. Lane B. Watt F. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1994: 243-257Google Scholar, 7Fusenig N.E. Leigh I. Lane B. Watt F. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1994: 71-94Google Scholar), and it is now acknowledged that the actively secreting keratinocyte (8Boyce S.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 8-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Katz A.B. Taichman L.B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 818-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) has a major role to play in normal skin differentiation and hemostasis (termed “epithelial-mesenchymal interactions”). Finally, in contributing to the general endocrine milieu, keratinocytes ultimately affect systemic homeostasis (10Maas-Szabowski N. Shimotoyodome A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xue H. McCauley R.L. Zhang W. J. Surg. Res. 2000; 89: 74-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Garner W.L. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1998; 102: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions were recently extrapolated to keloid pathogenesis following the clinical observation that the initiating event for keloid formation is invariably skin trauma, ranging from the insignificant to the severe (13Lim I.J. Phan T.-T. Bay B.H. Qi R. Huynh H.-T. Tan W.T. Lee S.-T. Longaker M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C212-C222Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Phan T.-T. Lim I.J. Bay B.H. Qi R.

Surg. 2001; 107: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The secretory role of the intrinsically abnormal keloid keratinocyte (KK) undergoes dramatic change following such injury to stimulate local and systemic responses. Unlike normal skin, these KK-derived regulatory paracrine factors are secreted either abnormally or in altered proportions. The KK may itself be insensitive to paracrine feedback from the fibroblast. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that fibroblast behavior in terms of cell proliferation and collagen-ECM synthesis is dictated to a significant degree by the overlying keratinocyte. In the case of keloids, both keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and KKs appear to have underlying abnormalities in the paracrine feedback loop, stimulating fibroproliferative mechanisms and tilting the balance of collagen-ECM synthesis toward excess deposition and accumulation. A genetic predisposition to this aberrant cell response remains incompletely understood (2Niessen F.B. Spauwen P.H. Schalkwijk J. Kon M. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1999; 104: 1435-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 16Omo-Dare P. J. Natl. Med. Assoc. 1975; 67: 428-432PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bayat A. Bock O. Mrowietz U. Ollier W.E.

Dermatol. 2001; 137: 1429-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).A previous study by our group demonstrated increased normal fibroblast (NF) and KF cell proliferation in defined serum-free medium co-culture with KKs compared with that in co-culture with normal keratinocytes, the latter of which was significantly higher than NF or KF cell proliferation in single cell culture (15Lim I.J. Phan T.-T. Song C. Tan W.T. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2001; 107: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that NFs and KFs exposed to KK paracrine secretions in co-culture secreted increased amounts of collagens I and III, which were again higher than in NF or KF single cell culture. The transmission electron microscopic morphology of collagen-ECM of NFs co-cultured with KKs approaches that of in vivo keloid tissue sections (13Lim I.J. Phan T.-T. Bay B.H. Qi R. Huynh H.-T. Tan W.T. Lee S.-T. Longaker M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C212-C222Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). More recent work from our group investigating the role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system of mitogens in keloids demonstrated heightened activation of ERK and PI3K pathways in KFs co-cultured with KKs, resulting in increased KF proliferation (14Phan T.-T. Lim I.J. Bay B.H. Qi R. Longaker M.T. Lee S.-T. Huynh H.-T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C860-C869Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This activation was again greatly enhanced in co-culture compared with single cell culture. In that study, IGF-1 interaction with the IGF-1 receptor appeared to be modulated by the bioavailability of IGF-binding protein-3 (14Phan T.-T. Lim I.J. Bay B.H. Qi R. Longaker M.T. Lee S.-T. Huynh H.-T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C860-C869Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).From the above studies, it became clear that fibroproliferation and collagen-ECM production are closely related. We hypothesized that keloid collagen and ECM component production is also linked to a MAPK cascade, specifically the MEK-ERK and PI3K pathways. To test this hypothesis, four samples of KFs were co-cultured in defined serum-free medium with KKs for 2–5 days. KF cell lysate was subjected to Western analysis to assess the activity of these two pathways and their downstream components affecting cell transcription. The conditioned medium from the co-culture was assayed to investigate fibroblast production of collagens I–III, which form the main structural fibers in skin, as well as laminin β2 and fibronectin, which are linking glycoproteins that have roles in cell adhesion and differentiation and which are found predominantly in the basal lamina, in the presence or absence of inhibitors of MEK1/2 (U0126) and PI3K (LY294002). Additionally, the activities of the stress-related MAPK pathways JNK and p38 kinase were also investigated using the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 to determine their role in keloid collagen and ECM component production.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsU0126, LY294002, rabbit anti-phospho-Ser217/Ser221 MEK1/2, rabbit anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt, mouse anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK1/2, rabbit anti-Akt, and mouse anti-ERK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). SB203580 and SP600125 were supplied by Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Mouse anti-collagen I–III antibody was from Monosan (Am Uden, The Netherlands). Mouse antilaminin β2 and mouse anti-fibronectin antibodies were supplied by Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse anti-α-tubulin, rabbit anti-p38 kinase, rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr182 p38 kinase, rabbit anti-JNK2, and rabbit anti-phospho-Thr183/Tyr185 JNK antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. The chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) was supplied by Amersham Biosciences. Tissue culture Petri dishes, 6-well plates, and 96-well plates were purchased from Nunc (Naperville, IL). Medium, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Invitrogen.U0126, LY294002, SB203580, and SP600125 are MEK1/2-specific, nonselective PI3K, p38 kinase-specific, and JNK-specific inhibitors, respectively. They were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (with the final concentration never exceeding 0.1%) and stored frozen under light-protected conditions at –20 °C.Earlobe KKs and Fibroblast Data BaseFour strains of keloid-derived fibroblasts (KF16, KF17, KF18, and KF48) and two strains of keloid-derived keratinocytes (KK18 and KK48) were obtained from excised earlobe keloid specimens. No patient had previously received any treatment for the keloids. A full history and clinical examination were supplemented with color slide photo documentation. Written informed consent was obtained before operative excision, and a portion of all excised specimens was sent to the Singapore General Hospital Department of Pathology for histological confirmation of keloid identity.Cell CultureKeratinocyte Culture with Earlobe Keloids—Passage 2 keratinocytes were obtained from excised specimens as previously described (15Lim I.J. Phan T.-T. Song C. Tan W.T. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2001; 107: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised earlobe keloid specimens were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 150 μg/ml gentamycin and 7.5 μg/ml Fungizone followed by plain phosphate-buffered saline until the solution became clear. The specimens were then cut into 5 × 10-mm pieces, and the epidermis was scored. Dispase (5 mg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution was added, and the specimens were left overnight at 4 °C. The epidermis was carefully scraped off with a scalpel the next day and incubated in a solution of 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% glucose, and 0.02% EDTA for 10 min. Trypsin action was quenched by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum upon intercellular separation. Suspended cells were transferred to tubes and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 8 min. The cells were then isolated and seeded in keratinocyte culture medium (80 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 ml of fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 × 10–9m cholera toxin, and 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone) at 1 × 105 cells/cm2 for 24 h before transfer to keratinocyte growth medium (Clonetics Corp.). Cell strains were maintained and stored at –150 °C until used. Only cells from the second passage were used in all experiments.Fibroblast Culture with Earlobe Keloids—Remnant keloid dermis was minced and incubated in a solution of collagenase I (0.5 mg/ml) and trypsin (0.2 mg/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and grown in tissue culture flasks. Cell strains were maintained and stored at –150 °C until used. Only cells from the second passage were used in all experiments.Keratinocyte-Fibroblast Co-culture—Keratinocytes from samples KK18 and KK48 were thawed, centrifuged, and recounted. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/cm2 on Transwell clear polyester membrane inserts (0.4-μm pore size, 0.3-cm2 area; Corning-Costar). Cells were maintained for 4 days in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium until 100% confluent in monolayer. The medium was then changed to serum-free defined fibroblast growth medium, and the cells were raised to air-liquid interface for another 3 days, allowing keratinocytes to stratify and to reach terminal differentiation (15Lim I.J. Phan T.-T. Song C. Tan W.T. Longaker M.T. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2001; 107: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Fibroblasts from samples KF16, KF17, KF18, and KF48 were thawed and seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in defined fibroblast growth medium for 3–4 days until 100% confluent. Both the cultured keratinocytes on membrane inserts and the cultured fibroblasts on plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the old medium before placing the inserts on the plates, commencing KK-KF co-culture in fresh serum-free defined fibroblast growth medium with or without varying concentrations of U0126, LY294002, SB203580, or SP600125 for 2 or 5 days. At day 2 or 5, membrane inserts with the cultured keratinocytes were removed, and the conditioned medium was collected for collagen, laminin, and fibronectin analysis. Fibroblasts were also harvested for Western blot analysis.Western BlottingTo detect collagens, fibronectin, and laminin in the conditioned medium, 1 ml of conditioned medium was concentrated using a Centricon centrifuge (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.) and then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with the indicated antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:7500 dilution). Blots were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence detection system as recommended by the manufacturer.To examine the effects of U0126 on the expression of ERK1/2, phospho-Ser217/Ser221 MEK1/2, and phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK1/2; LY294002 on the expression of Akt and phospho-Ser473 Akt; SB203580 on the expression of p38 kinase and phospho-Tyr182 p38 kinase; and SP600125 on the expression of JNK and phospho-Thr183/Tyr185 JNK, KF cells plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells were co-cultured with KKs for the indicated times (2 or 5 days) in defined fibroblast growth medium in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of inhibitors. Following this treatment, KF cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm NaVO4), and Western blot analysis was performed. Blots were incubated with the indicated antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:7500 dilution). All of the primary antibodies were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Blots were then visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence detection system as recommended by the manufacturer.Cell Proliferation AssayThe 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is a colorimetric assay that tests the metabolic activity of viable cells and is used for indirect cell quantification (19Hansen M.B.

Differences in cell number and the levels of proteins under studied were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTSCo-culture of NFs or KFs with KKs Results in Increased Fibroproliferation and Collagen I–III Production—As a confirmatory study on the basal proliferative behavior and collagen production characteristics of three of the KF test samples (KF16, KF17, and KF18), a 5-day co-culture with KKs (KK18) was performed. This was followed by cell proliferation assessment using the MTT assay (Fig. 1A) and Western blotting of the conditioned medium to assess collagen I–III production (Fig. 1B). KFs demonstrated increased cell proliferation and collagen I–III production in co-culture with KKs, and the levels were significantly higher than those obtained with NFs cocultured with KKs. These results correlate with those of our previous studies (13Lim I.J. Phan T.-T. Bay B.H. Qi R. Huynh H.-T. Tan W.T. Lee S.-T. Longaker M.T. Am. J.

KFs co-cultured with KKs demonstrated increased phosphorylation of Akt-1 downstream of the PI3K pathway (Fig. 2C), as well as increased phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Fig. 2D), ERK1/2 (Fig. 2E), and Elk-1 (Fig. 2G), again consistent with our previous study (14Phan T.-T.

In the absence of U0126, KF18 cell proliferation was progressive, whereas the addition of U0126 resulted in progressively decreasing cell proliferation (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effects of U0126 on KK18-induced KF18 cell proliferation. KK18 cells were co-cultured with KF18 cells in the presence or absence of 10 μm U0126 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” KF18 cell proliferation was determined daily for 5 days using the MTT assay.

A 2-day co-culture was selected, as the proliferation of KFs was seen to be progressive with time as long as they were co-cultured with KKs, without the need for a 5-day co-culture. KF18 cell proliferation was noted to be progressively reduced by increasing concentrations of U0126, especially between 2 and 6 μm (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). Increasing concentrations of U0126 also progressively decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was synchronous with the falling KF proliferation rates above (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Effects of U0126 on KK18-induced KF18 proliferation and activation of ERK. KK18 cells were co-cultured with KF18 cells in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of U0126 for 2 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell proliferation of the study groups at day 2 of co-culture was determined using the MTT assay (A). Bars with different letters are significantly different from one another (p < 0.01). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of six samples. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. For analysis of activated ERK1/2, cells were harvested at day 2 and lysed for Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Blots were incubated with mouse anti-ERK (B) and mouse anti-phospho (p)-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK1/2 (C) antibodies.

Complete nullification of laminin β2 production was also seen upon the addition of U0126 at 2 μm and above (Fig. 5B). Fibronectin production was decreased by increasing concentrations of U0126, but was never completely abrogated. Of note were the different in-gel migration characteristics, which reflected a change in the molecular mass of the molecule (Fig. 5C). We speculate this to be due to a change in side chain moiety attachment, which might have been altered in the presence of MEK inhibition.Fig. 5Effects of U0126 on KK18-induced collagen, laminin β2, and fibronectin secretion by KF18 cells. KK18 cells were co-cultured with KF18 cells in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of U0126 for 2 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The conditioned medium was collected on day 2, and 1 ml of conditioned medium was concentrated 10 times and subjected to Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Blots were incubated with mouse anti-collagen I–III (A), mouse anti-laminin β2 (B), and mouse anti-fibronectin (C) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increasing Concentrations of LY294002 Progressively Decrease Cell Proliferation and Akt-1 Activation—KF18 was cocultured with KK18 for 2 days in the absence or presence of different concentrations of LY294002 (2, 4, 6, and 8 μm). Similar to the results obtained with U0126 inhibition, KF18 cell proliferation was noted to be progressively reduced by increasing concentrations of LY294002, with a significant difference seen especially between 2 and 4 μm (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). Increasing concentrations of LY294002 progressively decreased Akt-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C) and abruptly so beyond concentrations of 4 μm. Akt-1 production by itself was unchanged by the treatment (Fig. 4B).Fig. 6Effects of LY294002 on KK18-induced KF18 proliferation and activation of Akt-1.

Although both EXT1 and EXT2 exhibit GlcNAc transferase and GlcUA transferase activities required for the HS synthesis, no HS chain polymerization has been demonstrated in vitro using recombinant enzymes. Here we report in vitro HS polymerization. Recombinant soluble enzymes expressed by co-transfection of EXT1 and EXT2 synthesized heparan polymers with average molecular weights greater than 1.7 x 105 using UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA as donors on the recombinant glypican-1 core protein and also on the synthetic linkage region analog GlcUA-Gal-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl. Moreover, in our in vitro polymerization system, a part time proteoglycan, alpha-thrombomodulin, that is normally modified with chondroitin sulfate served as a polymerization primer for heparan chain. In contrast, no polymerization was achieved with a mixture of individually expressed EXT1 and EXT2 or with acceptor substrates such as N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides or the linkage region tetrasaccharide-Ser, which are devoid of a hydrophobic aglycon, suggesting the critical requirement of core protein moieties in addition to the interaction between EXT1 and EXT2 for HS polymerization."

In FTIR-TDS experiments, the CO ligand can serve as an internal voltmeter that monitors the local electrostatic field not only at the active site but also at intermediate ligand docking sites. Mutations of residue 68 alter size, shape, and electric field of the distal pocket, especially in the vicinity of the primary docking site (state B). As a consequence, the infrared bands associated with the ligand at site B are shifted. The effect is most pronounced in mutants with large aromatic side chains. Polar side chains (threonine or serine) have only little effect on the peak frequencies. Ligands that migrate toward more remote sites C and D give rise to IR bands with altered frequencies. TDS experiments separate the photoproducts according to their recombination temperatures. The rates and extent of ligand migration among internal cavities at cryogenic temperatures can be used to interpret geminate and bimolecular O2 and CO recombination at room temperature. The kinetics of geminate recombination can be explained by steric arguments alone, whereas both the polarity and size of the position 68 side chain play major roles in regulating bimolecular ligand binding from the solvent.

This small globin reversibly binds diatomic ligands like oxygen (O2), nitric oxide (NO), or carbon monoxide (CO). Almost 50 years ago, its three-dimensional average structure was resolved in atomic detail (1Kendrew J.C. Dickerson R.E. Strandberg B.E. Hart R.G. Davies D.R. Phillips D.R. Phillips D.C. Shore V.C. Nature. 1960; 185: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The diffraction data revealed a polypeptide chain tightly wrapped around a heme group, leaving no direct pathway from the outside to the central heme iron where the ligands bind. Therefore, it became evident early on that protein motions are essential for Mb to perform its function. Initially, ligand binding was assumed to be a simple one-step process (2Brunori M. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Antonini E. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This view had to be refined when flash photolysis experiments showed non-exponential internal recombination and multistep kinetics (3Austin R.H. Beeson K.W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Gunsalus I.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5355-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Over the years, a more detailed picture of ligand binding has emerged. In all current models, the ligand has to overcome a sequence of energy barriers to migrate from the solvent to the active site. For a long time, the underlying structural determinants of these barriers remained controversial. Interpretations of the nature of the kinetic intermediates included proximal structural transitions of the protein that affect the reactivity at the heme iron atom (4Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Frauenfelder H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Chu K. Frauenfelder H.

In recent years, a clear structural picture of the ligand binding reaction in Mb has begun to emerge (Fig. 1). It is based on an integrated experimental approach, combining x-ray crystallography of photoproducts, time-resolved spectroscopy and protein engineering. After photolysis of MbCO crystals at liquid-helium temperatures, photolyzed ligands were found to reside in the primary docking site B in close vicinity of the heme iron (8Schlichting I. Berendzen J.

A total of four cavities spacious enough to accommodate a xenon atom, the so-called Xe cavities, are known to exist in the Mb structure (14Tilton Jr., R.F. Kuntz Jr., I.D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recent time resolved x-ray diffraction data have given direct evidence of their role as transient ligand docking sites at physiological temperature (15Srajer V. Ren Z. Teng T.Y. Schmidt M. Ursby T.

The new crystallographic evidence of secondary docking sites prompted us to re-examine the functional role of the highly conserved distal valine at position 68, which is located both adjacent to the ligand binding site and along the pathway to the xenon (Xe) 4 cavity, as shown in Fig. 1.

Their results indicated that Val-68 is part of the overall kinetic barrier to ligand binding. A monotonic decrease of the ligand association rate with increasing size of the Val-68 side chain suggested that residue 68 regulates ligand approach to and capture at the heme iron. In 1995, Quillin et al. (25Quillin M.L. Li T. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Regan R. Carlson M. Gibson Q.H. Li H. Elber R. J. Mol.

In V68F MbCO, the benzyl side chain points away from the ligand-binding site and occupies a region in the back of the distal pocket, partially filling the Xe4 cavity (Fig. 1, right panel). The bulky side chain appears to trap photolyzed ligands near the heme iron, enhancing both the rate and extent of CO, O2, and NO geminate rebinding. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the volume of residue 68 governs ligand escape to remote sites within the protein interior. The polarity of amino acid 68 also affects the bimolecular rate of ligand binding. The V68T mutation in pig Mb causes a ∼10-fold decrease in k′O2, the overall rate coefficient for O2 binding from solvent (26Smerdon S.J. Dodson G.G. Wilkinson A.J. Gibson Q.H. Blackmore R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6252-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This mutation also affects ligand migration into and out of the distal pocket, but its effects on ligand movement to secondary docking sites have not been examined carefully. In this study, the effects of polarity and side chain volume on the lifetimes and spectral characteristics of the B and C/D state intermediates at cryogenic temperatures have been examined more systematically and in great detail. Determination of photoproducts by x-ray diffraction methods is only feasible if the states are populated to at least 20-30%. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a more sensitive technique that allows resolution of different species with fractional populations as low as 1%. Sensitivity to local structure can be combined with time resolution to study dynamics. Measurements carried out as a function of temperature, for instance with the TDS technique, yield information on the energy barriers governing internal migration and rebinding of the photodissociated ligand. The CO stretch bands of heme-bound and photodissociated CO serve as powerful tools to probe the electrostatic fields and accessible space in the immediate vicinity of the CO molecule inside the protein matrix (28Braunstein D.

In wild-type MbCO, the taxonomic substates A0, A1, and A3 associated with CO stretch (νC-O) bands at ∼1965, ∼1945, and ∼1933 cm-1 differ mainly in the position of the distal histidine, His-64 (34Yang F.

To differentiate between steric and electrostatic effects of the distal valine on ligand migration and recombination, mutations were selected (i) to alter the electrostatic potential adjacent to the binding site and/or the primary docking site and (ii) to change the open volume in the interior of the distal pocket. Replacement of the non-polar Val-68 by the isosteric threonine (V68T) provides an unequivocal test of the importance of polarity in determining the rate of ligand binding. The V68S mutant has a smaller and polar side chain and V68M a larger polar one. The V68F and V68W mutations introduce large aromatic side chains into the distal pocket and V68Y combines polarity with an increase in volume. To relate the low temperature spectroscopic data to physiological ligand binding, room temperature flash photolysis and rapid mixing data were collected for both geminate and bimolecular CO and O2 binding to the mutants. The observed kinetic traces are interpreted in terms of the results of the low temperature FTIR-TDS experiments. Sample Preparation—Plasmids containing the mutant Mb genes were transformed into Escherichia coli strain Tb1, expressed and purified as described previously (48Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). IR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein at a concentration of ∼15 mm in cryosolvent (75% glycerol, 25% potassium phosphate buffer (v/v), pH 8) and subsequent reduction with excess dithionite under a CO atmosphere. For the kinetic measurements, lyophilized protein was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8 at a concentration of ∼10 μm and sealed in a 1 × 1 × 3 cm3 cuvette. The solution was equilibrated with 1 atm of CO and reduced with excess sodium dithionite solution. MbO2 samples were prepared by adding sodium dithionite to a ferric Mb solution followed by a rapid passage through a G25 Sephadex column to remove excess reducing agent (for flash photolysis) or by exchanging CO from reduced MbCO samples by equilibration with 1 atm O2 under a bright light source (for the on-rate determinations). Cryospectroscopy and Photolysis Setup—A few microliters of the protein solution were placed between two CaF2 windows (diameter, 25.4 mm) separated by a 75-μm thick Mylar washer. The windows were sandwiched inside a block of oxygen-free, high-conductivity copper mounted on the cold-finger of a closed-cycle helium refrigerator (model SRDK-205AW, Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan). The sample temperature was measured with a silicon temperature sensor diode and regulated by a digital temperature controller (model 330, Lake Shore Cryotronics, Westerville, OH). A continuous wave, frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (model Forte 530-300, Laser Quantum, Manchester, UK), emitting 300 milliwatt output power at 532 nm, was used to photolyze the sample. The laser beam was split and focused with lenses on the sample from both sides. The standard photolysis rate k L was determined to be ∼20 s-1 at low temperature. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (IFS 66v/S, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with an InSb detector was employed to collect transmission spectra in the mid-infrared between 1800 and 2400 cm-1 at a resolution of 2 cm-1. Temperature Derivative Spectroscopy—TDS is an experimental protocol designed to investigate thermally activated rate processes that are characterized by distributed enthalpy barriers (5Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13413-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Mourant J.R. Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P.

A. 1990; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This two-dimensional technique has proven to be particularly useful for detailed investigations of ligand recombination because it allows separation of populations not only by their spectral components (wavenumber, ν) but also by their rebinding properties (recombination temperature, T). Photolysis creates an initial non-equilibrium set of intermediate states within the sample. The subsequent TDS measurement records the relaxation of the sample back to equilibrium as the temperature is ramped up linearly with time in the dark at a rate β = 5 mK/s. During the TDS experiment, FTIR transmission spectra I(ν,T) are taken every 1 K. The integrated absorbance A of the spectral band taken at the lowest temperature represents the total photolyzed population, N. The change in integrated absorbance, ∫ΔAdν, is assumed to be proportional to the change in population of a state, ΔN, during the acquisition of two successive spectra. Absorbance changes arise from two different rate processes, CO rebinding to the heme iron and CO migration to other locations in the protein. Distributed barrier heights and recombination rates are universal features of protein ensembles at low temperatures (3Austin R.H. Beeson K.W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Gunsalus I.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5355-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 50Nienhaus G.U. Young R.D. Trigg G.L. Protein Dynamics. VCH Publishers, New York1996: 163-184Google Scholar). Only small changes in the absorbance are expected at the lowest temperatures because merely a few molecules can surmount the barrier for recombination. At higher temperatures, ∫ΔAdν will increase because more molecules are able to rebind. At even higher temperatures, ∫ΔAdν will decrease again as the population of the photodissociated states gets depleted. Therefore, the TDS protocol ensures that the different rate processes are sorted according to their activation enthalpy barrier, which is, to a good approximation, linearly related to the temperature at which the reaction is observed. For a quantitative modeling of the TDS data, the derivative of the population with respect to temperature, dN/dT, is approximated by calculating absorbance difference spectra ΔA(ν,T) from transmission spectra I(ν,T) at successive temperatures. Two assumptions are implicit in this procedure. (i) The change in absorbance is proportional to the rebinding population, and (ii) there is no intrinsic temperature dependence in the measured spectra. TDS data are conveniently presented as contour plots of the absorbance change on a surface spanned by the wavenumber (ν) and temperature (T) axes. Geminate and Bimolecular Recombination at Room Temperature—Experiments were carried out with a home-built flash photolysis apparatus, using a 6-ns (full width at half maximum) pulse from a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (model Surelite, Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) for photodissociation. Ligand binding was monitored with light from a tungsten source, which was passed through a monochromator set at 436 nm. A photomultiplier tube (model R5600U, Hamamatsu Corp., Middlesex, NJ) measured the changes in transmittance. Th"

Loss of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is critical for tumor progression by allowing the cells to escape growth control. Exposure of HEY and OVCA 433 ovarian carcinoma cell lines to ET-1 led to a 50–75% inhibition in intercellular communication and to a decrease in the connexin 43 (Cx43)-based gap junction plaques. To investigate the phosphorylation state of Cx43, ovarian carcinoma cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 was detected in ET-1-treated cells. BQ 123, a selective ETAR antagonist, blocked the ET-1-induced Cx43 phosphorylation and cellular uncoupling. Gap junction closure was prevented by tyrphostin 25 and by the selective c-Src inhibitor, PP2. Furthermore, the increased Cx43 tyrosine phosphorylation was correlated with ET-1-induced increase of c-Src activity, and PP2 suppressed the ET-1-induced Cx43 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that inhibition of Cx43-based GJIC is mainly mediated by the Src tyrosine kinase pathway. In vivo, the inhibition of human ovarian tumor growth in nude mice induced by the potent ETAR antagonist, ABT-627, was associated with a reduction of Cx43 phosphorylation. These findings indicate that the signaling mechanisms involved in GJIC disruption on ovarian carcinoma cells depend on ETAR activation, which leads to the Cx43 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by c-Src, suggesting that ETAR blockade may contribute to the control of ovarian carcinoma growth and progression also by preventing the loss of GJIC.

ETs and their receptors have been implicated in tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine pathways. ET-1 is produced primarily by vascular cells and in elevated amounts by different tumor cells and acts through two distinct subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), namely ETA receptor (ETAR) and ETBR, that have different affinities for ETs (10Rubanji G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 46: 325-414Google Scholar). The ET-1/ETAR autocrine pathway has a key role in the development and the progression of prostatic, ovarian, and cervical cancers (11Nelson J.B. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that ET-1 and ETAR are overexpressed in primary and metastatic ovarian carcinomas compared with normal ovarian tissues (3Bagnato A. Salani D. Di Castro V. Wu-Wong J.R. Tecce R. Nicotra M.R. Venuti A. Natali P.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar). In ovarian tumor cells, ET-1 acts an autocrine factor selectively through ETAR (2Bagnato A. Tecce R. Moretti C. Di Castro V. Spergel D. Catt K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding to this receptor results in activation of a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein that stimulates phospholipase C activity and increases intracellular Ca2+ levels, activation of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p125 focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation (11Nelson J.B.

Moreover, the role of ET-1 in the regulation of GJIC in tumor cells has not been studied.GJs are composed of transmembrane channel proteins, termed connexins (Cxs), that directly connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells, allowing the cells to review and shape the functional state of their neighbors by exchanging signaling molecules, a process called gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) (22Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar).During the transition to malignant lesions and to metastatic cancer, stepwise changes in intercellular communications provide tumor cells with the ability to overcome microenvironmental controls from the host, to invade surrounding tissues, and to metastasize (23Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 1: 219-229Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Various tumor-promoting agents (24Ruch R.J. Trosko J.E. Madhukar B.V. J. Cell.

Cell. 2002; 94: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) decrease GJIC, either by suppressing Cx expression or by inducing post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, a process that is closely related to cellular processes such as trafficking, assembly/disassembly, gating of gap junction channels, and altered susceptibility to degradation (27Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the turnover of connexins is exceptionally rapid and that degradation of Cx43 involves both the lysosome and the proteasome pathways (28Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation, in most cases, is a prerequisite for ubiquitination that marks the protein for proteasomal destruction. The COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 contains several serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, suggesting that this region of the molecule contains a complex array of potential regulatory sites (20Postma F.R.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the activation of the ETAR by ET-1 leads to a reduction of Cx43-mediated GJIC in ovarian carcinoma cells and, if so, to determine the involved signaling pathways targeting Cx43. Because phosphorylation of Cx43 is believed to be causally linked with disruption of GJIC, we analyzed whether ET-1 could modulate the phosphorylation of Cx43. Using two ovarian carcinoma cell lines, HEY and OVCA 433, in which the ET-1/ETAR autocrine pathway is biologically active, we report here for the first time in tumor cells that 1) ET-1 significantly decreases intercellular communication and Cx43 expression at the cell surface; 2) these activities require ETAR activation; and 3) Cx43 phosphorylation is mainly mediated by the Src tyrosine kinase pathway.

Thus, our findings identify the signaling pathways linking ETAR with cellular uncoupling, which may contribute to ET-1-mediated ovarian tumor progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines HEY and OVCA 433 were a generous gift from Prof. G. Scambia (Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. When the cells reached 70–80% confluence, the cultures were serum-deprived by incubation for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absolute absence of serum. All culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland, UK). ET-1 (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) was added in the HEY and OVCA 433 cell medium at the indicated concentration and for the indicated time. When the effects of the antagonists (BQ 123 and BQ 788; Peninsula Laboratories) were studied, they were added 15 min before agonist. Pretreatment of cells with pervanadate (1 mm), PP2 (50 nm), tyrphostin 25 (100 μm), or staurosporine (100 nm) (Calbiochem) was performed for 30 min prior to the addition of ET-1.Scrape Loading/Dye Transfer—Levels of GJIC in control and treated cultures were determined using the scrape-loading/dye transfer (SL/DT) technique, applying a mixture of fluorescent dyes; Lucifer Yellow (LY) (Sigma) and rhodamine-dextran (RhD) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (38Carruba G.

HEY and OVCA 433 cells, cultured as described above, were washed thoroughly with PBS in which Ca2+ was omitted to prevent uncoupling of the cells due to high Ca2+. The mixture containing 0.5% LY and 0.5% RhD in Ca2+-free PBS was added to the cells, and scrape loading was performed, applying two or three cuts on cell monolayers with a razor blade. The dye mixture was rinsed away 1 min after the scrape. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and cells stained with LY and/or with RhD were detected by fluorescence emission with an inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a camera. Junctional permeability was measured after the scrape by taking five successive images per trial. Cells that received the LY from the scrape-loaded cells, excluding the RhD-stained cells, were considered communicating. The numbers of communicating cells in the untreated and treated samples were counted. Gap junction communicating capacity was expressed as percentage of the control.Immunostaining of Cx43—HEY cells were grown to 80% confluence in 8 wells of tissue culture (Labtek). After the addition of 100 nm ET-1 for 30 min, the cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed on acetone. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-Cx43 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) diluted 1:10 in PBS and then for 1 h with a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Fab′) fraction (Cappel; ICN Biomedicals GmbH) diluted 1:200 in PBS at room temperature. Cells stained directly with the secondary antibody or with the isotype-matched murine immunoglobulins were used as a negative control. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was carried out on acetone-fixed 4-μm frozen tissue sections employing rabbit anti-Cx43 antiserum and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fab′) fraction (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mm orthovanadate, 0.06 units of aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For immunoprecipitation of Cx43, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. Cell lysates, obtained after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material, were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation overnight at 4 °C of the precleared lysates with a polyclonal anti-pan-Cx43 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which detects nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Cx43 species, insolubilized on protein A-Sepharose. After washing six times with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated material was solubilized in 2× SDS Laemmli buffer under reducing conditions and analyzed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Nonspecific binding of Abs was prevented by incubating the blotted membrane in 3% bovine serum albumin TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween) for1hat room temperature. The blots were then incubated for 1 h with anti-phosphotyrosine or with anti-pan-c-Src, a nonphosphospecific antibody or with anti-c-Src (Tyr(P)418) polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE) or anti-Cx43 monoclonal Ab (Transduction Laboratories). Membranes were then washed with TBS-T three times for 15 min each at room temperature and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and subjected to the ECL (Amersham Biosciences).For detection of Cx43 or c-Src or activated form of c-Src, an equal amount of cell lysate proteins from ovarian carcinoma cells or homogenized HEY tumor specimens was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T and incubated with either Cx43 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-pan-c-Src (BIOSOURCE), or an activated form of c-Src (BIOSOURCE) antibodies for 1 h. After washing with TBS-T, blots were incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and subjected to the ECL (Amersham Biosciences) procedure. After being stripped, the membranes were reprobed with β-actin monoclonal antibody (Oncogene, CN Biosciences, Inc., Darmastadt, Germany) to ensure equal loading. The relative intensity of signals was quantified using the Scion image analysis program. The quantification data was statistically analyzed using Student's t test and represent the average value of three independent Western blots.HEY Xenografts in Nude Mice—Female athymic (nu+/nu+) mice, 4–6 weeks old, were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Milan, Italy). The treatment protocol followed the guidelines of animal experimentation adopted by the Regina Elena Cancer Institute under the control of the Ministry of Public Health. Mice were given injections subcutaneously into one flank with 1.5 × 106 viable HEY cells, as determined by trypan blue staining, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. After 7 days, when established tumors of ∼0.2–0.3 cm3 in diameter were detectable, mice were randomized in groups (n = 10) to receive different treatments. One group was treated intraperitoneally for 21 days with ABT-627 (atrasentan, provided by Abbott, at daily doses of 2 mg/kg/day) dissolved in 0.25 n NaHCO3. Control mice were injected in the same way with 200 μl of drug vehicle. On day 40 after tumor injection, tumors were removed from control and treated mice and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis.Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were assessed using a two-tailed Student's t test and were performed by the Instat software system (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTSET-1 Inhibits Gap Junctional Intercellular Communication in Ovarian Carcinoma Cells—Although previous studies demonstrated that ET-1 disrupted GJIC in astrocytes (19Blomstrand F. Giaume C. Hansson E. Ronnback L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C616-C627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in Rat-1 cells (20Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), its effect on the regulation of GJIC in tumor cells has not been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of ET-1 on GJIC of two ovarian carcinoma cell lines, HEY and OVCA 433, that express functional ETAR and secrete high levels of ET-1 (3Bagnato A. Salani D. Di Castro V. Wu-Wong J.R. Tecce R. Nicotra M.R. Venuti A. Natali P.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar). We used the SL/DT method, applying a low molecular mass fluorescent tracer, LY, which transfers through the gap junction channel, to monitor GJIC function and RhD, which does not pass through the channels, to identify the incision sites or artificially damaged cells. For the evaluation of GJIC function, cells stained only with LY, excluding the RhD-stained cells, were counted. As assessed by the SL/DT technique, serum-starved ovarian carcinoma cells were communication-competent and transferred LY to several cells distant to the wound edge (Fig. 1). The addition of 100 nm ET-1 to the cell medium resulted in a transient and time-dependent reduction in GJIC. Intercellular movement of LY was still detectable 10 min after ET-1 addition, at this time inhibition of GJIC was 50%, whereas after 30 min the dye remained confined to the wounded cells, and GJIC were inhibited by 70–80% with respect to the controls. Ovarian cancer cell GJIC returned to basal levels within 2 h (Fig. 1B). After exposure to different concentrations of ET-1 for 30 min, a dose-dependent inhibition was detected in HEY and OVCA 433 cells. ET-1 at a dosage of 0.1 nm induced a 20% inhibition that reached 70% at a concentration of 100 nm ET-1 (Fig. 1C). In all of these experiments, the transmembrane permeability was not affected by agonist stimulation, since both stimulated and control cells showed negligible dye loss over a 3-h period. Thus, the observed inhibition of LY diffusion represented an ET-1-induced decrease in gap junctional communication.ET-1 Induces Phosphorylation of Cx43—To determine whether ET-1 can regulate Cx43 expression in ovarian carcinoma cells, HEY and OVCA 433 cells were exposed for different times to ET-1 (100 nm). ET-1 significantly induced dose-dependent increase in the electrophoretic mobility shift of Cx43 (Fig. 2A). As analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Cx43 is normally reported as being represented by a faster migrating, nonphosphorylated species (Cx43-P0) and two more slower migrating, phosphorylated species (Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2) (39Musil L.S. Beyer E.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) that we refer to collectively as Cx43-P. ET-1 treatment resulted a in time-dependent Cx43 phosphorylation reaching the maximum level after 30 min and returning to basal level after 1 h of exposure to ET-1 (Fig. 2A). Treatment with alkaline phosphatase results in the total disappearance of the slower migrating bands, indicating that these bands correspond to the phosphorylated forms of Cx43 (Fig. 2B). The differences in Cx43 banding patterns between the two cell lines may reflect differential steady-state levels probably related to kinetic variability in Cx43 turnover. Nonphosphorylated Cx43 (Cx43-P0) was detected in untreated HEY cells, whereas the phosphorylated Cx43 species (Cx43-P) were much less apparent (Fig. 2, A and B). Exposure of HEY cells to from 0.1 nm up to 100 nm ET-1 for 30 min resulted in a dose-dependent increase of Cx43 phosphorylation that reached the highest intensity at 100 nm of ET-1 (Fig. 2C). Densitometric analysis of Fig. 2C shows that ET-1 increased the Cx43-P at the expense of Cx43-P0 (Fig. 2D, left), and the total cellular Cx43 content only slightly decreased following treatment with ET-1 (Fig. 2D, right).Fig. 2Effects of ET-1 on Cx43 expression in ovarian carcinoma cells. HEY and OVCA 433 cells were stimulated for up to 120 min with 100 nm ET-1 (A). Samples from 30-min ET-1 (100 nm)-stimulated HEY cells were incubated with alkaline phosphatases treatment and analyzed for Cx43 expression by Western blotting (B). HEY cells were also stimulated with different concentrations of ET-1 for 30 min (C). Whole cell lysates were assayed for Cx43 expression by Western blotting with anti-Cx43. After being stripped, the membranes were reprobed with β-actin-specific antibody to ensure equal loading. The relative density of Cx43-P/Cx43-P0 ratio and total Cx43 content (D) from HEY cells treated with different concentration of ET-1 (B) were statistically analyzed and represent the average value of three independent Western blots ± S.D. *, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.05 compared with untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further examine the other connexin subtypes that participate in gap junction formation in HEY and OVCA 433 cells. Western blotting showed that Cx32 and Cx26 expression was barely detectable in these cells, and ET-1 did not modify their levels of expression (data not shown).ET-1-induced Cx43 Phosphorylation and GJIC Inhibition Are Mediated through ETAR—To investigate which receptor subtype mediates ET-1-induced disruption of GJIC and Cx43 phosphorylation, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, BQ123, and a selective ETBR antagonist, BQ788, were used in the presence or absence of 100 nm ET-1. BQ123 was able to completely block ET-1-induced Cx43 phosphorylation, whereas BQ 788 did not (Fig. 3A). To determine whether ETAR was responsible for the inhibition of GJIC, BQ 123 was used in SL/DT experiments. ET-1-induced dye transfer inhibition was prevented by the ETAR antagonist (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings indicate that ET-1 acts through ETAR to induce the phosphorylation of Cx43 and to disrupt the GJIC.Fig. 3Effects of ETAR antagonist on ET-1-induced Cx43 phosphorylation. HEY cells were incubated for 30 min with 100 nm ET-1 in the absence or in presence of BQ 123 (1 μm) or BQ 788 (1 μm). Lysates were assayed for Cx43 expression by Western blotting. After being stripped, the membranes were reprobed with β-actin-specific antibody to ensure equal loading (A). ET-1 (100 nm) effects on GJIC were analyzed in HEY cells in the absence or presence of BQ123 (1 μm) by the SL/DT method, and the data were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and expressed as the relative percentage of the control (B).

https://openalex.org/W2030787587,"Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. SF-1 regulates the expression of many genes involved in reproduction, steroidogenesis, and sexual differentiation. An important SF-1 target for male sexual differentiation is the gene encoding the Müllerian-inhibiting substance hormone that induces regression of the Müllerian ducts in the developing male embryo. Not long ago, a mutation (G35E) in the human SF-1 gene was identified as the cause of sex reversal and adrenal failure in a phenotypically female but genotypically XY individual. This suggested that the mutated SF-1 protein might interfere with the expression of SF-1 target gene(s) involved in the male sexual differentiation pathway, such as MIS. Surprisingly, the initial biochemical characterization of the SF-1 G35E mutant revealed that it could bind and activate the MIS promoter as efficiently as wild-type SF-1. MIS expression, however, does not rely solely on SF-1 but rather requires the concerted action of several transcription factors including GATA-4. We have previously reported that GATA-4 and SF-1 transcriptionally cooperate to synergistically activate the MIS promoter. Thus, we hypothesized that the phenotype observed with the SF-1 G35E mutation could be explained, at least in part, by a failure and/or a disruption of GATA-4/SF-1 synergism. We found that the SF-1 G35E mutant failed to synergize with GATA-4 despite a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. Interestingly, the SF-1 G35E mutant also disrupted transcriptional synergism between wild-type SF-1 and GATA-4, indicating that it could act as a dominant negative competitor. Thus, our results strengthen the importance of a GATA-4/SF-1 cooperation for MIS transcription and reveal that disruption of this synergism might be responsible for some cases of abnormal sex differentiation in humans.

In mammals, male sexual differentiation is regulated by two hormones produced by the fetal testis, testosterone secreted by Leydig cells and Müllerian-inhibiting substance (anti-Müllerian hormone) produced by Sertoli cells. In the male embryo, testosterone promotes the Wolffian ducts to develop into the male accessory sex organs (epididymis, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens), whereas Müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) 1The abbreviations used are: MIS, Müllerian inhibiting substance; SF-1, steroidogenic factor 1; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: MIS, Müllerian inhibiting substance; SF-1, steroidogenic factor 1; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. induces regression of the Müllerian ducts (the precursors of the internal female reproductive tract). MIS is the earliest marker of testis formation where it is found in Sertoli cells of the developing human testis starting around 8 weeks of gestation (1De Santa Barbara P. Moniot B. Poulat F. Berta P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Rajpert-De Meyts E. Jorgensen N. Graem N. Muller J. Cate R.L. Skakkebaek N.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 3836-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the mouse, MIS is first detected in Sertoli cells on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and its expression remains high throughout fetal life before declining markedly after birth (3Shen W.H. Moore C.C. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4Münsterberg A. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1991; 113: 613-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in male sexual differentiation, the absence of MIS expression in mice or humans causes pseudohermaphroditism characterized by the retention of Müllerian duct structures (5Behringer R.R. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1994; 29: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Josso N. Picard J.Y. Imbeaud S. di Clemente N. Rey R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1997; 47: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because Müllerian duct regression is essential for proper masculinization of the male embryo, a complete understanding of MIS gene regulation is central to our comprehension of cases of abnormal sex differentiation involving aberrant MIS expression. The transcriptional regulation of the MIS gene has been intensely studied. In the mouse, as little as 180 bp of 5′-flanking sequence of the MIS gene have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to faithfully reconstitute its spatiotemporal expression in vivo (7Giuili G. Shen W.H. Ingraham H.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1799-1807PubMed Google Scholar). Within this short promoter region, there are species-conserved regulatory elements for the binding of three different transcription factors, the Sry-related factor Sox9, the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1/Ad4BP/NR5A1), and the zinc finger factor GATA-4 (3Shen W.H.

SF-1 binds DNA as a monomer to regulatory sequences containing a PyCAAGGTCA nucleotide motif (16Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). SF-1 was first identified as an essential regulator of the P450 hydroxylases in the adrenals and gonads (17Ikeda Y. Lala D.S.

In humans, the role of SF-1 in male sex differentiation is supported by the identification of SF-1 gene mutations in some 46, XY sex-reversed patients: a dominant de novo heterozygous G35E mutation (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), a recessive homozygous R92Q mutation (27Achermann J.C. Ozisik G. Ito M. Orun U.A. Harmanci K. Gurakan B. Jameson J.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and a heterozygous deletion of eight nucleotides causing a frameshift mutation and C-terminal truncation of the SF-1 protein (28Correa R.V. Domenice S. Billerbeck A.E.C. MeloKarla F.A.S. Costa E.M.F. Latronico A.C. Mendonca B.B. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 55Google Scholar). For two of these SF-1 mutations (G35E and R92Q), the presence of normal Müllerian structures and the retention of a uterus in the affected individuals is indicative of insufficient MIS production. This suggested that the mutated SF-1 proteins might interfere with the expression of SF-1 target gene(s) involved in the male sexual differentiation pathway, including MIS. Although both SF-1 mutations are located in the DNA-binding domain, each occurs within a different region (the G35E in the P-box and R92Q in the A-box). The A-box is involved in stabilizing the SF-1/DNA interaction by contacting the 5′ extension (PyCA) and the first part of the half-site. Mutation in this region (R92Q) has been shown to have little effect on DNA binding (29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the P-box is believed to direct binding to the AGGTCA core motif. Consequently, mutation in the P-box (G35E) was shown to interfere with SF-1 binding to promoters containing variant half-sites (for example, P450scc: TCAAGGCTA) but not to promoters having consensus half-sites (P450 aromatase and MIS: CCAAGGTCA) (29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the SF-1 G35E mutant was found to be able to bind and activate the MIS promoter (29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally, the SF-1 G35E mutant did not exhibit dominant negative activity when coexpressed with the wild-type SF-1 protein (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the phenotypic sex reversal in the patient harboring the SF-1 G35E mutation remains poorly understood. Several possibilities, however, have been proposed including gene dosage and/or a primary defect in Sertoli cell function (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Another potential explanation is that the SF-1 G35E mutant may not be able to synergize with transcription factors known to enhance MIS promoter activity. Because we have demonstrated previously that a GATA-4/SF-1 cooperation is an important contributor to MIS transcription in Sertoli cells (15Tremblay J.J. Robert N.M. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1636-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the phenotypic sex reversal observed with the heterozygous SF-1 G35E mutation could be explained, at least in part, by a failure and/or a disruption of this GATA-4/SF-1 transcriptional synergism. In the present study, we provide data supporting this hypothesis whereby the SF-1 G35E mutant protein not only fails to synergize with GATA-4 on the MIS promoter but also acts as a dominant negative competitor of the synergism between GATA-4 and the wild-type SF-1 protein. Plasmids—The (SF-1:GATA)3-MIS synthetic reporter has been described previously (13Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for full-length rat GATA-4 (amino acids 1-440) and a GATA dominant negative consisting of the GATA-4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 201-332) have also been described previously (15Tremblay J.J. Robert N.M. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1636-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because the SF-1 G35E mutation creates a unique EcoRI site, an overlapping PCR strategy (centered around the EcoRI site) using the wild-type mouse SF-1 cDNA as template was used to recreate the G35E mutation. The mouse and human SF-1 proteins are 93% identical overall and 100% identical in the DNA-binding domain. The first PCR fragment, representing the N-terminal portion of the SF-1 protein, was cloned into an expression vector. The resulting plasmid was then opened up with EcoRI and the second PCR, corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the SF-1 protein, was inserted to yield the SF-1 G35E construct. To control for the level of expression of the wild-type and G35E SF-1 proteins, the corresponding cDNAs were subcloned in an expression vector that provided an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression plasmids for mouse SF-1 (18Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and FOG-2 (31Lu J.R. McKinsey A. Xu H. Wang D.Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4495-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. Keith Parker and Eric Olson, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfections—African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 and embryonal kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All transfections were done in 24-well plates using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Data reported represent the average of at least three experiments, each done in duplicate. Nuclear Extracts and Western Blots—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the procedure outlined by Schreiber et al. (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). In Western analyses, 20-μg aliquots of nuclear extracts from 293 cells overexpressing SF-1 (wild-type or G35E) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). HA-tagged SF-1 proteins were detected using a commercially available anti-HA polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech) and a VECTASTAIN-ABC-Amp Western blot detection kit (Vector Laboratories Canada, Burlington, Canada). Production of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-GATA-4 Fusion Protein—A recombinant GST-GATA-4255-440 fusion protein was obtained by cloning the C-terminal region of the rat GATA-4 cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 255-440) in-frame with GST using the commercially available pGEX2T fusion protein vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting construct was introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BL21, and the fusion protein was produced by inducing the bacterial culture with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, the bacterial culture was lysed by sonication and the fusion protein was purified using a glutathione resin (Amersham Biosciences) according to instructions outlined by the manufacturer. Protein-Protein Binding Assays—Protein-protein binding studies were done using 35S-labeled in vitro translated SF-1 wild-type and G35E proteins and the purified GST-GATA-4255-440 fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. The 35S-labeled SF-1 and control luciferase proteins were obtained using the TnT® T7/SP6-coupled reticulocyte system from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein-protein interaction assays were done as described previously (13Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Assays—Recombinant SF-1 wild-type and G35E proteins were in vitro translated using the TnT® system. DNA binding assays were performed using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the conserved SF-1 element of the proximal (-90 bp) murine MIS promoter. Binding reactions and electrophoresis conditions were as described previously (13Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Affinities of the Wild-type and G35E SF-1 Proteins—To study the effect of the SF-1 G35E mutation on the transcriptional cooperation between GATA-4 and SF-1 on the MIS promoter, the G35E mutation was first recreated in the mouse SF-1 cDNA by an overlapping PCR strategy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA binding affinities of the wild-type and G35E SF-1 proteins were compared by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 1, the SF-1 G35E mutant retains its ability to strongly bind to the SF-1 element from the MIS promoter (compare the G35E mutant in lane 8 with the wild-type SF-1 protein in lane 2). This result is consistent with a previous study that had first characterized the DNA binding properties of the human SF-1 G35E protein (29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Competition experiments were undertaken then to detect potential differences in DNA binding affinity between the two proteins. As expected, increasing doses of unlabeled probe led to a dose-dependent displacement of binding for both proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 3-7 and 9-13). However, no significant differences in the rate of displacement were observed for either protein, indicating that the SF-1 G35E mutant binds to the MIS SF-1 element with a similar affinity as the wild-type SF-1 protein. The SF-1 G35E Mutant Fails to Synergize with GATA Factors—We have reported previously that SF-1 transcriptionally cooperates with members of the GATA family of transcription factors to activate the promoters of multiple gonad-expressed genes, including MIS (13Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Tremblay J.J. Robert N.M. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1636-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the ability of the SF-1 G35E mutant to normally bind to the MIS promoter, the G35E mutation might impair its ability to cooperate transcriptionally with GATA-4. To test this hypothesis, transient transfection assays were first performed in heterologous CV-1 cells that lack both endogenous GATA-4 and SF-1 proteins. A synthetic MIS reporter containing three copies of the MIS SF-1 and GATA elements was used to amplify the transcriptional cooperation between SF-1 and GATA-4. As expected, the wild-type SF-1 protein markedly enhanced the GATA-4-dependent activation of the MIS promoter (black bar in Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, no synergism was detected between GATA-4 and the G35E SF-1 mutant (gray bar in Fig. 2A) even when higher doses of the SF-1 G35E construct were used (data not shown). This was not simply because of differences in expression or nuclear localization of the two SF-1 constructs because both the wild-type and G35E proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2B). The effect of the SF-1 G35E mutation on MIS promoter activity was subsequently studied in the human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cell line (Fig. 3). JEG-3 cells have been shown to contain endogenous GATA activity including GATA-4 (34Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but no functional SF-1 (12Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 35Ito M. Yu R.N. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that overexpression of SF-1 in JEG-3 cells results in a strong synergistic activation of SF-1-dependent promoters because of the presence of endogenous GATA factors (14Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As expected, SF-1 is a potent trans-activator of MIS promoter activity in GATA-expressing JEG-3 cells but only a weak activator in non-GATA-expressing CV-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Consistent with a GATA/SF-1 transcriptional cooperation, the potent transactivation mediated by SF-1 alone in JEG-3 cells was similar to the synergistic activation observed between GATA-4 and SF-1 in heterologous CV-1 cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). Further proof that the SF-1-dependent transactivation observed in JEG-3 cells is indeed a reflection of GATA/SF-1 synergism is the fact that both a GATA dominant negative competitor and the GATA corepressor FOG-2 markedly repressed SF-1-dependent transcription in these cells (Fig. 3A). Because the GATA dominant negative and FOG-2 do not directly affect SF-1 transcription (15Tremblay J.J. Robert N.M. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1636-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Robert N.M. Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the effects observed in JEG-3 cells can be attributed to a disruption of GATA/SF-1 synergism. Therefore, JEG-3 cells provide a sensitive assay system for detecting transcriptional cooperations between SF-1 and GATA factors. The transactivation potential of the SF-1 G35E mutant was then tested in these cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast to wild-type SF-1, the G35E mutant only weakly activated the MIS reporter even when high doses of expression vector were used. Thus, transfection data from both CV-1 and JEG-3 cells indicate that the SF-1 G35E mutant fails to synergize with GATA-4. The G35E SF-1 Mutant Still Interacts with GATA-4—Because we have shown previously that GATA-4 and SF-1 cooperate transcriptionally through a direct protein-protein interaction (13Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the lack of synergism between the SF-1 G35E mutant and GATA-4 might be because of a disruption of this physical interaction. To test this possibility, in vitro protein-protein interaction assays were performed (Fig. 4). In these experiments, a GST-GATA-4 fusion protein (GST-GATA-4255-440) containing the GATA-4 zinc finger domain involved in the interaction with SF-1 (13Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was used with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled SF-1 wild-type and G35E proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, both SF-1 proteins were specifically retained by the GST-GATA-4 fusion protein (lanes 4 and 5). A control luciferase protein (lane 6) showed no interaction. Thus, the absence of transcriptional synergism between GATA-4 and SF-1 G35E mutant is not because of a loss of direct interaction between the two proteins. SF-1 G35E Acts as a Dominant Negative Competitor of GATA-4/SF-1 Synergism—The fact that no transcriptional cooperation results from a SF-1 G35E/GATA-4 interaction in vitro raised the intriguing possibility that in vivo the abnormal sex differentiation associated with the G35E mutation might be because of competition between the mutant and wild-type SF-1 proteins for synergism with GATA-4 on the MIS promoter. In support of this argument, the affected patient carries the G35E mutation on one allele of the SF-1 gene whereas the other allele is capable of producing a normal SF-1 protein (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis of a dominant negative effect, CV-1 cells were first transfected with GATA-4 and wild-type SF-1 to obtain the characteristic synergistic activation of the MIS reporter (Fig. 5A, black bar). This synergism was then challenged by increasing doses of the SF-1 G35E mutant (Fig. 5A, hatched bars). In CV-1 cells, this led to a dose-dependent inhibition of synergism between GATA-4 and wild-type SF-1. The reverse was also observed; by holding the SF-1 G35E concentration constant, its dominant negative negative effect could be overridden by increasing doses of wild-type SF-1 (Fig. 5A, horizontal bars). Next, to reconstitute the situation found in the SF-1G35E/wild-type patient, GATA-expressing JEG-3 cells were transfected with the MIS reporter and different amounts of the wild-type and mutant SF-1 constructs: an arbitrary amount of wild-type SF-1 (200 ng, gray bar) representing SF-1 protein levels produced from the two normal alleles; half of that dose (100 ng, open bar) representing SF-1 protein levels produced by only one functional allele as in the case of true haploinsufficiency (complete loss-of-function of one allele); and finally, equal amounts of wild-type SF-1 and SF-1 G35E (100 ng each, black bar), which would represent the individual carrying the G35E mutation. As shown in Fig. 5B, transfection of equal doses of wild-type and mutant SF-1 results in a weaker activation than what is observed with a single dose of wild-type SF-1. This indicates that the SF-1 G35E mutant actively competes with the wild-type protein for interacting proteins, such as GATA factors. Taken together, these results suggest that the SF-1 G35E mutant acts as a dominant negative competitor of SF-1 activity by disrupting GATA-4/SF-1 synergism on the MIS promoter. MIS plays a critical role in mammalian sex differentiation. In humans, insufficient MIS levels during fetal development causes persistent Müllerian duct syndrome where affected males manifest female internal genitalia (37Teixeira J. Maheswaran S. Donahoe P.K. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 657-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying the transcription factors involved in MIS transcription and how these factors interact to ensure proper spatiotemporal MIS expression is of fundamental importance to our understanding of male sex differentiation. Over the past few years, several transcription factors have been shown to play a role in the regulation of MIS promoter activity both in vitro and in vivo. These include SF-1, GATA-4, SOX-9, WT-1, and DAX-1 (reviewed in Ref. 37Teixeira J. Maheswaran S. Donahoe P.K. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 657-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, gene mutations that alter the function of these factors are likely to affect MIS gene expression and consequently the male sex differentiation process. Indeed, such mutations have been identified for the SOX-9 gene (38Wagner T. Wirth J. Meyer J. Zabel B. Held M. Zimmer J. Pasantes J. Bricarelli F.D. Keutel J. Hustert E. Cell. 1994; 79: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), the WT-1 gene (39Pelletier J. Bruening W. Li F.P. Haber D.A. Glaser T. Housman D.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and more recently the SF-1 gene (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 27Achermann J.C. Ozisik G. Ito M. Orun U.A. Harmanci K. Gurakan B. Jameson J.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Correa R.V. Domenice S. Billerbeck A.E.C. MeloKarla F.A.S. Costa E.M.F. Latronico A.C. Mendonca B.B. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 55Google Scholar). Of the three SF-1 gene mutations that have been associated with human 46, XY sex reversal, the G35E substitution is a dominant de novo mutation that occurs on one allele of the SF-1 gene (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The abnormal sex differentiation associated with the heterozygous SF-1 G35E mutation can be explained by at least three non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. The first would be a primary defect in Sertoli cell function whereby the expression of multiple Sertoli cell genes, including MIS, would be compromised. The other two mechanisms, gene dosage and dominant negative effects, are summarized in the model presented in Fig. 6. Because the G35E mutation is on one allele, a gene dosage effect or haploinsufficiency (Fig. 6B) might result if the amount of functional SF-1 protein produced by a single wild-type allele is insufficient to produce adequate levels of MIS hormone required for Müllerian duct regression. Although gene dosage might have an important role, the biochemical properties of the SF-1 G35E mutant do not favor it as being the only mechanism involved. For example, the G35E mutation does not affect the nuclear localization and stability of the SF-1 protein (26Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Moreover, the DNA binding properties of the SF-1 G35E protein on the MIS SF-1 element are nearly identical to those of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1 and Ref. 29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On a transcriptional level, the SF-1 G35E mutant has also been reported to activate the MIS promoter with at least 50% of the activity of wild-type SF-1 protein (29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, if we assume the normal SF-1 allele accounts for 50% of the total MIS protein produced and the G35E allele accounts for 25% (50% functional protein of 50% protein made), then the level of functional MIS hormone in the G35E patient should have been sufficiently high enough (at least 75% of normal) to induce Müllerian duct regression. In fact, male SF-1+/- mice that only have one functional allele of SF-1 were shown to be phenotypically normal (23Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 25Sadovsky Y. Crawford P.A. Woodson K.G. Polish J.A. Clements M.A. Tourtellotte L.M. Simburger K. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10939-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, even low levels of MIS are sufficient for Müllerian duct regression and hence proper male sex differentiation (8Arango N.A. Lovell-Badge R. Behringer R.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, taken together, it is unlikely that haploinsufficiency would be the primary cause of insufficient MIS production in the SF-1 G35E patient. However, haploinsufficiency may explain other aspects of the phenotype such as adrenal malfunction because a similar, albeit less severe, phenotype was in fact reported in heterozygous SF-1+/- mice (40Bland M.L. Jamieson C.A. Akana S.F. Bornstein S.R. Eisenhofer G. Dallman M.F. Ingraham H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14488-14493Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another mechanism that might explain the more penetrant phenotype of the heterozygous G35E mutation is dominant negative activity associated with the mutated protein (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the SF-1 G35E mutant does not display dominant negative activity on the MIS promoter when coexpressed with its wild-type counterpart (29Ito M. Achermann J.C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31708-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, MIS promoter activity is not regulated by SF-1 alone but rather by a combination of transcriptional cooperations between SF-1 and other factors. Therefore, the G35E mutant could still act as a dominant negative by competing synergism between SF-1 and its interacting partners. Indeed, we have found this to be true for GATA-4; the G35E mutant not only failed to synergize with GATA-4, but it also repressed the GATA-4/SF-1 synergism on the MIS promoter. The inability of the SF-1 G35E mutant to synergize with GATA factors (Fig. 2) despite an apparently normal physical interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 4) remains unclear. This might be because of an unfavorable conformational change in either or both proteins that could affect co-activator recruitment. Nonetheless, an interaction between the SF-1 G35E and GATA-4 is essential for the mutant protein to act as a dominant negative competitor of GATA-4/SF-1 synergism on the MIS promoter (Fig. 6C). Therefore, our results favor this dominant negative mechanism where the end result would be very low MIS levels and consequently abnormal sex differentiation. Our data also underscore the importance of transcriptional cooperations in the regulation of tissue- and cell-specific gene expression. Interestingly, a link between failed transcriptional cooperations and human disease is not unprecedented. An example directly related to the present study is the role of Wilms' tumor (WT-1) gene mutations in the development of Denys-Drash syndrome, a human disease where affected individuals have a high incidence of urogenital defects including XY male pseudohermaphroditism (41Pelletier J. Bruening W. Kashtan C.E. Mauer S.M. Manivel J.C. Striegel J.E. Houghton D.C. Junien C. Habib R. Fouser L. Fine R.N. Silverman B.L. Haber D.A. Housman D. Cell. 1991; 67: 437-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In normal individuals, WT-1 interacts with SF-1 to up-regulate MIS expression. In Denys-Drash patients, however, the mutated WT-1 proteins fail to synergize with SF-1 despite an apparently normal direct protein-protein interaction (12Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that disruption of transcriptional cooperations involving GATA factors might also be linked to human disease. We thank Drs. Keith Parker and Eric Olson for generously providing the SF-1 and FOG-2 expression plasmids used in this study."

The EXTL genes have not been linked to hereditary multiple extoses but belong to the EXT family of proteins based on amino acid sequence similarity to EXT1 and EXT2. All three EXTL proteins express glycosyltransferase activities related to HS biosynthesis; however, their role in HS formation in vivo remains undefined (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J.

The mechanism of chain elongation in heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis involves the alternating transfer of GlcA and GlcNAc from their respective UDP-derivatives to the nonreducing end of the growing polymer. Although solubilized microsomal enzymes as well as purified EXT proteins can catalyze the transfer of single GlcA or GlcNAc residues to exogenous substrates in vitro, actual polymerization on exogenous substrates has not been demonstrated (15Lidholt K.

The previous results suggest that the biologically functional unit in HS polymerization is a complex containing EXT1 and EXT2 (18Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K.

We found that both EXT1 alone and the EXT1/2 complex were able to sequentially add GlcA and GlcNAc to 3H-labeled oligosaccharide substrates, albeit with apparently different kinetics. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Truncated forms of human EXT2 lacking the first N-terminal 46 amino acids were amplified by PCR using a human placenta cDNA as a template. Primers used for p3FLAGCMV9 (Sigma) were 5′-ATATGCGGCCGCTCCCCATTCTATCGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGGGATCCTAAGCTGCCAATGTTGGGGAA-3′ (reverse), and those for pSecTagC (Invitrogen) were 5′-GGCCAAGCTGGCCCCCCATTCTATCGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCTCTAGATAAGCTGCCAATGTTGGGGAAG-3′ (reverse). A truncated form of human EXT1 (amino acids 29–746) was amplified by PCR from a previously constructed plasmid (18Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), with primers 5′-ATATGCGGCCGCTAGGGCATCGAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCTGGATCCAAGTCGCTCAATGTCTCG-3 (reverse). All of the PCRs were carried out using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). PCR products were cloned in-frame either with the preprotrypsin leader sequence and the N-terminal 3-FLAG tag (p3FLAGCMV9) or with the Ig κ-chain leader sequence and a C-terminal Myc-His tag (pSecTagC). Expression of Truncated EXT Proteins—HEK 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Stable clones expressing p3FLAGCMV9 constructs were selected in 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate (Invitrogen). For co-expression of EXT1 and EXT2 (EXT1/2), one of the stable EXT1p3FLAGCMV9 clones was transfected with pSeqTagC EXT2, and double EXT1/2 transfectants were selected by addition of 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The stable clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg streptomycin sulfate/ml, 100 units penicillin G/ml, and 400 μg geneticin/ml or 400 μg geneticin/ml together with 200 μg/ml Zeocin. To isolate expressed proteins, the medium was changed to serum-free Optimem-1 with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium was collected after 48 h, and protein expression was monitored by Western blotting as described below. FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Met 3× FLAG-BAP; Sigma) was used to estimate the relative amount of purified enzymes. Recombinant proteins were captured on anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) during overnight incubation at 4 °C, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and used as the enzyme source in transferase and polymerase reactions. Analysis of Expressed Truncated EXT Proteins—The proteins present in the conditioned medium from HEK 293-transfected cells were precipitated with 11% trichloroacetic acid, separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The antibodies used were anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako), rabbit anti-Myc (kindly provided by E. Fries, Uppsala University) detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako), and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The membranes were analyzed for chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL Plus detection kit; Amersham Biosciences). For isoelectrofocusing and gel filtration analysis, conditioned medium was concentrated using Microcon YM-10 devices (Amicon) and then applied to a precast isoelectrofocusing gel, pI range 3–10 (Bio-Rad), or a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). Polymerization Reaction—Size-defined oligosaccharide acceptors were prepared from a purified capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K5, with the structure (GlcAβ1,4GlcNAcα1,4) n . The polysaccharide was partially N-deacetylated by incubation in 2 m NaOH (68 °C, 40 min) followed by deaminative cleavage (pH 3.9) (20Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The generated fragments were reduced with NaB3H4 to yield reducing terminal 3H-labeled 2,5-anhydromannitol (aManR) residues. Labeled oligosaccharides (GlcA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]n-[3H]aManR) were size-separated on a Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) column (1 × 200 cm) in 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Fractions corresponding to peaks of oligosaccharides ranging from tetra- to octadecasaccharides were pooled separately and lyophilized. Labeled [Glc-NAc-GlcA]5-[3H]aManR acceptor was prepared by digestion of GlcA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]5-[3H]aManR with β-glucuronidase (Sigma) as described below. Agarose-bound proteins were incubated in 20 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 16 mm unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc, 16 mm unlabeled UDP-GlcA, and 17 μm3H-end-labeled K5 oligosaccharide substrate. Reaction mixtures (100–200 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then the reactions were stopped by precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation the supernatants were neutralized with NaOH and again centrifuged, and the reaction products present in the supernatants were separated on Bio Gel P10 columns. Glycosyltransferase Assays—GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities were measured essentially as described (18Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating anti-FLAG agarose-bound enzyme protein preparations with 0.125 μCi of 14C-labeled UDP sugars (62.5 μCi/μmol; prepared by mixing radiolabeled and unlabeled UDP sugars) and 45 μg of oligosaccharide acceptor at 37 °C for 2 h. Oligosaccharide acceptors were generated from K5 polysaccharide, as described (22Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Labeled products were isolated by gel chromatography and quantified by scintillation counting. Enzymatic Digestions—Digestion with heparitinase I (4.2.2.8; Seikagaku Corporation) was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Purified polymerization products were incubated with α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Oxford GlycoSciences) and/or β-d-glucuronidase in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The samples were incubated for ∼16 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. The EXT proteins are Golgi transmembrane type II proteins with an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large luminal catalytic domain. Thus the enzymes are believed to execute their function in a membrane bound state in vivo. However, because it has previously been shown that truncated soluble recombinant EXT proteins also are enzymatically active (18Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we expressed soluble forms of the EXT proteins to facilitate their purification. We stably transfected HEK 293 cells with N-terminally FLAG-tagged human EXT1 and EXT2 constructs lacking the transmembrane domains, yielding soluble fusion proteins that were released into the culture medium (EXT1 and EXT2; Fig. 1). For co-expression of EXT1 and EXT2, cells expressing FLAG-tagged EXT1 were stably transfected with a C-terminally Myc-His-tagged EXT2 construct (EXT1/2 in Fig. 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). To confirm the association of EXT1 and EXT2 into a co-secreted FLAG-EXT1/Myc-His-EXT2 complex, following co-expression, the complex was affinity adsorbed from medium onto anti-FLAG agarose and visualized by Western blotting with anti-His antibodies. Myc-His-tagged EXT2 was readily detected in the medium of the FLAG-EXT1/Myc-His-EXT2 co-expressing cells, indicating that EXT1 and EXT2 formed a secreted heterocomplex (EXT1/2; Fig. 1) that could be captured on anti-FLAG agarose (data not shown, but see below). Soluble affinity-tagged EXT proteins, expressed separately or co-secreted, were affinity captured on anti-FLAG agarose beads, and the enzyme-containing beads were used as enzyme source. In Vitro Polymerization of Heparan Sulfate Backbone—For polymerization we used small amounts of 3H-end-labeled size-defined K5 oligosaccharides as substrates and an excess of unlabeled nucleotide sugar precursors, in a molar ratio of 1:1000 (K5/UDP sugars). The substrates used were a 3H-labeled 10-mer containing a nonreducing terminal GlcA as acceptor and a 3H-labeled 11-mer containing a nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residue (GlcA-[GlcNAc-GlcA]4-[3H]aManR and [GlcNAc-GlcA]5-[3H]aManR, respectively; see “Experimental Procedures”). In vitro chain elongation of the 10-mer proceeds by the initial addition of a GlcNAc residue, followed by alternating addition of GlcA and GlcNAc residues to the nonreducing end of the acceptor. Accordingly, chain elongation of an 11-mer starts by the addition of a GlcA unit followed by the sequential addition of GlcNAc and GlcA units. Consequently, polymerization products with nonreducing end GlcNAc residues are odd-numbered, and those ending with GlcA units are even-numbered. The polymerization products formed in incubations of recombinant EXT proteins with the 10-mer are shown in Fig. 2A. Incubations with EXT1 resulted in extensive polymerization generating products containing mostly 20 or more sugar units. The reaction products generated with the EXT1/2 complex as a catalyst were shorter and contained distinct even-numbered products, implying a more efficient incorporation of GlcA than of GlcNAc units. When instead an 11-mer, containing a nonreducing terminal GlcNAc, was used as a substrate, both EXT1 and the EXT1/2 complex likewise elongated the oligosaccharide, although the proportion of smaller reaction products was higher than seen with the 10-mer (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, EXT1/2 again mostly generated even-numbered oligosaccharides, suggesting that one GlcA unit was efficiently added to the 11-mer, and thereafter chain elongation continued in a similar manner as in Fig. 2A. EXT1, on the other hand, produced both even- and odd-numbered products (Fig. 3A). In contrast to EXT1 and EXT1/2, no significant chain elongation was observed in incubations with EXT2. Nevertheless, EXT2 was able to catalyze the addition of a single GlcA to the 11-mer, as indicated by the small shoulder in Fig. 2B. No chain elongation was observed after incubation with mock beads (i.e. anti-FLAG agarose beads reacted with the medium from vector-transfected cells).Fig. 3Restricted polymerization by recombinant EXT1 and EXT1/2 complex. Affinity-purified EXT1 (A) and EXT1/2 (B) were incubated for 24 h with a 3H-reducing end-labeled 10-mer acceptor substrate and a mixture of unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The products were fractionated by gel chromatography on Bio Gel P-10 eluted with 0.5 m NH4HCO3 as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The fractions corresponding to V 0 (<30-mers) and 15- and 14-mers were pooled as indicated by the horizontal bars, lyophilized, and analyzed further. The numbers above the various peaks indicate even-numbered oligosaccharide units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The different modes of polymerization kinetics are more evident in Fig. 3 where the polymerization reactions were less extensive than in Fig. 2. EXT1 clearly generated even- and odd-numbered products in fairly similar proportions, indicating that GlcNAc and GlcA residues were incorporated with similar efficiency. The elution profile of the EXT1/2 complexcatalyzed polymerization again contained polymers of largely even-numbered oligosaccharides. We were intrigued by the fact that EXT2 appeared to modify the catalytic properties of EXT1. To determine whether the observed activity required complex formation of EXT1 and EXT2, singly expressed EXT1 and EXT2 were combined in equal amounts, adsorbed to anti-FLAG agarose, and incubated with the 10-mer and the 11-mer. The resultant gel chromatography patterns resembled that of EXT1 alone, indicating that the catalytic activity of EXT1/2 was due to complex formation of the two proteins (not shown). Analysis of Reaction Products—The nature of the polymerization products was determined by enzymatic digestions. The 14-mer, 15-mer, and V 0 material obtained after incubation of the 10-mer with EXT1 and the V 0 material from incubations of the 10-mer with EXT1/2 were pooled as indicated in Fig. 3. Each of the reaction products were digested with β-glucuronidase alone or in combination with α-N-acetylglucosaminidase and analyzed by gel chromatography on Superdex 30 (Fig. 4). All of the reaction products were digested to monosaccharide ([3H]aManR) or small oligosaccharides by the mixed exoglycosidases, indicating that they were composed of alternating GlcA-GlcNAc units with the predicted linkage configurations (Fig. 4, A and C). Digestion with β-glucuronidase alone converted the 14-mer into a 13-mer but did not change the elution position of the 15-mer, further demonstrating that the incorporated sugars were transferred to the nonreducing end of the expected acceptor structure (Fig. 4, A and B). Finally, all of the products were completely degraded to disaccharides by heparitinase I (data not shown). Glycosyltransferase Activities of Expressed EXT Proteins— We wanted to examine whether the elution patterns shown in Figs. 2 and 3 related to the in vitro transferase activities (single sugar transfer reactions performed in the presence of only one of the two donor nucleotide substrates). FLAG affinity-purified EXT proteins were analyzed for GlcA and GlcNAc transferase activities, with radiolabeled UDP-GlcA and a GlcNAc[GlcA-GlcNAc] n oligosaccharide acceptor (measuring GlcA transferase activity) or with radiolabeled UDP-GlcNAc and a [GlcA-GlcNAc] n acceptor (measuring GlcNAc transferase activity) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results clearly demonstrated both transferase activities for EXT1 and EXT1/2, whereas only low activities were detected with EXT2 (Fig. 5). The GlcA transferase activity of EXT2 was low but readily detected, whereas the GlcNAc transferase activity was even lower and in some preparations virtually absent. Similar to the polymerization reaction, complex formation of EXT1 and EXT2 influenced the transferase activities. In particular, the GlcNAc transferase activity of EXT1/2 was lower in relation to the GlcA transferase activity, compared with EXT1 alone. Homo- and Heterooligomeric Complex Formation of Expressed EXT Proteins—The available information suggests that EXT1 and EXT2 form both homooligomeric and heterooligomeric complexes (18Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19McCormick C. Duncan G.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether, in our system, the secreted truncated proteins oligomerized, conditioned media from EXT1, EXT2, and EXT1/2 overexpressing cells were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose-12 column. Concentrated media from FLAG-EXT1, FLAG-EXT2, or FLAG-EXT1/Myc-His-EXT2 (Fig. 1) expressing cells were applied to the column, and individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies. EXT2 eluted in the position of a monomeric protein (80 kDa), whereas both EXT1 and EXT1/2 eluted as dimers (160 kDa) (Fig. 6). Identical fractions from the EXT1/2 chromatogram reacted with both anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies, showing that co-expression of EXT1 (FLAG) and EXT2 (Myc-His) yielded a heterocomplex. Interactions between the expressed and endogenous EXT proteins could conceivably also affect analyses of affinity-purified recombinant proteins. We lack specific antibodies against the EXT proteins; therefore the presence of endogenous EXT protein in complex with expressed proteins was examined by isoelectrofocusing followed by immunoblotting. Bands corresponding to the theoretically predicted isoelectric point (pI) for EXT1, EXT2, and EXT1/2, pI 9, 6, and 7.5, respectively, were detected for the respective expressed proteins (data not shown). The absence of any detectable bands corresponding to pI 7.5 in the conditioned medium of EXT1 or EXT2 transfected cells indicated that the majority of the expressed recombinant EXT1 and EXT2 proteins do not form heterooligomeric complexes with endogenous EXT proteins. EXT1 and EXT2 are both GlcA/GlcNAc transferases, and evidence suggests that EXT1 and EXT2 interact to form the biologically active HS polymerase (19McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Lack of either EXT1 or EXT2 disrupts HS synthesis, indicating that both proteins are required for proper polymerization (9Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L.E. Dyer A.P. Tufaro F. Nat.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). From the results presented in this study, it is apparent that EXT1 alone, as well as EXT1/2, can catalyze the in vitro polymerization of the HS backbone structure on an oligosaccharide primer. No additional factors such as membrane structures, lipids, or other proteins, seem to be required for the in vitro polymerization reaction. Both EXT1 and EXT1/2 catalyzed the formation of intermediate sized and long chains, but the kinetics of the EXT1-catalyzed polymerization reaction appears to be different from that of EXT1/2. EXT1 alone seemed to catalyze the incorporation of GlcNAc and GlcA residues with similar efficiency. When, on the other hand, the EXT1/2 complex catalyzed polymerization, GlcA residues appeared to be more efficiently incorporated than GlcNAc units. When a single sugar nucleotide (UDP-GlcA or UDP-GlcNAc) was used as a sugar donor in the transferase assays, complex formation of EXT1 and EXT2 resulted in less efficient transfer of GlcNAc as compared with EXT1 alone (Fig. 5). The most reasonable explanation for the difference in mode of polymerization, as indicated by the elution profiles in Figs. 2 and 3, is that the in vitro polymerization process reflects the single sugar transferase activities and that complex formation changed the catalysis. The effect of EXT2 on EXT1 activity is intriguing. EXT2 appeared to interfere with the addition of GlcNAc such that the EXT1/2 complex polymerized less efficiently than EXT1 alone. Our data indicate that EXT2 harbors low GlcA transferase activity but no readily detected GlcNac transferase activity. Both EXT1 and EXT2 have been reported to form homodi/oligomers (19McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Kobayashi S. Morimoto K. Shimizu T. Takahashi M. Kurosawa H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is possible that the EXT proteins need to di/oligomerize to catalyze the polymerization reaction. In our study, EXT2 did not seem to dimerize, and we cannot exclude the possibility that this is the reason for the observed low transferase activity. On the other hand, it is tempting to speculate that EXT2 is not involved in the actual elongation of the HS backbone but serves as a chaperon and delivers EXT1 to the Golgi apparatus. So far no additional GlcA transferases involved in actual HS chain elongation are known. Both EXTL1 and EXTL3 have been shown to be able to transfer GlcNAc (but not GlcA) to K5 oligosaccharide acceptors and are likely to be involved in HS biosynthesis (14Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Of the two, only EXTL3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (27Wise C.A. Clines G.A. Massa H. Trask B.J. Lovett M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Saito T. Seki N. Yamauchi M. Tsuji S. Hayashi A. Kozuma S. Hori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and therefore more likely to be part of a universal HS chain-elongating complex. The more restricted mRNA expression of EXTL1 may indicate a more specialized role for this enzyme. Our present findings raise a number of questions. By what mechanism does the interaction between EXT1 and EXT2 promote enzyme translocation and function? It is noted that EXT1 transfected into EXT1-deficient mutant l-cells remained localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (24McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L.E. Dyer A.P. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), whereas HS chain generation is believed to take place in the Golgi (5Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 8Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). How does the EXT proteins relate to the proteoglycan core protein and the other enzymes required for HS assembly? The exact coupling between polysaccharide chain elongation and modification has not yet been defined, but previous studies have shown that heparin/HS chain elongation is stimulated by concomitant N-sulfation of the product (29Lidholt K. Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Pikas D.S. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4552-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, how does tumor formation caused by defective EXT proteins relate to HS biosynthesis? These and similar problems can hopefully be approached after a more detailed analysis, at the molecular and cellular levels, of the EXT proteins and their various interactions. In particular, it would be of interest to assess the effect of N-sulfation and the role of EXTL proteins on the in vitro polymerization process. We thank Dr. Ulf Lindahl and Krzysztof Wicher for helpful suggestions and critical reading of the manuscript and Helena Grundberg for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2020848561,"The 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenation pathway in certain Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas bacterial species contains three enzymes: a ligase, a dehalogenase, and a thioesterase. Here we describe the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain SU. The tetrameric enzyme is a dimer of dimers with each subunit adopting the so-called “hot dog fold” composed of six strands of anti-parallel β-sheet flanked on one side by a rather long α-helix. The dimers come together to form the tetramer with their α-helices facing outwards. This quaternary structure is in sharp contrast to that previously observed for the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Pseudomonas species strain CBS-3, whereby the dimers forming the tetramer pack with their α-helices projecting toward the interfacial region. In the Arthrobacter thioesterase, each of the four active sites is formed by three of the subunits of the tetramer. On the basis of both structural and kinetic data, it appears that Glu73 is the active site base in the Arthrobacter thioesterase. Remarkably, this residue is located on the opposite side of the substrate-binding pocket compared with that observed for the Pseudomonas enzyme. Although these two bacterial thioesterases demonstrate equivalent catalytic efficiencies, substrate specificities, and metabolic functions, their quaternary structures, CoA-binding sites, and catalytic platforms are decidedly different.

This quaternary structure is in sharp contrast to that previously observed for the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Pseudomonas species strain CBS-3, whereby the dimers forming the tetramer pack with their α-helices projecting toward the interfacial region. In the Arthrobacter thioesterase, each of the four active sites is formed by three of the subunits of the tetramer. On the basis of both structural and kinetic data, it appears that Glu73 is the active site base in the Arthrobacter thioesterase. Remarkably, this residue is located on the opposite side of the substrate-binding pocket compared with that observed for the Pseudomonas enzyme. Although these two bacterial thioesterases demonstrate equivalent catalytic efficiencies, substrate specificities, and metabolic functions, their quaternary structures, CoA-binding sites, and catalytic platforms are decidedly different. During the last century, large quantities of 4-chlorobenzoate or related herbicides and polychlorinated biphenyl pesticides were released into the environment because of commercial production and careless waste disposal (1Cork D.J. Krueger J.P. Adv. App. Microbiol. 1991; 36: 1-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Haggblom M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 9: 29-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Higson F.K. Adv. Appl.

Strikingly, a variety of soil-dwelling bacteria capable of employing 4-chlorobenzoate as their principal source of carbon have been discovered in richly contaminated areas (5Dunaway-Mariano D.

In these microorganisms, 4-chlorobenzoate is first converted to 4-hydroxybenzoate, which is subsequently metabolized via the ortho- or meta-cleavage pathways (5Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenation pathway, as outlined in Scheme 1, consists of three reaction steps catalyzed by 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase, 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase, and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase (8Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Babbitt P.C. Charest H. Sylvestre M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Science. 1991; 253: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Genes encoding these enzymes are organized within an operon that is under the regulatory control of 4-chlorobenzoate (5Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In some bacteria, the gene cluster is located within the chromosomal DNA (12Savard P. Peloquin L. Sylvestre M. J.

Gartemann K.-H. Eichenluab R. Dunaway-Mariano D. Appl. Envir. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 2707-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the primary structural level, the amino acid sequence identity between paired Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas ligases is ∼38%, whereas that between paired dehalogenases is ∼50%. Remarkably, however, there is no significant amino acid sequence identity shared between the thioesterases from these species.The three-dimensional structure of the thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 was solved several years ago in this laboratory and was shown to have a “hot dog fold” motif (18Benning M.M.

This type of molecular architecture was first observed in the x-ray structure of β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from Escherichia coli (20Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and has since been found in the (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase from Aeromonas caviae (21Hisano T.

The structures of these enzymes are dominated by a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet that cradles a rather long α-helix of approximately five turns.Here we report a high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of the Arthrobacter sp. strain SU 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase complexed with its products (4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA) or with the substrate analogs, 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA (Scheme 2).

The conditions were tested with both the apo enzyme and that complexed with 1 mm 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA. The protein solution, at a concentration of 18 mg/ml, contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm 1,4-dithio-d,l-threitol. The best crystals were observed growing at room temperature from poly(ethylene glycol) 3400 at pH 7.0 in the presence of 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA. Large single crystals were subsequently obtained via hanging drops with precipitant solutions containing 17–20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 100 mm MOPS 1The abbreviation used is: MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. (pH 7.0), and 200 mm LiCl. The crystals achieved maximum dimensions of 0.7 mm × 0.7 mm × 0.3 mm in ∼1–2 weeks. They belonged to the trigonal space group P3221 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 113.2 Å and c = 62.5 Å and contained one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The crystals of the enzyme complexed with either 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA were prepared in a similar manner. It was never possible to grow crystals of the apo enzyme in a form suitable for a high resolution x-ray analysis.Structural Analysis of the Thioesterase/4-Hydroxyphenacyl-CoA Complex—An initial x-ray data set was collected to 2.6 Å resolution at 4 °C with a Bruker HISTAR area detector system equipped with Supper long mirrors. The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with XDS (23Kabsch W. J. Appl.

The x-ray data (including Friedel mates) were collected to 2.6 Å. The R-factor between the native and mercury derivative x-ray data sets was 26.8% (where R = Σ|F N - F h|/Σ|F N| × 100, F N is the native structure factor amplitude and F h is the heavy-atom derivative structure factor amplitude). Four heavy atom-binding sites were determined with CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 5: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). The positions, occupancies, and temperature factors for these sites were refined with CNS, yielding an overall figure of merit of 0.44 and a phasing power of 1.58. Protein phases were calculated to 2.6 Å resolution with CNS and improved by the method of solvent flipping (as implemented in CNS) to yield a figure of merit of 0.94. Greater than 95% of the residues were built into the solvent flattened electron density map with the graphics software TURBO (26Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 4: 66-67Google Scholar). This “partial” model was subsequently refined via least squares with the program package TnT (27Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density maps calculated with coefficients of the form (2F o - F c)or(F o - F c) allowed for the placement of the remainder of the amino acid residues and the 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA ligand.High Resolution X-ray Data Collection and Least Squares Refinement—Thioesterase crystals were harvested from hanging drop experiments and equilibrated in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 150 mm KCl, 100 mm LiCl, 1 mm 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA, and 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). They were then serially transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 200 mm KCl, 250 mm LiCl, 15% ethylene glycol, 1 mm 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA, and 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). The crystals were suspended in a loop of 20-μm nylon and flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas. Unit cell dimensions changed to a = b = 112.5 Å and c = 60.6 Å upon cooling to 120 K. A native x-ray data set was collected to 1.6 Å resolution, processed with SAINT (Bruker AXS, Inc.), and scaled as previously described. This structure was solved via molecular replacement with the program AMORE (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The complex of the enzyme with bound products was prepared by crystallizing the enzyme in the presence of its substrate, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA that was hydrolyzed to 4-hydroxybenzoate (or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) and CoA. For the sake of simplicity, the ligand will be referred to as 4-hydroxybenzoate, but this does not imply that its protonation state is known. All of the x-ray data for these two complexes were collected in a manner identical to that employed for the thioesterase/4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA complex as described above. Relevant x-ray data collection and least squares refinement statistics are given in Tables I and II, respectively. In all three complexes, the first 10 and 11 residues were disordered in subunits I and II, respectively. Apart from these disordered N-terminal residues, the electron densities corresponding to both polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit were continuous throughout the map. The only significant outlier in the Ramachandran plot was Asp39 (in both subunits). This residue is located ∼14 Å from the active site. The dihedral angles adopted by Asp39 produce a bulge in the first β-strand of the sheet. All of the figures were prepared with the software package MOLSCRIPT (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).Ligand Binding—The initial velocity of the thioesterase catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA was measured by monitoring the decrease in solution absorption at 300 nm resulting from the disappearance of reactant (Δϵ = 11.8 mm-1·cm-1). The reactions were carried out in 50 mm K+-HEPES (pH 7.5, 25 °C) that contained 0.003 μm thioesterase, varying concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (1–10 μm) and varying concentrations of 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA (0.00925, 0.00185, and 0.037 μm) or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA (0.38, 0.76, 1.9, and 3.8 μm). The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the computer program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, PA). V=Vmax[S]/[Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]](Eq. 1) where V = initial velocity, V max = maximum velocity, [S] = substrate concentration, K m = Michaelis constant, [I] = inhibitor concentration, and K i = the inhibition constant.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInhibitor Binding—The binding constants of the substrate analogs were evaluated by measuring their competitive inhibition constants. Both analogs displayed linear competitive inhibition versus 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA. The K i of 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA was 0.6 ± 0.1 μm, and the K i of 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA was 0.003 ± 0.0003 μm. These results indicate that these ligands bind tightly to the substrate-binding site.Overall Structure of the Thioesterase/Product Complex—All of the crystals employed in this investigation contained two subunits/asymmetric unit. For the sake of simplicity, the following discussions will refer only to Subunit II of the x-ray coordinate file unless otherwise indicated. A ribbon representation of the monomer with the bound products, 4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA, is depicted in Fig. 1. The monomer contains 151 amino acid residues, and its topology, referred to as the hot dog fold, is dominated by a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet formed by Val37–Met41, Ala46–Val52, Met89–Phe100, His108–Ala118, Trp123–Arg130, and Arg135–Arg149. These β-strands are labeled A–F in Fig. 1. Four of the six β-strands (A, C, D, and F) contain β-bulges at Asp39 (ϕ = -101°, Ψ = -73°), Gln94 (ϕ = -115°, Ψ = -30°), Ile116 (ϕ = -113°, Ψ = -20°), and Cys137 (ϕ = -94°, Ψ = -29°), respectively. In addition to the six β-strands, there are two α-helices delineated by Leu30–Val34 and Gly65–Val84, six Type I turns, and one Type III turn. Nearly 80% of the amino acid residues lie within classical secondary structural elements. The monomer is compact with overall dimensions of ∼38 Å × 49 Å × 35 Å.Fig. 1Ribbon representation of the Arthrobacter thioesterase monomer. The bound ligands, 4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA, are shown in ball-and-stick representations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In that the asymmetric unit contained only two subunits, ultracentrifugation experiments were subsequently performed to define the quaternary structure of the Arthrobacter thioesterase. These experiments were consistent with a tetrameric quaternary structure. The tetramer thus packed in the crystalline lattice with one of its 2-fold rotational axes coincident to a crystallographic dyad. Shown in Fig. 2a is a ribbon representation of the two monomers contained within the asymmetric unit. The tetrameric form of the enzyme, as depicted in Fig. 2b, was generated by rotation of the dimer in the asymmetric unit about the crystallographic 2-fold rotational axis. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (a and b), the quaternary structure of the enzyme can be aptly described as a dimer of dimers with overall dimensions of ∼72 Å × 70 Å × 52 Å.Fig. 2Quaternary structure of the Arthrobacter thioesterase. The quaternary structure of the enzyme can be aptly described as a dimer of dimer. The dimer is shown in panel a with the two separate subunits displayed in blue and green. The 4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA moieties are drawn in ball-and-stick representations with pink- and yellow-filled bonds, respectively. The complete tetramer is depicted in panel b with the long α-helices, one per subunit, displayed as cylinders. Key amino acid residues involved in dimer-dimer interactions are shown in ball-and-stick representations with green-filled bonds. For comparison purposes, the Pseudomonas thioesterase tetramer, complexed with 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, is presented in panel c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The subunit-subunit interface of the dimer is quite extensive with a total buried surface area of ∼3100 Å 2I. Rayment and G. Wesenberg, unpublished results. as calculated according to the method of Lee and Richards (30Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar). There are three major regions of subunit-subunit interactions between the two monomers. These intermolecular contacts are formed by Tyr22–Val34 (α-helix), Asp54–Met74 (α-helix), and Gly93–Pro103 (β-strand C) in one subunit and the symmetry-related residues in the second monomer. Indeed, the six-stranded sheets in each monomer come together, through β-strands C, to form a 12-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet in the dimer. The active sites are wedged between the two subunits of the dimer and are separated by ∼24 Å (Fig. 2a). The two major α-helices of the dimer run anti-parallel to one another.The 12-stranded β-sheet of one dimer abuts the β-sheet motif in the second dimer to form the tetramer (Fig. 2b). This packing arrangement is reminiscent to that observed for the dimeric thioesterase II from E. coli (31Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this enzyme, each monomer contains two hot dog folds referred to as the “double hot dog.” The subunit-subunit interface for the E. coli thioesterase II is likewise built with the β-sheets back to back and the major α-helices facing outwards.Approximately 2125 Å 2I. Rayment and G. Wesenberg, unpublished results. of surface area is buried per monomer upon tetramer formation in the Arthrobacter thioesterase. The dimer-dimer interface is lined with water molecules and various side chains from each subunit including His97, Phe101, His117, and Phe124. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the histidines at position 97 form a hydrogen bonding ring at the middle of the dimer-dimer interface. The pyrophosphate groups of the CoA moieties project into this interface. Ser120 and Thr121, which lie in a Type I turn defined by Gly119–Thr122, provide hydrogen bonds to the phosphoryl oxygens of the CoA. Specifically, Oγ and the peptidic NH group of Ser120 lie within hydrogen bonding distance to the two α-phosphoryl oxygens, respectively, whereas Oγ and the peptidic NH group of Thr121 are situated within ∼2.5 Å of one of the β-phosphoryl oxygens. Each of the binding sites for CoA is thus formed by three of the four subunits comprising the tetramer.Active Site with Bound Products, 4-Hydroxybenzoate and CoA—As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the 4-hydroxybenzoate is primarily wedged between the two subunits of the dimer pair in the tetramer and specifically between the two major α-helices. A close-up view of the active site is presented in Fig. 3. Key side chains involved in binding the 4-hydroxybenzoate moiety to the protein include Glu73, Thr77, and Glu78 from Subunit II. In addition, the 4-hydroxyl group lies within hydrogen bonding distance to an ordered water molecule, whereas one of the carboxylate oxygens hydrogen bonds to the peptidic NH group of Gly65 in Subunit I. One of the carboxylate oxygens of the 4-hydroxybenzoate ligand is positioned within 2.8 Å of the sulfhydryl group of CoA, indicating that the substrate has indeed been hydrolyzed. The CoA binds to the protein in a quite curved conformation with its ribose adopting the C3′-endo conformation. Only solvent molecules and backbone carbonyl or peptidic NH groups lie within hydrogen bonding distance to the oxygens and nitrogens of the CoA β-mercaptoethylamine and pantothenate units. The pyrophosphate group oxygens of CoA, however, form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Ser120 and Thr121 situated in the third subunit of the tetramer. Two arginine residues, 102 from Subunit I and 150 from Subunit II, point toward the 3′-phosphate group of the CoA ribose. Additionally, the side chain of Arg150 (Subunit II) runs nearly parallel to the plane of the adenine ring. The amino group at position 6 of the adenine ring forms hydrogen bonds with a water molecule and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro148 from Subunit II.Fig. 3The Arthrobacter thioesterase active site with bound hydrolysis products. Those residues located within ∼3.5 Å of the 4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA molecule are shown. The products are highlighted in yellow-filled bonds. Ordered water molecules are represented by the red spheres. The asterisks indicate those amino acid residues belonging to Subunit II. Ser120 and Thr121, highlighted in pink-filled bonds, belong to Subunit III of the tetramer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structure of the Arthrobacter Thioesterase Complexed with Either 4-Hydroxyphenacyl-CoA or 4-Hydroxybenzyl-CoA—The binding of either 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA within the thioesterase active site resulted in little perturbation of the polypeptide chain backbone compared with that were observed with bound products. Indeed, the α-carbons for these two complexes both superimpose onto the protein/product complex with a root mean square deviation of 0.17 Å. For all atoms, the three models presented here superimpose upon one another with typical root mean square deviations of 0.45 Å or less.

Bone marrow transplantation in mice was used to assess the contribution of immune cells to the expression of UCP2 in basal condition and during inflammation. Immune cells accounted for the total amount of UCP2 expression in the spleen, one-third of its expression in the lung, and did not participate in its expression in the intestine. LPS injection stimulated UCP2 expression in lung, spleen, and intestine in both immune and non-immune cells. Successive injections of LPS and dexamethasone or N-acetyl-cysteine prevented the induction of UCP2 in all three tissues, suggesting that oxygen free radical generation plays a role in UCP2 regulation. Finally, both previous studies and our data show that there is down-regulation of UCP2 in immune cells during their activation in the early stages of the LPS response followed by an up-regulation in UCP2 during the later stages to protect all cells against oxidative stress.

Studies on Ucp2 -/- mice revealed two intriguing phenotypes (for review, see Ref. 2Alves-Guerra M.C. Pecqueur C. Shaw A. Couplan E. Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B.

Macrophages isolated from Ucp2 -/- mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and had a higher toxoplasmacidal activity compared with wild-type mice (4Arsenijevic D.

LDL R -/- mice, which are susceptible to atherosclerosis when fed an atherogenic diet, were transplanted with bone marrow cells from either Ucp2 -/- or Ucp2 +/+ littermate mice. In this mouse model of atherosclerosis, the lack of UCP2 accelerated the development of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, showing a protective role for UCP2 in atherosclerosis (5Blanc J.

Another approach to understanding the physiological roles of UCP2 has been to study the expression of the protein in wild-type mice. The detection of UCP2 protein is difficult for two main reasons. First, UCP2 is at least 160-fold less abundant in spleen mitochondria than UCP1 is in brown adipose tissue. Second, most of the anti-peptide antibodies cross-react with other mitochondrial carriers and, therefore, are misleading. Nevertheless, with the help of the Ucp2 -/- mice as negative controls, a highly sensitive anti-UCP2 polyclonal antibody suitable for in vivo detection of UCP2 has been characterized. UCP2 was found to be expressed in spleen, lung, intestine, and, at lower levels, in white adipose tissue (18Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D.

Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), we set out to determine the precise contribution of immune cells in the expression of UCP2. In the absence of antibodies suitable for in situ detection of UCP2, bone marrow transplantation between Ucp2 -/- and Ucp2 +/+ mice was performed. Levels of UCP2 in all groups of mice were assessed at basal conditions after LPS treatment. To provoke liver injury, mice were also fed an atherogenic diet. Finally, we investigated the effects of N-acetyl-cysteine and dexamethasone on the expression of UCP2 in the LPS model. Animals and Treatments—Studies on mice were performed in agreement with the institutional CNRS guidelines defined by the European Community guiding principles and by the French decree No. 87/848 of October 19, 1987. Authorization to perform animal experiments was given by the French Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (permit A92580 was issued February 2, 1994 and 92-148 was issued May 14, 2002). All mice were 7-10 weeks old. Ucp2 -/- mice have been described previously. The mice were transferred onto a C57BL/6J genetic background (99.2%). C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Elevage Janvier (Orleans, France). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with various concentrations of LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5 (Sigma) and left with free access to food and water. Rectal temperature was measured with a thermocouple probe thermometer (CHY 508BR, Bioseb, Chaville, France). Mice were killed 14 h after injection. Atherogenic diet was purchased from UAR (Epinay sur Orge, France) and consisted of an A03 diet complete with 15% cocoa butter, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate. Medullar aplasia was induced by 9.5 Gy total body irradiation. Mice were injected intravenously under anesthesia with bone marrow cells (1.2 × 106) extracted from the femur and tibia of either Ucp2 +/+ or Ucp2 -/- mice. The Ucp2 +/+ mice that received bone marrow from Ucp2 -/- mice were named Ucp2 +/+tKO, and the Ucp2 -/- mice that received bone marrow from Ucp2 +/+ were named Ucp2 -/-tWT. Macrophage engraftment of hemapoietic tissues after bone marrow transplantation requires one month, whereas the engraftment of Kuppfer cells in liver or of resident lung macrophages requires 3-6 months (19Kennedy D.W. Abkowitz J.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakata K. Gotoh H. Watanabe J. Uetake T. Komuro I. Yuasa K. Watanabe S. Ieki R. Sakamaki H. Akiyama H. Kudoh S. Naitoh M.

Therefore, transplanted mice were allowed to recover for 4 months to ensure that the engraftment of resident macrophages was close to completion. Transplanted mice were either fed an atherogenic diet for 12 additional weeks or treated with LPS. Morphometric Analyses—The aortic sinus and aorta of the mice were frozen. Serial sections of the aortic sinus were assayed for lipid deposition with oil red O. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (21Mallat Z. Silvestre J.S. Le Ricousse-Roussanne S. Lecomte-Raclet L. Corbaz A. Clergue M. Duriez M. Barateau V. Akira S. Tedgui A. Tobelem G. Chvatchko Y. Levy B.I. Circ.

Biochemical Methods: Isolation of Mitochondria and Western Blot Analysis—All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Fresh tissues were minced in TES buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml bestatin, 50 μg/ml sodium-tosyl-phechloromethyl ketone, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. Minced tissue was carefully disrupted in a Thomas' potter at low speed rotation. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by two successive centrifugations of the homogenate at 750 × g for 10 min. Mitochondria were collected after centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and protein content was assayed using a bicinchoninic acid kit (Sigma). The anti-UCP2 antibody (hUCP2-605) and the Western blotting conditions have been described previously (18Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D.

Anti-cytochrome c oxydase subunit I (COX I), monoclonal antibody (1D6), and anti-mitochondrial porin monoclonal antibody (20B12) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands) and used at 0.5 μg/ml. Direct recording of the chemiluminescence was performed with the charge-coupled device camera of the GeneGnome instrument, and quantification was achieved using GeneSnap software (Syngene, Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by using a one-way analysis of variance. In the figures, the following correspondences may be found: *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; and ***, p ≤ 0.001. p ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. LPS Serotype 055:B5 Induces UCP2 in Multiple Organs—Fig. 1 shows the induction of UCP2 protein 14 h after LPS injection. In contrast to the LPS serotype 0111:B4 used in our previous study (18Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), the LPS serotype 055:B5 increased UCP2 not only in lung but also in spleen and duodenum (Fig. 1A). At an LPS concentration of 5 mg/kg, UCP2 levels increased 2.7-fold in spleen (p ≤ 0.001). UCP2 levels in the lung and duodenum were increased 2.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively, at an LPS concentration of 10 mg/kg; however, these levels of expression were consistently less than those seen in the spleen (Fig. 1B), which is the predominant organ of UCP2 expression in the conditions examined. Given the importance of the liver in the metabolic response to endotoxin and previous results obtained by Faggioni et al. (22Faggioni R. Shigenaga J. Moser A. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Cortez-Pinto et al. (23Cortez-Pinto H. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Costa S. Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Bagby G. Diehl A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we examined the induction of UCP2 in liver by LPS treatment. At a high concentration of this LPS serotype (10 mg/kg), UCP2 increased to a hardly detectable level by our antibody and reached 25% of the basal level of UCP2 in lung (Fig. 2A). The protein band detected below UCP2 is still present in liver mitochondria from Ucp2 -/- (Fig. 2B, lane 4) and is, therefore, not UCP2.Fig. 2Induction of UCP2 in liver mitochondria upon LPS treatment or atherogenic diet. Ucp2 +/+ mice were irradiated and transplanted with bone marrow from Ucp2 -/- littermate mice, whereas Ucp2 -/- mice were transplanted with bone marrow from Ucp2 +/+ littermate mice. Four months after transplantation, Ucp2 +/+ mice, Ucp2 -/- mice, Ucp2 +/+tWT-transplanted mice, and Ucp2 +/+tKO-transplanted mice were subjected to LPS injection or to an atherogenic diet.

Biophys. 2000; 378: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In these animal models, liver inflammation can occur, and it is possible, therefore, that the expression of UCP2 observed is due to resident or infiltrating macrophages. To test this hypothesis, bone marrow transplantation was performed. Ucp2 +/+ mice, Ucp2 -/- mice, Ucp2 +/+tWT-transplanted mice, and Ucp2 +/+tKO-transplanted mice were fed an atherogenic diet or were treated with LPS. After LPS treatment (10 mg/kg), UCP2 protein was induced in liver from Ucp2 +/+ and Ucp2 +/+-tKO mice (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that LPS induced UCP2 in hepatocytes. After 6 weeks of an atherogenic diet containing cholate, the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in both the Ucp2 -/- and Ucp2 +/+ groups of mice was observed (Fig. 2B). Consistent with our previous study on transplanted LDL R -/- mice fed a cholate-free atherogenic diet (5Blanc J. Alves-Guerra M.C. Esposito B. Rousset S. Gourdy P. Ricquier D. Tedgui A. Miroux B. Mallat Z. Circulation. 2003; 107: 388-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the mean size of the atherosclerotic plaques was increased four times in Ucp2 -/- mice compared with Ucp2 +/+ (Fig. 2B; p = 0.0011). In contrast to the LPS model of inflammation, the atherogenic diet induced UCP2 protein in liver mitochondria from Ucp2 +/+ and Ucp2 +/+-tWT mice but not in liver mitochondria from Ucp2 +/+tKO mice (Fig. 2C). This result shows that the relatively high level of UCP2 protein (50% of the level of UCP2 in control lung) detected in response to an atherogenic diet is associated with immune cells and not with hepatocytes. To confirm this observation, frozen sections of liver were immunostained with the MOMA-2 macrophage-specific antibody (Fig. 2D). Resident macrophages were present in both Ucp2 +/+ control mice and in Ucp2 +/+tWT-transplanted mice, showing that 4 months after bone marrow transplantation, repopulation of the liver by immune cells has occurred. As revealed by the strong MOMA-2 staining, the atherogenic diet in the presence of cholate triggered a massive infiltration of macrophages in the liver of Ucp2 +/+tWT mice (Fig. 2D). In spleen, expression of UCP2 almost disappeared in the Ucp2 +/+tKO mice (Fig. 3A), showing that UCP2 protein is more than 90% associated with immune cells in this organ (Fig. 3D). In contrast, expression of UCP2 in duodenum disappeared in Ucp2 -/-tWT mice, demonstrating the expression of UCP2 within intestine cells only (Fig. 3B). Lung exhibited an intermediary phenotype. A significant amount of UCP2 protein is present in the lung of Ucp2 -/-tWT (Fig. 3C), corresponding to 30% of the signal found in untransplanted mice. To verify that the transplantation was completed, wild-type mice were also transplanted with wild-type bone marrow (Ucp2 +/+tWT), and the level of UCP2 in spleen was measured in all groups of mice. As shown in Fig. 3D, the levels of UCP2 protein in the spleen of Ucp2 +/+tWT and Ucp2 -/-tWT mice were comparable to the level of UCP2 in the spleen of untransplanted wild-type mice. LPS injection stimulated UCP2 protein in spleen of Ucp2 -/-tKO mice only (data not shown). However, in the lung, stimulation of UCP2 expression occurred in both groups of mice (Fig. 4), showing that 14 h after injection, both immune and non-immune cells up-regulate UCP2. In intestine, a weak UCP2 protein signal appeared in the Ucp2 -/-tKO mice treated with LPS (data not shown), indicating that, in addition to the induction of UCP2 by intestine cells, a small proportion of immune cells contributed to UCP2 induction by LPS. Effects of N-Acetyl-cysteine and Dexamethasone after LPS Injection—To confirm that UPC2 responds to the septic shock induced by LPS, mice were first injected intraperitoneally with LPS (5 mg/kg) and 1 h later, with either N-acetyl-cysteine (150 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg). As expected, the high concentration of LPS induced a severe hypothermia, with body temperature decreasing to 35 °C (Fig. 5A). Both N-acetyl-cysteine and dexamethasone significantly restored the body temperature (p ≤ 0.01 or 0.001) and prevented UCP2 induction in spleen, lung, and duodenum (Fig. 5, B and C). Bone Marrow Transplantation Reveals New Expression Pattern of UCP2—In spleen, UCP2 expression is thoroughly restricted to immune cells, which confirms that UCP2 is expressed in macrophages and lymphocytes as proposed previously (4Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat.

However, immune cells do not contribute to the UCP2 protein detected in intestine. The lung exhibits an intermediary phenotype. In liver, expression of UCP2 can be ascribed to either hepatocytes or to resident and infiltrating immune cells, depending on the inflammatory model. The presence of cholate in the atherogenic diet, which causes a chronic inflammation of the liver, triggers macrophage infiltration, whereas LPS injection, which induces a severe septic shock for a short period of time, is probably not sufficient to allow a massive infiltration of immune cells. All together, these data showed that immune cells are a dominant site for UCP2 expression, which should be taken into account when measuring UCP2 expression in vivo. Anti-inflammatory Drugs Confirm the Involvement of UCP2 during Inflammation—Dexamethasone has been shown to significantly reduce neutrophil infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and, consequently, the oxidative burst activity in the lung of LPS-treated mice (28Rocksen D. Lilliehook B. Larsson R. Johansson T. Bucht A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 122: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It also inhibits, via the NFκB regulation pathway, the production of cytokines and chemokines such as TNFα, interleukine-1α and -1β, and macrophage inhibitor protein-1α (28Rocksen D. Lilliehook B.

The inhibiting effects of dexamethasone and NAC on UCP2 induction by LPS suggest that free radicals may directly regulate the expression of UCP2 either at the translational level as described by Pecqueur et al. (18Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) or at the transcriptional level. In addition, the possibility that UCP2 regulation is determined by cytokine levels cannot be excluded. Systemic LPS injection in mice triggers an increase in blood TNFα level in less than 2 h, which is followed by bronchopulmonary hyperactivity and an accumulation of neutrophils in the microvasculature of the lung (29Lefort J.

UCP2 induction occurs just after the peak of blood cytokine levels. However, Menon et al. (32Memon R.A. Hotamisligil G.S. Wiesbrock S.M. Uysal K.T. Faggioni R. Moser A.H. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that TNFα is not required for the up-regulation of UCP2 mRNA levels observed in the genetically obese ob/ob mice, and Nakatani et al. (33Nakatani T. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Takahashi M. Miura S. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9562-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that PPARα activators up-regulated liver Ucp2 mRNA by means of a TNFα-independent pathway. Toward a Two-step Model of in Vivo Regulation of UCP2 in Immune Cells—UCP2 expression in immune cells upon LPS treatment has been studied in vitro by several groups. We initially described a down-regulation of UCP2 mRNA in cultured peritoneal macrophages 4 h after LPS treatment (4Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Lee and et al. (34Lee F.Y. Li Y. Yang E.K. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Trush M.A. Dannenberg A.J. Diehl A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C386-C394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed the same effect with LPS treatment and furthermore demonstrated that leptin-deficient mice exhibited a constitutive down-regulation of UCP2 in macrophages. Kizaki et al. (35Kizaki T. Suzuki K. Hitomi Y. Taniguchi N. Saitoh D. Watanabe K. Onoe K. Day N.K. Good R.A. Ohno H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9392-9397Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) also described a down-regulation of UCP2 mRNA and protein in macrophages 6 h after LPS treatment. Both groups suggested that this should result in an increase in reactive oxygen species, triggering the transduction cascade of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and the production of cytokines and prostanoids. Consistent with this proposal, Chen et al. (36Chen Z. Gordon J.R. Zhang X. Xiang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) described a 15-fold decrease of UCP2 mRNA in bone marrow-derived dentritic cells after LPS treatment and a 9-fold increase in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. In addition to these in vitro studies, bone marrow transplantation revealed an increase of UCP2 protein in immune cells 16 h after LPS treatment. Two explanations are possible: either (i) UCP2 is inducted into immune cells, or (ii) immune cells are recruited into the organ. In the spleen, the first explanation seems more likely, whereas in the lung and duodenum, a recruitment of immune cells cannot be excluded. Taken together, previous studies and our data support a two-step model of UCP2 regulation consisting of an early phase and a late phase response to LPS (Fig. 6). In the early phase of the LPS response, UCP2 down-regulation within macrophages allows an increased production of ROS, which leads to the activation of macrophages and to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and interleukin-1. This is consistent with the observation that Ucp2 -/- macrophages are over-activated after infection with T. gondii (4Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). At a later stage, 12-16 h after LPS injection, pro-inflammatory cytokines have induced a systemic oxidative stress, and there is a need to counteract the toxic effects of inflammation and over-stimulation of immune cells. Up-regulation of UCP2 expression may be seen as an adaptive response to reduce the production of ROS in immune cells in a negative feedback regulatory cycle (Fig. 6) and also in non-immune tissues such as the lung and duodenum. Finally, these data suggest the interesting possibility that UCP2 may serve as either a pro-oxidant or an anti-oxidant, depending on its mitochondrial concentration. At low levels, UCP2 participates in the activation of immune cells, enhancing their oxidative burst activity. At higher levels, UCP2 appears to serve a cytoprotective effect, guarding against an excess of oxygen free radicals.

CETP has no apparent preference for high (HDL) or low (LDL) density lipoprotein as lipid donor to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and the preference for HDL observed in plasma is due to suppression of LDL transfers by lipid transfer inhibitor protein (LTIP). Given the heterogeneity of HDL, and a demonstrated ability of HDL subfractions to bind LTIP, we examined whether LTIP might also control CETP-facilitated lipid flux among HDL subfractions. CETP-mediated CE transfers from [3H]CE VLDL to various lipoproteins, combined on an equal phospholipid basis, ranged 2-fold and followed the order: HDL3 > LDL > HDL2. LTIP inhibited VLDL to HDL2 transfer at one-half the rate of VLDL to LDL. In contrast, VLDL to HDL3 transfer was stimulated, resulting in a CETP preference for HDL3 that was 3-fold greater than that for LDL or HDL2. Long-term mass transfer experiments confirmed these findings and further established that the previously observed stimulation of CETP activity on HDL by LTIP is due solely to its stimulation of transfer activity on HDL3. TG enrichment of HDL2, which occurs during the HDL cycle, inhibited CETP activity by ∼2-fold and LTIP activity was blocked almost completely. This suggests that LTIP keeps lipid transfer activity on HDL2 low and constant regardless of its TG enrichment status. Overall, these results show that LTIP tailors CETP-mediated remodeling of HDL3 and HDL2 particles in subclass-specific ways, strongly implicating LTIP as a regulator of HDL metabolism.

Because of its unique capacity to mediate net exchange of triglyceride (TG) and cholesteryl ester (CE) between TG-rich VLDL and CE-rich lipoproteins, such as LDL and HDL, CETP plays an essential role in regulating plasma cholesterol levels. By altering lipoprotein core lipid composition, CETP participates in the catabolism of VLDL to LDL (1Morton R.E.

Additionally, CETP facilitates HDL metabolism by promoting the formation of larger TG-rich HDL2 from smaller HDL3 subspecies (8Zechner R. Dieplinger H. Steyrer E. Groener J. Calvert D. Kostner G.M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that CETP possesses no functional preference for HDL over LDL. Consequently, in the absence of other factors, LDL is the most active donor of CE to VLDL due to the relative abundance of CE in this lipoprotein in normal plasma. However, CETP activity is controlled by several apolipoproteins including lipid transfer inhibitor protein (LTIP) (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Son Y.S.C. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Morton R.E.

LTIP has been purified and characterized as an acidic glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 33 kDa (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Driscoll D.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1814-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of LTIP had determined its identity with apolipoprotein F (20Wang X. Driscoll D.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1814-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). LTIP prevents CETP activity by binding to lipoproteins and disrupting their interaction with CETP (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LTIP appears to alter the relative participation of HDL versus LDL in the lipid transfer processes by selectively interacting with the latter lipoprotein and reducing its capacity to bind CETP. Thus, in plasma-like lipoprotein mixtures, HDL and LDL are equal donors of CE to VLDL in the absence of LTIP, but HDL becomes a preferred CETP substrate and donates more CE in the presence of LTIP (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of LTIP with LDL may be not exclusive. For instance, LTIP effectively binds to HDL and displaces CETP from its surface (21Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in two-component assays with CE-labeled lipoproteins, LTIP inhibits CETP-induced lipid transfer between VLDL and HDL, although to a lower extent than transfer between VLDL and LDL (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that HDL is heterogeneous in composition and function. The two most abundant HDL subpopulations, HDL2 and HDL3, differ not only in terms of particle size, but also in lipid content, lipid/protein ratio, apoprotein A-I/apoprotein A-II ratio, and, presumably, in apoprotein conformation (22Edelstein C.

Given that HDL2 and HDL3 vary significantly in their interaction with plasma enzymes and transfer factors, and previous observations that LTIP can bind HDL (21Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lopez-Miranda J. Kam N. Osada J. Rodriguez C. Fernandez P. Contois J. Schaefer E.J. Ordovas J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we have investigated the capacity of LTIP to modify CETP-mediated lipid flux from these HDL subfractions. We have analyzed lipid transfers in 2-, 3-, and 4-component, short-term radiolabeled lipid transfer experiments with native and modified lipoproteins, and in long-term mass transfer assays to determine how LTIP alters the pattern of lipid movement among HDL fractions. We have observed marked differences in the substrate properties of HDL2 and HDL3 for both CETP and LTIP. The data suggest that LTIP may be important in controlling the maturation of HDL species. Lipoprotein Isolation and Labeling—VLDL, LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from fresh human plasma obtained from the Blood Bank of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation as described (35Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were extensively dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and stored at 4 °C. Radiolabeled lipoproteins were prepared by CETP-induced transfer (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) of [1α,2α(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleate (48.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) from phosphatidylcholine cholesterol-[3H]CE liposomes prepared as previously described (36Morton R.E. Steinbrunner J.V. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1559-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the labeling procedure, VLDL and LDL were isolated by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas HDL2 and HDL3 were re-isolated within their original density intervals by ultracentrifugation. Radiolabeled lipoproteins contained 400–1200 cpm 3H per μg of total cholesterol. Biotin-LDL and avidin-Sepharose were prepared as previously described (37Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2094-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as previously detailed (21Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the lipoprotein to Sepharose ratios given under “Results.” Purification of CETP and LTIP—Partially purified CETP (∼1 mg of total protein/ml, ∼4 μg of CETP/ml) was isolated from lipoprotein-deficient human plasma using preparative chromatography as described earlier (38Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1058-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in 0.27 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Partially purified LTIP (∼0.5 mg of total protein/ml) was also isolated from human plasma according to the procedure described earlier (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the comparison of the activity of several preparations with the LTIP activity of lipoprotein-deficient human plasma, 3 μg of total protein of the partially purified LTIP was equivalent to the LTIP activity contained in 1 μl of human lipoprotein-deficient plasma (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither LTIP nor CETP preparations contained phospholipid transfer protein (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been previously shown to stimulate CETP activity in vitro (39Tollefson J.H. Ravnik S. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1593-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Lipid Transfer Assays—[3H]CE-labeled lipoproteins were prepared as described above. VLDL, LDL (or biotin-LDL), HDL2 and HDL3 were added to assays on an equal phospholipid basis (4.6 μg phospholipid each). Depending on the design of the experiment, assays contained a radiolabeled lipoprotein (donor) and one to three unlabeled lipoproteins (acceptors). The lipoprotein mixture was incubated in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin, 21 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% NaCl, 0.011% NaN3, and 0.006% EDTA (total volume, 1.4 ml) ±CETP and ±LTIP (as indicated) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After incubation, samples were cooled on ice and lipoprotein fractions were separated at 4 °C. For assays containing biotin-LDL, LDL was removed by addition of 100 μl of avidin-Sepharose (37Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2094-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise, LDL or VLDL was precipitated by manganese-phosphorus reagent (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, HDL2 and HDL3 were separated by a single ultracentrifugation step (d = 1.125 g/ml), or at d = 1.21 g/ml when assays contained only one of these HDL subfractions. In parallel studies not shown, we have confirmed data derived from this hybrid separation approach with assays using native lipoproteins that were separated by sequential ultracentrifugation (35Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar) alone. The radioactivity (cpm) of each fraction was measured by scintillation counting. Lipid transfer rates, inhibition values, and mass of the lipid transferred were calculated as previously described (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blank samples (no CETP added) were incubated under the same conditions and subtracted from the values shown. Samples were assayed in duplicate. In general, the presence of CETP or LTIP did not influence the separation of lipoproteins at the end of transfer assays. However, we observed in samples containing LTIP that HDL2 was partially recovered in the d > 1.125 g/ml density fraction, presumably because LTIP or proteins in this fraction bind to HDL2 and increase its density. Thus, for each HDL2 and LTIP preparation we determined, under assay conditions, the dose-relationship between the fraction of HDL2 recovered in the d > 1.125 g/ml fraction and LTIP concentration. This correction was then applied to the values reported for all assays containing both HDL2 and HDL3. Without this correction, the reported differences in LTIP activity between HDL2 and HDL3 would be larger. Lipid Mass Transfer Assays—VLDL, LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 (225, 500, 120, and 120 μg of total cholesterol, respectively) were incubated in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.01% EDTA (total volume 3.0 ml) ±CETP and ±LTIP (as indicated) for 20 h at 37 °C. Also, 1 mm (final concentration) diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added to inhibit residual LCAT activity co-isolated with HDL subfractions. After incubation, samples were cooled on ice and separated by sequential ultracentrifugation at 4 °C (35Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). Dialyzed samples were assayed for total and unesterified cholesterol, TG, and protein content. Changes in CE and TG content were calculated from the recovery corrected differences in the lipid content of CETP-containing samples (±LTIP) incubated at 37 °C and blank (no CETP added) samples (±LTIP) incubated at 4 °C. Preference values were calculated as previously described (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These values reflect the ratio between the amount of lipid transferred to a given lipoprotein acceptor expressed as a fraction of all transferred lipid, and the amount of transferable lipid in that acceptor expressed as a fraction of whole transferable lipid in the acceptor pool. Protein content of the lipoprotein fractions was quantitated according to the Lowry method as modified by Peterson (40Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7124) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total cholesterol and TG were assayed by Infinity™ Cholesterol and Infinity™ Triglyceride kits (Sigma). Unesterified cholesterol was determined by the Free Cholesterol C kit from Wako Diagnostics (Richmond, VA). Lipid phosphorus was assayed by the method of Bartlett (41Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For calculations, 653, 885, and 800 were used as average molecular weights of CE, TG, and phospholipid, respectively. All assays were performed in duplicate. LTIP Binding to LDL, HDL2, and HDL3—LTIP binds HDL and displaces CETP from the HDL surface (21Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the LTIP binding capacity of HDL subspecies with LDL, isolated LDL, HDL2 and HDL3 were immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B. Since LTIP is a surface active apoprotein that interacts primarily with the phospholipid monolayer of lipoproteins (42Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Jones J.B. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29588-29591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the capacity of solid-phase lipoproteins to bind LTIP were compared on an equal phospholipid basis. LTIP was applied to columns prepared with these matrices, the columns extensively washed, and bound LTIP was quantified. HDL2 and HDL3 bound similar amounts of LTIP, and this binding exceeded that for LDL by 2-fold under these conditions (Fig. 1). Thus, HDL2 and HDL3 are comparable in their ability to form stable complexes with LTIP. Effect of LTIP on CETP-mediated CE Transfer to HDL2 and HDL3—In our previous studies of LTIP, where lipoproteins were added to transfer assays on an equal cholesterol basis, we observed that LTIP preferentially inhibited CETP activity with LDL (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding studies above suggest that this preference toward LDL may not be observed when lipoproteins are compared on a phospholipid basis. To address this issue, we initially assessed the capacity of LTIP to affect CETP-mediated CE transfer between HDL2 and HDL3 in the absence of other lipoproteins to determine if the binding of LTIP to HDL2 and HDL3 noted above resulted in CETP suppression (Fig. 2A). Without LTIP, the CETP-mediated transfer of CE between these lipoproteins was the same (inset). LTIP did not disrupt the balance of CE flux between these two lipoproteins but equally suppressed CE transfer from both HDL2 and HDL3 in the dose-dependent manner. Since CETP transfer occurs largely through an exchange mechanism (1Morton R.E. Experientia. 1990; 46: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), an equivalent effect of LTIP on bidirectional flux between two lipoproteins is expected and consistent with our previous findings (17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the capacity of LTIP to inhibit lipid transfers to HDL2 and HDL3, we measured the effect of this protein on CETP-mediated CE transfer from VLDL to these lipoprotein fractions. Although TG transfer from VLDL to HDL is more physiologically relevant, the very small pool of TG in HDL, when added to assays at the same phospholipid concentration as VLDL, prevented the transfer of this lipid from being accurately measured. CE transfer to each of these lipoproteins in the absence of LTIP was similar, with transfer to HDL2 being modestly but not significantly higher than that to HDL3 (Fig. 2B, inset). LTIP caused a dose-dependent suppression of CE transfer from VLDL regardless of the acceptor lipoprotein (Fig. 2B). However, CETP activity from VLDL to HDL2 was much more sensitive to LTIP. At higher LTIP levels, the inhibition of VLDL to HDL2 was 1.7-fold more than that for VLDL to HDL3. As expected, unfractionated HDL gave an intermediate response. These results suggest that LTIP may influence CETP activity on HDL subfractions differently. Having observed that LTIP suppresses lipid transfers to HDL2 more than HDL3 in simple 2-component assays, we subsequently investigated how CE transfer from VLDL was affected by LTIP when both HDL2 and HDL3 were present as acceptors. In the absence of LTIP, CETP-mediated CE transfer from VLDL to HDL2 was lower than that from VLDL to HDL3 (Fig. 3A, inset). Among four similar experiments, VLDL to HDL3 transfers averaged ∼30% higher than VLDL to HDL2 transfers. The influence of LTIP on these CE transfers was unique. In contrast to that seen when HDL2 and HDL3 were added separately to transfer reactions, here we observed that VLDL to HDL2 CE transfer was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by LTIP, but CE transfer from VLDL to HDL3 was stimulated by almost 40% at the highest LTIP level (Fig. 3A). Similar LTIP effects were observed in lipid transfer assays measuring lipid flux in the reverse direction from HDL2 or HDL3 to VLDL (i.e. HDL2 to VLDL + HDL3 and HDL3 to VLDL + HDL2, data not shown). Total CE flux from VLDL to HDL2 + HDL3 was unaffected by LTIP (Fig. 3B). This indicates that LTIP alters the destination of CE transferred from VLDL but not the overall rate of CE efflux from this lipoprotein. This shift in lipid transfer pathways is illustrated by the calculated preference values of CETP for each acceptor in the absence and presence of LTIP (Fig. 3C). In the absence of LTIP, lipid flux from VLDL to HDL3 was favored modestly over flux to HDL2. However, at the highest LTIP dose tested the preference of CETP for VLDL to HDL3 transfers was 3-fold greater than that involving HDL2. Thus in this experimental design, LTIP did not inhibit CETP-mediated lipid transfer from VLDL per se, but influenced which lipoprotein was the recipient of that lipid. We previously reported that LTIP preferentially blocks CETP activity on LDL (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Driscoll D.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1814-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus in transfer assays containing LDL, the influence of LTIP on lipid flux pathways involving HDL2 and HDL3 may be different. In fact, we have observed that although LTIP effectively inhibited CETP-mediated transfers between LDL and HDL2 as well as between LDL and HDL3, no statistically significant difference was evident (data not shown). Also, no significant difference in LTIP effect was detected for the VLDL → HDL2 and VLDL → HDL3 transfers in assays that also contained LDL (i.e. VLDL to LDL + HDL2 versus VLDL to LDL + HDL3) (data not shown). Together, these findings suggest that the LTIP-LDL interaction may modulate the interaction of LTIP with HDL subfractions. However, in each of these experimental settings the transfer assays contained HDL2 or HDL3, but not both. Since we observed in Fig. 3 that the differential affects of LTIP on HDL subfractions are most evident when these lipoproteins are together, we examined the influence of LTIP on lipid flux pathways in four-component assays containing VLDL donor, and LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 as acceptors. In the absence of LTIP, lipid fluxes from VLDL to LDL and HDL3 were similar and almost 2-fold higher than the transfer to HDL2 (Fig. 4A, inset). Although the magnitude of the LTIP effects on HDL2 and HDL3 transfers was quantitatively less than that observed in the absence of LDL (Fig. 3), the unique influence of LTIP on these lipoproteins observed above persisted when LDL was present. As expected, VLDL to LDL transfers were the most sensitive to LTIP inhibition, but lipid transfer to HDL2 was also inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by LTIP (Fig. 4A). In contrast, lipid transfer from VLDL to HDL3 was mildly stimulated. These changes in lipid flux among LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 revealed marked changes in the preference of CETP for these lipoproteins. Among multiple assays without (n = 5) and with (n = 4) LTIP (15 μg) the preference values for LDL decreased and HDL3 increased significantly in the presence of LTIP (Fig. 4B). The relative preference of CETP for HDL2 was unchanged by LTIP. Consistent with our previous findings (15Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), here we observe that in the absence of LTIP the preference values for LDL and total HDL are near one and these values decrease for LDL and increase for HDL in the presence of LTIP (Fig. 4B). These data also clearly demonstrate, however, that CETP has a marked preference for HDL3 as a substrate and that HDL2 is the least preferred substrate"

The peptide approach allows for the analysis of mutants that fail to be expressed in a transfected system. The Na,K-ATPase or sodium pump is an integral membrane protein found in the cells of virtually all higher eukaryotes and is one of the most important systems involved in cellular energy transduction (1Kaplan J.H. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 2Scheiner-Bobis G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the electrogenic exchange of three intracellular Na+ for two extracellular K+ ions energized by the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. The transporter plays a major role in ion homeostasis, and, in epithelia, the sodium gradient created by the pump also plays an important role in secondary active transport mechanisms that are necessary for Na+-dependent reabsorption of a variety of solutes including sugars and amino acids. There is an increasing body of evidence that members of a family of membrane proteins, the so-called FXYD family (3Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), associate with and modulate the kinetic behavior of the sodium pump (for a recent overview, see Ref 4Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A.

Bioenerg Biomembr. 2001; 33: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Gamma, or FXYD2, exists as two main splice variants, γa and γb, with distinct as well as overlapping localization along the nephron (11Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of γa and γb indicate that they differ only in the N terminus; in rat γa, TELSANH is replaced by Ac-MDRWYL in γb (12Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R.

Previous studies using membrane fragments isolated from γ-transfected rat α1-HeLa cells have shown that γ serves at least two distinct functions in regulating the pump, and the effects are similar for both variants (11Pu H.X.

These distinct effects of γ include the following: (i) an increase in the apparent affinity for ATP; and (ii) an increase in K+/Na+ competition at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites, as seen by an increase in K′Na at high [K+]. Previous studies have suggested that the effect on ATP affinity is mediated by the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the protein (5Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas effects on K+/Na+ antagonism may be associated with the TM domain (15Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a novel strategy to assess directly the functional effects of the TM region of FXYD2 whereby peptides corresponding to the TM domain of γ are added directly to membranes derived from cells devoid of the protein. In addition, we describe a mutagenesis approach to structure/function analysis of γ using both transfected cells and peptides. A residue of particular interest is Gly-41, because it is replaced by Arg (G41R) in a familial form of renal magnesium wasting (16Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and is invariant throughout the FXYD family. The other residue examined is Gly-35 because of its location at the alternate face of the membrane relative to Gly-41 (17Therien A.G. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Effects of peptides with either of these Gly residues replaced by Arg or Leu are compared with those of the full-length transfected γ proteins (wild-type or mutants of the γb variant) expressed in cultured rat α1-transfected HeLa cells. This approach allows for assessment of the role of the TM region alone and provides an opportunity to distinguish the effects of mutations on biogenesis and routing to the plasma membrane from the direct effects on association and kinetic modulation of αβ pumps. Mutagenesis, Transfection, Tissue Culture, and Membrane Preparations—Point mutations were introduced into γb cDNA subcloned into the pIRES expression vector and then transfected into HeLa cells stably expressing the rat α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (α1 HeLa cells were kindly provided by Dr. J. B. Lingrel) as described previously (14Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, cellular membranes from the stably transfected cells were prepared as described by Jewell and Lingrel (18Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol.

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (11Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R.

Briefly, 250 μg of membranes, prepared from γb(WT)and γb(mutant)-transfected cells as described previously (18Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were resuspended and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm RbCl, and 5 mm ouabain in a final volume of 250 μl. Polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (C12E10) (250 μl of a 2 mg/ml solution in water) was then added (final concentration, 1 mg/ml), and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation. Following centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was added to 50 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml)-treated protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and the beads were then centrifuged to remove non-specifically bound proteins. The supernatant was removed and a 10-μl aliquot was taken for SDS-PAGE. To another 450-μl aliquot, 90 μl of RbCl (118 mm final concentration) and 30 μl of γC32 anti-serum (stored at -20 °C in 50% glycerol) were added, and the suspension was further incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation. The suspension was then mixed with protein A-Sepharose beads (100 μl) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed six times with immunoprecipitation buffer without ouabain, and the immunoprecipitated proteins retained by the beads were eluted with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 30 min. A 20-μl aliquot of the eluate and the 10-μl sample removed before addition of antiserum were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Transfected α1-HeLa cells were grown to ≈80% confluence in 6-well plates. The surface biotinylation is a modification of Stephan et al. (21Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) Briefly, the cell surface biotinylation reaction was carried out on ice for one 20-min period using sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) (Pierce). After biotinylation, each well was rinsed briefly twice with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (CM) solution containing 100 mm glycine and then treated with the same solution for 30 min to ensure complete quenching of unreacted sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. The cells were then lysed for 45 min with 500 μl of L1 buffer (1% Triton X-100/0.1% SDS in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Each well was then scraped, and the sample was collected and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. One 20-μl aliquot of supernatant (total fraction, T) was taken for protein determination (Lowry method) and another (5 μl), for Western blotting. The biotinylated surface-exposed proteins were isolated by incubating a 150-μg (≈85 μl) fraction in L2 buffer (L1 buffer without SDS; final volume, 500 μl) with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The samples were then centrifuged to separate beads and supernatant (unbound fraction, U), and an aliquot of U (15 μl ≅ 2.5 μl of T) was taken for Western blotting. The beads were washed three times with L2 buffer, twice with high salt L2 buffer (L2 buffer with 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100), and then once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads (Fraction B) by incubation in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 85 °C for 10 min and an aliquot (30 μl ≅ 25 μl of T) was taken for Western blotting. Peptide Synthesis—Synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 23–48 of the TM segment of wild-type γb, mutant TM peptides with replacements G41R, G41L, G35R, G35L, and the scrambled peptide, all containing three lysine residues on the N and C termini to aid in synthesis and purification, were prepared as described previously (17Therien A.G.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The sequences of these peptides are shown in Fig. 1. Kinetic Assays and Data Analysis—Kinetic assays of Na,K-ATPase were carried out in triplicate as described previously (11Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using membranes isolated from mock-transfected and either mutant or WT γbtransfected rat α1-HeLa cells. For studies of the kinetic effects of the various peptides, the permeabilized membranes were incubated in buffered medium (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA) with peptide such that the peptide concentration was 16.7 μm (3.3 μm in the final assay mixture) and the membrane protein concentration was 0.15–0.2 mg/ml. Following incubation for 10 min at room temperature and then for 1 h on ice, the membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 μm ouabain and assayed for Na,K-ATPase activity with the data analyzed as described (11Pu H.X.

Studies with Transfected Cells—Several approaches were used to gain insight into the role of two glycine residues, Gly-41 and Gly-35, on γ processing, trafficking, and association with the Na,K-ATPase on the one hand and the functional effect on K+/Na+ antagonism on the other. To assess γ association with the catalytic α subunit and γ surface expression, we tested γ/α co-immunoprecipitation and cell surface biotinylation followed by streptavidin bead isolation and Western blotting of γ and α, respectively (see Ref. 14Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 2A) shows that γb and γb-G35L associate with α, whereas γbG41L shows weak association, and γb-G41R and γb-G35R show little, if any, association. In additional experiments (not shown), γ/α association seen at lower detergent concentration (0.4 mg/ml) is increased for γb-G41L but not for γb-G41R. The surface biotinylation results (Fig. 2B) show that γb and γb-G35L and, to some extent, the γb-G41L mutant, traffic to the surface. As shown earlier (13Therien A.G. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), little if any γb-G41R appears at the surface. Although the low expression of γb-G35R precluded assessment of its surface expression, these results indicate that the appearance of the WT and mutant γ chains at the cell surface parallels their ability to associate with α. A surprising finding is the low level of γb-G41L relative to α in the Triton X-100-solubilized cells (total fraction, Fig. 2B) compared with the relative amounts seen in Western blots of total membranes that were not subjected to this detergent treatment (see Fig. 2A). The reason for this apparent discrepancy is under investigation, although this observation does not detract from the conclusion that this mutant does, in fact, traffic to the cell surface. Further evidence for altered γ trafficking in the Gly → Arg mutants is the failure to detect post-translational modification of γ. Thus, in Western blots of multiple clones of rat α1-HeLa cells transfected with WT γb and each of the above-mentioned mutants (experiments not shown), the γb chain appeared as a doublet (γb and γb′; cf. Ref. 11Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol.

We then looked at the functional properties of the various γb-transfected cells. Table I summarizes measurements of apparent Na+-affinity of Na,K-ATPase measured at high K+ concentration (100 mm) of membranes isolated from the mock-transfected (control) as well as the WT and mutant γb-transfected cells. The results indicate that γbG35L behaves like WT γ in that it decreases the apparent affinity for Na+; K′Na is increased 2.5-fold by γbG35L and nearly 2-fold by γb. In contrast, γbG41L, like γbG41R, does not increase K′Na. Unfortunately, γbG35R mutants were expressed at levels too low for meaningful kinetic analysis.Table ISummary of comparative effects of γwt and γmutants on apparent affinity for Na+ at 100 mM K+MembranesK' Na at 100 mM K+Control (mock)4.8 ± 0.2γbap < 0.01 for γb and γbG35L compared to control membranes8.3 ± 0.4γbG41R5.3 ± 0.2γbG41L4.5 ± 0.02γbG35Rn.d.bn.d., not determined due to low expressionγbG35Lap < 0.01 for γb and γbG35L compared to control membranes10.7 ± 0.8a p < 0.01 for γb and γbG35L compared to control membranesb n.d., not determined due to low expression Open table in a new tab Effects of Transmembrane Mimetic Peptides—Studies of the effects of peptides comprising the TM sequence of γ (γ-TM), G41R (γG41R-TM), G41L (γG41L-TM), G35R (γG35R-TM), and G35L (γG35L-TM) γ as well as a “scrambled” peptide (“γScr-TM”) were carried out with synthetic peptides containing “lysine tags” at both the N and the C termini. These tags overcome the inherent insolubility of these α-helical TM peptides, thus aiding in their synthesis and purification, but retain their native TM oligomeric states (17Therien A.G. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the Na+ activation profile measured at high (100 mm) K+ concentration without and with the various TM peptides. Compared with γ-Scr-TM, the addition of either γ-TM or γG35L-TM peptide to γ-devoid membranes isolated from rat α1-HeLa cells increases K′Na. The increase effected by G35L is even greater than seen with the WT peptide, similar to the greater effect of γbG35L compared with γb in γ-expressing cells (described above). In contrast, γG41R-TM, γG41L-TM, and γG35R-TM did not increase K′Na above that observed with the control scrambled peptide (γScr-TM). A nonspecific effect of peptide addition is evident in a small but consistent increase in K′Na seen irrespective of whether γScr-TM or any of the three mutants, γG35R-TM, γG41R-TM and γG41L-TM, is added. The other notable kinetic effect of the full-length γ chain, the decrease in K′ATP, was not seen with γ-TM (experiments not shown), consistent with earlier evidence (14Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that this effect is mediated primarily by the cytoplasmic C terminus. We showed previously that K′Na is a linear function of K+ concentration, approximating a simple competitive model of cytoplasmic K+/Na+ competition, i.e. K′Na = K Na (1 + [K+]/K K) (19Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Garay R.P. Garrahan P.J. J. Physiol. 1973; 231: 297-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 24Sachs J.R. J. Physiol. 1986; 374: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and that the main effect of either γa or γb was not due to an increase in K Na, but rather to a decrease in K K. To further assess the specificity of the mimicry of the TM peptides, we determined K′Na as a function of K+ concentration and, thus, values of K Na (K′Na when [K+] = 0) and K K (the apparent K+ affinity for competition with cytoplasmic Na+). The results shown in the inset to Fig. 3 support the conclusion that γ-TM and γG35L-TM peptides, like their full-length counterparts (see table in Ref. 11Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), decrease K K with little effect on K Na. As shown in Fig. 4, in control experiments carried out with the γ-TM peptide and/or the γG35L-TM peptide, an increase in K′Na seen with mock-transfected cell membranes is seen also with γbG41R-transfected but not γb-transfected membranes. Thus, the kinetic effects of the mimetic peptides are highly specific in that they are seen only with pumps not already associated (mock transfected) or minimally associated (γb-G41R) with full-length γ chains. As expected, γG41L-TM and γG41R-TM peptides had no effect on the K′Na values of pumps in any of the transfected systems. The experiments described herein unequivocally show that the effect of γ (FXYD2) on the K′Na values of Na,K-ATPase is mediated solely by the TM domain of the protein, as suggested recently (15Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, peptides comprising only this region of γ simulate functional effects obtained in assays performed on membranes isolated from wild-type and mutant γb-transfected α1-HeLa cells. The mimetic effects of the peptides underscore the feasibility of using TM peptides to evaluate kinetic effects of TM helices, including instances in which adequate expression is problematic, as is the case of the γb-G35R mutant. TM mimetic peptides offer the unique advantage of examining the function of the TM domain without the complexity of longrange effects of extramembranous regions. In fact, concern over this complexity was mentioned by Lindzen et al. (15Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) who raised the possibility that a change in K′ATP effected by the cytoplasmic domain may mask an apparent effect of γ-TM on K+/Na+ antagonism, which may account for the larger decrease in K K effected by γ-TM and γG35L-TM compared with the analogous transfectants (compare inset of Fig. 3 with Table I). The results of the present study provide insight into the role of two Gly residues, Gly-35 and Gly-41, which reside on opposite faces of the helical TM domain of γ. The observation that both the γb-G35R (Fig. 1) and γb-G41R (11Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) mutants show either minimal expression or processing and trafficking led us to consider more conservative mutations in our attempts to understand the role of these residues in modulating pump function. We therefore studied G35L and G41L mutants in experiments with both transfected cells and synthesized peptides. These mutants circumvent the energetic cost associated with inserting a positively charged residue within the hydrophobic core of the membrane and are therefore more relevant in studying the role of the native glycine residues. This consideration may not only explain the low processing/trafficking of Arg mutants but also the lack of effect of the γG35R-TM peptide on sodium pump kinetics (Fig. 3). The studies with both transfected cells and peptides provide evidence that disruption of a Gly residue (Gly-41) on one face of the γ helix but not on the other (Gly-35) abrogates the increased K+/Na+ antagonism effected by γ as seen by a notable increase in K′Na at a high K+ concentration. Thus, the abolition of the kinetic effect is seen not only with the disrupting mutation G41R replacement associated with autosomal dominant renal magnesium wasting (16Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) but also with the conservative mutation, G41L. Previous results from our laboratory (14Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggested that Gly at position 41 is essential for normal trafficking to the cell surface and association with the pump. However, even when the cellular processing and trafficking problems are circumvented, as is the case with the G41L mutant and the peptide experiments presented herein, mutating this residue fails to increase K′Na above levels seen with a control scrambled peptide. Importantly, γb-G41L appears to be expressed at the surface (Fig. 2B) and to associate, at least to an extent, with the α subunit (Fig. 2A), confirming a role for Gly-41 in mediating one of the kinetic effects of γ but not primarily in αβ-γ association. Such a dissociation between residues important for the functional effects of γ and its interaction with the sodium pump is consistent with the findings of Lindzen et al. (15Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to Gly-41, Gly-35 on the opposite face of the helix does not appear to be functionally important, because the G35L mutation does not abrogate kinetic function. Our results also suggest that Gly-35 is not involved in association of γ with the αβ complex, because γb-G35L was able to co-immunoprecipitate with the α subunit (Fig. 2A). The latter finding is consistent with recent experiments showing that the residues important for this association are on a different side of the helix (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 15Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As described previously (17Therien A.G. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), γ-TM and γG35R-TM peptides form oligomers in the weak detergent PFO, but mutants of Gly-41 (γG41R-TM and γG41L-TM) do not. Using PFO-PAGE analysis (see Ref. 17Therien A.G. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have confirmed that the γG35L-TM peptide can form oligomers in PFO (not shown), revealing a potential correlation between the effects of γ peptides on K′Na and their ability to form oligomers in PFO. The physiological relevance of this observation remains to be investigated. Mimetic TM peptides reconstituted in detergent micelles have been used previously in structural studies of membrane proteins (22Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M.

However, to our knowledge, the results reported here constitute an unique example of a TM peptide that can display specific kinetic effects attributable to the TM domain of a membrane protein. The remarkable mimetic properties of the TM peptides and the expressed γ mutants have particular significance. The failure of the G41R and G41L mutants to affect K′Na, whether added as TM peptides to cell membranes or expressed as full-length proteins in transfected cells, underscores the conclusion that Gly-41, which is associated with renal magnesium wasting when mutated to Arg, is important for the effect of the γ subunit on K+/Na+ antagonism and possibly for oligomerization of the protein, whereas Gly-35 is not.

Its restricted expression in neural precursor cells suggests that it is involved in maintenance of the character of progenitor cells. Musashi1 contains two ribonucleoprotein-type RNA-binding domains (RBDs), RBD1 and RBD2, the affinity to RNA of RBD1 being much higher than that of RBD2. We previously reported the structure and mode of interaction with RNA of RBD2. Here, we have determined the structure and mode of interaction with RNA of RBD1. We have also analyzed the surface electrostatic potential and backbone dynamics of both RBDs. The two RBDs exhibit the same ribo-nucleoprotein-type fold and commonly make contact with RNA on the β-sheet side. On the other hand, there is a remarkable difference in surface electrostatic potential, the β-sheet of RBD1 being positively charged, which is favorable for binding negatively charged RNA, but that of RBD2 being almost neutral. There is also a difference in backbone dynamics, the central portion of the β-sheet of RBD1 being flexible, but that of RBD2 not being flexible. The flexibility of RBD1 may be utilized in the recognition process to facilitate an induced fit. Thus, comparative studies have revealed the origin of the higher affinity of RBD1 than that of RBD2 and indicated that the affinity of an RBD to RNA is not governed by its fold alone but is also determined by its surface electrostatic potential and/or backbone dynamics. The biological role of RBD2 with lower affinity is also discussed. Musashi1 is an RNA-binding protein abundantly expressed in the developing mouse central nervous system.

In Drosophila, during sensory organ development, Notch signaling directs the asymmetry between neuronal and non-neuronal lineages (1Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and a zinc finger transcriptional repressor, Tramtrack69, acts downstream of Notch as a determinant of non-neuronal identity (2Guo M.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the Drosophila Musashi protein represses the expression of the Tramtrack69 protein translationally in a neuronal lineage by binding to a cis-acting element in the 3′-untranslated region of tramtrack69 messenger RNA (5Okabe M. Imai T. Kurusu M. Hiromi Y. Okano H. Nature. 2001; 411: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Okano H. Imai T. Okabe M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in mammalian neural development, neural RNA-binding proteins play important roles by regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. During mammalian central nervous system development, neurons and glial cells are thought to be generated from common neural precursor cells located in the periventricular area (7Temple S. Alvarez-Buylla A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Musashi1, a mammalian homologue of Drosophila Musashi, is expressed in the neural precursor cells that exist in the ventricular area of the developing mouse neural tube (6Okano H. Imai T. Okabe M. J.

Musashi1, which is evolutionally conserved in different species, may be required for the self-renewal and neuronal potential retention of neural stem cells in the developing mouse nervous system (6Okano H.

In fact, it was demonstrated that Musashi1 translationally regulates the expression of a mammalian numb gene, which encodes a membrane-associated antagonist of Notch signaling, by interacting with numb mRNA (16Imai T.

Here, to elucidate the origin of the much higher affinity of RBD1 to RNA than that of RBD2 and the basis of the recognition of the target RNA, we have determined the structure and mode of interaction with RNA of RBD1. We have also compared the surface electrostatic potentials of the interactive surface as to RNA for the two RBDs. Moreover, we have compared the backbone dynamics of the two RBDs by means of quantitative model-free analysis. These studies have indicated that the higher affinity to RNA is brought about by the positive surface potential of the interactive β-sheet and/or the flexibility of the central portion of the β-sheet. Gel Retardation Experiments—Gel retardation experiments were performed as described previously (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled r(GUUAGUUAGUUAGUU) (T4-3) was incubated with various amounts of RBD1, RBD2, or their tandem link (RBD1-RBD2) at room temperature for 30 min. The complexes were run on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate buffer and EDTA. The gels were then dried and exposed to XAR autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Sample Preparation for NMR—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), transformed with a plasmid, pMMA, containing DNA encoding mouse Musashi1 RBD1-(20–103) was grown in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source and then harvested. The cells were lysed by sonication. After purification with ammonium sulfate, RBD1 was loaded onto a DE52 anion-exchange column (Whatman), and then the flow-through fraction was loaded onto a HiTrap-SP cation-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The fraction eluted with NaCl was loaded onto a HiTrap-Q anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), and the flow-through fraction was collected. RBD1 was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 10 mm [2H6]dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaN3, and then concentrated to 2 mm using Centricon-3 (Amicon). RNA oligomers were prepared as described previously (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a quadruple resonance probe with X, Y, and Z gradients. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as an internal chemical shift reference. The following NMR experiments were performed to assign the resonances of RBD1 and to obtain distance and dihedral angle constraints: NOESY, TOCSY, double quantum filtered COSY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, and HNHA experiments. For titration experiments, a concentrated RNA solution was added step by step to the RBD1 solution, 1H-15N HSQC spectra being recorded at each step. Spectra were processed with XWIN-NMR (Bruker), Felix (MSI), NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar), and Capp/Pipp/Stapp (27Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). 15N T1, T2, and NOE spectra of RBD1 and RBD2 were recorded and processed as described previously (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). T2 spectra were recorded at various protein concentrations, 2.0, 0.4, and 0.25 mm for RBD1 and 2, 0.6, and 0.3 mm for RBD2. Structure Calculations—870 distance constraints (203 intraresidue, 254 sequential, 130 medium range, and 283 long range distance constraints) were obtained for RBD1 from NOESY and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra, as described previously (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y.

Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thirty-seven dihedral angle constraints for φ were obtained from an HNHA experiment. Eight dihedral angle constraints for χ1 were also obtained, together with stereospecific assignment of the β-methylene protons of AMX and the γ-methyl protons of valine residues. Additionally, in the later stage of the calculations, 42 distance constraints for 21 hydrogen bonds were included for slowly exchanging amide protons within the identified secondary structure elements. Structure calculations were carried out using distance and dihedral angle constraints with a simulated annealing protocol supplied with X-PLOR v. 3.8 (30Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A final set of 15 structures was selected from 100 calculations on the basis of the criteria of the smallest residual energy values. None of them violated the distance constraints by more than 0.4 Å or dihedral angle constraints by more than 4°. A mean structure was obtained by averaging the coordinates of the 15 structures, and a restrained energy minimized mean structure was obtained by energy minimization of the mean structure under the constraints. The quality of the structures was evaluated with PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Surface Electrostatic Potentials and Backbone Dynamics—The surface electrostatic potentials of RBD1 and RBD2 were calculated with GRASP (32Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The backbone dynamics of RBD1 and RBD2 were quantitatively analyzed by model-free analysis of the relaxation data (33Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar), as described previously for another RBD (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Modelfree program was used (34Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Difference in RNA Binding Activity among RBD1, RBD2, and RBD1-RBD2—RNA binding activities of RBD1, RBD2, and their tandem link with a native linker (RBD1-RBD2) were examined by gel retardation experiments. r(GUUAGUUAGUUAGUU) (T4-3), which was obtained as one of the target sequences by means of the in vitro selection method (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), was used for the examination. T4-3 comprises at least two consensus sequences, (G/A)U n AGU (n = 1–3), tandemly, and even three if overlapping is allowed. T4-3 was incubated with RBD1, RBD2, or RBD1-RBD2 and run on the gel. Binding of RBD1 to T4-3 was observed, whereas that of RBD2 was not detected under the experimental conditions applied (Fig. 1A). From the densitometric analysis of the results, the dissociation constant for the RBD1-RNA complex was determined to be 3–9 μm. Binding of RBD1-RBD2 to T4-3 was also observed (Fig. 1B), and the dissociation constant was determined to be 40–88 nm. Resonance Assignments and Structure Calculations for RBD1—Sequential assignments of the main chain and side chain 1H and 15N resonances of RBD1 were made in the same way as reported for RBD2 (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The assignments of the main chain HN and N resonances, together with those of Hϵ2 and Nϵ2 of Gln residues and Hϵ1 and Nϵ1 of a Trp residue, are presented in Fig. 2. The structures of RBD1 were calculated on the basis of distance and dihedral angle constraints. The structural statistics are shown in Table I. The backbone root mean square deviation of the 15 final structures versus the mean structure was 0.49 ± 0.10 Å for the 21–95 region, excluding less well defined loop 3 (53–62) and loop 4 (69–71).Table IStructural statistics for RBD1 of Musashi115 refined structuresX-PLOR energies (kcal/mol)E total288 ± 11E bond15 ± 1E angle140 ± 6E improper19 ± 1E vdw28 ± 3E NOE85 ± 5E cdih0.47 ± 0.25r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.0033 ± 0.0001Angles (deg.)0.610 ± 0.013Impropers (deg.)0.421 ± 0.013r.m.s.d. from experimental constraintsDistances (Å)0.043 ± 0.001Dihedral angles (degrees)0.403 ± 0.101NOE violationsNumber of violations greater than 0.4 Å0 ± 0Dihedral angle violationsNumber of violations greater than 4 degrees0 ± 0Ramachandran analysis for 21-95 region residuesIn most favored regions (%)58.8In additional favored regions (%)33.7In generously allowed regions (%)6.4In disallowed regions (%)1.1r.m.s.d. of 15 refined structures versus mean structure (Å) for 21-95 regionexcluding loop 3 (53-62) and loop 4 (69-71)Backbone atoms (Å)0.49 ± 0.10All heavy atoms (Å)0.95 ± 0.11a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Structure of RBD1— Fig. 3A shows a stereo view of superposition of the 15 final structures of RBD1. Fig. 3B shows a stereo view of the restrained energy minimized mean structure of RBD1. RBD1 exhibits typical RNP-type fold, a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1, Lys-21–Gly-25; β2, Val-46–Met-52; β3, Phe-63-Phe-68; and β4, Asp-91–Ala-95) packed against two α-helices (α1, Gln-33–Phe-43; and α2, Ala-72–Ala-79), as observed for RBD2 (Fig. 3C) (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, a short antiparallel β-sheet (Glu-84–Leu-85:Lys-88–Thr-89) was identified in loop 5 located between α2 and β4. A similar short β-sheet was identified for the other RNP-type RBDs of hnRNP D0 (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Nagata T. Kurihara Y. Matsuda G. Saeki J. Kohno T. Yanagida Y. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A β-bulge structure was found in the Val-46–Glu-48 region of β2, which is common to most RNP-type RBDs. Phe-23, Phe-63, and Phe-65 of RBD1 form a hydrophobic patch exposed to the solvent, as observed for Phe-112, Phe-152, and Phe-154 of RBD2 (Fig. 3, B and C). The backbone root mean square deviation between RBD1 and RBD2 for the β1 to β4 region, which is shown in Fig. 3, was 2.2 Å, excluding loop 3. It should be added that the right-handed twist of the β1- and β3-strands of RBD1 is slightly greater than that in the case of RBD2. The Mode of Interaction with RNA of RBD1— Fig. 4A shows chemical shift perturbations of RBD1 on binding of one of the target sequences identified through in vitro selection, r(GUUAGUUAGUUAGUU) (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For comparison, those of RBD2 are shown in Fig. 4B. The perturbations were observed on the β-sheet side, not on the opposite side composed of two α-helices. Residues interacting with RNA or present near the binding interface are expected to exhibit relatively large perturbations. It is apparent that the interaction with RNA takes place on the β-sheet side of RBD1 as in the case of RBD2. Although the binding of RBD2 to RNA was not detected in gel retardation experiments (Fig. 1A), it was detected with NMR (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This is explained by the fact that higher RBD2 and RNA concentrations and the absence of salts and a detergent for NMR experiments facilitate the formation of the complex (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this sense, NMR is a suitable method for the characterization of a weak interaction that is hard to detect by means of biochemical methods. Comparison of Surface Electrostatic Potentials between RBD1 and RBD2—The surface electrostatic potential of the β-sheet side, which interacts with RNA, was calculated for RBD1 and RBD2 and compared (Fig. 5). Notably, the β-sheet surface of RBD1 is entirely positively charged, whereas that of RBD2 is largely neutral. It was confirmed that these characters are seen for all final structures of RBD1 and RBD2. RNA is negatively charged due to phosphate groups. Thus, from the viewpoint of electrostatic interactions, RBD1 is expected to bind RNA more strongly than RBD2. Backbone Dynamics of RBD1 and RBD2—To shed light from a dynamical point of view on the recognition of RNA by Musashi1, the backbone dynamics of RBD1 and RBD2 were analyzed quantitatively, in the same way as described in detail for another RNP-type RBD (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Examination of the concentration-dependence of the 15N T2 value confirmed that RBD1 and RBD2 are in a monomeric form at the protein concentrations of 0.4 and 0.6 mm, respectively. Model-free analysis was performed for relaxation data recorded at these concentrations. First, it was found that an axially symmetric diffusion model can well describe the overall rotational diffusion of both RBD1 and RBD2. Three relaxation data, R 1(= 1/T 1), R 2(= 1/T 2), and NOE, were fitted for each RBD with five models consisting of the following subsets of extended model-free parameters: 1) S 2; 2) S 2 and τ e ; 3) S 2 and R ex; 4) S 2, τ e , and R ex; and 5) Sf2 , S 2, and τ e , where S 2 is the square of a generalized order parameter, τ e an effective correlation time, R ex is a chemical exchange term, and Sf2 is the square of an order parameter for an internal motion on a fast time scale (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar, 34Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 35Clore G.M. Szabo A.

Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The numbers of residues fitting each model were as follows for RBD1: 1) 10, 2) 5, 3) 12, 4) 25, and 5) 13 residues. Those for RBD2 were as follows: 1) 15, 2) 5, 3) 5, 4) 28, and 5) 10 residues. The results of analyses of the backbone dynamics are summarized in Fig. 6, residues being mapped that require either a chemical exchange term, R ex, greater than 1 s–1, or a two-time scale spectral density function with a correlation time for slow internal motion, τ s. R ex and τ s represent the flexibility on the milli- and pico- to nanosecond time scales, respectively. It is notable that the two central β-strands, β1 and β3, of RBD1 exhibit flexibility on either the milli- or pico- to nanosecond time scale, whereas those of RBD2 do not. The mouse Musashi1 protein is drawing great attention because of its possible dominant role in regulation of the self-renewal and neuronal potential retention of neural stem cells in the developing nervous system (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). It is supposed that Musashi1 translationally regulates the expression of a certain gene such as numb, which is involved in Notch signaling, through interaction with mRNA of that gene (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Musashi1 possesses two RBDs, RBD1 and RBD2. Despite the high sequence homology between them, RBD1 binds to target RNA much more strongly than RBD2. Here, we have elucidated the mechanism underlying the higher affinity of RBD1 to RNA. The study also suggests how Musashi1 is able to bind to the target RNA effectively. Although a short antiparallel β-sheet has been detected exclusively for RBD1, a similar β-sheet-like structure has also been found for RBD2 (25Nagata T. Kanno R. Kurihara Y. Uesugi S. Imai T. Sakakibara S. Okano H. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the fold is essentially identical for RBD1 and RBD2, a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet being packed against two α-helices (Fig. 3, B and C). Either the Phe or Tyr residue is conserved at the positions of Phe-23 and Phe-65 of RBD1 (Phe-112 and Phe-154 of RBD2) in RNP-type RBDs (20Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 21Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 37Merrill B.M. Stone K.L. Cobianch F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3307-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stacking interactions of these residues of RNP-type RBDs with the bases of the target RNA are one of the major forces for the stabilization of a protein-RNA complex. In fact, mouse Musashi1 and Drosophila Musashi with the mutation of these residues cannot bind to RNA (5Okabe M. Imai T. Kurusu M. Hiromi Y. Okano H. Nature. 2001; 411: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although the orientations of the aromatic rings of Phe-23 and Phe-65 of RBD1 are somehow different from those of Phe-112 and Phe-154 of RBD2, all of these rings are exposed to the solvent for the achievement of the stacking interactions with bases on the β-sheet. A slightly greater right-handed twist of the β1- and β3-strands was observed for RBD1 in comparison with that of RBD2. We noticed a similar difference between RBD1 and RBD2 of an RNP-type U1A protein on inspection of their structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. It is interesting that in the cases of both proteins, RBD1, which exhibits higher affinity to RNA, exhibits a slightly greater right-handed twist of the β1- and β3-strands. The greater twist of these β-strands may be favorable for amino acid residues to interact with RNA. The mode of interaction with the target RNA is also identical for RBD1 and RBD2 of Musashi1 in the sense that the β-sheet is the interactive surface (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, studies on the protein fold and mode of interaction with RNA have left the origin of the higher affinity of RBD1 to RNA to be answered largely from different viewpoints. It is notable that the surface electrostatic potential of the β-sheet, which interacts with RNA, differs drastically between RBD1 and RBD2, despite the essentially identical fold (Fig. 5, A and B). The positive surface potential is prevailing for the β-sheet side of RBD1. On the other hand, the surface potential of the β-sheet side of RBD2 is largely neutral, and even the negative surface potential has been found for some portions. Apparently, the electrostatic character of RBD1 is favorable for the binding of negatively charged RNA as compared with that of RBD2. Thus, the higher affinity of RBD1 to RNA can be accounted for from the electrostatic viewpoint of the interactive surface. The amino acid residues that contribute to the formation of the positive surface for the β-sheet side of RBD1 are mostly conserved in RBD2. In the case of RBD1, the side chains of basic residues, Arg and Lys, are located on the β-sheet, where they form a large positive surface area, those of acidic residues, Asp and Glu, being spread away from the β-sheet without disturbing the positive surface. In the case of RBD2, on the other hand, the side chains of basic residues are spread away from the β-sheet, and those of some acidic residues are located on the β-sheet, which results in the mostly neutral and even partially negative surface of the β-sheet. In this way, the drastic difference in the surface electrostatic potential arises. A remarkable difference between RBD1 and RBD2 of Musashi1 was also noticed in dynamics. In particular, the central two β-strands, β1 and β3, of RBD1 exhibit flexibility on either the milli- or pico- to nanosecond time scale, whereas those of RBD2 do not (Fig. 6, A and B). The two Phe residues (Phe-23 and Phe-65 of RBD1 and Phe-112 and Phe-154 of RBD2) located in β1 and β3, respectively, undergo key stacking interactions with RNA bases, as described earlier. Thus, the flexibility of RBD1 may be utilized in the recognition process because it allows different conformational states to be accessed and facilitates an induced fit. In fact, the utilization of flexibility in recognition has been reported for other RNP-type RBDs, U1A and hnRNP D (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Mittermaier A. Varani L. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the flexibility of Musashi1 RBD1 may be favorable for the induction of ideal mutual positioning for strong stacking between the aromatic rings of the Phe residues and RNA bases. The flexibility of RBD1 may also be utilized by other residues to interact with RNA. On the other hand, the lack of flexibility of the β1- and β3-strands of Musashi1 RBD2 may restrict the induction of ideal mutual positioning of the Phe rings and RNA bases, which may result in weaker binding. The chemical shift perturbations of Phe-23 and Phe-65 of RBD1 are large, ∼80 and 110 Hz, respectively. Although the perturbation of Phe-112 of RBD2 is relatively large, ∼75 Hz, that of Phe-154 of RBD2 is rather small, ∼30 Hz. These results seem to be consistent with the idea of the better stacking for RBD1, although the backbone NH group, which is located relatively far from the side chain aromatic ring, is occasionally not a good indicator as to stacking interactions (28Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher affinity of RBD1 to RNA can also be rationalized from a dynamical viewpoint. The β1- and β3-strands approximately correspond to the RNP2 hexamer and RNP1 octamer sequences, respectively, both of which are highly conserved in RNP-type RBDs. Therefore, the difference in flexibility of the β1- and β3-strands between the two RBDs is not brought about by the sequence difference, but is supposed to originate from the global character of the proteins. r(GUUAGUUAGUUAGUU) (T4-3) comprises at least two consensus sequences, (G/A)U n AGU (n = 1–3), tandemly, and even three consensus sequences tandemly if overlapping is allowed. The chemical shift perturbation experiment to detect the interactions was also carried out with r(GUUAGUU), which only possesses a single consensus sequence. The perturbations obtained with r(GUUAGUU) were almost the same as those with r(GUUAGUUAGUUAGUU) (data not shown). This suggests that the binding of a single RBD can be achieved at a single consensus sequence. Musashi1 binds to numb mRNA and translationally regulates the expression of the numb gene (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The putative binding sequence of Musashi1 present in numb mRNA, r(GUAGUAGU), is composed of two consensus sequences arranged tandemly in an overlapped way (16Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). When Musashi1 comprising both RBD1 and RBD2 binds to numb mRNA, it is supposed that RBD1 and RBD2 tandemly bind to the two consensus sequences, respectively. In this case, RBD1, the affinity of which to RNA is much higher than that of RBD2, may play a primary role in the binding. However, although the affinity of RBD2 to RNA is much lower, RBD2 may still be able to play a certain role. For example, even if the dissociation constant of an RBD2-RNA complex is 10–3m, the joining of RBD2 to RBD1 theoretically could increase the affinity by 1000 times maximally. Actually, it was shown experimentally that the joining of RBD2 to RBD1 increased the affinity to T4-3 by ∼100-fold (dissociation constants: 3–9 μm to 40–88 nm), as described previously. This increase in affinity may be necessary for the regulation of the numb gene by Musashi1. Thus, the contribution of RBD2 could potentially be critical. There is another possibility that if the affinity of RBD2 to RNA is as high as that of RBD1, Musashi1 may bind to numb mRNA too strongly for turn over. Thus, the lower affinity of RBD2 may be suitable for Musashi1 to exert a biological function. In this context, it was interesting to find that the affinity of RBD to RNA can be easily tuned by changing the surface electrostatic potential and/or the backbone dynamics, the fold itself remaining unchanged. The assumption with a structural genomics approach is that the function of a protein can be deduced from its structure. This reminds us of the necessity of being aware that although the fold of RBD1 and RBD2 is essentially identical, their affinity to RNA is drastically different. To deduce the function of a protein, the surface electrostatic potential and backbone dynamics should also be considered, together with fold. We thank Dr. Y. Kurihara and T.

In their inactive state, translocons are saturated with ribosomes and SecA protein, reflecting the inherent affinity of these components for one another. We found that SecA and ribosomes are bound simultaneously and noncompetitively to a common set of inactive translocons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at a later stage in binding, SecA possesses a ribosome-translocon dissociation activity that is coupled to its ATP-dependent membrane insertion and retraction cycle that drives protein translocation. This novel activity is presumably important in the commitment of the translocon to the Sec-dependent pathway. These results also provide a rationale for the compatibility and regulation of multiple protein translocation pathways that each makes distinct demands on a common translocon core.

Organisms contain multiple protein translocation pathways for targeting proteins into and across their membrane systems. In bacteria, signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; AMPPNP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate; IMV, inverted membrane vesicles.1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; AMPPNP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate; IMV, inverted membrane vesicles. and its receptor and SecA and its partner chaperone SecB comprise two major pathways for the insertion of membrane proteins and the translocation of secretory proteins (see Refs. 1Driessen A.J.M.

These two pathways converge at the translocon, which consists of the heterotrimeric SecYEG protein that appears to form a protein-conducting channel (3Valent Q. Scotti P.

SecYEG is homologous to the Sec61p complex that is present in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes (10Pohlschroder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Bacterial SRP and SRP receptor consist of Ffh (P48)/4.5 S RNA and FtsY components, respectively; they are homologous to the 54-kDa subunit/7 S RNA and α-subunit of eukaryotic SRP and SRP receptor, respectively (11Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D.

Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The SRP-dependent pathway promotes the co-translational targeting of nascent chain-ribosome complexes to the translocon, where the ribosome can form a tight seal with the translocon by alignment of the peptide exit tunnel of the large ribosomal subunit with the translocon channel (13Liao S.

By contrast, SecA and SecB promote both co-translational and post-translational protein translocation, where SecB transfers its bound protein substrate to SecA, which then undergoes multiple ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and retraction at SecYEG to promote the stepwise translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane (16Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. van der Wolk J.P.W.

Analysis to date suggests that the SRP and SecA-dependent pathways transport membrane and secretory protein substrates, respectively (14Scotti P. Valent Q. Manting E. Urbanus M. Driessen A. Oudega B.

However, certain membrane proteins also require SecA for their biogenesis, and the two pathways may act consecutively or in concert with one another, making the rules that distinguish such differential targeting unclear presently (20Qi H.-Y.

Both purified SecA and ribosomes display high affinity binding activity for the translocon. Studies with proteoliposomes indicated that no additional components were necessary for this interaction, since purified SecYEG protein was sufficient to restore high affinity translocon-binding activity for both SecA and ribosomes (23Brundage L.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of SecA, this activity resides within its N-domain, which is homologous to DEAD helicase motor domains and consists of two nucleotide-binding domains that flank a substrate protein-binding site (25Hartl F.-U.

The high affinity nucleotide-binding domain of SecA has been shown to regulate both its substrate protein-binding and release cycle along with its membrane insertion and retraction cycle (29van Voorst F.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). By contrast, the C-domain of SecA mediates dimerization, low affinity binding to anionic phospholipids, and SecB association (31Hirano M. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Breukink E. Nouwen N. van Raalte A. Mizushima S. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol.

In the case of ribosomes, high affinity translocon-binding activity has been shown to be a highly conserved property, since ribosomes from Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammals bound to heterologous translocons with similar affinities (24Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding was found to reside within 28 or 23 S rRNA of eukaryotes or prokaryotes, respectively. Since both SecA and ribosomes have nanomolar affinity for the translocon and are considerably in excess of translocons in vivo (∼10-fold for SecA and >10-fold for ribosomes (33Matsuyama S.-I. Fujita Y. Sagara K. Mizushima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34Neidhardt F.C. Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Vol. I. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 13-16Google Scholar)), a number of interesting questions arise. (i) Are SecA and ribosome binding at the translocon mutually exclusive or not? (ii) Has a mechanism evolved to remove potentially interfering ribosomes or SecA from translocons being targeted for protein translocation by another pathway? (iii) Do translocon-bound ribosomes or SecA serve any significant function when the protein-conducting channel is not occupied? We have performed a biochemical analysis of this system for the SecA-dependent pathway in order to address these questions.

SecA and ribosomes were labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences), utilizing the IODOGEN direct method, to a specific activity of 0.5 × 106 to 1.0 × 106 cpm/pmol or 0.8 × 106 to 1.2 × 106 cpm/pmol, respectively, and filtered through a Micro BioSpin P-6 column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (27Dapic V.

The chimeric preprotein PSN, composed of the E. coli alkaline phosphatase signal sequence and mature portion of Staphylococcal nuclease with K97C and W140H substitutions, was prepared as described previously (37Cabelli R.J.

Pro-OmpA was prepared as described previously (38Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Membrane Binding Assays—Binding assays (100 μl) containing 10-μg membrane protein equivalents of urea-treated IMV and the indicated concentrations of 125I-SecA or 125I-ribosomes in buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NH4Cl, 2.5 mm Mg(OAC)2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were incubated on ice for 15 min, when they were overlaid onto an equal volume of buffer A containing 0.2 m sucrose and sedimented at 320,000 × g in a Sorvall RC M100 microultracentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was rinsed with 200 μl of buffer A followed by quantification of pellet-bound radioactivity with a γ-counter (Beckman 5500). In Vitro Protein Translocation and SecA ATPase Assays—For analysis of pro-OmpA translocation, 100-μl reactions contained 10 μlof10× TL buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2), SecA (50 μg/ml), SecB (66 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml), ATP (2 mm), NADH (5 mm), CK1801.4 urea-treated IMV (100 μg/ml), and 70 S E. coli ribosomes (100 nm) where indicated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a mixture of 125I-pro-OmpA (5 × 105 cpm/ml) and pro-OmpA (32 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were transferred to ice and digested with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 15 min. Protein was precipitated by the addition of 75 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For SecA ATPase activity assays, 25-μl reactions contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, SecA dimer (0.2 μm), CK1801 IMV (50 μg of membrane protein/ml) (for membrane and translocation ATPase activity), PSN (20 μm) (for translocation ATPase activity), and ribosomes (100 nm) where indicated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (4 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. ATPase activity was determined using the malachite green colorimetric method (39Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (40Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Noncompetitive Binding of SecA and Ribosomes to SecYEG Protein—Purified 125I-labeled SecA and 70 S ribosomes were prepared and bound to IMV that had been previously treated with urea in order to remove and inactivate endogenous SecA protein (25Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Our results were consistent with previous studies both from our laboratory and others with respect to SecA and ribosome affinity and maximum binding capacity of IMV for these components (Fig. 1, A and B) (24Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Variation of our incubation and sedimentation conditions indicated that the binding reaction had reached equilibrium and that IMV separation was specific with less than 2% contamination with unbound SecA or ribosomes (data not shown). In order to demonstrate that binding was specific for SecYEG protein, IMV were prepared from a strain that overproduced SecYEG (IMV-SecYEG++). Western blot analysis of such IMV showed that they contained an ∼5-fold higher level of SecY protein than wild-type IMV (data not shown). In addition, these IMV displayed a 3-fold higher level of SecA-dependent translocation ATPase activity than wild-type IMV, in keeping with their higher SecY protein content. Translocation ATPase activity requires binding of SecA to both a substrate protein and SecYE in order to activate the SecA ATPase cycle (41Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Analysis of SecA and ribosome binding to IMV-SecYEG++ showed that binding affinities were similar to wild-type IMV, but the maximum binding capacity was increased ∼3-fold, consistent with the higher level of translocation ATPase activity observed with these membranes (Fig. 1, C and D). Finally, in order to have a second means of demonstrating translocon-specific binding, we investigated the binding of SecA and ribosomes to IMV prepared from a strain that contains the prlA4 allele of secY that has been reported to increase the affinity of SecY for SecA protein (42van der Wolk J. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J. Silhavy T. Driessen A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that SecA affinity for these IMV was increased more than 5-fold compared with IMV from the isogenic prlA + strain, whereas ribosome affinity was increased only 2.8-fold in this case (Fig. 1, E and F). This latter result indicates that the prlA4 mutation affects both SecA and ribosome binding, but it does so differentially. This circumstance could arise by either a local or more global change in the conformation of SecY protein, and it need not indicate a shared binding site within a particular region of SecY. In order to determine whether SecA and ribosomes have overlapping translocon-binding sites or sterically interfere with one another during binding, we performed competition-binding assays. Either SecA or ribosomes were prebound to IMV at various concentrations, followed by the binding of the 125I-labeled other species. Our results indicate that neither SecA nor ribosomes compete with each other for translocon association (Fig. 2, A and B). Binding assays in which various ratios of SecA and ribosomes were added simultaneously to IMV displayed identical results, and in each case SecA or ribosome affinity and maximum binding capacity was unchanged in the presence of the competing species (data not shown). The fact that the binding affinity was unchanged makes it unlikely that either SecA or the ribosome engaged in “piggyback” binding to one another rather than in direct translocon association. However, in order to rule against this possibility, we determined whether SecA and ribosomes interact with each other in solution under mild conditions. For this purpose, 125I-labeled ribosomes were incubated with biotinylated SecA, and the mixture was specifically separated utilizing NeutraAvidin beads that were subjected to several washing and sedimentation steps. These studies indicated that greater than 95% of ribosomes were not associated with SecA, the latter of which was bound specifically and quantitatively to the NeutraAvidin beads under our experimental conditions (Table I and data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that both SecA and ribosomes bind independently to a common set of translocons in order to have equivalent maximal binding capacities. Additional studies described below strongly support this conclusion.Table ISecA and ribosomes do not interact in solution SecA was biotinylated utilizing 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) (Molecular Probes) as described previously (57Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 100-μl reactions in buffer A containing 200 nm125I-labeled ribosomes and 200 nm SecA or biotinylated SecA protein, as indicated, were incubated on ice for 15 min and then added to 300 μl of NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce). The slurry was shaken at 4°C for 90 min, followed by sedimentation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in a 5415C Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant (Low salt) was collected, and the pellet was washed consecutively in a 400-μl volume of buffer A containing 300 mm KCl (Medium salt) or 1 m KCl (High salt), followed by resedimentation and final isolation of the NeutrAvidin-bound fraction (Pellet). Western blot analysis of the fractions with horseradish peroxidase-strepavidin conjugate or SecA antisera indicated that nearly all of the biotinylated SecA was in the final NeutrAvidin-bound pellet, whereas nearly all of the unlabeled SecA was in the original supernatant fraction (data not shown).MPB labelSecAFractionRibosomes%——Low salt84——Medium salt12——High salt2.7——Pellet1.3—+Low salt83—+Medium salt12—+High salt3.1—+Pellet1.5++Low salt86++Medium salt10++High salt2.2++Pellet1.5 Open table in a new tab SecA Possesses a Ribosome-Translocon Dissociation Activity— It seemed probable to us that stable association of the ribosome with the translocon would interfere with the SRP-dependent protein translocation pathway, since it would ultimately block targeting of nascent chain-ribosome complexes to the translocon. Likewise, such a circumstance could also interfere with the Sec pathway, since a bound ribosome could limit the conformational flexibility of the translocon that is needed to promote SecA function particularly during its insertion and retraction cycle (30Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, since both pathways function well in vivo despite such theoretical concerns, it seemed likely that the cell may possess a mechanism(s) for dealing with the potential difficulty. In order to investigate whether translocon-bound ribosomes interfere with SecA function, we made use of a simple in vitro protein translocation system consisting of purified preprotein, SecA, ribosomes, and IMV. Prebinding of ribosomes to IMV at a 3-fold excess over saturation did not interfere with SecA-dependent protein translocation (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 7). Furthermore, the presence of such translocon-bound ribosomes did not interfere with either SecA-dependent membrane or translocation ATPase activities (Fig. 4). These two activities require SecA association with SecYE or SecYE and an export-competent preprotein, respectively, in order to activate SecA ATPase activity (43Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Ribosomes do not inhibit SecA ATPase activities. SecA endogenous, membrane, and translocation ATPase activity assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were conducted in the absence (open bars) or presence (filled bars) of 100 nm ribosomes. Each bar represents the average of triplicate assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It seemed implausible to us that ribosomes would remain bound to translocons during SecA membrane cycling, since both entities would need access to the translocon channel. Accordingly, these preliminary experiments suggested to us that SecA might possess a novel ribosome-translocon dissociation activity. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we measured whether SecA could dissociate translocon-bound ribosomes during protein translocation conditions. For this purpose, 125I-labeled ribosomes were prebound to IMV, followed by the addition of the components required to promote SecA-dependent protein translocation. In addition, we also included a 10-fold excess of unlabeled ribosomes in this mixture to act as a ribosomal “sink” to prevent the rebinding of 125I-labeled ribosomes to IMV. Our results show that fully 73% of ribosomes were released from the translocon during protein translocation conditions, and such release was dependent on the addition of SecA, pro-OmpA, and ATP, the requisites for this reaction (Fig. 5A). The observed extent of ribosomal release is consistent with a minor fraction of nonspecifically bound 125I-labeled ribosomes at the concentration that we employed here (just under saturation) as well as the fact that our ribosomal sink was only at a 10-fold higher concentration than 125I-labeled ribosomes. In addition, since urea treatment of IMV leaves inactive SecA bound to a portion of translocons (44Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that such translocons were poorly active for SecA-dependent protein translocation and ribosomal release. We also noted that there was a minor but significant release of ribosomes in the presence of SecA and ATP alone, suggesting that such release may be mediated by the so called “default” (preprotein-independent) membrane-cycling mode of SecA that has been described previously (30Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We have tested this latter inference, and our results are described below. The foregoing data lent strong support to our hypothesis that both ribosomes and SecA were simultaneously bound to a common set of translocons in order to observe SecA-dependent ribosome dissociation. However, in order to more rigorously explore this idea, we measured the extent of ribosomal release during a single round of SecA insertion. It has been previously shown that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs such as AMP-PNP can promote SecA-membrane insertion and that the inserted state can be further stabilized by inclusion of sodium azide, an inhibitor of SecA ATPase activity and the membrane deinsertion reaction (30Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 44Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore, 125I-labeled ribosomes were prebound to IMV, followed by the addition of SecA under conditions that promote its stable membrane insertion, and the amount of membrane-bound ribosomes was determined. Our results indicate that up to 70% of translocon-bound ribosomes were released under these conditions, and such release was dependent on SecA, AMP-PNP, and azide, conditions that stabilize translocon-inserted SecA protein (Fig. 5A). This level of dissociation was equivalent to that observed under conditions of normal SecA-dependent protein translocation. Neither AMPPNP nor azide alone in the presence of SecA promoted a significant level of ribosome release. The poor release activity observed in the presence of SecA and AMP-PNP suggested to us that ribosome dissociation might not occur immediately upon SecA insertion, so that quantitative release of ribosomes required stabilization of the inserted state of SecA that only occurs in the presence of azide (44Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Significant deinsertion of SecA has been observed previously when only AMP-PNP is present as indicated by the exchangeability of this translocon-associated species with exogenously added SecA (e.g. see Fig. 6 of Ref. 17Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The combined action of AMP-PNP and azide was shown to greatly increase the level of steady state translocon-inserted SecA protein (44Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple attachment points between the ribosome and the translocon, which was recently observed for the eukaryotic system, may also enhance ribosomal stability at the translocon (46Menetret K.E.

We were able to assess the kinetics of the dissociation reaction, since translocon-bound ribosomes were stable in the presence of bound SecA protein as long as AMP-PNP and azide were not p"

PAK2 is activated by autophosphorylation upon binding of small G proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac in the GTP-bound state. However, the mechanism of PAK2 autophosphorylation in vitro is unclear. In the present study, the kinetic theory of the substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity has been applied to a study of the autoactivation of PAK2. On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction during the autophosphorylation of PAK2, the activation rate constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex have been determined. The results indicate that 1) in the presence of Cdc42, PAK2 autophosphorylation is a bipartite mechanism, with the regulatory domain autophosphorylated at multiple residues, whereas activation coincides with autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain at Thr-402; 2) the autophosphorylation reactions in regulatory domain are either a nonlimiting step or not required for activation of enzyme; 3) the autophosphorylation at site Thr-402 on the catalytic domain occurs by an intermolecular mechanism and is required for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates examined; 4) binding of the exogenous protein/peptide substrates at the active site of PAK2 has little or no effect on the autoactivation of PAK2, suggesting that multiple regions of PAK2 are involved in the enzyme-substrate recognition. The present method also provides a novel approach for studying autophosphorylation reactions.

Protein phosphorylation is the most important post-translational modification mechanism utilized by eukaryotic cells to regulate various signal transduction pathways. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing this reaction are protein kinases. It is now proposed that there exist over 1000 different protein kinases in mammals, and approximately one every three proteins in mammalian cells is phosphorylated (1Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 50: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 3Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). In protein phosphorylation reactions, the terminal (γ) phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to specific serine and threonine residues by one class of protein kinases and transferred to specific tyrosine residues by another. Because of their central role in signal transduction, the regulation and function of protein kinases has been the subject of intense interest. Major insights for cellular signaling have been derived from studies of protein kinases, and it is common to view signaling pathways as cascades of protein kinase reactions. In addition to the phosphotransferase reaction between ATP and specific residues in other polypeptides, almost all protein kinases catalyze autophosphorylation reactions (i.e. reactions in which the kinase serves as its own substrate), which are frequently modulated by regulatory ligands. The significance of autophosphorylation may be apparent in many cases, but, as with phosphorylation of some protein substrates, autophosphorylation may have no function effect (i.e. silent phosphorylation) and could reflect the availability of substrate sequence similar to that in the actual target proteins, or it may reflect the lack of absolute specificity (4Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation reactions can either be an intra- or intermolecular event, dependent upon the kinase. In some cases, both routes have been proposed for the same enzyme. The simplest intramolecular autophosphorylation is a first-order reaction and therefore can be described by the single exponential kinetic equation. In contrast, the intermolecular autophosphorylation is a bimolecular autocatalytic event. In addition to modulation by other regulatory ligands, the rate of intermolecular autophosphorylation is dependent on the concentration of protein kinase and thereby provides an alternative means for regulating particular biological processes (5Wang Z.X. Wu J.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 947-952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MBP, bovine myelin basic protein; LIMKtide, KPDRKKRYTVVGNPY; RAFtide, IRPRGQRDSSYYWEI; PAKtide, TPEQSKRSTMVGTPY.1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MBP, bovine myelin basic protein; LIMKtide, KPDRKKRYTVVGNPY; RAFtide, IRPRGQRDSSYYWEI; PAKtide, TPEQSKRSTMVGTPY. are members of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases defined by their interaction with the small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac (6Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 363: 364-367Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At present, six major members of the PAK family have been identified in mammalian cells (8Kumar F. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All PAKs consist of a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain containing a GTPase binding domain and an inhibitory domain. PAKs play an important role in diverse cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, growth/apoptotic signal transduction through mitogen-activated protein kinases, and regulation of transcription factors (9Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, PAK2 is a substrate of caspase and may be cleaved and activated by it (13Rudel T. Bokoch G.B. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The activated PAK2 is able to induce some of the morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of programmed cell death (14Rudel T Zenke F.T. Chuang T.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 7-11PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bokoch G.M. Cell. Death Differ. 1998; 5: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The requirement for PAK kinase activity in such diverse processes underscores the importance of understanding the molecular basis for regulation of PAK activity. Based on the structural and architectural similarities, the PAK family can be categorized into two subgroups. The first group includes the closely related human PAK1, human PAK2, mouse PAK3, and the corresponding rat homologues α-PAK, γ-PAK, and β-PAK, respectively (16Brown J.L. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 17Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The most recently identified members of the PAK family are PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6, which fall into a second group of PAKs. PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6 are highly related to each other but show only about ∼50% identity to the GTPase binding domain and kinase domains of PAK1 to -3. Outside of this region, PAK4 to -6 are entirely different in sequence from other PAKs (19Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Dan C. Nath N. Liberto M. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Liu M.L. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although, all PAKs can interact with GTPases, not all PAKs are activated by such interaction. The GTPase interaction of PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3 by itself leads to activation of PAK1 to -3, whereas binding of GTPases to PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6 does not lead to their activation, suggesting that GTPases regulate PAKs of the second group distinct from that of the first group (22Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). PAK2 is activated by the binding of active Cdc42 and Rac to the GTPase binding domain, resulting in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues. However, there have been numerous inconsistencies concerning the mechanism of PAK2 autophosphorylation in vitro. Using the trypsin-cleaved PAK2, two autophosphorylation sites (Ser-197 and Thr-402) were identified. Based on the kinetic analysis of autophosphorylation reactions with enzyme dilution and the activation time course, Benner et al. (23Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) concluded that the phosphorylation of Thr-402 is most rapid, but activation does not occur until Ser-197 is autophosphorylated. The autophosphorylation of Thr-402 occurs by an intramolecular mechanism, whereas autophosphorylation of Ser-197 occurs by an intermolecular mechanism (23Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, using the caspase 3-cleaved γ-PAK, Walter et al. (24Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon R.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) found that the phosphorylation of Thr-402 parallels the activity of the kinase and therefore suggested that autophosphorylation events of this threonine are closely coupled to the activation process. When MnATP is used instead of MgATP, both Thr-402 in the activation loop of γ-PAK and exogenous substrates cannot be phosphorylated by MnATP, substantiating the idea that the activation loop requires intermolecular phosphorylation (25Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, Zenke et al. (26Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) also suggested that the intermolecular autophosphorylation of Thr-423 in PAK1 (equivalent to Thr-402 in PAK2) seems to be a key event for full activation of the enzyme. In this study, we have applied the kinetic theory of substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity (27Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 28Tsou C.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 381-436PubMed Google Scholar) to study the mechanism of PAK2 activation by autophosphorylation. On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction during the autocatalytic activation of PAK2, all microscopic kinetic constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate(s) complexes have been determined. Detailed analysis of the kinetic data enabled us to not only obtain the apparent rate constants for autoactivation of PAK2 activity from a single experiment but also to ascertain the effect of protein/peptide substrates on PAK2 autophosphorylation. The results indicate that 1) in the presence of Cdc42, PAK2 autophosphorylation is a bipartite mechanism, with the regulatory domain autophosphorylated at multiple residues, whereas activation coincides with autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain at Thr-402; 2) the autophosphorylation at site Thr-402 on the catalytic domain occurs by an intermolecular mechanism; 3) binding of the exogenous protein/peptide substrates at the active site of PAK2 has little or no effect on the rate of PAK2 autoactivation. Materials—ATP, bovine brain acetone powder, phospho(enol)pyruvate, NADH, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and urea (ultrapure) were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum, Grace's insect cell culture medium, and yeastolate solution were purchased from Invitrogen; MOPS and Tris were purchased from Roche Applied Science. All peptides were synthesized using a standard protocol, purified by reverse-phase preparative high pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry by ADI Inc. Other reagents were local products of analytical grade used without further purification. Double-deionized water was used throughout. Expression and Purification of Proteins—GST fusion human PAK2 was cloned into baculovirus vector and expressed in Sf9 cells. After 2–3 days of infection, culture Sf9 cells containing GST-PAK2 were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. The lysate was homogenized and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied onto a glutathione-Sepharose column, and the GST-PAK2 were eluted with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 10 mm glutathione (reduced). The purity of PAK2 was examined by Coomassie Blue staining SDS-PAGE, and no other bands were observed. The enzyme was stored at –70 °C and stable for at least 1 year. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A constitutively active Cdc42, GST-Cdc42L61, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to standard procedures using the affinity matrix glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The protein purity was judged to be over 95% by SDS-PAGE. The purified proteins were stored in 20% glycerol at –70 °C. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was isolated from brain acetone powder based on a published protocol (29Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentration determination was based on an extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid composition of bovine MBP, ϵ280 = 10,800 cm–1m–1 (30Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 182: 319-326Crossref Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Shi (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). Enzyme Assays—Enzyme activity of PAK2 was determined with the MBP as a substrate using a coupled spectrophotometric assay except where indicated (31Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The standard assay for PAK2 was carried out at 25 °C in 1.0 ml of reaction mixture containing 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm NADH, 1 mm phospho(enol)-pyruvate, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 15 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and different concentrations of substrates. Reactions were initiated by the addition of PAK2 to the reaction mixture. The progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by following the formation of NAD+ at 340 nm, on a Shimadzu UV2501PC14 spectrophotometer. The concentrations of ADP formed in the PAK2-catalyzed reaction were determined using an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6220 cm–1m–1 at 340 nm. The concentrations of substrates and PAK2 are given in the text or in the figure legends. The concentrations of peptides were determined by turnover with the GST-PAK2 under conditions of limiting peptides. Kinetic Analysis—In the presence of exogenous substrate, the general mechanism of the intermolecular autophosphorylation at low enzyme concentrations can be represented as follows, where E and E* represent unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme, and S and P represent exogenous substrate and its corresponding product, respectively. If we assume that 1) the enzymatic reaction is irreversible and not inhibited by the product formed, 2) the substrate concentration remains constant throughout the activity measurement, and 3) the steady state of the substrate reaction is rapidly established, application of the steady-state treatment to E*S gives rise to the equation, Km=[E*][S][E*S](Eq. 1) where Km = (k –1 + k 2)/k 1 is the Michaelis constant for the exogenous substrate. Given the following, [ET*]=[E*]+[E*S](Eq. 2) the total concentration of enzyme is as follows, [T]0=[E*]+[E*S]+[E]=[E*]0+[E]0(Eq. 3) where [E]0 and [E*]0 are the initial concentrations of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme, respectively. From Equations 1, 2, 3, we have the following. [E*]=Km[ET*]Km+[S](Eq. 4) [E*S]=[ET*][S]Km+[S](Eq. 5) The rate of the phosphorylated enzyme formation is given by the following, d[ET*]dtx0026;=k+0[E*][E]+k+0'[E*S][E]x0026;=k+0Km+k+0'[S]Km+[S][ET*][E]x0026;=kobs[ET*][E]=kobs[ET*]([T]0-[ET*])(Eq. 6) where kobs=(k+0Km+k+0'[S])/(Km+[S]). Equation 6 can be integrated to give the following. [ET*]=[E]0[T]0[E]0+([T]0-[E]0)e-kobs[T]0t(Eq. 7) The rate of product formation while the enzyme is being modified is as follows. d[P]dt=k2[E*S]x0026;=k2[S][ET*]Km+[S]x0026;=k2[S][E]0[T]0(Km+[S]){[E]0+([T]0-[E]0)e-kobs[T]0t}(Eq. 8) The concentration of product formed at time t is given by the equation, [P]=νskobs[T]0ln{1-α(1-ekobs[T]0t)}(Eq. 9) where α=[E*]0/[T]0(Eq. 10) νs=k2[T]0[S]Km+[S](Eq. 11) kobs=k+0Km+k+0'[S]Km+[S](Eq. 12) Note that when the consumption of substrate is negligible during the course of the reaction, k obs can be regarded as apparent rate constant of the following reaction. ET*+E→kobs2ET*Reaction1(Eq. 13) According to Equation 9, it can be verified that the relaxation time is given by the equation, τ=lnα(α-1)kobs[T]0(Eq. 14) In this case, the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the total enzyme concentration. Mechanism of PAK2 Autoactivation by Autophosphorylation—Recombinant PAK2 from humans was expressed in insect cell as GST-PAK2 and purified using affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose as described before (32Wu H. Zheng Y. Wang Z.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The PAK2 was obtained as an inactive enzyme and can be activated by autophosphorylation in the presence of Rho family small G proteins, Cdc42 or Rac. Previous study has shown that γ-PAK from rabbit is highly phosphorylated during activation (33Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Seven autophosphorylation sites on serine have been identified in the N-terminal regulatory domain by microsequence analysis. In the C-terminal catalytic domain, a single phosphothreonine is observed, Thr-402. The complete amino acid sequence of human PAK2 shares 97% identity with rabbit γ-PAK. Of the eight autophosphorylation sites identified in γ-PAK from rabbits, seven of the sites are present in PAK2, with Ser-165 replaced by proline (34Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, these sites were likely to be autophosphorylated when recombinant PAK2 was subjected to the same experimental protocol. Fig. 1 shows a time dependence of autophosphorylation of GST-PAK2. The GST-PAK2 (0.15 μm) was incubated with 1.5 mm ATP and 15 μm Cdc42L61 at 25 °C, and the reaction was analyzed at different time points by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The major product formed in 10 s of reaction was a partially phosphorylated enzyme, whereas only a low level of the fully phosphorylated enzyme was detected. When the rapid autophosphorylated PAK2 sample was examined in our assay system with MBP as a substrate, about 10% of the maximum autoactivated kinase activity was observed. The activity of PAK2 was probably due to a small amount of fully autophosphorylated and activated forms in the rapid autophosphorylated PAK2 sample, as suggested by the presence of trace amounts of fully phosphorylated PAK2 in lane 2 of Fig. 1. After 30 s of reaction, measurable levels of the fully phosphorylated PAK2 accumulated and reached maximal level in 2 min. The fully phosphorylated and activated enzyme ran as a single 98-kDa band on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, shifted by 14 kDa from the inactive form that ran 84 kDa. The GST moiety did not serve as a substrate of PAK2, since it was not phosphorylated under similar conditions (data not shown). To study the mechanism of GST-PAK2 autoactivation by autophosphorylation, the activation kinetics of PAK2 was determined at several lower enzyme concentrations. The autoactivation of GST-PAK2 was carried out in 1.0 ml of reaction mixture containing 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm ATP, and 0.5 μm Cdc42L61 at 25 °C. At defined time intervals, an aliquot was taken from the reaction mixture and assayed for enzyme activity. Kinase activity assays were carried out under kinetically valid conditions with MBP as a substrate. Fig. 2 shows time courses for PAK2 activation by autophosphorylation. A slight lag time for activation was observed. When the activation time course was measured at several enzyme dilutions, the time required for activation increased at greater enzyme dilutions, suggesting that the activation process of PAK2 is related to the intermolecular autophosphorylation events. The maximum PAK2 kinase activity is proportional to the enzyme concentration in reaction solution. If only one autophosphorylation site on the catalytic domain of PAK2 is critical for kinase activity, the simplest mechanism to describe autocatalytic reaction at low enzyme concentrations is given by the following second-order mechanism, E*+E→k+02E*Reaction2(Eq. 15) where k +0 is an apparent second-order rate constant for the full-length PAK2. The reaction rate is given by the equation, d[E*]dt=k+0[E*][E](Eq. 16) which can be solved to give the following. 1([E*]0+[E]0)ln[E*]0[E][E*][E]0=-k+0t(Eq. 17) If the inactive PAK2 preparation contains trace amounts of phosphorylated active enzyme, the initial concentrations of active and inactive enzyme species can be written as [E*]0 = α[T]0 and [E]0 = (1 – α)[T]0, where α is a constant and [T]0 is the total concentration of active plus inactive enzyme. Thus, Equation 15 can then be written as follows. [E*]=α[T]0α+(1-α)e-k+0[T]0t(Eq. 18) The time courses for PAK2 autoactivation at three different enzyme concentrations can be analyzed by global fitting procedure simultaneously. At a fixed ATP concentration of 1.5 mm, the values of k +0 and α were determined to be 1.5 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 and 0.12 ± 0.01, respectively. Collectively, the data show that in the presence of Cdc42L61, the autophosphorylation of PAK2 is a bipartite mechanism. First, the autophosphorylation of the enzyme at multiple sites occurs rapidly and precedes activation of the enzyme. The activation of the enzyme is correlated to a slow autophosphorylation at the critical site(s). Time course of autoactivation can be well described with a second-order reaction, suggesting that this reaction occurs by an intermolecular mechanism. Kinetics of Substrate Reaction during Autocatalytic Activation of PAK2—Inside the cell, PAK2 is surrounded with various protein/peptide substrates. Therefore, it is of interest to obtain information about the effect of exogenous substrates on the autophosphorylation of PAK2. In the present study, we applied the kinetic theory of the substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity (27Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 28Tsou C.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 381-436PubMed Google Scholar) to the study of the autophosphorylation process of PAK2. Because only a catalytic amount of enzyme is required, this method allows extraction of kinetic parameters for the autophosphorylation of PAK2 from its effect on the exogenous substrate reactions. To characterize the kinetic properties of PAK2 autophosphorylation, the preliminary experiment for an autophosphorylation system is to follow the full time course of the reaction as a function of enzyme concentration. MBP was used for PAK2 assay. The phosphorylation of MBP (169 amino acids) by PAK2 has been mapped to single site Ser-55 (25Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and this protein was shown previously to be a good substrate for PAK2. Fig. 3A shows the progress curves of product formation at different enzyme concentrations. The activation rates of PAK2 increase with increasing concentrations of PAK2. The progress curves start off the lag phases but go up with increasing time due to the activation of PAK2. When reaction time is sufficiently large, the curves approach straight lines. Preincubation of PAK2 with MgATP and Cdc42L16 led to a linear progress curve (see Fig. 3A, control). Such linearity indicates that 1) the coupling enzyme is in sufficient quantity to ensure actual measurement of the primary enzyme's behavior and 2) the substrate consumption can be neglected, and the initial rate conditions are satisfied during activity measurement. The relaxation times were determined from the intersection of the asymptotes for the initial and final steady-state phases of progress curves. Indicated are those portions of the curve from which initial velocity and final velocity can be obtained. The abscissa value of the intercept of the two lines gives the value of the relaxation time. The inset of Fig. 3A shows a plot of the relaxation time, τ, against the total concentration of enzyme. With an increase in the concentration of PAK2, the relaxation time decreases. The relaxation time decreased from 1000 to 250 s when the concentration of PAK2 was increased from 1.5 to 7.5 nm. If activation is determined by intramolecular autophosphorylation only, the activation progress curves can be described by a single exponential equation, and the relaxation time should be independent of the enzyme concentration. If activation is related to intermolecular autophosphorylation, the relaxation time will vary as a function of enzyme concentration. Under the conditions employed in the present study, the time-dependent behavior of enzyme-catalyzed reaction can be well described by Equation 9. The best fit curves in Fig. 3A were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis from which the kinetic parameters, ν s /[T]0, α, and k obs can be determined. As expected, the kinetic parameters so determined are independent on the enzyme concentration at a fixed substrate concentration within experimental error (data not shown). The average values of the parameters are ν s /[T]0 = 2.2 ± 0.4 s–1, α = 0.11 ± 0.01, and k obs = 1.2 ± 0.2 μm–1 s–1. The full-length PAK2 contains multiple autophosphorylation sites, and therefore it is impossible to identify the critical phosphorylation site responsible for the enzyme activation. Walter et al.

M., and Taylor, K. A. (1999) J. Cell Biol. 147, 1385–1390; and Wendt, T., Taylor, D., Trybus, K. M., and Taylor, K. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 4361–4366). Our earlier cryo-atomic force microscopy (cryo-AFM) (Zhang, Y., Shao, Z., Somlyo, A. P., and Somlyo, A. V. (1997) Biophys. J. 72, 1308–1318) indicates that thiophosphorylation of the regulatory light chain increases the separation of the two heads of a single myosin molecule, but the thermodynamic probability of steric hindrance by strong binding between the two heads was not determined. We now report this probability determined by cryo-AFM of single whole myosin molecules shown to have normal low ATPase activity (0.007 s–1). We found that the thermodynamic probability of the relative head positions of nonphosphorylated myosin was approximately equal between separated heads as compared with closely apposed heads (energy difference of 0.24 kT (where k is a Boltzman constant and T is the absolute temperature)), and thiophosphorylation increased the number of molecules having separated heads (energy advantage of –1.2 kT (where k is a Boltzman constant and I is the absolute temperature)). Our results do not support the suggestion that strong binding of one head to the other stabilizes the blocked conformation against thermal fluctuations resulting in steric blockage that can account for the low activity of nonphosphorylated two-headed myosin. The purpose of this study was to determine whether steric blockage of one head by the second head of native two-headed myosin was responsible for the inactivity of nonphosphorylated two-headed myosin compared with the high activity of single-headed myosin, as suggested on the basis of electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals of heavy meromyosin (Wendt, T., Taylor, D., Messier, T., Trybus, K.

Our earlier cryo-atomic force microscopy (cryo-AFM) (Zhang, Y., Shao, Z., Somlyo, A. P., and Somlyo, A. V. (1997) Biophys.

Our results do not support the suggestion that strong binding of one head to the other stabilizes the blocked conformation against thermal fluctuations resulting in steric blockage that can account for the low activity of nonphosphorylated two-headed myosin. One of the most fundamental, but not yet understood, questions about smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin II is how phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC), 1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; EM, electron microscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy; HMM, heavy meromyosin; kT, k is a Boltzman constant and T is the absolute temperature; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; EM, electron microscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy; HMM, heavy meromyosin; kT, k is a Boltzman constant and T is the absolute temperature; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). located C-terminally in the myosin head, activates the N-terminal motor domain at a nearly 15-nm distance; or conversely, how dephosphorylated RLCs maintain myosin in the “off state.” Myosin II is composed of two heavy chains each having at its N terminus a catalytic (motor) and a regulatory domain bound with essential light chain (LC17) and RLC. Whereas the hexamer containing unphosphorylated RLCs is inactive and requires RLC phosphorylation for ATPase activity, a single head (S1) (4Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or a construct of a single head with the heavy chain tail and two associated light chains is active without RLC phosphorylation (e.g. see Refs. 5Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

The structural basis of the inhibitory mechanism has been difficult to decipher partly because the high resolution crystal structure of the smooth muscle myosin S1 fragment does not include the regulatory light chain (8Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar); the scallop muscle protein structure contains both essential and regulatory light chains, but the protein is regulated by calcium binding rather than by phosphorylation (9Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); and the residue (Ser-13) equivalent to the phosphorylation site (Ser-19) in smooth myosin RLC is not seen in the structure of striated muscle myosin (11Rayment I.

Therefore, before atomic structures of both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated RLC bound to two-headed smooth muscle myosin are obtained, information at less than atomic resolution may lead to critical insights about the regulation of smooth muscle myosin or could at least rule out some proposed mechanisms. The two approaches used recently to obtain structural information about the relationship of the two heads of smooth muscle myosin II, cryo-AFM of single myosin molecules (3Zhang Y. Shao Z. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and EM of heavy meromyosin (HMM) (1Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), examined, respectively, the full-length molecules in the nonfolded (6 S) conformation present in smooth muscle in vivo and the “short tail” hexamer in two-dimensional crystals. Cryo-AFM showed that thiophosphorylation of RLC favored greater separation of the two heads, but the change was not dramatic (3Zhang Y. Shao Z. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, analysis of two-dimensional crystals by EM (1Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) showed the actin-binding domain of one of the two heads to be bound to the converter domain of the second “blocked head” in dephosphorylated HMM. This intramolecular steric hindrance of one by the other head was proposed to be responsible for the inhibited state of dephosphorylated two-headed myosin (2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of the mechanism of regulation of smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin II, we re-examined the relationship of smooth muscle myosin heads by cryo-AFM of whole myosin molecules obtained by various preparatory methods, including the charge of the surface on which myosin is deposited. We further made the (reasonable) assumption that for the steric model to operate in vivo, the blocked conformation would have to be sufficiently stable in the absence of activation, and, consequently, the energy cost of the transition from the blocked to the open state should be significantly higher than the thermal energy. Otherwise, if regulation were solely or primarily dependent on the blocked-head model, thermal fluctuation would separate the two heads, leading to nearly continuous activity (12Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5632-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our results suggest only a minimal energy difference between the closed and the open forms of dephosphorylated myosin and do not support the mechanism of regulation based on intramolecular occlusion by strong forces binding one head to the other. Protein Preparation—Turkey gizzard myosin was purified as described previously (13Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and kept at 4 °C in buffer A (0.3 m KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) for less than 2 weeks or stored in buffer A with 50% glycerol at –20 °C without noticeable differences in both the function and the structure of the protein. Before use, myosin was extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer A or low salt buffer (20 mm K2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 120 mm KCl, pH 7.2) to remove glycerol. To eliminate undesirable “unregulated” molecules, the unphosphorylated myosin was incubated with equimolar actin in buffer A containing 1 mm ATP and 4 mm MgCl2 and subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h (see “dead heads” removal protocol in Ref. 14Baker J.E. Brosseau C. Joel P.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2134-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Myosin was thiophosphorylated by a standard procedure (15Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8249-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (3Zhang Y. Shao Z. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); thiophosphorylation efficiency was determined for each preparation by one-dimensional urea-gel electrophoresis according to Ref. 16Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and Fig. 1. More than 95% of myosin was thiophosphorylated, whereas only a single band of non-phosphorylated myosin was found in the absence of ATP and ATPγS. ATPase Activity Assay—The ATPase activity of the purified myosin (with or without the dead heads removed, as well as nonphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated) was measured under single turnover conditions (myosin ≥ ATP) by monitoring the rate of inorganic phosphate release with the aid of linked phosphorolysis reaction (Molecular Probes, EnzChek kit E-6645). Following the procedure described by Webb (17Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), solutions in two Hamilton syringes containing 50 μl of myosin (3–5 mg/ml) in 300 mm KCl and separately 50 μl of a stoichiometric amount of ATP together with the linked enzyme system (100 μm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside, 10 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase) were injected simultaneously into a 100-μl spectrophotometric cuvette, and the time course of absorption at 360 nm was monitored. The ATPase rate was determined from single exponential fitting of the absorption increase at 360 nm over time. The “dead time” of the system was less than 1 s, giving adequate time resolution for the present study. The lower limit of rate measurements determined by the sensitivity to [Pi] changes (1 μm) was determined as 0.001 s–1. Unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin hydrolyzed MgATP at a rate of 0.007 ± 0.001 s–1 (n = 7) and at 0.04 ± 0.02 s–1 (n = 5) after thiophosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase. The ATPase rate of unphosphorylated myosin without the dead heads was below the detection limit (<0.001 s–1), in agreement with reports in the literature (6Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R.

Specimen Preparation for Cryo-AFM—Mica was used as the substrate for preparing all AFM specimens. The freshly cleaved mica surface was negatively charged. Positively charged surfaces were prepared by treating mica with 1 mm spermidine followed by washing with deionized water. The treated mica was blown dry with nitrogen gas leaving sufficient spermidine retained on the surface to efficiently adsorb negatively charged molecules. After 20 μl of myosin was deposited on the substrate (1 μg/ml in buffer A or low salt buffer), excess protein was removed by washing with the same buffer. To avoid possible structural effects, including separation of the heads because of changes in ionic strength during evaporation of the volatile buffer, the surface-adsorbed molecules were cross-linked with the incubation buffer containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 2–3 min. The sample was then washed again with the incubation buffer before finally being flushed with 250 mm or 125 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.2 (volatile buffer). The specimens were quickly transferred to the cryo-AFM for equilibration and imaging. Cryo-AFM Imaging—All cryo-AFM images were collected at ∼80 K with instrumentation described elsewhere (20Mou J. Yang J. Shao Z. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1483-1488Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The scanner was calibrated with a standard grid, and the accuracy was verified by imaging various samples with known dimensions (21Sheng S. Shao Z. Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 1998; 37: 3828-3833Crossref Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Sheng S. Shao Z. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2168-2176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Full frame images were collected at a rate of 1 scan line/s. Distortion was minimal because of the high thermal stability of the system (23Han W. Mou J. Sheng J. Yang J. Shao Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8215-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). No image processing was applied. We first examined the distribution of different conformations of nonphosphorylated myosin on freshly cleaved mica. A typical image is shown in Fig. 2A. The relative arrangement of the two heads may be roughly divided into three different categories (see Fig. 2B): well separated by 180° (α); still resolvable, but at a smaller angle (β); no longer distinguishable even in stereo views and, therefore, may be considered closely associated (γ). Note that in well resolved molecules both the regulatory and catalytic domains of each of the heads can be resolved (e.g. see molecules in Fig. 2B). We also note that, because of the random orientation of the molecules on the substrate, even the count of the γ conformation may yield an overestimate of closed states if, for example, two separated heads were viewed as one on top of the other. Counting the number of nonphosphorylated myosin molecules that were clearly resolved by cryo-AFM (n = 294), we found 25% in the α conformation, 20% in the β conformation and 55% in the γ conformation. In other words, the ratio between closely associated heads and open heads is almost 1:1. However, as noted above, the two-dimensional crystals used for the cryo-EM study were formed on a positively charged lipid monolayer (2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), whereas the results of Fig. 2 show molecules deposited on a negatively charged surface. Even though at such high ionic strength mica is only slightly negatively charged, we were concerned that the negative surface could still affect the relative arrangement of myosin heads during adsorption. Therefore, to more closely reconstitute the conditions used for the cryo-EM study, we also used a substrate with a positive surface charge. The adsorption efficiency did not change significantly when the surface charge was reversed, consistent with cryo-EM results. Moreover, the distribution of myosin in the three recognizable conformations remained essentially unchanged. A typical cryo-AFM image of nonphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin molecules on the positively charged substrate is shown in Fig. 3A. Simple counting (n = 349) indicates that in this case, 25% of myosin is in the α conformation, 19% in the β conformation, and 56% in the closed γ conformation (see Table I).Table ISummary of distribution of smooth muscle myosin (dead head removed) into three different conformational states as resolved under different ionic conditions by cryo-AFM on spermidine treated mica surfaceBiochemical stateKClα State (open)β State (open)γ State (closed)nmm%%%Nonphosphorylated300251956349120232552291Thiophosphorylated300641323336120581824285 Open table in a new tab To determine whether phosphorylation affects the conformation of myosin heads, we examined samples containing more than 95% thiophosphorylated RLC. The distribution of molecular conformations of thiophosphorylated myosin on the positively charged surface was noticeably shifted between the three conformations, as made more obvious by color-coding the molecules in Fig. 3, B versus A. As summarized in Table I, thiophosphorylation reduced the fully closed γ conformation by about 50% (to 23%). To exclude the possibility that strong ionic shielding under high salt conditions (buffer A) could favor conformations otherwise disfavored at lower ionic strength, we further compared the distribution of nonphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated myosin in a buffer closer to physiological ionic strength and also similar to that used for the cryo-EM studies (20 mm K2PO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP) (2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These results were essentially identical to those obtained under high salt conditions (Table I). As shown in Fig. 4, the head conformation of myosin molecules is essentially the same as observed at higher ionic strength (both nonphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated) except that the bends of the tail (characteristic of low salt conditions) are clearly seen. When observed in this buffer even in the absence of ATP, the structure of myosin molecules as well as the distribution of the relative head-to-head positions were not noticeably different (data not shown). However, most of the molecules were not in the completely folded 10 S conformation in this low, but close to physiological ionic strength buffer containing ATP, unlike those found in previous studies where myosin was imaged in 50 mm NaCl (24Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16485-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine the possible sources of this discrepancy, we cross-linked myosin molecules in 60 mm KCl buffer containing 1 mm MgATP, similar to the ionic strength of the buffer used in a previous electron microscopic study (24Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only at this very low (unphysiological) ionic strength did we find a significant number of myosin molecules in the 10 S conformation (Fig. 5, 10 S gallery). Because the partition of molecules into different energy states is determined by the Boltzmann distribution, the statistics shown in Table I can be used to estimate the energy difference between the two states: n 1/n 2 = exp(–δϵ/kT). We found that δϵ is only 0.24 kT for dephosphorylated myosin, and when thiophosphorylated, the energy difference favoring the open state is significantly greater: δϵ = –1.21 kT.Fig. 5A gallery of the completely folded 10 S form of myosin observed with cryo-AFM. Myosin samples were deposited on a positively charged mica surface in buffer (10 mm K2PO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP). Myosin was cross-linked for 2 min in the same buffer containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde before being exchanged into a 60-mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.2). Only when myosin was cross-linked in this low ionic strength buffer did we observe a significant number of myosin molecules in the 10 S form. The tail of these myosin molecules is bent at two regions and folds into thirds of the rod.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The questions we attempt to address in this study are relatively simple: 1) do the two heads of inactive myosin containing dephosphorylated RLCs have a high probability of being closely apposed to each other, and 2) does phosphorylation of RLC alter the relationship between the two heads independently of the charge of the surface on which the molecules are deposited? The answers directly address the question whether phosphorylation regulates smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin II by modifying steric hindrance between the two heads. A high probability of heads that are closely apposed would imply the existence of sufficiently strong binding between the two heads to inhibit catalytic activity (i.e. regulation), whereas a low probability of finding such closely apposed heads would indicate a weak interaction that is easily perturbed by thermal fluctuation. We found a nearly equal probability (∼52%) of closely apposed compared with partially or fully open conformations of the two heads in a population sample of nonphosphorylated myosin molecules. Regardless of the preparatory method, the surface charge of the substrate, or the ionic strength, cryo-AFM of whole nonphosphorylated myosin molecules failed to show a predominant distribution of closely apposed heads. Based on the Boltzmann distribution, this suggests that the energy cost of separating the two heads is small, only about one-fourth of the thermal energy. Our results, obtained by direct imaging of single molecules, do not support the suggestion, based on cryo-EM image processing and modeling of two-dimensional crystals of HMM crystallized at low temperatures, that strong head-to-head interactions are responsible for the inhibited state of myosin in which RLC is not phosphorylated (2Wendt T.

The high proportion (∼60%) of thiophosphorylated myosin heads in the completely open state (present study) confirms our original observation (3Zhang Y. Shao Z. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) about the effect of thiophosphorylation. The implication that regulation of two-headed myosin is not because of strong head-to-head interactions in the unphosphorylated state is consistent with several relevant studies of myosin in solution. For example, chimeric myosins composed of the motor domain of skeletal muscle and regulatory domains and light chains of smooth muscle are regulated by RLC phosphorylation, arguing against the possibility that special properties of the smooth muscle heavy chain favor intramolecular binding between the two motor domains and are required for regulation (26Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the myosin ATPase activity of HMM that contains only one motor domain is regulated by phosphorylation (Ref. 27Li X.D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, but see also Ref. 6Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The two heads of dephosphorylated myosin have been shown to be photo-cross-linked through the RLCs (within 8.9 Å of each other) (28Wahlstrom J.L. Randall Jr., M.A. Lawson J.D. Lyons D.E. Siems W.F. Crouch G.J. Barr R. Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5123-5131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and thiophosphorylation abolishes this cross-linking (29Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) consistent with the greater separation of the two thiophosphorylated heads in solution (present study and Ref. 3Zhang Y. Shao Z. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, because myosin in buffer was deposited on the mica surface prior to cross-linking, only the conformation with closely apposed heads at the time of deposition would be cross-linked independent of the protein substrate interaction. A cryo-AFM image of myosin molecules represents a “snapshot” of all conformations in solution. Indeed, ∼50% of the unphosphorylated heads were separated, indicating that the two states of different head-to-head interactions are equally present in solution. In other words, myosin molecules fluctuate between the “open” and “closed” states, because of their relatively small energy difference. Following completion of this manuscript, images of two-dimensional crystals of smooth muscle myosin interpreted as being consistent with 10 S conformation were published (30Liu J. Wendt T. Taylor D. Taylor K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The relatively high ionic strength of the crystallization buffer used in the study (20 mm phosphate, 90–120 mm NaCl) that would have further increased during crystallization is difficult to reconcile with conditions producing 10 S myosin in solution (24Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the behavior of muscle itself, the blocked head model of Wendt et al. (2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) would have to allow one head to bind to actin to be consistent with the ability of nonphosphorylated myosin in the permeabilized muscle strip to develop rigor stiffness (31Somlyo A.V. Goldman Y.E. Fujimori T. Bond M. Trentham D.R. Somlyo A.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), enabling dephosphorylated myosin filaments to hold actin in a rigor-like conformation preventing actin filaments from diffusing away into the solution in motility assays (32Warshaw D.M. Desrosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and enabling filaments containing both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated heads to move actin at intermediate rates in comparison to fully phosphorylated heads (33Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1991; 14: 87-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blocked model requires the actin-binding domain of one head to be strongly bound to the converter domain of the second head to maintain myosin in the off state. It is also less likely to allow HMM to bind actin in the presence of MgATP, and would not allow the cross-bridge to mechanically cycle (34Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13880-13883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model is also difficult to reconcile with the cooperative attachment and cycling of dephosphorylated cross-bridges induced by micromolar ATP or CTP in muscles in rigor, which results in force development of up to 40% of maximal active tension without phosphorylation (31Somlyo A.V. Goldman Y.E. Fujimori T. Bond M. Trentham D.R. Somlyo A.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); a recent report (35Ellison P.A. DePew Z.S. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4410-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showing that both heads of tissue-derived smooth muscle HMM bind to actin irrespective of RLC phosphorylation or the presence of ADP seems also incompatible with a model (2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) that requires the actin-binding domain of one head to be strongly bound to the converter domain of the second head to maintain myosin in the off state. Taking the appropriate Popperian view that hypotheses cannot be proven but only tested and destroyed, we conclude that the available data do not support the hypothesis that requires strong intramolecular head-to-head binding forces to maintain the inhibited state of nonphosphorylated myosin II. In contrast, several studies (13Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M.

(Lond.). 1998; 512: 345-350Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are consistent with an alternative mechanism in which the activating message from the regulatory to the catalytic domain is transferred through the long α helix of the heavy chain and the converter domain as the result of stiffening of the α helix induced by phosphorylation of RLC. It is plausible to suggest, given the structural homology between calmodulin and myosin light chains (10Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A.

Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar), that phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain causes a conformational change similar to that experienced upon calcium binding by calmodulin, causing it to collapse on the regulatory domain of the lever arm, resembling the interaction of calmodulin with myosin light chain kinase (40Krueger J.K.

What is not explained by such a mechanism is the original critical observation (4Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that two-headed myosin II containing nonphosphorylated RLC is inhibited, but a single head is active. If there are no strong binding forces between the two catalytic domains (2Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), then what mechanism keeps the catalytic domain of one head informed about the proximity of the other? Is it the inhibitory effect of the rod portion of the molecule on the regulatory domain (41Konishi K. Kojima S. Katoh T. Yazawa M. Kato K. Fujiwara K. Onishi H. J. Biochem.

Only the appropriate combination of transcription factors results in B cell-specific enhancer activation. HMGA1 (formerly (HMG-I(Y)) is a proposed co-activator of the ETS transcription factors required for μ enhancer activity. HMGA1 associates with the ETS factor PU.1, resulting in changes in PU.1 structure, and enhanced transcriptional synergy with Ets-1 on the μ enhancer in nonlymphoid cells.

B lymphocyte development is critically dependent on the immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer, or μ enhancer.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). μ enhancer transcriptional activity has been extensively analyzed in the context of a three-element minimal enhancer, containing the μA, μE3, and μB sites necessary for activity in B cells (5Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the minimal enhancer has demonstrated that transcriptional activation requires combinatorial activity of transcription factors binding the three elements in a precise stereochemistry (6Nikolajczyk B. Nelsen B. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4544-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nikolajczyk B.S. Cortes M. Feinman R. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two proteins that are required for synergistically activating the μ enhancer, PU.1 and Ets-1, are members of the ets family of transcription factors. PU.1 and Ets-1 activate transcription by binding to the μB or μA sites, respectively. The third minimal enhancer activator is the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein TFE3 that binds to the μE3 site of the enhancer. Arguably, the transcription factor CBF may instead occupy an overlapping site and activate the enhancer in lieu of TFE3 (8Erman B. Cortes M. Nikolajczyk B.S. Speck N.A. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Of these critical μ enhancer activators, only PU.1 is restricted to the hematopoetic lineage (9Galson D.L. Hensold J.O.

However, B cell activation and plasma cell development are perturbed in these mice (13Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3335-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that each of these proteins is key for terminal B lineage differentiation after exit from the bone marrow. It has been previously demonstrated that the transcriptional co-activator HMGA1 (formerly designated HMG-I(Y)) forms a protein-protein interaction with PU.1 in solution (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar). HMGA1a (formerly HMG-I) and HMGA1b (formerly HMG-Y) are splice variants of a single gene. Both proteins contain peptide sequences designated A-T hooks, which are involved in DNA binding and have multiple surfaces capable of protein-protein interactions (18Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In many cases HMGA1 co-activates transcription by aiding assembly of a large nucleoprotein complex. Perhaps the best-characterized transcriptional nucleoprotein complex, or enhanceosome, is dependent on sequence-specific HMGA1 binding to the inducible interferon β (IFN-β) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN-β, interferon β; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Mo-MLV, Moloney murine leukemia virus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CBF, core binding factor; HMGA1, high mobility group protein A1. enhancer (19Falvo J.V.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). HMGA1 binding alters IFN-β DNA structure, decreasing the activation energy required for the transcription factors NF-κB and ATF/c-jun to bind (19Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). HMGA1 apparently serves a similar function in many other promoters and enhancers. For example, HMGA1 is necessary for increased binding of c-rel (21Himes S.R. Coles L.S. Reeves R. Shannon M.F. Immunity. 1996; 5: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the AP-1 complex (22Himes S.R. Reeves R. Attema J. Nissen M. Li Y. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3157-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to the interleukin-2 promoter. HMGA1 also facilitates formation of a transcriptional complex at the interleukin-2Rα promoter/enhancer through both DNA and protein-protein interactions (23Reeves R. Leonard W.J. Nissen M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4666-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HMGA1 does not directly bind μ enhancer DNA (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); therefore, the mechanism of action at the aforementioned promoters/enhancers cannot be applicable to demonstrated co-activation of the μ enhancer by HMGA1 (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent work (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) has begun to uncover the novel mechanisms by which HMGA1 co-activates the μ enhancer. HMGA1 first interacts with the critical μ enhancer regulator PU.1 in solution (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction results in increased PU.1/μ enhancer binding likely through an HMGA1-induced change in PU.1 structure. This increased binding manifests itself in the ability of HMGA1 to potentiate PU.1/Ets-1 functional synergy on the μ enhancer. Overall, the data suggest that HMGA1 activates the μ enhancer through an indirect mechanism. Because these assays were completed in non-lymphoid cells, we questioned whether HMGA1 is a co-activator of the μ enhancer in B cells. The current analysis begins to address the role HMGA1 plays in activating the μ enhancer in B cells. To differentiate between HMGA1 playing a role in assembling the μ enhanceosome versus activating the enhancer through other mechanisms, we have extended our initial analysis to detail how HMGA1 interacts with other minimal μ enhancer activators, TFE3 and Ets-1. HMGA1 increases TFE3/μE3 binding (25Andreucci A. Reeves R. McCarthy K. Nikolajczyk B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) reminiscent of the effect HMGA1 has on PU.1. New data demonstrate that HMGA1 also forms protein-protein interactions with Ets-1 and facilitates Ets-1/μ enhancer binding. Although recombinant HMGA1 does not associate with μ enhancer DNA through a PU.1/Ets-1 tether in vitro, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show HMGA1 associates with the enhancer in B cells. Furthermore, antisense HMGA1 substantially decreases enhancer activity in B cells. Our model for HMGA1 functioning through indirect association with the enhancer may explain how HMGA1 functions on a wide variety of promoters and enhancers independent of direct HMGA1/DNA binding. Cell Lines and Transfections—The mature plamacytoma Ag8.653 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.05% penicillin/streptomycin. 2017 pro-T or 38B9 pre-B cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.05% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10-5m β-mercaptoethanol. BAL-17 mature B cells were grown similarly, except using 5% serum. For enhancer activity assays 5-8 × 105 cells were transfected with 4 μg CAT or luciferase reporter plasmid plus 4 μg antisense HMGA1 (21Himes S.R. Coles L.S. Reeves R. Shannon M.F. Immunity. 1996; 5: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or control plasmid using Superfect (Qiagen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and equivalent amounts of whole cell extracts were assayed for the presence of the CAT reporter by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase activity was measured using luciferase assay reagents from Promega. Note that in functional assays, different activities of HMGA1a and HMGA1b cannot be distinguished because the antisense HMGA1 depletes both proteins. Resulting data is therefore interpreted based on effects of HMGA1. DNA and Oligonucleotides—The control Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) enhancer reporter and the minimal μ enhancer reporter construct, (μ70)2 CAT, have been previously described (5Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Sun W. Graves B. Speck N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative Ets-1 protein Ets-1 Δ286 is a 5′ deletion of Ets-1 to amino acid 286 cloned into the EVRF mammalian expression vector as previously described (27Erman B. Sen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ets-1 Δ286 binds μ enhancer DNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) but does not transactivate the enhancer in combination with PU.1 in non-lymphoid cells. All plasmid DNAs were verified for identity by restriction endonuclease digestion and, in all cases, more than one plasmid preparation was used for analysis. A biotinylated T7 oligonucleotide and a non-biotinylated T3 oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used to PCR amplify μ enhancer DNA from a pBluescript vector containing either the wild type or μB- μ enhancer DNA (5Nelsen B.

Proteins were purified on a HisTrap nickel column or a GSTrap (Pharmacia), using a BioLogic HR Work station (BioRad). Eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blot and DNA binding assays to confirm protein identity. High expressing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at -80 °C. In all cases, multiple protein preparations were analyzed in duplicate experiments. GST pull-down experiments using recombinant proteins have been previously described (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GST-HMGA1a was used to test association with PU.1 and Ets-1 from 200-1000 μg pre-cleared Ag8 or 38B9 nuclear extracts in 1000 μl total volume using an identical protocol. Eluted proteins were separated on 10-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with a rabbit α-Ets-1 or goat α-PU.1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit antibodies raised against the His6 tag or PU.1 were likewise purchased. All primary antibodies were used at a 1:200-1:1000 dilution for Western blot analyses. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey α-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) or donkey α-goat IgG (Jackson Labs) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:3000. Immune complexes were visualized using the Renaissance Reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Science) in all cases. Immunoprecipitation of PU.1 from 38B9 pre-B cell nuclear extracts was done from 1000 μg protein using 20 μl rabbit-αPU.1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and standard protocols. Precipitated PU.1 was detected on Western blots using goat α-PU.1 antibody as detailed above. EMSAs were performed as previously described (7Nikolajczyk B.S. Cortes M. Feinman R. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol.

(30Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar)) or a PvuII-BamHI fragment (base pairs 383-433) of the μ enhancer was analyzed. Biotinylated DNA Pull-downs—Approximately 7 × 106 streptavidin conjugated Dynabeads (Dynal) were washed with PBS-BSA (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA) for each sample. Biotinylated μ enhancer DNA (500-1000 ng) was incubated with the streptavidin beads for >4 h at 4 °C with rotation. Dynabead·DNA complexes were extensively washed with PBS-BSA to remove unbound DNA. Beads were resuspended in pull-down buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, 1 μg/ml poly(dI·dC)·(dI·dC) before addition of 10 μg BSA as a nonspecific protein competitor. We then added recombinant His-PU.1 (200-300 ng) alone, recombinant His-Ets-1 (200-300 ng) alone, or recombinant His-HMGA1a (200-300 ng) alone or in pair-wise or three-way combinations. Samples were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. Dynabead·DNA·protein complexes were spun down and washed three times with ice cold PBS-BSA. Samples were transferred to fresh microfuge tubes prior to final wash to avoid eluting plastic bound proteins. Dynabead·DNA·protein complexes were eluted in SDS-reducing sample buffer by heating at 95 °C. Quadruplicate samples were pooled and equal volumes loaded onto either 10% (for analysis of PU.1 and Ets-1) or 16% (for analysis of HMGA1) polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—For each immunoprecipitation 1 × 107 2017 or 38B9 cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% directly to growth media at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor mini-mixture (Roche) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were pelleted at low speed, lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 10 min on ice and diluted to 1 ml in dilution buffer (0.01%SDS, 1.1%Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 16.7 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mini-mixture). Chromatin was sonicated to ∼500-bp fragments and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. A portion (5%) of each sample was set aside to measure input DNA, and the remainder was diluted to 2 ml in dilution buffer and split into two 1 ml aliquots. Nonspecific background was pre-cleared with 30 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose beads (Upstate) and 1 μl of normal mouse IgG (Upstate) for1hat4 °C with rotation. Supernatants were incubated with either 5 μl of α-acetylated histone H3 (Upstate), α-HMGA1 (MR19), or normal mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C with rotation before immune complexes were collected with 30 μl salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed once each with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (same as low salt but with 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) then twice in TE (10 mm Tris 1 mm EDTA) (pH 8.0). Pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and rotated at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged and eluates removed. Elution was repeated one time and eluates were combined. Input DNA (5% of total sample previously set aside) were diluted to 300 μl in elution buffer, and cross-links were reversed in all samples with the addition of NaCl to a concentration of 0.3 m and 20 μg of RNase A for 5-6hat65 °C. Proteins were removed from samples with 10 mm EDTA, 53 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 50 μg proteinase K overnight at 37 °C. Samples were extracted once with phenol, once with 1:1 phenol/chloroform, and once with chloroform and precipitated in EtOH with 30 μl of 5 m NaCl and 20 μg glycogen at -80 °C for one hour. DNA was quantified using Picogreen quantification reagent (Molecular Probes). 500 pg of each sample was then analyzed with quantitative real-time PCR. Real-Time PCR and Analysis—Duplicates or triplicates of each sample were analyzed in a quantitative PCR reaction using the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector and QPCR Mastermix Plus SYBR Green kit (VWR Scientific Products). Data was analyzed with a threshold set in the linear range of amplification, which for most experiments was 0.05. The cycle number that any particular sample crossed that threshold (Ct) was then used to determine fold difference (enrichment). Fold difference was calculated as 2(Ct(input)-Ct(ChIP)) (31Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2224-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Melt curves of each amplified sample indicated formation of a single product in all cases. HMGA1 Associates with ETS Proteins in Solution—HMGA1 has been shown to interact with two μ enhancer activators in vitro, PU.1 and TFE3 (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar, 25Andreucci A. Reeves R. McCarthy K. Nikolajczyk B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because activation of the μ enhancer also requires Ets-1 binding (5Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we questioned whether HMGA1 interacts with this third protein of the minimal μ enhanceosome. Using a GST pull-down assay, we tested whether a GST-tagged HMGA1a forms a stable protein-protein interaction with Ets-1 in solution. Ets-1 interacts with HMGA1a as shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 3 and 5, representing independent duplicate samples). The precipitated Ets-1 co-migrated with recombinant Ets-1 loaded directly onto the gel as a control (lane 9). In the presence of the GST tag alone, Ets-1 did not precipitate (lanes 4 and 6), indicating that Ets-1 interacts with HMGA1a rather than the GST tag. The data clearly demonstrate a stable protein-protein interaction between HMGA1a and Ets-1 in vitro. Although recombinant HMGA1a interacts with recombinant Ets-1 or PU.1 in a GST pull-down assay, this interaction must occur in the context of a complex mix of nuclear proteins to be physiologically relevant. Fig. 1B demonstrates that GST-tagged HMGA1a forms a stable interaction with PU.1 (lane 3) in the context of 38B9 pre-B cell nuclear extracts. Recombinant PU.1 (lane 1) loaded directly onto the gel co-migrated with the HMGA1a-associated PU.1, suggesting identity of the immunoreactive bands. The GST tag alone does not interact with the PU.1 naturally present in 38B9 nuclear extracts (lane 2). PU.1 identity was further confirmed by co-migration of the HMGA1a-associated protein with PU.1 directly immunoprecipitated from 38B9 nuclear extracts using an α-PU.1 antibody (lane 4). In contrast, α-GST did not immunoprecipitate PU.1 from 38B9 nuclear extracts (lane 5). GST pull-down analyses of HMGA1a-interacting proteins in Ag8 plasmacytoma nuclear extracts demonstrated that a likely Ets-1 proteolytic fragment bound HMGA1a but not GST. The putative nuclear Ets-1 fragment associated with HMGA1a co-migrated with an HMGA1a-associated recombinant Ets-1 fragment (data not shown). Full-length Ets-1 could not be recovered from the HMGA1a-associated protein pool, likely due to the relatively high protease level in Ag8 cells in combination with the relative lability of Ets-1 to proteases. Taken together these data demonstrate PU.1 and Ets-1 form protein-protein interactions with HMGA1 in both simple and more physiological contexts. HMGA1 Increases Ets-1/μ Enhancer Binding—HMGA1a facilitates PU.1/μB binding through protein-protein interaction (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that HMGA1a interacts with Ets-1 in solution raises the possibility that HMGA1a augments Ets-1/μ enhancer binding in a similar fashion. Ets-1 specifically binds to the μA site of the μ enhancer, and mutation of this site destroys Ets-1/μDNA interaction and Ets-1-mediated enhancer activation (5Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). EMSA analysis with full-length Ets-1 is difficult to interpret as the inhibitory domains cause weak binding to the μA site under EMSA conditions (32Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Cowley D.O. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 366-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify analysis of how the demonstrated Ets-1/HMGA1a interaction affects Ets-1 function, we used a truncated form of Ets-1, ETS(Ets-1), containing only the ETS DNA binding domain. At relatively high amounts of protein (64 ng), ETS(Ets-1) complexed with μ enhancer DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 2). At relatively low levels of ETS(Ets-1) (6 ng), no detectable complex was formed with the μ enhancer (lane 3). To determine whether HMGA1a enhances ETS(Ets-1)·μ enhancer complex formation, we added HMGA1a protein to the EMSA reaction. HMGA1a increased ETS(Ets-1)/μ enhancer binding at low levels of Ets-1 (compare lanes 4-6 to lane 3). Very low levels of HMGA1a had no effect on complex formation (lanes 7 and 8). In the presence of equivalent amounts of BSA (instead of HMGA1a), the ETS(Ets-1)·μ enhancer complex was undetectable using 6 ng ETS(Ets-1) (data not shown). To further demonstrate the specificity of the enhanced binding complex, we repeated the analysis using a μA- mutated probe. Lanes 11-15 demonstrate that the μA binding site was necessary for ETS(Ets-1)·DNA complex formation in the presence of HMGA1a. Similar results were obtained for full-length Ets-1 protein despite the generally weak μ enhancer binding activity as previously published (data not shown and Refs. 26Sun W. Graves B. Speck N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 29Tian G. Erman B. Ishii H. Gangopadhyay S.S. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Overall, the data suggest that μ enhancer co-activation by HMGA1 stems from its ability to increase DNA binding by Ets-1 (Fig. 2A), TFE3 (25Andreucci A. Reeves R. McCarthy K. Nikolajczyk B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and PU.1 (16Lewis R.T. Andreucci A. Nikolajczyk B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Taken together, our GST pull-down and EMSA assays suggest HMGA1 directly interacts with the ETS domain of Ets-1 to facilitate DNA binding. To determine whether HMGA1 function in this context is more generally applicable to other ETS domains, we extended our bind"
