https://openalex.org/W2022164021,"Potted poplar ramets showed increased concentrations and rates of synthesis of phenolic compounds within 52 hours of having 7 percent of their leaf area removed by tearing, as did undamaged plants sharing the same enclosure. Damaged sugar maple seedlings responded in a manner similar to that of the damaged poplars. Nearby undamaged maples had increased levels of phenolics and hydrolyzable and condensed tannin within 36 hours, but exhibited no change in rates of synthesis. An airborne cue originating in damaged tissues may stimulate biochemical changes in neighboring plants that could influence the feeding and growth of phytophagous insects."
https://openalex.org/W2033636619,"A novel, enzymatic approach has been developed for the removal of phenols from coal-conversion aqueous effluents. Treatment with horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide precipitates 97 to 99 percent of the phenol in a wide range of pH and phenol concentrations; both model mixtures and real industrial waste-water samples have been treated successfully. Other pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, can be enzymatically coprecipitated with the phenols."
https://openalex.org/W2050476536,"The regulation of natural populations of invertebrate hosts by viral, bacterial, protozoan, or helminth infections is discussed, using models that combine elements of conventional epidemiology (where the host population is assumed constant) with dynamic elements drawn from predator-prey studies; the apparent absence of acquired immunity in invertebrates simplifies the analysis. Highly pathogenic infections, with long-lived infective stages, tend to produce cyclic behavior in their host populations. The models give an explanation of the 9- to 10-year population cycles of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana) in the European Alps and suggest that microsporidian protozoan and baculovirus infections may be responsible for the 5- to 12-year population cycles observed in many temperate forest insects."
https://openalex.org/W1997932176,The pattern of sulfur transformation in peat across the Everglades basin indicates that pyrite formation in organic-rich swamps depends on the use of organic oxysulfur compounds in dissimilatory respiration by sulfur-reducing bacteria. This paragenesis explains the primary distribution of sulfur compounds in low-sulfur coals and possibly in most coals and many organic-rich soils and sediments. It also accounts for the occurrence of framboidal pyrite bound in fossil tissue in coal and sediments.

For the evolution of altruistic traits by kin selection, [See equation in the PDF file] is always negative-that is, individual selection operates against altruism-and [See equation in the PDF file] is always positive, so that selection between groups favors altruism. Hamilton's rule specifies the conditions under which [See equation in the PDF file]-that is, the conditions necessary for intergroup selection to override individual selection."
https://openalex.org/W2015747375,"The process of osmoregulation in a unicellular blue-green alga, Synechococcus sp., has been studied by natural-abundance carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of intact cells and cell extracts. 2-O-alpha-D-Glucopyranosylglycerol was identified as the major organic osmoregulatory solute. This demonstrates the presence of a major osmoregulatory solute in a blue-green alga and is also an example of an osmoregulatory role for glucosylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W2017843511,"The concentrations of two industrially produced chlorofluoromethanes, CCl3F(F-11) and CCl2F2(F-12), have been measured in the water column and in the marine atmosphere of the Greenland and Norwegian seas. Measurable concentrations of these two chlorofluoromethanes have penetrated to the deep basins of both of these regions, and the general characteristics of their vertical distributions are similar to those of the bomb-produced radioisotopes injected into the atmosphere on a similar time scale. The data have been fitted to a time-dependent box model based on deep convective mixing in the Greenland Sea and lateral exchange between the deep basins. The model calculations for the two chlorofluoromethanes in the Greenland Sea give similar results, with a time scale for deep convection of about 40 years. The time scale for lateral mixing between the deep Greenland Sea and the deep Norwegian Sea is estimated to be 20 to 30 years, although the agreement between the calculations for the two chlorofluoromethanes is limited by analytical uncertainties at the low concentrations found in the deep Norwegian Sea and by uncertainties in the model assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W1980965079,"The diffusion equation derived from the continuity equation for hillslopes is applied to scarp erosion in unconsolidated materials. Solutions to this equation allow direct calculation of the product of the rate coefficient and the age of the scarp from measurements of scarp morphology. Where the rate coefficient can be estimated or can be derived from scarps of known age, this method allows direct calculation of unknown ages of scarps."
https://openalex.org/W1983852003,"Pollen, fossil logs, and macrofossils from three high-elevation sites in the Maligne Range, Jasper National Park, Alberta, provide the first detailed record of timberline fluctuations in the Canadian Rockies during the last 8700 years. Timberlines were much higher than at present between 8700 to 5200 years ago but oscillated significantly in elevation, with a major episode of timberline recession punctuating two periods of high timberline between about 6700 to 5900 and about 8700 to 7000 years ago. Since 5200 years ago, regional timberlines have generally receded with perhaps brief reversals, reaching their lowest recorded positions sometime after 500 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2021092270,"Photuris males emit flashed signals matching those of unrelated sympatric forms (Photinus and Pyractomena species). Some have only one flash pattern matching that of another species, others mimic at least two species, as well as emitting ""their own"" species-specific pattern. They tend to restrict the mimicking signals, but not their own, to the habitats, seasons, and daily periods of the mimicked species. Since Photuris females prey on males of other firefly species by mimicking their females' flashes, the Photuris males may be using their mimicry to locate and seduce their own hunting females. This mimicry is without known parallel in other animal communicative systems. It explains why the genus Photuris has been a frustrating mystery to taxonomists, who have long used flash patterns to distinguish sibling species in other genera."

Inclusive fitness serves as an organizing concept in much of sociobiology. Through the use of Sewall Wright's ""fitness function,"" the theoretical equivalence of these concepts for weak selection in family-structured populations is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1982496133,"A ground-based search for stratospheric chlorine monoxide was carried out during May and October 1981 with an infrared heterodyne spectrometer in the solar absorption mode. Lines due to stratospheric nitric acid and tropospheric carbonyl sulfide were detected at about 0.2 percent absorptance levels, but the expected 0.1 percent lines of chlorine monoxide in this same region were not seen. Stratospheric chlorine monoxide is less abundant by at least a factor of 7 than is indicated by in situ measurements, and the upper limit for the integrated vertical column density of chlorine monoxide is 2.3 x 10(13) molecules per square centimeter at the 95 percent confidence level. These results imply that the release of chlorofluorocarbons may be significantly less important for the destruction of stratospheric ozone than is currently thought."
https://openalex.org/W1999246036,"Neptunium and americium are relatively insoluble in ground waters containing high sulfate concentrations, particularly at 90Â°C. The insoluble neptunium species is Np(IV); hence reducing waters should enhance its formation. Americium can exist only in the trivalent state under these conditions, and its solubility also should be representative of that of curium."
https://openalex.org/W2124121398,"Two-phase mixtures of gasoline, water, and ethanol were dehydrated with both starch and saponified starch-g-polyacrylonitrile (HSPAN). Whereas starch absorbed ethanol as well as water, HSPAN selectively absorbed the water component, allowing ethanol to dissolve in the gasoline phase."

https://openalex.org/W2030410726,"Several independent study groups have reached the same general conclusions about tha acid rain problem. It was concluded that in the northeastern United States, acid rain (both dry and wet deposition) derives chiefly from man-made pollutants. The acid is doing significant damage to the environment, among other things, killing off species of freshwater fish. The scientists who did the studies have recommended strong measures to control the problem, because some of the effects of acid rain may be severe, possibly irreversible. Although the new reports have made the case for regulation stronger, the debate still continues over whether additional controls should be imposed."

En particulier, le doute est emis sur la modelisation de la transformation du SO 2 en acide sulfurique, qui ne tiendrait pas compte des composes intermediaires pourtant essentiels a l'oxydation continue du SO 2"
