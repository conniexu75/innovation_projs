https://openalex.org/W2975715205,"The near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb) (1,500-1,700 nm) window is ideal for deep-tissue optical imaging in mammals, but lacks bright and biocompatible probes. Here, we developed biocompatible cubic-phase (α-phase) erbium-based rare-earth nanoparticles (ErNPs) exhibiting bright downconversion luminescence at ~1,600 nm for dynamic imaging of cancer immunotherapy in mice. We used ErNPs functionalized with cross-linked hydrophilic polymer layers attached to anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand-1) antibody for molecular imaging of PD-L1 in a mouse model of colon cancer and achieved tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratios of ~40. The long luminescence lifetime of ErNPs (~4.6 ms) enabled simultaneous imaging of ErNPs and lead sulfide quantum dots emitting in the same ~1,600 nm window. In vivo NIR-IIb molecular imaging of PD-L1 and CD8 revealed cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment in response to immunotherapy, and altered CD8 signals in tumor and spleen due to immune activation. The cross-linked functionalization layer facilitated 90% ErNP excretion within 2 weeks without detectable toxicity in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2976511826,"The whole-genome sequencing of prospectively collected tissue biopsies from 442 patients with metastatic breast cancer reveals that, compared to primary breast cancer, tumor mutational burden doubles, the relative contributions of mutational signatures shift and the mutation frequency of six known driver genes increases in metastatic breast cancer. Significant associations with pretreatment are also observed. The contribution of mutational signature 17 is significantly enriched in patients pretreated with fluorouracil, taxanes, platinum and/or eribulin, whereas the de novo mutational signature I identified in this study is significantly associated with pretreatment containing platinum-based chemotherapy. Clinically relevant subgroups of tumors are identified, exhibiting either homologous recombination deficiency (13%), high tumor mutational burden (11%) or specific alterations (24%) linked to sensitivity to FDA-approved drugs. This study provides insights into the biology of metastatic breast cancer and identifies clinically useful genomic features for the future improvement of patient management."
https://openalex.org/W2976566477,"Most microorganisms from all taxonomic levels are uncultured. Single-cell genomes and metagenomes continue to increase the known diversity of Bacteria and Archaea; however, while 'omics can be used to infer physiological or ecological roles for species in a community, most of these hypothetical roles remain unvalidated. Here, we report an approach to capture specific microorganisms from complex communities into pure cultures using genome-informed antibody engineering. We apply our reverse genomics approach to isolate and sequence single cells and to cultivate three different species-level lineages of human oral Saccharibacteria (TM7). Using our pure cultures, we show that all three Saccharibacteria species are epibionts of diverse Actinobacteria. We also isolate and cultivate human oral SR1 bacteria, which are members of a lineage of previously uncultured bacteria. Reverse-genomics-enabled cultivation of microorganisms can be applied to any species from any environment and has the potential to unlock the isolation, cultivation and characterization of species from as-yet-uncultured branches of the microbial tree of life."

https://openalex.org/W2978688014,"Most cetacean species are wide-ranging and highly mobile, creating significant challenges for researchers by limiting the scope of data that can be collected and leaving large areas un-surveyed. Aerial surveys have proven an effective way to locate and study cetacean movements but are costly and limited in spatial extent. Here we present a semi-automated pipeline for whale detection from very high-resolution (sub-meter) satellite imagery that makes use of a convolutional neural network (CNN). We trained ResNet, and DenseNet CNNs using down-scaled aerial imagery and tested each model on 31 cm-resolution imagery obtained from the WorldView-3 sensor. Satellite imagery was tiled and the trained algorithms were used to classify whether or not a tile was likely to contain a whale. Our best model correctly classified 100% of tiles with whales, and 94% of tiles containing only water. All model architectures performed well, with learning rate controlling performance more than architecture. While the resolution of commercially-available satellite imagery continues to make whale identification a challenging problem, our approach provides the means to efficiently eliminate areas without whales and, in doing so, greatly accelerates ocean surveys for large cetaceans."
https://openalex.org/W2978796126,"Cognitive models suggest that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is maintained through the use of safety behaviours. Previous reports propose that these safety behaviours can be subdivided into two main categories: avoidance and impression management. Study 1 investigates whether certain safety behaviours are specific to SAD. The social behaviour questionnaire was administered to individuals with SAD (N = 106), post-traumatic stress disorder (N = 28) and non-patient controls (N = 59). A factor analysis (N = 164) replicated the previously reported avoidance and impression management subtypes. Scores for both subtypes were significantly higher in individuals with SAD than in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder or non-patient controls. Study 2 investigated the causal role of such safety behaviours using an experimental design in a non-clinical population (N = 96). Pairs of participants each engaged in two conversations. In one of the conversations, a randomly selected participant performed either avoidance or impression management safety behaviours. In the other conversation, neither participant was instructed to use safety behaviours. Each participant rated their own anxiety and performance as well as rating the other person. Videos of the conversations were also rated. Both types of safety behaviour increased anxiety in the person performing the safety behaviour. The avoidance subtype also had broader effects on the other person that were largely absent from the impression management subtype. Taken together the studies provide support for the distinction between safety behaviour subtypes and have implications for the treatment of SAD."
https://openalex.org/W2977650083,"Patients with diabetes are at high risk of drug therapy problems (DTPs), as they are receiving multiple medications. To date, studies regarding DTPs in patients with diabetes in Ethiopia are limited. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of DTPs, medication adherence and treatment satisfaction of patients with diabetes at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH).A cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 418 participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and patients' chart review. Cipolle's classification system was used to determine DTPs. Modified Morisky's Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) was used to measure patients' adherence to their medication. Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire (SATMED-Q) patient satisfaction assessment questionnaire was used to assess patients' treatment satisfaction.A total of 207 DTPs in 177 (42.3%) of participants were identified. Commonly identified DTPs were dosage too low (58, 28.0%), ineffective drug therapy (54, 26.1%), and need additional drug therapy (52, 25.1%). Factors associated with DTPs were female gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.31,95% CI:1.30-4.12); ≥3comorbidities (AOR = 3.61, 95% CI:1.19-10.96); ever married (AOR = 2.58,95% CI:1.23-5.48); type 2 diabetes (AOR = 5.62, 95% CI:1.21-26.04); non-adherence (AOR = 5.26,95% CI:2.51-11.04) and residence out of Addis Ababa (AOR = 0.30, 95% CI:0.12-0.73). Twenty four percent of participants were non-adherent to their drug therapies. Factors associated with non-adherence were diabetes complications (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.2-3.32), the female gender (AOR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.01-2.8) and level of education (AOR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.18-0.96). Eighty one percent of participants were satisfied with the current treatment.A significant proportion of patients were satisfied with their treatment and a quarter of the study participants were non-adherent to their medications at TASH diabetic clinic. However, DTPs were considerably higher among the study participants. Hence, future interventions targeting prevention and resolution of DTPs deemed to be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2977895894,"[Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a HER2 (ERBB2)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, composed of a HER2-targeting antibody and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan derivative, that has antitumor effects in preclinical xenograft models and clinical trials. Recently, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan was reported to enhance antitumor immunity and was beneficial in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody in a mouse model. In this study, the antitumor effect of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in combination with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody was evaluated. [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy had antitumor activity in an immunocompetent mouse model with EMT6 human HER2-expressing mouse breast cancer cells (EMT6-hHER2). [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in combination with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody induced more potent antitumor activity than that by monotherapy with either agent. The combination therapy increased tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo. Mechanistically, cured mice with treatment of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan and an anti-CTLA-4 antibody completely rejected EMT6-mock cells similar to EMT6-hHER2 cells, and splenocytes from the cured mice responded to both EMT6-hHER2 and EMT6-mock cells as measured by interferon-gamma release. Taken together, these results indicate that antitumor immunity is induced by [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan and is facilitated in combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2977911154,"Background Delirium is the most common postoperative complication of the central nervous system (CNS) that can trigger long-term cognitive impairment. Its underlying mechanism is not fully understood, but the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been implicated. The serum levels of the axonal damage biomarker, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit (pNF-H) increase in moderate to severe delirium patients, indicating that postoperative delirium can induce irreversible CNS damage. Here, we investigated the relationship among postoperative delirium, CNS damage and BBB dysfunction, using pNF-H as reference. Methods Blood samples were collected from 117 patients within 3 postoperative days. These patients were clinically diagnosed with postoperative delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. We measured intercellular adhesion molecule-1, platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin as biomarkers for BBB disruption, pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6), and pNF-H. We conducted logistic regression analysis including all participants to identify independent biomarkers contributing to serum pNF-H detection. Next, by multiple regression analysis with a stepwise method we sought to determine which biomarkers influence serum pNF-H levels, in pNF-H positive patients. Results Of the 117 subjects, 41 were clinically diagnosed with postoperative delirium, and 30 were positive for serum pNF-H. Sensitivity and specificity of serum pNF-H detection in the patients with postoperative delirium were 56% and 90%, respectively. P-selectin was the only independent variable to associate with pNF-H detection (P < 0.0001) in all 117 patients. In pNF-H positive patients, only PECAM-1 was associated with serum pNF-H levels (P = 0.02). Conclusions Serum pNF-H could be an objective delirium biomarker, superior to conventional tools in clinical settings. In reference to pNF-H, P-selectin may be involved in the development of delirium-related CNS damage and PECAM-1 may contribute to the progression of delirium- related CNS damage."
https://openalex.org/W2977598256,"Inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based gait analysis can be used to quantitatively analyze the bilateral coordination and gait asymmetry (GA). The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in bilateral coordination and GA due to gait speed using an IMU based gait analysis and identify spatiotemporal factors affecting bilateral coordination and GA. Eighty healthy adults (40 men and 40 women) participated in the study. The mean age was 26.2 years, and the mean body mass index was 22.8 kg/m2. Three different walking speeds (80%, 100%, and 120% of preferred walking speed) on a treadmill were applied for 1 min of continuous level walking using a shoe-type IMU-based gait analysis system. The phase coordination index (PCI) and GA were calculated on three different walking speeds. Several variables (gait speed, height, body mass index, cadence, and step length) were analyzed as possible factors affecting the PCI and GA. Bilateral coordination and GA improved during fast walking (p = 0.005 and p = 0.019, respectively) and deteriorated during slow walking (p<0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively), compared with the participants’ preferred walking speeds. The correlation analysis revealed that PCI was negatively correlated with step length at each walking condition and lower gait speed was negatively correlated with PCI and GA during slow walking. Both bilateral coordination and GA had a negative linear relationship with gait speed, showing an improvement in the fast walking condition and deterioration in the slow walking condition. Step length was the factor associated with the change in the bilateral coordination."
https://openalex.org/W2977580025,"Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) are a form of private governance using seafood supply chains to reduce environmental impacts of fishing in some of the most challenged fisheries. Some FIPs are industry-led, others are championed by NGOs. They range across many different fishery types, in both high- and low-income settings. Their diversity is notable, and their proliferation remarkable. This rapid growth suggests FIPs are becoming a key feature of the fisheries governance landscape globally. Based on a global sample of 107 FIPs, we systematically examined their reported actions, the actors involved, and their achievements in terms of policy and practice outputs. The most common actions were dialogues with policy stakeholders, data collection, and educational efforts directed at fishers. Common policy outputs included development of management plans and/or a management body, and rules for limiting entry and increasing compliance. Practice related outputs were dominated by gear changes, and observer and traceability programs. Only crab and lobster FIPs engaged in sustained policy conversations as one of the most common actions. Shrimp and tuna fisheries report more engagement in testing and implementing changes to fishery practices. While supply chain actors are involved in all FIPs, retailers and 1st tier suppliers are relatively absent from FIP activities, and are primarily involved in rallying financial support or some policy engagement. Based on our analysis we discuss the opportunities and challenges FIPs will likely need to engage with to contribute to a global transition to more socially and environmentally sustainable fisheries. We outline key areas where further work is needed to understand how FIPs can improve their contribution to global fisheries governance in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2979221504,"Elephant camps are among the most popular destinations in Thailand for tourists from many countries. A wide range of management strategies are used by these camps, which can have varied impacts on health and welfare of elephants. The objectives of this study were to examine relationships between FGM (fecal glucocorticoid metabolite) concentrations and camp management factors (work routine, walking, restraint, rest area, foraging), and to other welfare indicators (stereotypic behaviors, body condition, foot health, and skin wounds). Data were obtained on 84 elephants (18 males and 66 females) from 15 elephant camps over a 1-year period. Elephants were examined every 3 months and assigned a body condition score, foot score, and wound score. Fecal samples were collected twice monthly for FGM analysis. Contrary to some beliefs, elephants in the observation only program where mahouts did not carry an ankus for protection had higher FGM concentrations compared to those at camps that offered riding with a saddle and shows. Elephants that were tethered in the forest at night had lower FGM concentrations compared to elephants that were kept in open areas inside the camps. There was an inverse relationship between FGM concentrations and occurrence of stereotypy, which was not anticipated. Thus, assessing adrenal activity via monitoring of FGM concentrations can provide important information on factors affecting the well-being of elephants. Results suggest that more naturalistic housing conditions and providing opportunities to exercise may be good for elephants under human care in Thailand, and that a no riding, no hook policy does not necessarily guarantee good welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2977593170,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerged swine enteropathogenic coronavirus affecting pigs of all ages and causing diarrhea problems. Research findings indicate that PDCoV has evolved strategies to escape innate immune response in host cells, but mechanism of PDCoV in innate immune modulation is not well understood. In this study, we report our findings on identifying the alterations of host cell innate immune response affected by PDCoV infection and exploring the gene expression profiles of PK-15 cells at 0, 24, and 36 h PDCoV post infection by RNA sequencing. A total of 3,762 and 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparison of uninfected PK-15 cells and infected PK-15 cells at 24 h post infection (hpi) (INF_24h versus NC), and also comparison of infected PK-15 cells between 24 and 36 hpi (INF_36h versus INF_24h), which included 156 and 23 porcine innate immune-related genes in the DEGs of INF_24h versus NC and INF_36h versus INF_24h, respectively. Gene Ontology function classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on the DEGs that exhibited the same expression tendencies with most of the innate immune-associated genes among these PK-15 cell samples described above. The enrichment results indicated that extensive gene functions and signaling pathways including innate immune-associated functions and pathways were affected by PDCoV infection. Particularly, 4 of 5 innate immune signaling pathways, which were primarily affected by PDCoV, played important roles in I-IFN's antiviral function in innate immune response. Additionally, 16 of the host cell endogenous miRNAs were predicted as potential contributors to the modulation of innate immune response affected by PDCoV. Our research findings indicated that the innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways in PK-15 cells could be modified by the infection of PDCoV, which provides a fundamental foundation for further studies to better understand the mechanism of PDCoV infections, so as to effectively control and prevent PDCoV-induced swine diarrheal disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2977777149,"Various methods have been devised to dissolve hydrogen gas in organ preservation solutions, including use of a hydrogen gas cylinder, electrolysis, or a hydrogen-generating agent. However, these methods require considerable time and effort for preparation. We investigated a practical technique for rapidly dissolving hydrogen gas in organ preservation solutions by using a canister containing hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The efficacy of hydrogen-containing organ preservation solution created by this method was tested in a miniature pig model of kidney transplantation from donors with circulatory arrest. The time required for dissolution of hydrogen gas was only 2–3 minutes. When hydrogen gas was infused into a bag containing cold ETK organ preservation solution at a pressure of 0.06 MPa and the bag was subsequently opened to the air, the dissolved hydrogen concentration remained at 1.0 mg/L or more for 4 hours. After warm ischemic injury was induced by circulatory arrest for 30 minutes, donor kidneys were harvested and perfused for 5 minutes with hydrogen-containing cold ETK solution or hydrogen-free cold ETK solution. The perfusion rate was faster from the initial stage with hydrogen-containing cold ETK solution than with hydrogen-free ETK solution. After storage of the kidney in hydrogen-free preservation solution for 1 hour before transplantation, no urine production was observed and blood flow was not detected in the transplanted kidney at sacrifice on postoperative day 6. In contrast, after storage in hydrogen-containing preservation solution for either 1 or 4 hours, urine was detected in the bladder and blood flow was confirmed in the transplanted kidney. This method of dissolving hydrogen gas in organ preservation solution is a practical technique for potentially converting damaged organs to transplantable organs that can be used safely in any clinical setting where organs are removed from donors."
https://openalex.org/W2978691402,"Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a technique for the assessment of muscle health and composition and has been shown to be sensitive to a variety of muscle pathologies including neurogenic atrophy and connective tissue deposition. However, it has been minimally studied in pure inflammation. In this study, we sought to assess EIM sensitivity to experimental inflammation induced by the localized intramuscular injection of λ-carrageenan. A total of 91 mice underwent 1–1000 kHz EIM measurements of gastrocnemius using a needle array, followed by injection of either 0.3% λ-carrageenan in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone. Animals were then remeasured with EIM at 4, 24, 48, or 72 hours and euthanized and quantitative assessment of muscle histology was performed. Parallel alterations in both 5 and 50 kHz EIM values were identified at 4 and 24 hours, including reductions in phase, reactance, and resistance. In PBS-treated animals these values normalized by 48 hours, whereas substantial reductions in phase and reactance in 5 kHz EIM values persisted at 48 and 72 hours (i.e., values of phase 72 hours post-injection were 6.51 ± 0.40 degrees for λ-carrageenan versus 8.44 ± 0.35 degrees for PBS p<0.001, n = 11 per group). The degree of basophilic area observed in muscle sections by histology correlated to the degree of phase change at these two time points (Rspearman = -0.51, p = 0.0029). Changes in low frequency EIM parameters are sensitive to the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, and have the potential of serving as a simple means of quantifying the presence and extent of muscle inflammation without the need for biopsy."
https://openalex.org/W2977875202,"Financial sanctions are often thought of as the “soft alternative” to armed conflict and are widely used in the 21st century. Nonetheless, sanctions are often criticized for being non-specific in their action, and having impact beyond their intended remit. One often-overlooked area affected by sanctions are academic systems of research and education. Sanctions place “invisible barriers” for research in these countries by limiting access to necessary resources and curtailing their effective use. In this paper we present a national survey of Sudanese academics focused on the impact of 20 years of economic sanctions on their work. It identifies key areas of academic research and education that have been impacted by international sanctions. Moreover, these data highlight how the impact of sanctions on academia is likely to persist long after they are formally lifted. The paper concludes by problematising the current interpretation of jus post bellum, or moral behaviour after conflict. It suggests that the responsibility to make reparations in the form of support for academic systems applies to countries who impose economic sanctions."
https://openalex.org/W2979122310,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with high mortality and a heavy financial and healthcare burden in the dialysis population. Determining which dialysis modality is associated with a higher risk of developing CHF might facilitate clinical decision making and surveillance programs in the dialysis population.Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we recruited all incident dialysis patients during the period from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010. The propensity score matching method was applied to establish the matched hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) cohort. Incidence rates and cumulative incidence rates of CHF-related hospitalization were first compared for the HD and PD patients. Multivariable subdistribution hazards models were then constructed to control for potential confounders.Among a total of 65,899 enrolled dialysis patients, 4,754 matched pairs of HD and PD patients were identified. The incidence rates of CHF in the matched HD and PD patients were 25.98 and 19.71 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (P = 0.001). The cumulative incidence rate of CHF was also higher in the matched HD patients (0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI)(0.12-0.21)] than in the corresponding PD patients (0.09, 95% CI [0.08-0.11])(P<0.0001). HD was consistently associated with an increased subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) of CHF compared with PD in the matched cohort (HR: 1.45, 95% CI [1.23-1.7]). Similar phenomenons were observed in either the subgroup analysis stratified by selected confounders or in the HD and PD group without matching.HD is associated with a higher risk of developing CHF-related hospitalization than PD. The surveillance program for CHF should differ in patients receiving different dialysis modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2977854488,"The objective was to evaluate vaginal temperature as a thermoregulatory response of Nellore heifers under different microclimatic conditions. The study was conducted during one year in an experimental area located at 54°37′W, 20°27′S, and 530 m of altitude in Brazil. Twenty-four Nellore females were reared in integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems with different shading patterns. The randomized complete block experimental design was utilized with a sub subdivided plots scheme, with plot corresponding to the production systems, the subplot to the season of the year, and the sub subplot, the hours of the day. To characterize the microclimate, data regarding air and black globe temperatures, and air relative humidity were collected and from them, temperature-humidity index was calculated. Vaginal temperature was obtained by using a bottom-type temperature logger (i-button) attached to an adapted intravaginal device. The black-globe temperature explained the variation on vaginal temperature. Increases on vaginal temperature were only observed, on average, two hours after the increase of black-globe temperature. The microclimatic conditions found in the systems, resulting from the various tree densities, modify the vaginal temperature in different degrees, demonstrating that the shading effect is not always accompanied by improvements in thermal comfort. The system with intermediate density showed a better microclimatic condition and, consequently, a lower increase in vaginal temperature. The interaction between air temperature, humidity and solar radiation resulted in adverse environmental conditions, however, Nellore heifers showed good adaptation to the environment. In conclusion, vaginal temperature is a good indicator to evaluate the thermoregulatory response in Nellore heifers."
https://openalex.org/W2977932509,"Objective To investigate if animal-assisted therapy (AAT) leads to higher consciousness in patients in a minimally conscious state during a therapy session, measured via behavioral reactions, heart rate and heart rate variability. Methods In a randomized two treatment multi-period crossover trial, 10 patients in a minimally conscious state participated in eight AAT sessions and eight paralleled conventional therapy sessions, leading to 78 AAT and 73 analyzed control sessions. Patients’ responses during sessions were assessed via behavioral video coding and the Basler Vegetative State Assessment (BAVESTA), heart rate and heart rate variability (SDNN, RMSSD, HF and LF). Data were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models. Results Patients showed more eye movements (IRR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.40, p < 0.001) and active movements per tactile input during AAT compared to control sessions (IRR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.25, p = 0.018). No difference was found for positive emotions. With BAVESTA, patients’ overall behavioral reactions were rated higher during AAT (b = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.22, p = 0.038). AAT led to significantly higher LF (b = 5.82, 95% CI: 0.55 to 11.08, p = 0.031) and lower HF (b = -5.80, 95% CI: -11.06 to -0.57, p = 0.030), while heart rate, SDNN, RMSSD did not differ. Conclusions Patients in a minimally conscious state showed more behavioral reactions and increased physiological arousal during AAT compared to control sessions. This might indicate increased consciousness during therapeutic sessions in the presence of an animal. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02629302."
https://openalex.org/W2978125296,"Purpose The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, needs, and preferences regarding follow-up perceived by people with stroke and healthcare professionals. Methods This is a qualitative exploratory study using focus groups. Patients and healthcare professionals, participating in a clinical visit in primary care or specialised care, were purposively sampled. Data were analysed using a framework of analysis developed by Krueger. Results Focus groups were conducted with two patient groups (n = 10, range 45–78 years) and two multidisciplinary healthcare professional groups (n = 8, range 35–55 years). The overarching theme elucidates stroke as a long-term condition requiring complex follow-up. Three organisational themes and six subthemes were identified. People with stroke discovered feelings and changes after returning home. In daily life, problems and feelings of abandonment became evident. Participants expressed experiences of unequal access to health care services. Barriers for accessing appropriate treatment and support included difficulties in communicating one’s needs and lack of coherent follow-up. Follow-up activities were well functioning in certain clinics but did not provide continuity over the long term. Participants made suggestions for a comprehensive, planned, and tailored follow-up to meet patient needs. Conclusion Comprehensive long-term follow-up that is accessible to all patients is essential for equal support. Our findings raised awareness about problems discovered after returning home and the obstacles individuals face in communicating their needs. Structured follow-up, which is individually tailored, can empower patients."
https://openalex.org/W2978600159,"In order to support decision making on how to most effectively improve broiler welfare an innovative expert survey was conducted based on principles derived from semantic modelling. Twenty-seven experts, mainly broiler welfare scientists (n = 20; and 7 veterinarians), responded (response rate 38%) by giving welfare scores (GWS, scale 0-10) to 14 benchmarking housing systems (HSs), and explaining these overall scores by selecting, weighing and scoring main welfare parameters, including both input and output measures. Data exploration followed by REML (Linear Mixed Model) and ALM (Automatic Linear Modelling) analyses revealed 6 clusters of HSs, sorted from high to low welfare, i.e. mean GWS (with superscripts indicating significant differences): 1. (semi-natural backyard) Flock (8.8a); 2. Nature (7.7ab), Label Rouge II (7.4ab), Free range EU (7.2ab), Better Life (7.2ab); 3. Organic EU (7.0bc), Freedom Food (6.2bc); 4. Organic US (5.8bcd), Concepts NL (5.6abcdef), GAP 2 (4.9bcd); 5. Conventional EU (3.7de), Conventional US (2.9ef), Modern cage (2.9abcdef); 6. Battery cage (1.3f). Mean weighting factors (WF, scale 0-10) of frequently (n> = 15) scored parameters were: Lameness (8.8), Health status (8.6), Litter (8.3), Density (8.2), Air quality (8.1), Breed (8.0), Enrichment (7.0) and Outdoor (6.6). These did not differ significantly, and did not have much added value in explaining GWS. Effects of Role (Scientist/Vet), Gender (M/F) and Region (EU/non-EU) did not significantly affect GWS or WF, except that women provided higher WF than men (7.2 vs 6.4, p<0.001). The contribution of welfare components to overall welfare has been quantified in two ways: a) using the beta-coefficients of statistical regression (ALM) analyses, and b) using a semantic-modelling type (weighted average) calculation of overall scores (CalcWS) from parameter level scores (PLS) and WF. GWS and CalcWS were highly correlated (R = ~0.85). CalcWS identified Lameness, Health status, Density, Breed, Air quality and Litter as main parameters contributing to welfare. ALM showed that the main parameters which significantly explained the variance in GWS based on all PLS, were the output parameter Health status (with a beta-coefficient of 0.38), and the input parameters (stocking) Density (0.42), Litter (0.14) and Enrichment (0.27). The beta-coefficients indicated how much GWS would improve from 1 unit improvement in PLS for each parameter, thus the potential impact on GWS ranged from 1.4 welfare points for Litter to 4.2 points for Density. When all parameters were included, 81% of the variance in GWS was explained (77% for inputs alone; 39% for outputs alone). From this, it appears that experts use both input and output parameters to explain overall welfare, and that both are important. The major conventional systems and modern cages for broilers received low welfare scores (2.9-3.7), well below scores that may be considered acceptable (5.5). Also, several alternatives like GAP 2 (4.9), Concepts NL (5.6), Organic US (5.8) and Freedom Food (6.2) are unacceptable, or at risk of being unacceptable due to individual variation between experts and farms. Thus, this expert survey provides a preliminary semi-quantified decision-support tool to help determine how to most effectively improve broiler welfare in a wide range of HSs."
https://openalex.org/W2978677602,"Objective We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness between two mHealth programs, implemented from 2011 to 2015 in rural Bangladesh: (1) Comprehensive mCARE package as an intervention group and (2) Basic mCARE package as a control group. Methods Both programs included a core package of census enumeration and pregnancy surveillance provided by an established cadre of digitally enabled community health workers (CHWs). In the comprehensive mCARE package, short message service (SMS) and home visit reminders were additionally sent to pregnant women (n = 610) and CHWs (n = 70) to promote the pregnant women’s care-seeking of essential maternal and newborn care services. Economic costs were assessed from a program perspective inclusive of development, start-up, and implementation phases. Effects were calculated as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and the number of newborn deaths averted. For comparative purposes, we normalized our evaluation to estimate total costs and total newborn deaths averted per 1 million people in a community for both groups. Uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo simulation. Results The addition of SMS and home visit reminders based on a mobile phone-facilitated pregnancy surveillance system was highly cost effective at a cost per DALY averted of $31 (95% uncertainty range: $19–81). The comprehensive mCARE program had at least 88% probability of being highly cost-effective as compared to the basic mCARE program based on the threshold of Bangladesh’s GDP per capita. Conclusion mHealth strategies such as SMS and home visit reminders on a well-established pregnancy surveillance system may improve service utilization and program cost-effectiveness in low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2978690894,"Introduction Adolescents can be prone to mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression following disasters. School teachers can provide timely psycho-social support that could instill hope and improve mental health among adolescents in a post-earthquake situation in a low-resource setting. This study examined the effect of training for school teachers on psycho-social support on adolescents’ mental health and hope in an earthquake affected district in Nepal. Methods This cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 15 schools in Dhading, a severely affected district by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The schools were randomized, as a result, 8 were in the intervention group and 7 in the control group. A total of 1,220 adolescents were recruited at baseline of which 605 adolescents belonged to intervention group and 615 to control group. The follow-up rate at 6 months was 83%. This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov with registration number NCT03387007. Results The intervention did not show significant effects for PTSD symptoms (Intervention*time, β = 0.33, p = 0.536), depression symptoms (Intervention*time, β = 0.30, p = 0.249), and hope (Intervention*time, β = -0.23, p = 0.588), among the adolescents at 6 months follow-up. Conclusion The intervention did not improve mental health symptoms and hope among adolescents at 6 months follow-up. More focused and longer training could be necessary to address mental health among adolescents affected by earthquake. Additionally, longer follow-up could be necessary to assess the changes taking place over time. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03387007."
https://openalex.org/W2977999118,"We assessed the impact of intravenous (IV) infusion versus intramuscular (IM) oxytocin on postpartum blood loss and rates of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) when administered during the third stage of labor. While oxytocin is recommended for prevention of PPH, few double-blind studies have compared outcomes by routes of administration.A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted at a hospital in Argentina. Participants were assigned to receive 10 IU oxytocin via IV infusion or IM injection and a matching saline ampoule for the other route after vaginal birth. Blood loss was measured using a calibrated receptacle for a 1-hour minimum. Shock index (SI) was also calculated, based on vital signs measurements, and additional interventions were recorded. Primary outcomes included: the frequency of blood loss ≥500ml and mean blood loss.239 (IV infusion) and 241 (IM) women were enrolled with comparable baseline characteristics. Mean blood loss was 43ml less in the IV infusion group (p = 0.161). Rates of blood loss ≥500ml were similar (IV infusion = 21%; IM = 24%, p = 0.362). Women in the IV infusion group received significantly fewer additional uterotonics (5%), than women in the IM group (12%, p = 0.007). Women with PPH in the IM group experienced a larger increase in SI after delivery, which may have influenced recourse to additional interventions.The route of oxytocin administration for PPH prevention did not significantly impact measured blood loss after vaginal birth. However, differences were observed in recourse to additional uterotonics, favoring IV infusion over IM. In settings where IV lines are routinely placed, oxytocin infusion may be preferable to IM injection."
https://openalex.org/W2978897880,"Tight junctions (TJs) are cellular junctions within the mammalian epithelial cell sheet that function as a physical barrier to molecular transport within the intercellular space. Dysregulation of TJs leads to various diseases. Tricellular TJs (tTJs), specialized structural variants of TJs, are formed by multiple transmembrane proteins (e.g., lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor [LSR] and tricellulin) within tricellular contacts in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet. However, the mechanism for recruiting LSR and tricellulin to tTJs is largely unknown. Previous studies have identified that tyrphostin 9, the dual inhibitor of Pyk2 (a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase) and receptor tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suppresses LSR and tricellulin recruitment to tTJs in EpH4 (a mouse mammary epithelial cell line) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Pyk2 inhibition on LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs. Pyk2 inactivation by its specific inhibitor or repression by RNAi inhibited the localization of LSR and downstream tricellulin to tTJs without changing their expression level in EpH4 cells. Pyk2-dependent changes in subcellular LSR and tricellulin localization were independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and expression. Additionally, Pyk2-dependent LSR phosphorylation at Tyr-237 was required for LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs and decreased epithelial barrier function. Our findings indicated a novel mechanism by which Pyk2 regulates tTJ assembly and epithelial barrier function in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet."
https://openalex.org/W2979268833,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained from human bone marrow and amplified in cultures supplemented with human platelet lysate in order to generate myofibroblasts. When MSCs were seeded in solid collagen scaffolds, they differentiated into myofibroblasts that were observed to strongly bind to the substrate, forming a 3D cell scaffold network that developed tension and shortening after KCl stimulation. Moreover, MSC-laden scaffolds recapitulated the Frank-Starling mechanism so that active tension increased in response to increases in the initial length of the contractile system. This constituted a bioengineering tissue that exhibited the contractile properties observed in both striated and smooth muscles. By using the A. F. Huxley formalism, we determined the myosin crossbridge (CB) kinetics of attachment (f1) and detachment (g1 and g2), maximum myosin ATPase activity, molar myosin concentration, unitary CB force and maximum CB efficiency. CB kinetics were dramatically slow, characterizing the non-muscle myosin type IIA (NMMIIA) present in myofibroblasts. When MSCs were seeded in solid collagen scaffolds functionalized with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), contractility increased and CB kinetics were modified, whereas the unitary NMMIIA-CB force and maximum CB efficiency did not change. In conclusion, we provided a non-muscle bioengineering tissue whose molecular mechanical characteristics of NMMIIA were very close to those of a non-muscle contractile tissue such as the human placenta."
https://openalex.org/W2977502415,"Background Several studies have examined the risk and health outcomes related to polypharmacy among the elderly. However, information regarding polypharmacy among pediatric patients is lacking. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of polypharmacy and its related factors among the pediatric population of South Korea. Methods We used national claim data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service—Pediatric Patients Sample (HIRA-PPS) in Korea originating from 2012 through 2016. Polypharmacy was defined as a daily average of two or more drugs used yearly. Complex chronic conditions (CCCs) were examined to evaluate concomitant chronic diseases in pediatric patients. Age-specific contraindications and potential drug-drug interactions were assessed according to criteria established by the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management (KIDS). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were conducted to analyze the status of polypharmacy and its associated risk factors in pediatric patients. Results The 5-year prevalence of pediatric polypharmacy in pediatric patients was 3.7%. The prevalence of polypharmacy was much higher in younger pediatric patients: 9.5% for patients between the ages of 1–7 years, 0.9% for ages 6–11 years, and 1.1% for ages 12–19 years. Pediatric patients with CCCs, Medical Aid benefits, or a hospital admission history had a significantly higher prevalence of polypharmacy when compared to their counterparts without those conditions. The most commonly prescribed drugs were respiratory agents (29%) followed by anti-allergic drugs (18.7%), central nervous system agents (15.9%), antibiotics (10.1%), and gastrointestinal drugs (7.7%). There was a positive correlation between the daily average number of inappropriate prescriptions and the degree of polypharmacy, especially in pediatric patients between the ages of 1–7 years. Contraindications and potential drug-drug interactions occurred in 11.0% and 10.1% of patients exposed to polypharmacy, respectively. Conclusions One in ten pediatric patients under the age of 7 years was prescribed two or more concurrent drugs on average per day. Furthermore, pediatric patients exposed to polypharmacy showed an increased risk of inappropriate drug use. The implementation of a medication review system that considers pediatric patient polypharmacy exposure would reduce inappropriate drug use and prevent unwanted adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2979119241,"Research on pro-social rat behaviour is growing within the fields of comparative psychology and social neuroscience. However, much work remains on mapping important variables influencing this behaviour, and there is even disagreement on whether this behaviour is empathetically motivated and correctly labelled pro-social, or whether the behaviour is motivated by social contact. The present study used the helping behaviour paradigm where a rat can release a familiar cagemate from a restrainer. Prior to testing with a trapped cagemate, restrainer door opening was trained and baseline opening latencies when the restrainer was empty or baited with food were established. The findings show that the first-time release occurred sooner than in previous research and that rats used a previously demonstrated response to release the trapped cagemate. Further, rats opened the restrainer door more often and with shorter latencies when the restrainer contained a cagemate than when the restrainer was empty, but less often and with longer latencies than when the restrainer contained food. The test of whether illumination levels affect door-opening included in the study showed no effects."
https://openalex.org/W2979160775,"COPD is a common HIV comorbidity, and HIV-infected individuals have a higher incidence and earlier onset of COPD compared to HIV-uninfected individuals. While the pathogenesis of HIV-associated COPD is largely unknown, chronic inflammation may contribute. Four pneumoproteins known to be markers of lung injury and inflammation have been associated with COPD in HIV-uninfected individuals: PARC/CCL-18, SP-D, CC-16, and sRAGE.To determine whether these pneumoproteins are also associated with pulmonary function and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores in HIV-infected individuals.Associations between plasma pneumoprotein levels and pulmonary function were determined in a cross-sectional study of otherwise healthy HIV-infected individuals enrolled between September 2016 and June 2017. Covariates included HIV-associated (antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count, and viral load) and COPD-associated (smoking and BMI) covariates.Among 65 participants, 78.5% were male, 50.8% had undetectable viral load, and 76.9% were ever-smokers. Mean post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC was 0.71, and mean DLco%predicted was 61%. Higher PARC/CCL-18 was associated with lower DLco%predicted and higher CAT score. Higher CC-16 was associated with lower DLco%predicted and lower FVC%predicted.This exploratory analysis is the first to characterize associations between these four pneumoproteins and pulmonary function in an HIV-infected cohort. Our findings suggest the pathogenesis of HIV-associated COPD may differ from that of non-HIV-associated COPD due to HIV-specific inflammatory changes affecting DLco. PARC/CCL-18 is associated with structural and functional pulmonary abnormalities and may be an important COPD biomarker candidate in HIV infection. Our study is a preliminary step toward finding clinically relevant COPD biomarkers in high-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W2979163272,"Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG) plays an important role in fetal heart rate (FHR) measurement during the pregnancy. However, despite the large number of methods that have been proposed for adult ECG signal processing, the analysis of NI-FECG remains challenging and largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a prefix tree-based framework, called QRStree, for FHR measurement directly from the abdominal ECG (AECG). The procedure is composed of three stages: Firstly, a preprocessing stage is employed for noise elimination. Secondly, the proposed prefix tree-based method is used for fetal QRS complexes (FQRS) detection. Finally, a correction stage is applied for false positive and false negative correction. The novelty of the framework relies on using the range of FHR to establish the connections between the FQRS. The consecutive FQRS can be considered as strings composed of alphabet items, thus we can use the prefix tree to store them. A vertex of the tree contains an alphabet, thus a path of the tree gives a string. Such that, by storing the connections of the FQRS into the prefix tree structure, the problem of FQRS detection converts to a problem of optimal path selection. Specifically, after selecting the optimal path of the tree, the nodes in the optimal path are collected as detected FQRS. Since the prefix tree can cover every possible combination of the FQRS candidates, it has the potential to reduce the occurrence of miss detections. Results on two different databases show that the proposed method is effective in FHR measurement from single-channel AECG. The focus on single-channel FHR measurement facilitates the long-term monitoring for healthcare at home."
https://openalex.org/W2979168847,"Over the last 20 years, a new group of systemic insecticides–the neonicotinoids—has gained prominence in arable systems, and their application globally has risen year on year. Previous modelling studies using long-term data have suggested that neonicotinoid application has had a detrimental impact on bird populations, but these studies were either limited to a single species or neglected to analyse specific exposure pathways in conjunction with observed population trends. Using bird abundance data, neonicotinoid usage records and cropping data for England at a 5x5 km resolution, generalised linear mixed models were used to test for spatio-temporal associations between neonicotinoid use and changes in the populations of 22 farmland bird species between 1994 and 2014, and to determine whether any associations were explained by dietary preferences. We assigned farmland bird species to three categories of dietary exposure to neonicotinoids based on literature data for species diets and neonicotinoid residues present in dietary items. Significant estimates of neonicotinoid-related population change were obtained for 13 of the 22 species (9 positive effects, 4 negative effects). Model estimates for individual species were not collectively explained by dietary risk categories, so dietary exposure to neonicotinoids via ingestion of treated seeds and seedlings could not be confirmed as a causal factor in farmland bird declines. Although it is not possible to infer any generic effect of dietary exposure to neonicotinoids on farmland bird populations, our analysis identifies three species with significant negative estimates that may warrant further research (house sparrow Passer domesticus, skylark Alauda arvensis and red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa). We conclude that there was either no consistent effect of dietary exposure to neonicotinoids on farmland bird populations in England, or that any over-arching effect was not detectable using our study design. The potential for indirect effects of insecticide use on bird populations via reduced food availability was not considered here and should be a focus for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2978939034,"M3 is a broad-spectrum chemokine-binding protein that inactivates inflammatory chemokines, including CCL2, CCL5, and CX3CL1. The aim of this study was to compare whether M3 could inhibit angiogenesis driven by inflammation or ischemia. Here, apolipoprotein E-/- mice were injected with adenoviral M3 (AdM3) or control adenoviral green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) 3 d prior to stimulating angiogenesis using 2 established models that distinctly represent inflammatory or ischemia-driven angiogenesis, namely the periarterial femoral cuff and hind limb ischemia. AdM3 reduced intimal thickening, adventitial capillary density, and macrophage accumulation in femoral arteries 21 d after periarterial femoral cuff placement compared with AdGFP-treated mice (P < 0.05). AdM3 also reduced mRNA expression of proangiogenic VEGF, inflammatory markers IL-6 and IL-1β, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-activated synthetic markers Krüppel-like family of transcription factor 4 (KLF4) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) in the inflammatory cuff model. In contrast, capillary density, VSMC content, blood flow perfusion, and VEGF gene expression were unaltered between groups in skeletal muscle following hind limb ischemia. In vitro, AdM3 significantly reduced human microvascular endothelial cell 1 proliferation, migration, and tubule formation by ∼17, 71.3, and 8.7% (P < 0.05) in macrophage-conditioned medium associating with reduced VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α mRNA but not in hypoxia (1% O2). Compared with AdGFP, AdM3 also inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration and reduced mRNA expression of KLF4 and PDGFRβ under inflammatory conditions. In contrast, AdM3 had no effect on VSMC processes in response to hypoxia in vitro. Our findings show that broad-spectrum inhibition of inflammatory chemokines by M3 inhibits inflammatory-driven but not ischemia-driven angiogenesis, presenting a novel strategy for the treatment of diseases associated with inflammatory-driven angiogenesis.-Ravindran, D., Cartland, S. P., Bursill, C. A., Kavurma, M. M. Broad-spectrum chemokine inhibition blocks inflammation-induced angiogenesis, but preserves ischemia-driven angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2979238271,"Human neonates spontaneously associate changes in magnitude across the dimensions of number, length, and duration. Do these particular associations generalize to other pairs of magnitudes in the same way at birth, or do they reflect an early predisposition to expect specific relations between spatial, temporal, and numerical representations? To begin to answer this question, we investigated how strongly newborns associated auditory sequences changing in number/duration with visual objects changing in levels of brightness. We tested forty-eight newborn infants in one of three, bimodal stimulus conditions in which auditory numbers/durations increased or decreased from a familiarization trial to the two test trials. Auditory numbers/durations were paired with visual objects in familiarization that remained the same on one test trial but changed in luminance/contrast or shape on the other. On average, results indicated that newborns looked longer when changes in brightness accompanied the number/duration change as compared to no change, a preference that was most consistent when the brightness change was congruent with the number/duration change. For incongruent changes, this preference depended on trial order. Critically, infants showed no preference for a shape change over no shape change, indicating that infants likely treated brightness differently than a generic feature. Though this performance pattern is somewhat similar to previously documented associations, these findings suggest that cross-magnitude associations among number, length, and duration may be more specialized at birth, rather than emerge gradually from postnatal experience or maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2978264237,"Introduction State lawmakers have explored numerous policy alternatives to reduce overweight and obesity. Evaluating effects of these laws is important but presents substantial methodological challenges. We present a conceptual framework that allows for classification of obesity prevention laws based on ecological level of influence and the underlying legal mechanism involved to guide analysis of the relationship between a substantial range of obesity prevention laws and BMI. Methods Obesity prevention laws (OPLs) for all 50 states and DC were obtained via primary legal research using the LexisNexis Advanced Legislative Services (ALS) database. For legal provisions that met inclusion criteria, reviewers abstracted information on bill state, citation, passage and effective dates, target population, and obesity prevention mechanism. Laws were categorized by ecological level of influence on weight-related behaviors and the legal mechanism utilized to change behavioral determinants of BMI. Results Laws designed to increase community-level opportunities for physical activity were the most frequently enacted OPL while laws designed to alter nutrition standards for school meals or competitive foods were comparatively less common, appearing in only 16% and 34% of states, respectively. Conclusion Prior studies of obesity policies have focused on specific interventions. We identified and categorized state-level laws that operate at all ecological levels and found that laws passed during the initial burst of lawmaking were largely confined to measures aimed at increasing opportunities for physical activity. Creating public spaces for recreation is an important step to promoting healthier lifestyles to reduce obesity risk; more comprehensive, multilevel legal approaches should also be pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2978874186,"The recent expansion of the invasive lionfish throughout the Western Hemisphere is one of the most extensively studied aquatic invasions. Molecular studies have improved our understanding of larval dispersal, connectivity, and biogeographical barriers among lionfish populations, but none have included Mexican localities, an important area for the larval dispersal of Pterois volitans through the Western Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we present a genetic analysis of lionfishes collected along Mexican coasts, examining their connectivity with other Caribbean localities (Belize, Cuba, Puerto Rico) and the role of ocean currents on population structure. We collected 213 lionfish samples from seven locations comprising four countries. To evaluate genetic structure, mitochondrial control region and nuclear inter-simple sequence repeat markers were used. We found that lionfish collected along Mexican coasts show a similar haplotype composition (H02 followed by H01 and H04) to other Caribbean locations, and the H03 rare haplotype was not found. Haplotype composition in the southwest Gulf of Mexico suggests a discontinuity between the southern and northern areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The southern area clustered more strongly to the Caribbean region, and this is supported by the complexity of water circulation in the semi-enclosed region of the Gulf of Mexico. Mitochondrial genetic diversity parameters show small values, whereas nuclear markers produce medium to high values. Only nuclear markers highlighted significant genetic differentiation between the southwest Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region, confirming a phylogeographic break between both regions. Separate analysis of Caribbean locations indicates restricted larval exchange between southern and northern regions of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, potentially in response to regional oceanographic circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2977339409,"Happiness, or Subjective Well-Being (SWB), is generally considered as a peaceful and satisfied state accompanied by consistent and optimistic mood. Due to its subjective and elusive nature, however, wellbeing has only been scarcely investigated in the neuroimaging literature. In this study, we investigated its neural substrates by characterizing two different perspectives: self- or other-concerned wellbeing. In the present study, 22 participants evaluated the subjective happiness (with button presses 1 to 4) to 3 categories (intra- and inter-personal and neutral) of pre-rated pictures in a slow event-related fMRI. Because wellbeing is constantly featured by pleasure feelings after self-inspection, we predict that happier conditions, featured by “intra-personal vs. neutral” and “inter-personal vs. neutral” conditions, should yield higher BOLD activities in overlapping reward- and self-related regions. Indeed, medial prefrontal (mPFC), pregenual ACC (pACC), precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were revealed both by General Linear Model (GLM) (categorical contrasts) and parametric modulations (correlations with rating 1-4s), specifically, more connectivity between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and mPFC, via additional psychophysiological interaction, or PPI, analyses. More interestingly, GLM and multivariate searchlight analyses jointly reveal the subdivision of mPFC and the PCC/precuneus, with anterior mPFC and dorsal PCC/precuneus more for interpersonal, posterior mPFC and ventral PCC/precuneus more for intrapersonal, SWB, respectively. Taken together, these results are not only consistent with the “cortical midline hypothesis of the self”, but also extending the “spatial gradients of self-to-other-concerned processing” from mPFC to including both mPFC and PCC/precuneus, making them two “hubs” of self-to-other-concerned wellbeing network."
https://openalex.org/W2978698330,"Previous studies have shown that sport experts are different from novices in functions and structures of the cerebellar sub-regions and the functional connectivity (FC) associated with the cerebellum, suggesting the role of the cerebellum on motor skill learning (MSL). However, the manipulation of individuals with different motor skills fails to exclude the effects of innate talents. In addition, individuals with higher motor skills often start with the MSL in their young ages. It is still unclear whether the effects regarding the cerebellum would be shown at one’s adult age. The present study was to directly alter individuals’ motor skills to investigate whether MSL (taking learning to play badminton as an example) in adulthood influences resting-state activity in the cerebellum. To this end, young adults without ball training experience were recruited as participants and were assigned randomly into the experimental group and the control group. Participants in the experimental group were asked to attend a badminton training course for 12 weeks, while the control group did not regularly attend any ball sports during this period. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was recorded before and after the training. Results showed that compared to the control group, the experimental group had smaller amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in right cerebellar hemispheric VI and left VIII after training. For the experimental group, right hemispheric VIII had a stronger FC with left hemispheric IV-V, cerebellar vermal IX, left middle cingulate gyrus and right hippocampus after training. Taken together, these findings suggested that MSL, at least learning to play badminton in adulthood, reduces resting-state activity in different sub-regions in the cerebellum but increases FC between sub-regions of the cerebellum as well as between sub-regions of the cerebellum and cerebral cortices (e.g., middle cingulate cortex and hippocampus)."
https://openalex.org/W2978872923,"Introduction Metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) warrant significant public health concern globally. This study aims to utilise the regional database of a major laboratory network to describe the geographic distribution pattern of eight different cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs), which in turn can potentially generate hypotheses for future research into locality specific preventive approaches. Method A cross-sectional design utilising de-identified laboratory data on eight CMRFs including fasting blood sugar level (FBSL); glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c); total cholesterol (TC); high density lipoprotein (HDL); albumin creatinine ratio (ACR); estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); body mass index (BMI); and diabetes mellitus (DM) status was used to undertake descriptive and spatial analyses. CMRF test results were dichotomised into ‘higher risk’ and ‘lower risk’ values based on existing risk definitions. Australian Census Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) were used as the geographic units of analysis, and an Empirical Bayes (EB) approach was used to smooth rates at SA1 level. Choropleth maps demonstrating the distribution of CMRFs rates at SA1 level were produced. Spatial clustering of CMRFs was assessed using Global Moran’s I test and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA). Results A total of 1,132,016 test data derived from 256,525 individuals revealed significant geographic variation in the distribution of ‘higher risk' CMRF findings. The populated eastern seaboard of the study region demonstrated the highest rates of CMRFs. Global Moran’s I values were significant and positive at SA1 level for all CMRFs. The highest spatial autocorrelation strength was found among obesity rates (0.328), and the lowest for albuminuria (0.028). LISA tests identified significant High-High (HH) and Low-Low (LL) spatial clusters of CMRFs, with LL predominantly in the less populated northern, central and southern regions of the study area. Conclusion The study describes a range of CMRFs with different distributions in the study region. The results allow generation of hypotheses to test in future research concerning location specific population health approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2978986771,"The biology and ecology of Africa’s largest fruit bat remains largely understudied and enigmatic despite at least two highly unusual attributes. The acoustic lek mating behavior of the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) in the Congo basin was first described in the 1970s. More recently molecular testing implicated this species and other African bats as potential reservoir hosts for Ebola virus and it was one of only two fruit bat species epidemiologically linked to the 2008 Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola outbreak. Here we share findings from the first pilot study of hammer-headed bat movement using GPS tracking and accelerometry units and a small preceding radio-tracking trial at an apparent lekking site. The radio-tracking revealed adult males had high rates of nightly visitation to the site compared to females (only one visit) and that two of six females day-roosted ~100 m west of Libonga, the nearest village that is ~1.6 km southwest. Four months later, in mid-April 2018, five individual bats, comprised of four males and one female, were tracked from two to 306 days, collecting from 67 to 1022 GPS locations. As measured by mean distance to the site and proportion of nightly GPS locations within 1 km of the site (percent visitation), the males were much more closely associated with the site (mean distance 1.4 km; 51% visitation), than the female (mean 5.5 km; 2.2% visitation). Despite the small sample size, our tracking evidence supports our original characterization of the site as a lek, and the lek itself is much more central to male than female movement. Moreover, our pilot demonstrates the technical feasibility of executing future studies on hammer-headed bats that will help fill problematic knowledge gaps about zoonotic spillover risks and the conservation needs of fruit bats across the continent."
https://openalex.org/W2979138348,"Information on healthcare costs in low-and-middle-income countries is limited. This study presents a framework to perform healthcare cost estimates for each province in China.This study has two aims. Using cervical cancer as an example, the first aim is to use data (including micro-costing data) from one province to derive estimates for other provinces in China. This used provincial and national Chinese-language statistical reports and considered levels of service delivery, hospital-seeking behaviour, and the urban/rural population distribution. The second aim is to characterise the relationship between the reference costs estimated using the method mentioned above and two sets of cost estimates derived using simplified cost-scaling method with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the Human Development Index (HDI). For simplified methods, regression modelling characterised the relationship between province-specific healthcare costs and macro-economic indicators, then we used the exponential fit to extrapolate costs.Using the reference method, the estimated costs were found to vary substantially by urban/rural regions and between provinces; the ratios of highest to lowest provincial costs were 3.5 for visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), 4.4 for cold knife conisation (CKC) and 4.6 for stage II cancer treatment. The HDI-based scaling method generally resulted in a better fit to reference costs than the GDP method.These reference costs for cervical cancer can inform cost-effectiveness evaluation of cervical screening and HPV vaccination in China. HDI-based methods for cost-scaling-based on social, as well as purely economic, factors-have potential to provide more accurate estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2977794543,"The formation of the sea urchin spicule skeleton requires the participation of hydrogel-forming protein families that regulate mineral nucleation and nanoparticle assembly processes that give rise to the spicule. However, the structure and molecular behavior of these proteins is not well established, and thus our ability to understand this process is hampered. We embarked on a study of sea urchin spicule proteins using a combination of biophysical and bioinformatics techniques. Our biophysical findings indicate that recombinant variants of the two most studied spicule matrix proteins, SpSM50 and SpSM30B/C (S. purpuratus) have a conformational landscape that include a C-terminal random coil/intrinsically disordered MAPQG sequence coupled to a conserved, folded N-terminal C-type lectin-like (CTLL) domain, with SpSM50 > SpSM30B/C with regard to intrinsic disorder. Both proteins possess solvent-accessible unfolded MAQPG sequence regions where Asn, Gln, and Arg residues may be accessible for protein hydrogel interactions with water molecules. Our bioinformatics study included seven other spicule matrix proteins where we note similarities between these proteins and rare, unusual proteins that possess folded and unfolded traits. Moreover, spicule matrix proteins possess three types of sequences: intrinsically disordered, amyloid-like, and folded protein-protein interactive. Collectively these reactive domains would be capable of driving protein assembly and hydrogel formation. Interestingly, three types of global conformations are predicted for the nine member protein set, wherein we note variations in the arrangement of intrinsically disordered and interactive globular domains. These variations may reflect species-specific requirements for spiculogenesis. We conclude that the molecular landscape of spicule matrix protein families enables them to function as hydrogelators, nucleators, and assemblers of mineral nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2978262207,"Background Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae resides in aquatic reservoirs of cholera-endemic areas mostly in a dormant form known as conditionally viable environmental cells (CVEC) in which the bacteria remain embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix, and fail to grow in routine bacteriological culture. The CVEC can be resuscitated by supplementing culture media with either of two autoinducers CAI-1 and AI-2, which are signal molecules controlling quorum sensing, a regulatory network of bacterial gene expression dependent on cell density. This study investigated possible existence of variant strains that overproduce AIs, sufficient to resuscitate CVEC in environmental waters. Methods Environmental V. cholerae isolates and Tn insertion mutants of a V. cholerae strain C6706 were screened for production of AIs using bioluminescent reporter strains. Relevant mutations in environmental strains which overproduced AI-2 were characterized by nucleotide sequencing and genetic complementation studies. Effect of AIs produced in culture supernatants of relevant strains on reactivation of CVEC in water was determined by resuscitation assays. Results Two of 54 environmental V. cholerae isolates were found to overproduce AI-2. Screening of a Tn-insertion library of V. cholerae strain C6706, identified a mutant which overproduced AI-2, and carried Tn insertion in the cqsS gene. Nucleotide sequencing also revealed mutations inactivating the cqsS gene in environmental isolates which overproduced AI-2, and this property was reversed when complemented with a wild type cqsS gene. Culture of river water samples supplemented with spent medium of these mutants resuscitated dormant V. cholerae cells in water. Significance V. cholerae strains with inactivated cqsS gene may offer a convenient source of AI-2 in enhanced assays for monitoring bacteriological quality of water. The results also suggest a potential role of naturally occurring cqsS mutants in the environmental biology of V. cholerae. Furthermore, similar phenomenon may have relevance in the ecology of other waterborne bacterial pathogens beyond V. cholerae."
https://openalex.org/W2979012341,"Background Due to the rise in incidence, the long term effect of sepsis are becoming more evident. There is increasing evidence that sepsis may result in an impaired health related quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether health related quality of life is impaired in sepsis survivors and which clinical parameters are associated with the affected health related quality of life. Methods We analyzed 880 Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires that were sent to sepsis survivors who participated in the Prehospital Antibiotics Against Sepsis (PHANTASi) trial. These questionnaires were sent by email, 28 days after discharge. Data entry and statistical analyses were performed in SPSS. The data from the general Dutch population, was obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) and served as a control group. Subsequently, 567 sepsis survivors were matched to 567 controls. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare these two groups. Within the group, we sought to explain the diminished health related quality of life by factor analysis. Results We found that sepsis survivors have a worse health related quality of life compared to the general Dutch population. This negative effect was more evident for the physical component than the mental component of health related quality of life. We found that health related quality of life was significantly altered by advancing age and female sex. We also found that the total length of stay (in the hospital) and (previous) comorbidity negatively affect the physical component of health related quality of life. Conclusion In our study we found that health related quality of life in sepsis survivors, 28 days after discharge, is severely diminished in comparison with the general Dutch population. The physical domain is severely affected, whereas the mental domain is less influenced. The length of stay, comorbidity, advancing age and female sex all have a negative effect on the Physical Component Scale of the health related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2977845886,"Background Protease inhibitors (PI) are especially important in salvage therapy. Previous treatment failure with a PI containing regimen may elicit resistance mutations, reducing PI susceptibility and limiting treatment options. The aim of this study was to describe major PI mutations among patients exposed to at least one PI to evaluate predictors of mutation emergence and the impact of subtypes on resistance. Methodology Partial HIV-1 pol sequences (Sanger Sequencing) from patients exposed to PI with virological failure were genotyped from January 2014 to December 2017. Drug resistance mutations (DRM), antiretroviral susceptibility (GSS) and subtypes, along clinical and laboratory parameters, were evaluated using logistic regression to access the predictors of mutation emergence. Results In 27.5% (466/1696) of the cases at least one major PI mutations was identified, most commonly M46 (14.7%), V82 (13.8%) and I54 (13.3%). Mutations to NRTI and NNRTI were observed in 69.6% and 59.9%, respectively, of the 1696 sequences. Full activity to darunavir was predicted in 88% (1496/1696), but was only 57% among those with at least one PI-DRM. Subtype C sequences had less major PI-DRMs (10%, 9/87) compared to B (28%, 338/1216) or F (35%, 58/168) (p <0.001) but adjusted analysis suggested that this association is not independent from a shorter treatment time and fewer regimens (OR 0.59, Confidence Interval 95: 0.2–2.5, p = 0.48). Subtype F, together with NRTI mutations and longer time on treatment was associated to presence of PI-DRM, to a lower darunavir GSS and to mutations at codon I50. Conclusions Among patients with PI-DRM, full activity to darunavir was compromised in almost half of the cases and efforts to detect failure at earlier time are warranted, particularly for HIV-1 subtype F that showed association to the emergence of resistance, with potential impact in protease inhibitors sequencing. Furthermore, NRTI mutations may serve as an indicative of sufficient adherence to allow PI-DRM emergence."
https://openalex.org/W2978343670,"Many animals are able to sense the earth’s magnetic field, including varieties of arthropods and members of all major vertebrate groups. While the existence of this magnetic sense is widely accepted, the mechanism of action remains unknown. Building from recent work on synthetic magnetoreceptors, we propose a new model for natural magnetosensation based on the rotating magnetocaloric effect (RME), which predicts that heat generated by magnetic nanoparticles may allow animals to detect features of the earth’s magnetic field. Using this model, we identify the conditions for the RME to produce physiological signals in response to the earth’s magnetic field and suggest experiments to distinguish between candidate mechanisms of magnetoreception."
https://openalex.org/W2977261648,"Background and objectives The construction of whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging atlases allows to perform statistical analysis with applications in anomaly detection, longitudinal, and correlation studies. Atlas-based methods require a common coordinate system to which all the subjects are mapped through image registration. Optimisation of the reference space is an important aspect that affects the subsequent analysis of the registered data, and having a reference space that is neutral with respect to local tissue volume is valuable in correlation studies. The purpose of this work is to generate a reference space for whole-body imaging that has zero voxel-wise average volume change when mapped to a cohort. Methods This work proposes an approach to register multiple whole-body images to a common template using volume changes to generate a synthetic reference space, starting with an initial reference and refining it by warping it with a deformation that brings the voxel-wise average volume change associated to the mappings of all the images in the cohort to zero. Results Experiments on fat/water separated whole-body MR images show how the method effectively generates a reference space neutral with respect to volume changes, without reducing the quality of the registration nor introducing artefacts in the anatomy, while providing better alignment when compared to an implicit reference groupwise approach. Conclusions The proposed method allows to quickly generate a reference space neutral with respect to local volume changes, that retains the registration quality of a sharp template, and that can be used for statistical analysis of voxel-wise correlations in large datasets of whole-body image data."
https://openalex.org/W2978224917,"Guyana expanded its HIV response in 2005 but the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections has not been characterized.The 2011 Seroprevalence and Behavioral Epidemiology Risk Survey for HIV and STIs collected biologic specimens with demographic and behavioral data from a representative sample of Guyana military personnel. Diagnostics included commercial serum: HIV antibody; total antibody to hepatitis B core (anti-HBc); IgM anti-HBc; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); anti-HBs; antibody to HCV with confirmatory testing; and HBV DNA sequencing with S gene fragment phylogenetic analysis. Chi-square, p-values and prevalence ratios determined statistical significance.Among 480 participants providing serologic specimens, 176 (36.7%) tested anti-HBc-positive. Overall, 19 (4.0%) participants tested HBsAg-positive; 17 (89.5%) of the HBsAg-positive participants also had detectable anti-HBc, including 1 (5.3%) IgM anti-HBc-positive male. Four (6.8%) females with available HBV testing were HBsAg-positive, all aged 23-29 years. Sixteen (16, 84.2%) HBsAg-positive participants had sufficient specimen for DNA testing. All 16 had detectable HBV DNA, 4 with viral load >2x104IU/ml. Sequencing found: 12 genotype (gt) A1 with 99.9% genetic identity between 1 IgM anti-HBc-positive and 1 anti-HBc-negative; 2 gtD1; and 2 with insufficient specimen. No statistically significant associations between risk factors and HBV infection were identified.Integrated HIV surveillance identified likely recent adult HBV transmission, current HBV infection among females of reproductive age, moderate HBV infection prevalence (all gtA1 and D1), no HCV infections and low HIV frequency among Guyana military personnel. Integrated HIV surveillance helped characterize HBV and HCV epidemiology, including probable recent transmission, prompting targeted responses to control ongoing HBV transmission and examination of hepatitis B vaccine policies."
https://openalex.org/W2979032031,"The R package crossrun computes the joint distribution of the number of crossings and the longest run in a sequence of independent Bernoulli observations. The main intended application is statistical process control where the joint distribution may be used for systematic investigation, and possibly refinement, of existing rules for distinguishing between signal and noise. While the crossrun vignette is written to assist in practical use, this article gives a hands-on explanation of why the procedures works. The article also includes a discussion of limitations of the present version of crossrun together with an outline of ongoing work to meet these limitations. There is more to come, and it is necessary to grasp the basic ideas behind the procedure implemented both to understand these planned extensions, and how presently implemented rules in statistical process control, based on the number of crossings and the longest run, may be refined."

Multi-scale analysis of the effects of aggregation across different administrative levels allows for the identification of administrative units with sub-optimally located schools and highlights the challenges in allocating resources. Using this method, we verify that the current scheme of free cross-enrollment across administrative boundaries is needed in achieving universal education in the Philippines."
