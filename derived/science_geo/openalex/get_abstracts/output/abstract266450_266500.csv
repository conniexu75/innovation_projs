https://openalex.org/W2089512125,A solid electrolyte fuel cell operating on ammonia fuel has been constructed and tested. The yield of nitric oxide can exceed 60 percent with simultaneous electric energy production. Two dimensionless numbers have been identified which govern the product selectivity and power output of this fuel cell. The cell appears to be a promising candidate for nitric acid and electric energy cogeneration.
https://openalex.org/W4238599958,"A new benthic species of the protobranch bivalve genus Solemya, from the northeastern Pacific Ocean, lacks a gut. It has no internal digestive enzymatic apparatus; nor is there any provision for the secretion of enzymes into the mantle cavity for extraorganismic digestion. The most likely nutritional mechanism for such an animal is the active absorption of dissolved organic molecules from the environment by the large ctenidial lamellae. These are well provided with blood, cleansed of sediment by cilia, and have phosphatases in their epithelial cells. Solemya borealis may also be gutless."
https://openalex.org/W2163346224,"The effects of increased ultraviolet radiation, due to decreased stratospheric ozone, on marine phytoplankton have been investigated with the use of static bottle in situ carbon-14 productivity measurements. The relative biological efficiency for photoinhibition may be used to calculate biologically effective doses and resultant amplification factors. The carbon-14 technique (short-term incubations) is inadequate for assessment of possible large amplification factor photoprocesses that may be ecologically significant."
https://openalex.org/W2062868657,"Average crustal models for the northeastern United States are computed on the basis of the travel times of P and S waves from regional earthquakes. The Precambrian Grenville Province in New York State has a relatively homogeneous crust. The Paleozoic New England Appalachians have a well-defined, two-layer crust that is slightly thicker and shows a high-velocity lower layer relative to the Grenville. A time-term analysis based on P(n) data (waves refracted from the Moho) shows that a relatively thick or low-velocity crust parallels northeast-trending geologic structures in central New England. The observed differences between the two orogenic belts may reflect contrasts in their tectonic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2081431869,"The project ""Energy and Society,"" sponsored by the Swedish Secretariat for Futures Studies, has studied different indigenous energy sources as alternatives to imported oil in Sweden. One alternative is nuclear energy, another is renewable energy. Large uncertainties are associated with both alternatives today. The main characteristics of an energy policy for the rest of the century that does not foreclose either of these options have been identified. Such a policy will have to be based on an understanding of similarities and differences between the alternatives. A nuclear and a solar energy system have been outlined as a basis for an analysis of technical, economic, and institutional issues."
https://openalex.org/W2050742184,"Agricultural development programs have so far been largely unable to meet the food needs of the world's poorest. Increased food production can be achieved only from more intensive agriculture, which requires greater energy inputs per farm worker. Problems of technological infrastructure and escalating oil prices appear to preclude the spread of mechanization to Third World agriculture at this time. Efficient utilization of grazing animals in specific integrated farming systems could not only increase energy inputs through draft and transportation but also increase the yield of high-grade products and by-products from the renewable energy of biomass. An approach to development based on animal agriculture systems is suggested that might initiate a self-sustaining, more productive agriculture requiring only small inputs of fossil-fuel energy."

https://openalex.org/W1970096442,"A model of Uranus's rings proposed by Van Flandern (1979) is discussed. According to the proposed model, Uranus's rings are the gaseous tails of unobserved small satellites. The hypothesis raises a number of objections, e.g., a gaseous torus must have a minor diameter of thousands, not tens, of kilometers; very large densities are required to produce the postulated angles of refraction; and making up the mass losses, even with a generous lifetime, would use up quite a large body in a few million years."
