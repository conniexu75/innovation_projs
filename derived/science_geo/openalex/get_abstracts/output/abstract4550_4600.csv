https://openalex.org/W2039245564,"Iodinated βH-[2-D-alanine]endorphin exhibits specific binding to cultured human lymphocytes. The binding is inhibited by low concentrations of β-endorphin and its D-alanine2 derivative, but is not affected by opiate agonists and antagonists, or by enkephalin analogs, β-lipotropin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; this suggests the existence of a specific, nonopiate binding site (receptor) for β-endorphin. The carboxy-terminal region of β-endorphin is essential for this binding activity, since α-endorphin is not active. β-Endorphin may be a circulating hormone with peripheral physiological effects that are not primarily mediated through interactions with opiate or enkephalin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1571444008,"The synthesis and secretion of various intermediate pituitary proteins was studied by using dispersed intermediate pituitary cell suspensions. Control studies indicated that the isolated cells were obtained in good yield and that after more than 24 h in culture the isolated cells continued to synthesize a collection of proteins similar to those found in freshly extracted intermediate pituitary tissue. Rat intermediate pituitary cells synthesized a molecule (Mr = 30,000; called 30K) that contained antigenic determinants for beta-endorphin, gamma-lipotropin, corticotropin (ACTH), and 16K fragment (the NH2-terminal region of mouse tumor cell pro-ACTH/endorphin). This 30K molecule, two high molecular weight forms of ACTH(13K and 20K), and 16K fragment were all shown to be glycoproteins. Continuous labeling and pulse-chase incubations were used to define the intracellular biosynthetic processing of the 30K molecule. After a 15-min pulse incubation the 30K molecule was the only labeled protein containing antigenic determinants for beta-endorphin, gamma-lipotropin, ACTH, or 16K fragment. A beta-lipotropin-like molecule served as a biosynthetic intermediate in the production of proteins similar to beta-endorphin and gamma-lipotropin. Methionine-enkephalin and alpha-endorphin were not major products in the intermediate lobe cells. Molecules similar to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (ACTH(18-39)) were also derived from the same 30K molecule; 20K ACTH served as a biosynthetic intermediate in this conversion. In rat intermediate pituitary cells ACTH(1-39) was not a major final product of the intracellular biosynthetic processing of the 30K molecule. The 30K molecule also served as a precursor to a protein similar to mouse tumor cell 16K fragment and related smaller proteins. With rat intermediate pituitary cells, pulse-chase experiments utilizing [35S]methionine demonstrated almost quantitative conversion of the 30K precursor into labeled proteins similar to beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. In the absence of added secretagogues, small amounts of all of the smaller proteins derived from the 30K precursor were secreted coordinately into the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W1483759283,"Abstract Oxidation factor, a protein required for electron transfer from succinate to cytochrome c in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has been purified from isolated succinate . cytochrome c reductase complex. Purification of the protein has been followed by a reconstitution assay in which restoration of ubiquinol . cytochrome c reductase activity is proportional to the amount of oxidation factor added back to depleted reductase complex. The purified protein is a homogeneous polypeptide on acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and migrates with an apparent Mr = 24,500. Purified oxidation factor restores succinate . cytochrome c reductase and ubiquinol . cytochrome c reductase activities to depleted reductase complex. It is not required for succinate dehydrogenase nor for succinate . ubiquinone reductase activities of the reconstituted reductase complex. Oxidation factor co-electrophoreses with the iron-sulfur protein polypeptide of ubiquinol . cytochrome c reductase complex. The purified protein contains 56 nmol of nonheme iron and 36 nmol of acid-labile sulfide/mg of protein and possesses an EPR spectrum with the characteristic g = 1.90 signal identical to that of the iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome b . c1 complex. In addition, the optimal conditions for extraction of oxidation factor, including reduction with hydrosulfite and treatment of the b . c1 complex with antimycin, are identical to those which facilitate extraction of the iron-sulfur protein from the b . c1 complex. These results indicate that oxidation factor is a reconstitutively active form of the iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome b . c1 complex first discovered by Rieske and co-workers (Rieske, J.S., Maclennan, D.H., and Coleman, R. (1964) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 15, 338-344) and thus demonstrate that this iron-sulfur protein is required for electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c in the mitochondrial respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W2078302353,"The incidence of trigeminal ganglion infection after corneal inoculation of guinea pigs with thymidine kinase-negative mutants of herpes simplex virus was markedly reduced compared to infection after inoculation of thymidine kinase-positive virus. Thymidine kinase-negative herpes simplex virus replicated well in ocular tissues in which dividing or potentially dividing cells were present, but not in trigeminal ganglion infection of nondividing neurons. Thymidine kinase-positive virus, however, replicated well in ocular tissues as well as in trigeminal ganglion. These results suggest that thymidine kinase expression of herpes simplex virus may be important in infections of sensory ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W1653853239,"Soluble proteins can be extracted by osmotic shock of purified rod (photoreceptor cell) outer segments that have intact plasma membranes. The soluble proteins include a component that contains tightly bound GDP-Exchange of this GDP with exogenous nucleotide is catalyzed by (and requires) the membranes from the outer segments. ATP does not participate in these reactions. Approximately one-half of the binding sites in the soluble component require GTP as the source of exogenous nucleotide; the remainder accept GTP or GDP with equal facility. When exogenous GTP is the source of bound nucleotide, it is found in the complex in the form of GDP. Exchange of bound nucleotide with GTP is stoichiometrically related to GTPase activity; this activity is highly dependent upon the presence of both membranes and soluble protein. The soluble nucleotide binding protein was purified by making use of the fact that it binds tightly to the membranes (under conditions of moderate ionic strength) in the absence of GTP and can be eluted by solutions containing low concentrations of GTP (but not GDP or ATP, nor can it be eluted by GTP-free solutions of low ionic strength). The purified protein contains two polypeptide chains of molecular weights 41,000 and 37,000; these are the major species that can be extracted from the outer segments by osmotic shock, and they constitute approximately 7% of the total protein of the isolated organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2082518238,"Simian virus 40 mutants and deletions between 0.54 and 0.59 map units direct the synthesis of defective 20K t antigens (Crawford et al., 1978). These deletion mutants transformed actively growing CHL cells nearly as efficently as did wild-type virus, in either the focus formation assay or the growth in soft agar assay. In contrast, when CHL cells were in a resting state during infection, the transformation frequency of the mutants relative to wild-type dropped approximately 50 fold. The presence of the phorbol ester, TPA, diminished this difference. CHL cell lines transformed by the deletion mutants and selected by the focus assay grew almost as efficiently in soft agar as lines transformed by wild-type SV40. Both produced tumors in nude mice. The function of the 20K t antigen is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1622906336,"GTP evoked both an activatory and an inhibitory response from adipocyte adenylate cyclase. This paper describes the persistence of the bimodal response under a variety of assay conditions. Additionally, manipulations are described which eliminate one or other of these actions. Treatment of adipocyte plasma membranes with cholera toxin A1 peptide and NAD+ abolishes the inhibitory phase of GTP action while preserving the activating phase. Treatment of the membranes with p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid eliminates the activatory phase while maintaining the inhibitory processes mediated by GTP in adipocytes normally coexist and operate through different pathways since either phase can be abolished leaving the other intact. Adenosine and its purine-modified analogs inhibit fat cell adenylate cyclase in the GTP inhibitory phase (Londos, C., Cooper, D. M. F., Schlegel, W., and Rodbell, M. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 5362-5366). When this effect of GTP is abolished by either cholera toxin or Gpp(NH)p pretreatment, the inhibitory action of adenosine analogs is also lost. These data suggest a central role for GTP in mediating both activation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase by agents which act through cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1522788913,"Highly purified SV40 large T antigen exhibits an ATPase activity which can be stimulated approximately 7-fold by the DNA homopolymer poly(dT). The poly(dT)-stimulated enzyme can hydrolyze various ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, with ATP and dATP serving as the best substrates. Purified large T antigen hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and Pi, with a maximum specific activity of 13.5 mumol of inorganic phosphate released per h per mg of protein. Of the various natural and synthetic polynucleotides tested, poly(dT) was by far the best activator. Long chain poly(dT) molecules are much more effective activators than are short chain length oligo(dT) molecules. The highly purified large T antigen contains no detectable protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1549939931,"The role of cyclic AMP in the regulation of aldosterone production by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), angiotensin II (A II), potassium, and serotonin was examined in collagenase-dispersed adrenal glomerulosa cells. The ability of 8-bromo cyclic AMP and choleragen to stimulate maximum aldosterone production indicated that cyclic AMP could act as second messenger for certain of the aldosterone-stimulating factors. The actions of ACTH and choleragen on aldosterone and cyclic AMP production were correlated in dog and rat cells, and a similar relation was seen during stimulation of rat cells by serotonin. In contrast, A II and potassium did not cause changes in cyclic AMP formation while stimulating aldosterone production. Intracellular and receptor-bound cyclic AMP were increased 3-fold by 10(-7) M ACTH but not by A II. Addition of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor increased the magnitude of the cyclic AMP response to ACTH but did not change the lack of stimulation by A II or potassium. In dog cells, the effects of A II and potassium on aldosterone production were partially additive to those of ACTH, choleragen, and 8-bromo cyclic AMP. In contrast, no additivity was observed between A II and potassium, or between combinations of the cyclic AMP-dependent stimuli. These results indicate that the actions of ACTH on aldosterone secretion are mediated by cyclic AMP formation, whereas A II and potassium stimulate aldosterone production through an independent mechanism. The lack of additivity between steroid responses to A II and potassium suggests that these factors could share a common mode of action on steroidogenesis in zona glomerulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970079147,"We have constructed and propagated two SV40 recombinants in which different portions of the viral late gene region are replaced by a rabbit beta-globin coding sequence derived from a cloned cDNA (Maniatis et al., 1976). One of these recombinants, which retains the promoter, leader and intervening sequences for a viral late mRNA, directs the synthesis of a stable SV40-globin hybrid transcript. Using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, we have shown that this globin RNA is translated in infected monkey cells. A second recombinant, which retains the late region promoter but lacks the RNA splicing region, produces neither a stable globin transcript nor any detectable beta-globin. These experiments indicate that some sequence within a 500 bp SV40 segment, presumably the splicing region, is required for the accumulation of stable mRNA. They also demonstrate how hybrid transducing viruses can be used both to characterize viral regulatory sequences and to produce new gene products in cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077476035,Low-frequency stimulation of hippocampal mossy fiber axons in zinc-deficient adult rats produced synaptic responses that declined in amplitude with successive stimuli. This response decrement is abnormal and suggests that the heavy deposits of zinc in mossy fiber boutons are important for synaptic transmission.

https://openalex.org/W1978222338,"Rat cells transformed by polyoma virus contain, in addition to integrated viral DNA, a small number of nonintegrated viral DNA molecules. The free viral DNA originates from the integrated form through a spontaneous induction of viral DNA replication in a minority of the cell population. Its presence is under the control of the viral A locus. To determine whether the induction of free viral DNA replication was accompanied by a loss of integrated viral DNA molecules in a phenomenon similar to the ""curing"" of lysogenic bacteria, we selected for revertants arising in the transformed rat populations and determined whether these cells had lost integrated viral genomes. We further investigated whether the viral A function was necessary for ""curing"" by determining the frequency of cured cells in populations of rat cells transformed by the ts-a mutant of polyoma virus following propagation at the permissive or nonpermissive temperature. A large proportion of the revertants isolated were negative or weakly positive when assayed by immunofluorescence for polyoma T antigen and were unable to produce infectious virus upon fusion with permissive mouse cells. The T antigen-negative, virus rescue-negative clones can be retransformed by superinfection and appear to have lost a considerable proportion of integrated viral DNA sequences. Restriction enzyme analysis of the integrated viral DNA sequences shows that the parental transformed lines contain tandem repeats of integrated viral molecules, and that this tandem arrangement is generally lost in the cured derivatives. While cells transformed by wild-type virus undergo ""curing"" with about the same frequency at 33 degrees or 39 degrees C, cells transformed by the ts-a mutant contain a much higher frequency of cured cells after propagation at 33 degrees than at 39 degrees C. Our results indicate that in polyoma-transformed rat cells, loss of integrated viral DNA can occur at a rather high rate, producing (at least in some cases) cells which have reverted partially or completely to a normal phenotype. Loss of integrated viral DNA is never total and appears to involve an excision event. The polyoma A function (large T antigen) is necessary for such excision to occur. In the absence of a functional A gene product, the association of the viral DNA with the host DNA appears to be very stable."

https://openalex.org/W1565334879,"The effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) and two analogs of cAMP have been studied in the PC12 line of rat pheochromocytoma cells. We have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to detect more than 800 proteins from control and NGF-treated cells. Of these proteins, none were qualitatively repressed in response to NGF, and no new proteins appeared after NGF treatment. Visual inspection of the gels showed that approximately 5% of the proteins were detectably increased or decreased in rate of synthesis by NGF, and each of these changes was mimicked by both cAMP analogs. The two-dimensional gel data were further analyzed by a computerized scanning system. This analysis has revealed many significant changes that are smaller than those detected by eye. Approximately 25 to 30% of the proteins analyzed were found to be altered in rate of synthesis by 30% or more. Statistical analysis has shown that the response to NGF and the response to dibutyryl cAMP are highly correlated, even down to changes as small as 30%. No proteins were found to be significantly altered by both dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo cAMP, but not by NGF. These results show that NGF causes only quantitative modulations of protein synthesis in PC12 cells, and these data strongly suggest that the response of PC12 cells to NGF is mediated by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1984149483,The microiontophoretic application of thyrotropin-releasing hormone causes a selective reduction in neuronal excitation evoked by L-glutamate but not by acetylcholine in rat cerebral cortex. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone has no influence on the activity of acetylcholinesterase or on choline uptake and release from cerebral synaptosomes. This evidence for a selective interaction between a centrally acting peptide and an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter may indicate a specific locus of thyrotropin-releasing hormone action at glutamate-activated receptor sites.
https://openalex.org/W2087626594,"We have introduced a fragment of the chromosomal mouse beta major globin gene into SV40 and used the resultant hybrid virus to infect cultured monkey kidney cells. The mouse DNA fragment, which contains an intervening sequence and a poly(A) addition site, has been inserted in both possible orientations relative to the SV40 late region promoter. While the fragment is transcribed regardless of orientation, the RNA splice signal and poly(A) addition site are utilized only when the fragment is inserted in the ""sense"" orientation. Thus genomic mouse signals for both splicing and polyadenylation are recognized across species boundaries. Furthermore, since only an 18 bp segment was included on the 5' border of the intervening sequence, we can define a maximum length for this splice signal."
https://openalex.org/W1991327161,"Mouse spinal neurons grown in tissue culture were used to examine the membrane mechanisms of action of the peptide substance P. Two functionally distinct actions were observed, one being a rapidly desensitizing excitation, and the other being a dose-dependent, reversible depression of excitatory responses to the putative amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate. These effects on excitability suggest that substance P may play more than one role in intercellular communication in the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1489432928,"Abstract Bovine vascular endothelial cells bind chylomicrons via a high affinity membrane receptor site. Subsequent to binding, the chylomicron apoprotein was neither internalized nor degraded by either sparse or confluent (contact-inhibited) cells. However, the adsorption of chylomicrons was associated with interiorization of chylomicron cholesteryl ester and triglyceride and the hydrolysis of these lipids to free cholesterol and unesterified fatty acids by a lysosome-dependent pathway. This pathway was active in both subconfluent and contact-inhibited cells. The chylomicron free cholesterol so produced inhibited endogeneous cholesterol synthesis measured in terms of the incorporation of [1-14C]-acetate into sterol. An excess of high density lipoprotein was 2- to 3-fold more effective in reducing both binding of chylomicrons and interiorization of chylomicron lipid than was low density lipoprotein. Chylomicron binding was not down-regulated by preincubation of the cells with low density lipoprotein or chylomicrons. The results are discussed in the context of cholesterol sources for contact-inhibited endothelial cells which do not interiorize low density lipoprotein cholesterol."

A similar binding pattern is produced in control membranes by treatment with Triton X-100, phospholipase C, or glycerophosphoethanolamine. Thus, it is likely that phospholipids or their metabolites regulate the accessibility of the GABA binding site and that this regulation is abnormal in Huntington's chorea."

https://openalex.org/W1546870562,"Yeast mitochondria and purified yeast cytochrome c oxidase incorporated into micelles of the nonionic detergent Tween 80 were equilibrated with the hydrophobic aryl azides 5-[125I]iodonaphthyl-1-azide or S-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-[35S]thiophenol. The azides were then converted to highly reactive nitrenes by flash photolysis or by illumination for 2 min and the derivatized cytochrome c oxidase subunits were identified by gel electrophoresis and radioactivity measurements. 5-[125I]Iodonaphthyl-1-azide labeled mainly the three mitochondrially made Subunits I to III and the cytoplasmically made Subunit VII. Subunits IV to VI or cytochrome c bound to the purified enzyme were labeled 9- to 90-fold less. Essentially the same result was obtained with S-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-[35S]thiophenol except that Subunit V was labeled as well. In contrast, all seven subunits as well as cytochrome c were heavily labeled when the enzyme was dissociated with dodecyl sulfate prior to photolabeling with either of the two probes. These data indicate that all subunits of yeast cytochrome c oxidase except Subunits IV and VI are at least partly embedded in the lipid bilayer of the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1575143219,"Transformation of cultured chick embryo chondrocytes with Rous sarcoma virus gives rise to increased incorporation of isotopic precursors into hyaluronate and decreased incorporation into chondroitin 6-sulfate. Chemical measurements of these glycosaminoglycans showed corresponding changes. Comparison of the kinetics of production of glycosaminoglycan by normal and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chondrocytes demonstrated (i) that the rate of accumulation in the medium was similar in both cultures, and (ii) that approximately 50% of total glycosaminoglycan produced by the normal chondrocytes, but only 10% of that from the transformed cells, accumulated in the cell layer. Prelabel-chase experiments indicated that cell surface-associated hyaluronate, as measured by release from the cell layer by trypsin treatment, was shed rapidly into the medium and accounted for all of the hyaluronate which accumulated in the medium. Thus we conclude (i) that accumulation of cell surface-associated glycosaminoglycan is dramatically reduced in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chondrocytes, and (ii) that hyaluronate produced by the transformed chondrocytes is first deposited in the cell-associated extracellular compartment and then rapidly shed into the medium, rather than being secreted directly into the medium."

B., and Dube, S. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 4817--4822). We have phosphorylated bisphosphoglycerate synthase from horse red blood cells with [U-32P]glycerate-2,3-P2, digested with trypsin, and purified the phosphopeptide. The amino acid sequence of the phosphohistidine peptide has been determined to be: His-Gly-Gln-Gly-Ala-Trp-Asn-Lys. In like manner, a phosphohistidyl peptide has now been purified from yeast phosphoglycerate mutase, for which the amino acid sequence is known (Winn, S. I., Watson, H. C., Fothergill, L. A., and Harkins, R. N. (1977) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 5, 657-659). The amino acid composition of the phosphopeptide indicates that histidine-8 was phosphorylated. The sequence of this peptide is closely homologous with the active site peptide from bisphosphoglycerate synthase. In yeast phosphoglycerate mutase, the denatured phosphoenzyme hydrolyzes with a single rate constant of 2.02 X 10(-4) s-1 at pH 3, 45 degrees C. The relevance of these observations to the enzymatic mechanism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1557536228,"Abstract Monomeric cAMP-binding fragments of molecular mass 16,000 and 14,000 daltons were obtained by Sephadex G-75 chromatography of partially trypsin-hydrolyzed regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozymes I and II, respectively. The Stokes radii were 19.1 and 16.4 A, the frictional ratios were 1.15 and 1.03, and the sedimentation coefficients were 1.94 and 1.91 S for the 16,000- and 14,000-dalton fragments, respectively. The 16,000-dalton fragment retained specific cyclic nucleotide binding characteristics of the native protein. The specificity of cyclic nucleotide binding to the 14,000-dalton fragment (cAMP greater than cIMP = 8-bromo-cAMP = 8-oxo-cAMP greater than cUMP = cGMP) differed from that of the native subunit (cAMP = 8-oxo-cAMP greater than 8-bromo-cAMP greater than cIMP greater than cUMP = cGMP). The 14,000-dalton fragment bound nearly 1 mol of cAMP/mol of fragment. The binding exchange rate of cAMP was much faster for the 14,000-dalton fragment than for either of the native regulatory subunits or for the 16,000 dalton fragment. Although hemin inhibited cAMP binding to the native regulatory subunits and to the 16,000 dalton fragment, the molecule did not affect cAMP binding to the 14,000-dalton fragment. Both of the native regulatory subunits and the isolated 16,000- and 14,000-dalton fragments could be covalently labeled with the photoaffinity analog, 8-N3-[32P]cAMP. The 14,000-dalton fragment could not be phosphorylated and neither fragment could recombine with the catalytic subunit to inhibit its activity. The results indicate that the functional entities of the regulatory subunit other than cAMP binding are destroyed by trypsin. The properties of the 16,000-dalton fragment suggest that the intact cAMP-binding site is contained in a small trypsin-resistant core of the native regulatory subunit. The properties of the 14,000-dalton fragment imply that part of the binding site of the native regulatory subunit was slighlty modified or lost during preparation of this fragment."

Of the 30 animals tested, 28 contained LDL-I and LDL-II, and 15 had, in addition to the first two components, LDL-III. Several exhibited additional minor LDL components. LDL-III with a mean buoyant density of 1.050 g/ml had an unexpectedly large molecular weight (3.47 x 10/sup 6/) when compared to LDL-I (3.32 x 10/sup 6/) and LDL-II (2.75 x 10/sup 6/) which had buoyant densities of 1.027 and 1.036 g/ml, respectively. The unusual physical properties of LDL-III were found to be due to a higher content and nature of its protein moiety, represented only by apo B according to electrophoretic criteria and radioimmunoassay. The protein of LDL-III (apo LDL-III) also differed from the other two in having a higher galactose and sialic acid content. Moreover, relative to LDL-I and LDL-II, LDL-III exhibited differences in behavior when using techniques of circular dichroism, radioimmunoassay, agarose- and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, which could be attributed to its protein moiety. In contrast,more » the molar lipid content of LDL-III was almost identical to that of LDL-I, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that the neutral lipids of the three LDLs undergo almost identicaltransitions below body temperature. When all of the data were analyzed according to the method of Shen et al., the major structural difference between LDL-III and the other two LDLs appeared to relate to the degree of occupancy and conformation of the apoprotein in the surface of the particles.« less"

Incubation of cytosol from these tumor slices with nuclei from unincubated tumors results in nuclear uptake of the 56,000-dalton cyclic AMP receptor and in phosphorylation of the 76,000-dalton nuclear protein. Binding of the 56,000-dalton receptor and phosphorylation of the 76,000-dalton protein also occur in DMBA tumor nuclei when protein kinase type II of bovine heart is used.

https://openalex.org/W1505777551,"When either fructose, glycerol, or succinate served as a sole source of carbon and energy in nitrogen-starved cultures of Escherichia coli W4597(K) the values of the kinetic constants of the equation that expresses the relationship between glycogen synthesis and hexose phosphates were different from the values observed when glucose was the sole source of carbon and energy. Addition of glucose during either exponential growth or nitrogen starvation to a culture using one of the other carbon sources slowed the rate of glycogen synthesis and shifted the values of the constants toward the values observed in cultures using glucose alone. Addition of cyclic AMP (cyclic adenosine 3‘:5‘-monophosphate) during exponential growth of a culture using glucose caused the values of the constants to be shifted toward the values observed in cultures using a carbon source other than glucose. In all of the metabolic conditions studied in this report the adenylate energy charge ((ATP + 1/2 ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP)) and the level of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen synthesis, ADP-glucose synthetase (glucose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.27), were the same. The data presented here indicate that the difference we observed in the quantitative relationship for glycogen synthesis is the result of the different cellular levels of cyclic AMP in the cells using glucose and the cells using one of the other carbon sources. Since cyclic AMP does not affect the velocity of ADP-glucose synthetase in vitro, apparently a change in the cellular level of cyclic AMP causes a shift in the cellular level of a presently unknown (and previously undetected) effector of this enzyme. The shift in the level of this effector evidently alters the response of the enzyme in vivo to the substrate glucose 1-phosphate and the activator fructose 1,6-diphosphate."

Refolding of the porphyrin protein occurs in essentially a single, exceptionally rapid kinetic phase (tau = 14 ms, 0.75 M guanidinium chloride, pH 6.5, 25 degrees C); whereas refolding of ferricytochrome c occurs in two slower kinetic phases (TAU 1 = 0.10 S, TAU 2 = 20 S) UNDER COMPARABLE CONDITIONS. The presence of Fe(III) in the metalloporphyrin of ferricytochrome c thus has a major effect on the protein folding kinetics. The slow kinetic phase is evidently due to this effect of Fe(III) and not to the slow cis-trans isomerism of the peptide bond of proline residues as has been suggested."

Also, lambda phage DNA and particles with a monomeric insert of polyoma DNA did not induce tumors. Purified recombinant plasmid DNA, as well as phage particles and DNA containing a head-to-tail dimer of polyoma DNA, showed a low degree of oncogenicity, comparable to that of polyoma DNA prepared from mouse cells. These findings support the previous conclusions, based on infectivity assays in mice, that propagation of polyoma virus DNA as a component of recombinant DNA molecules in E. coli K12 reduces its biologic activity many orders of magnitude relative to the virus itself."
https://openalex.org/W1520470494,"The biosynthesis of the Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied in cell cultures of embryonic chick heart. Rates of synthesis were estimated from the incorporation of tritium-labeled leucine into the ATPase. Newly synthesized ATPase was isolated from cells by immunoprecipitation. Radioactive leucine incorporation into the ATPase was determined by gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates and counting of gel slices containing the ATPase band. Accumulation of the ATPase was estimated from the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+-dependent, hydroxylamine-sensitive phosphoprotein in the whole cell membrane fraction of cultured cells. Embryonic heart cells cultured in a medium which permitted cell proliferation showed approximately linearly increasing rates of ATPase synthesis and accumulation/culture plate as the cells proliferated. When cells were cultured in a serum-free medium, cell proliferation was inhibited and there was no sustained increase in the rate of ATPase synthesis or accumulation. Inclusion of isoproterenol or dibutyryl cyclic AMP at concentrations of 10 microM up to 1 mM in serum-free culture medium failed to stimulate significantly ATPase synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1489150286,"We have purified a DNA-binding protein from bacteriophage T5-infected cells. The protein is the product of the T5 gene D5 and is produced in quantities ultimately exceeding 2% of the total cell protein. The protein has no tendency to aggregate and exists in solution as a monomer of about 29,000 daltons. Although the protein binds with a high affinity to both single-stranded (fd, T7) and duplex DNA (T5, T7), there is a preferred binding to duplex DNA. The binding of the gene D5 protein to duplex DNA is cooperative with an estimated dissociation constant of 6.27 x 10(-10) M and leads to the production of a more condensed form of the DNA. In contrast, binding of the gene D5 protein to single-stranded DNA is noncooperative with an estimated dissociation constant of only 1.85 x 10(-8) M and produces a sedimentation shift in the DNA proportional to the added mass of the protein. The protein product of the gene D5 of bacteriophage T5 is known to be required for both T5 DNA replication and for the inhibition of early phage gene expression. We also show here that the protein is required to initiate transcription of the late region of the T5 genome."
https://openalex.org/W277910521,"Crystals of apo- and holo-D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the tail muscle of the Mediterranean lobster Palinurus vulgaris, previously found to be suitable for single crystal microspectrophotometric studies of catalytic activity in the crystalline state, have been examined by x-ray crystallography. The two forms are isomorphous, space group C 2 with cell dimensions a=128.4 A, b=99.9 A, c=80.3 A,beta=113.4 degrees. These data are consistent with a molecular weight of 73,000 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, indicating that the tetrameric molecule possesses an exact 2-fold axis both in the presence and in the absence of NAD+. Analysis of the intensity distribution of conventional x-ray precession photographs shows that two further noncrystallographic diads are present and that the molecule has the 2 pseudo 22 symmetry found in other D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. Binding of NAD+ to apoenzyme in solution, at 25 degrees C, is anticooperative and it can be satisfactorily described by assuming two classes of coenzyme binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1600805597,"Dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine, a principal lipid component of membranes of Escherichia coli fatty acid auxotrophs enriched in elaidic acid, has been studied by paramagnetic resonance, fluorescence, and calorimetric methods. EPR measurements with perdeutero-di-tert-butylnitroxide and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl indicate that, when dispersed in aqueous media, this phospholipid undergoes an abrupt order leads to disorder transition at 37.5 degrees C and 36.5 C, respectively. A similar transition temperature is suggested by experiments with 9-doxyl-dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DEPE). cis- and trans-Parinaric-acid fluorescence polarization measurements indicate that the midpoint of this transition occurs at 34.0 degrees C and 35.5 degrees C, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry of DEPE revealed a single, sharp endotherm at 38.5 degrees C with increasing temperature; two exotherms of similar magnitude were observed at 36.5 degrees C and 34.5 degrees C upon cooling. This double transition was not observed by any of the other methods. From these results we conclude that the major structural transition at 30-31 degrees C observed previously with 5-, 12-, and 16-doxyl stearate in intact E. coli membranes is due to the DEPE present (Morrisett, J.D., Pownall, H.J., Plumlee, R.T., Smith, L.C., Zehner, Z.E., Esfahani, M., and Wakil, S.J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6969-6976)."
https://openalex.org/W1479823865,"The 4'-phosphopantetheine hydrolase of rat liver, partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the prosthetic group 4'-phosphopantetheine from the holo-fatty acid synthetase. The two products of the action of this enzyme, 4'-phosphopantetheine and apo-fatty acid synthetase, were isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and by chromatography on a Sepharose epsilon-aminocaproyl pantetheine column, respectively. The resultant apo-fatty acid synthetase was quantitated by immunoprecipitation and it was also converted to the holoprotein with a crude preparation of rat liver 4'-phosphopantetheine transferase. Quantitative determination of the hydrolase reaction product, 4'-phosphopantetheine, by amino acid analysis and microbiological assays confirmed the presence of 1 mol of this compound/mol of holo-fatty acid synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1501354255,"A novel enzyme system, myo-inositol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, has been isolated from germinating mung bean seeds. The dehydrogenation and cleavage of myo-inositol 1-phosphate by this enzyme leads to the synthesis of a pentose phosphate which appears to be ribulose 5-phosphate. The pH optimum of the enzyme is 8.6; NAD+ is required as coenzyme and no other nucleotides can replace NAD+. Mono- or divalent cations are not essential for the enzyme activity. Stoichiometry of the reaction suggests that 2 mol of NAD+ are reduced per mol of ribulose-5-P generated."
