https://openalex.org/W2068157186,"Histone methylation regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and epigenetic state of the cell. Histone methylation is dynamically regulated by histone methylases and demethylases such as LSD1 and JHDM1, which mediate demethylation of di- and monomethylated histones. It has been unclear whether demethylases exist that reverse lysine trimethylation. We show the JmjC domain-containing protein JMJD2A reversed trimethylated H3-K9/K36 to di- but not mono- or unmethylated products. Overexpression of JMJD2A but not a catalytically inactive mutant reduced H3-K9/K36 trimethylation levels in cultured cells. In contrast, RNAi depletion of the C. elegans JMJD2A homolog resulted in an increase in general H3-K9Me3 and localized H3-K36Me3 levels on meiotic chromosomes and triggered p53-dependent germline apoptosis. Additionally, other human JMJD2 subfamily members also functioned as trimethylation-specific demethylases, converting H3-K9Me3 to H3-K9Me2 and H3-K9Me1, respectively. Our finding that this family of demethylases generates different methylated states at the same lysine residue provides a mechanism for fine-tuning histone methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2133148543,"Covalent modification of histones plays an important role in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription. Histone methylation was thought to be an irreversible modification until recently. Using a biochemical assay coupled with chromatography, we have purified a JmjC domain-containing protein, JHDM2A, which specifically demethylates mono- and dimethyl-H3K9. Similar to JHDM1, JHDM2A-mediated histone demethylation requires cofactors Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate. Mutational studies indicate that a JmjC domain and a zinc finger present in JHDM2A are required for its enzymatic activity. Overexpression of JHDM2A greatly reduced the H3K9 methylation level in vivo. Knockdown of JHDM2A results in an increase in the dimethyl-K9 levels at the promoter region of a subset of genes concomitant with decrease in their expression. Finally, JHDM2A exhibits hormone-dependent recruitment to androgen-receptor target genes, resulting in H3K9 demethylation and transcriptional activation. Thus, our work identifies a histone demethylase and links its function to hormone-dependent transcriptional activation.

Posttranslational histone modifications are involved in a variety of cellular processes through regulating chromatin dynamics (Strahl and Allis, 2000Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). It has become clear that histone methylation is an important part of this histone modification repertoire and functions in heterochromatin formation, X chromosome inactivation, and transcriptional regulation (Margueron et al., 2005Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. The key to development: interpreting the histone code?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, Martin and Zhang, 2005Martin C. Zhang Y. The diverse functions of histone lysine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Histone methylation occurs on both arginine and lysine residues and is catalyzed by three different protein families which include: the protein arginine methyltransferase family, the SET domain-containing family, and the Dot1 protein family (Lachner et al., 2003Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. An epigenetic road map for histone lysine methylation.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, Zhang and Reinberg, 2001Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Transcription regulation by histone methylation: interplay between different covalent modifications of the core histone tails.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). While histone arginine methylation generally correlates with transcriptional activation, histone lysine methylation can signal either activation or repression, depending on the particular lysine residue which is methylated (Kouzarides, 2002Kouzarides T. Histone methylation in transcriptional control.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, Zhang and Reinberg, 2001Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Transcription regulation by histone methylation: interplay between different covalent modifications of the core histone tails.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Even within the same lysine residue, the biological consequence of methylation can differ depending on the methylation state (Santos-Rosa et al., 2002Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T.

Cell. 2003; 12: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of histone modification is dictated by the balance between addition and removal of a given modification. While this notion is generally true for acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, early studies looking at the turnover of methyl groups in bulk histones suggested that histone methylation was not reversible since the half-life of histones, and methyl lysine residues within them, were similar (Byvoet, 1972Byvoet P. In vivo turnover and distribution of radio-N-methyl in arginine-rich histones from rat tissues.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 887-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies indicate that histone methylation is dynamic in certain situations. For example, H3K9 methylation in some inducible inflammatory genes is erased upon activation and restored upon transcriptional repression (Saccani and Natoli, 2002Saccani S. Natoli G. Dynamic changes in histone H3 Lys 9 methylation occurring at tightly regulated inducible inflammatory genes.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, trimethyl-H3K27, which is associated with the inactive X chromosome in the trophoblast stem (TS) cells, disappears during TS cell differentiation (Plath et al., 2003Plath K. Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A. Wang H. de la Cruz C.C. Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y.

The first example of an enzyme that was capable of turning over a methylated residue was the human peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4/PADI4). PAD4/PADI4 converts monomethyl-arginine in histone H3 and H4 to citrulline by demethylimination (Cuthbert et al., 2004Cuthbert G.L. Daujat S. Snowden A.W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hagiwara T. Yamada M.

Lee Y.H. Perlin J.R. Leonelli L. Sonbuchner L.S. McDonald C.H. Cook R.G. Dou Y. et al.Human PAD4 regulates histone arginine methylation levels via demethylimination.Science. 2004; 306: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). However, since PAD4/PADI4 catalyzed demethylimination does not generate arginine and given that PAD4/PADI4 also acts on unmethylated arginine to generate citrulline, PAD4/PADI4 is not a strict demethylase. A recent study has uncovered a true histone lysine demethylase. Shi and colleagues demonstrated that LSD1/BHC110 can specifically demethylate mono- and dimethyl H3K4 in a FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide)-dependent oxidative reaction (Shi et al., 2004Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1.Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that H3K4 demethylation participates in transcriptional repression, LSD1 was previously identified in several histone deacetylase complexes (Hakimi et al., 2002Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. A core-BRAF35 complex containing histone deacetylase mediates repression of neuronal-specific genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Schreiber S.L. CoREST is an integral component of the CoREST-human histone deacetylase complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although there are potential LSD1 homologs in S. pombe, no apparent LSD1 homologs exist in S. cerevisiae even though at least three distinct lysine residues on H3 can be methylated in this organism. This observation, in combination with the fact that oxidative demethylation catalyzed by the LSD1 family of proteins is unable to demethylate trimethylated lysine residues, raises the possibility that additional demethylases that utilize a different enzymatic mechanisms exist. In an effort to identify histone demethylases that differ from the LSD1 family of proteins, we have developed an in vitro histone demethylase assay based on the mechanism used by the DNA repair demethylase AlkB (Falnes et al., 2002Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. AlkB-mediated oxidative demethylation reverses DNA damage in Escherichia coli.Nature. 2002; 419: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, Trewick et al., 2002Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Oxidative demethylation by Escherichia coli AlkB directly reverts DNA base damage.Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Using this assay, coupled with chromatography, we have purified and characterized a family of H3K36 demethylases which we have called JHDM1 (JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase 1; Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). In a parallel study, using G9a-methylated histone substrates, we have purified and characterized a second JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase JHDM2A that specifically demethylates H3K9. We demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of JHDM2A depends on an intact JmjC domain and requires cofactors Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Although JHDM2A is capable of demethylating mono- and dimethyl-H3K9 in vitro and in vivo, it fails to demethylate trimethyl-H3K9. siRNA-mediated knockdown of JHDM2A results in decreased gene expression concomitant with increased promoter H3K9 methylation. Importantly, JHDM2A interacts directly with androgen receptor (AR) and is recruited to AR target genes in a hormone-dependent manner to mediate transcription activation. Thus, our work identifies a novel histone demethylase and links its function to hormone-dependent transcriptional activation. Using a novel biochemical assay, we have recently purified and characterized an H3K36-specific histone demethylase JHDM1A (Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that JHDM1A-mediated histone demethylation utilizes Fe(II) and α-KG as cofactors generating formaldehyde and succinate and requires the evolutionarily conserved JmjC domain for its activity (Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). In that study, we used SET2-methylated nucleosomal histone substrates to monitor histone demethylase activity. In parallel studies, we also used histone substrates methylated by other histone methyltransferases, including the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a (Tachibana et al., 2002Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. G9a histone methyltransferase plays a dominant role in euchromatic histone H3 lysine 9 methylation and is essential for early embryogenesis.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). When the G9a-methylated histone substrates were subjected to demethylation assays using the protein fractions derived from HeLa nuclear extracts (NE) and nuclear pellet (NP; Wang et al., 2001bWang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Methylation of histone H4 at arginine 3 facilitating transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptor.Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), we detected a potential H3K9 demethylase activity in the nuclear extract-derived 0.3 M P11 protein fraction (Figure 1A) . To ascertain whether this activity is the result of a genuine demethylase, we examined its dependency on the required cofactors Fe(II) and α-KG. Results shown in Figure 1B demonstrate that release of formaldehyde not only requires the presence of the protein fraction (Figure 1B, compare lanes 1 and 5), but also the cofactors Fe(II) and α-KG (Figure 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). Addition of ascorbate, which is involved in regenerating Fe(II) from Fe(III), appears to stimulate formaldehyde production (Figure 1B, compare lanes 1 and 4). These results indicate that a histone demethylase activity is present in the nuclear extract-derived 0.3 M P11 fraction and the candidate enzyme likely uses the same oxidative demethylation mechanism used by JHDM1A for histone demethylation (Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). To identify the protein(s) responsible for this demethylase activity, we monitored the enzymatic activity through five chromatography columns (Figure 2A). After purification of the 0.3 M P11 fraction through DEAE5PW and Phenyl Sepharose columns, we determined that the native mass of the enzymatic activity is about 300 kDa as assessed by a Sephacyl S300 column (Figure 2B). Further purification on a MonoS column allowed us to correlate the enzymatic activity (Figure 2C, bottom panel) to a protein of about 150 kDa, marked by ∗ (Figure 2C, top panel). Because there is a dramatic difference in the enzymatic activities between fractions 17 and 20 (Figure 2C), we concentrated these two fractions and compared their protein composition by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2D). After recovering protein bands unique to fraction 20, they were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis which revealed the protein, marked by ∗, to be a novel JmjC domain-containing protein named JMJD1A (jumonji domain-containing 1A) or TSGA (testis-specific gene A; Hoog et al., 1991Hoog C. Schalling M. Grunder-Brundell E. Daneholt B. Analysis of a murine male germ cell-specific transcript that encodes a putative zinc finger protein.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 30: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; Figure 2D). To verify that JMJD1A is responsible for the detected demethylase activity, an antibody against this protein was generated and used to immunoprecipitate JMJD1A from the MonoS column fractions 21–29. The immunoprecipitated sample was divided for silver staining, Western blot, and demethylase assays. Results shown in Figure 2E demonstrate that the demethylase activity (bottom panel) was completely depleted from the supernatant (S), which correlates with depletion of the JMJD1A (middle panel). Importantly, silver staining (top panel) revealed a single protein corresponding to JMJD1A. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the MonoS column fractions demonstrated a perfect correlation between JMJD1A and the enzymatic activity (Figure 2C, bottom two panels). These results collectively suggest that JMJD1A is responsible for the detected demethylase activity. Given that the native size of JMJD1A is about 300 kDa (Figure 2B), it is likely that JMJD1A functions as a homodimer. Because histone demethylase activity is the first identified activity of this protein and that it is the second JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase that we have identified, we have renamed the protein JHDM2A (JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase 2A) to reflect its newly identified function. Accordingly, we have named the other two JHDM2A-related human proteins JHDM2B and JHDM2C, respectively (Figure 3C).Figure 3JmjC and Zinc Finger Domains of JHDM2A Are Both Required for Histone Demethylase ActivityShow full caption(A) Schematic representation of the wild-type and mutant JHDM2A proteins with their activities (right). + represents active and − represents inactive.(B) Wild-type and mutant FLAG-JHDM1A proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated using a FLAG antibody.

JHDM2A was first identified in a testis cDNA library (Hoog et al., 1991Hoog C. Schalling M. Grunder-Brundell E. Daneholt B. Analysis of a murine male germ cell-specific transcript that encodes a putative zinc finger protein.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 30: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies indicated that JHDM2A is highly expressed in male germ cells, and its steady-state transcript levels are the highest during the meiotic and the postmeiotic stages of germ cell development (Hoog et al., 1991Hoog C. Schalling M. Grunder-Brundell E. Daneholt B. Analysis of a murine male germ cell-specific transcript that encodes a putative zinc finger protein.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 30: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Domain structure analysis using the SMART program (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de) revealed the presence of a JmjC domain and a zinc finger (Figure 3A). Given our recent demonstration that JmjC domain is a signature motif for histone demethylases (Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), the presence of a JmjC domain in JHDM2A strongly suggests that JHDM2A is responsible for the detected histone demethylase activity. To directly demonstrate the demethylase activity of JHDM2A, we transfected COS-7 cells with a FLAG-tagged mammalian expression vector. After immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG conjugated beads, the immunoprecipitates were split for Western and enzymatic activity assays. Results shown in Figure 3B (lane 1) revealed a robust histone demethylase activity dependent on the FLAG-JHDM2A protein. To evaluate the importance of the JmjC and the zinc figure domains for the enzymatic activity of JHDM2A, we generated four expression constructs with deletions of the N terminus, zinc finger, N terminus plus zinc finger, and JmjC domain, respectively (Figure 3A). After transfection and immunoprecipitation, these mutant proteins were subjected to Western blotting and demethylase activity assays. Results shown in Figure 3B indicate that both the zinc finger and the JmjC domain are critical for enzymatic activity (Figure 3B, compare lane 1 with lanes 4–6). To further demonstrate the importance of the JmjC domain for enzymatic activity, we generated a single amino acid substitution, H1120Y, in the JmjC domain. We choose to mutate amino acid H1120 because this histidine is highly conserved in the JmjC domain of JHDM2A-related proteins (Figure 3D), and the corresponding histidine in FIH (factor-inhibiting HIF [hypoxia-inducible factor]), a known Fe(II) dependent oxygenase, was found to directly bind to Fe(II) (Elkins et al., 2003Elkins J.M. Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Seibel J.F. Schlemminger I. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Structure of factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) reveals mechanism of oxidative modification of HIF-1 alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1802-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Fe(II) dependency of the histone demethylase activity (Figure 1B) predicts that the H1120Y mutation will disrupt Fe(II) binding and thus impair the enzymatic activity of JHDM2A. Results shown in Figure 3B confirmed this prediction (Figure 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The importance of the JmjC and zinc finger for the demethylase activity was also verified in vivo (Figure 5 and see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Therefore, we conclude that JHDM2A is a novel histone demethylase and that its JmjC and zinc inger domains are both critical for its enzymatic activity. To further characterize JHDM2A, we generated a baculovirus expressing a FLAG-tagged JHDM2A and purified the protein from infected Sf9 cells by affinity chromatography. After evaluating the purity and quantifying the FLAG-JHDM2A protein (Figure 4A), we analyzed and compared its enzymatic activity with that of the native JHDM2A protein. Results shown in Figure 4B demonstrated that recombinant FLAG-JHDM2A and native JHDM2A have similar activity when equal amounts of proteins are compared (Figure 4B, compare lane 1 with lanes 4 and 5). To analyze the site specificity of JHDM2A, histone substrates radiolabeled at all known methyl lysine sites in histones H3 (K4, K9, K27, K36, K79) and H4 (K20) were subjected to a demethylation assay containing purified recombinant FLAG-JHDM2A. Of the six substrates, only H3K9 methylated by G9a was a substrate for JHDM2A (Figure 4C). In addition to H3K9, previous studies indicated that G9a can also methylate H3K27 in vitro (Tachibana et al., 2002Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. G9a histone methyltransferase plays a dominant role in euchromatic histone H3 lysine 9 methylation and is essential for early embryogenesis.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). To verify that JHDM2A specifically demethylates H3K9, but not H3K27, we generated radiolabeled substrate histone H3 that contains either a K9R or a K27R mutation using the G9a HMT. In parallel, we also included radiolabeled wild-type recombinant H3 and HeLa core histones in the assay. Results shown in Figure 4D demonstrate that JHDM2A is not able to demethylate H3 when K9 is mutated (Figure 4D, compare lanes 5 and 6), while the K27 mutation does not affect the activity of JHDM2A (Figure 4D, compare lanes 7 and 8). Thus, we conclude that JHDM2A is an H3K9-specific demethylase. Lysine residues exist in three methylation states (mono-, di-, and trimethylation). To determine whether JHDM2A preferentially demethylates a particular methylation state, we performed a demethylation assay using H3K9-methylated peptide substrates and analyzed demethylation products by mass spectrometry. Results shown in Figure 4E demonstrate that demethylation of a dimethyl-K9 peptide depends on the presence of JHDM2A and generated products with masses that correlate with both monomethyl and unmethylated forms of the peptide, indicating that both mono- and dimethyl-K9 can serve as substrates. In contrast, no demethylation was detected when a trimethyl-K9 peptide that has the same sequence was subjected to parallel analysis (Figure 4F). Based on the above results, we conclude that JHDM2A selectively demethylates H3-mono- and dimethyl-K9. Having demonstrated demethylase activity for JHDM2A in vitro, we sought to test its activity in vivo. To this end, we investigated the effect of overexpression JHDM2A on the H3K9 methylation levels by immunostaining. We find that overexpression of JHDM2A greatly reduced the dimethyl-H3K9 level (Figure 5A). This effect is not simply a result of inaccessibility of modification-specific antibody due to the presence of FLAG-JHDM2A because overexpression of an enzymatically defective mutant did not affect dimethyl-H3K9 levels (Figure 5B). In addition, overexpression of JHDM2A does not alter the expression level of several known H3K9 methyltransferases (Figure S2). A decrease in the level of monomethyl-H3K9 was also observed in cells that overexpress JHDM2A (Figure 5C). However, no effect was observed on the levels of trimethyl-H3K9 (Figures 5D and S3) or dimethyl-H3K27 (Figure 5E). These results indicate that JHDM2A demethylates mono- and dimethyl-H3K9, with a preference for dimethyl-H3K9, in vivo. Previous studies have linked H3K9 methylation to transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation (Martin and Zhang, 2005Martin C. Zhang Y. The diverse functions of histone lysine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Therefore, a H3K9 demethylase could potentially antagonize gene silencing. To test this possibility, we generated stable Jhdm2a knockdown cells using a vector-mediated RNAi approach (Okada et al., 2005Okada Y. Feng Q. Lin Y. Jiang Q. Li Y. Coffield V.M. Su L. Xu G. Zhang Y. hDOT1L links histone methylation to leukemogenesis.Cell. 2005; 121: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We choose to perform knockdown in F9 cells because this cell line exhibits the highest Jhdm2a expression in the three cell lines that we have analyzed (Figure 6A). Quantitative PCR (Figure 6B, left panel) and Western blot analysis (Figure 6B, right panel) confirmed that the knockdown efficiency is about 80% at the RNA level and about 70% at the protein level. Compared to the parental F9 cells, no apparent morphological changes were observed in the knockdown cells (data not shown), indicating either that Jhdm2a does not play a critical role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of F9 cells or that the highly related Jhdm2b which is also a H3K9 demethylase expressed in F9 cells (data not shown) may compensate for Jhdm2a function. Although no apparent cell differentiation was observed in response to Jhdm2a knockdown, we have nevertheless analyzed potential changes in expression levels of several differentiation mark genes. The genes that we analyzed include the pluripotency marks (Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2) and differentiation marks (Lamb1, Hoxa1, Hoxb1, and Stra6). Results shown in Figure 6C indicate that, in response to Jhdm2a knockdown, Nanog and Oct4 are down regulated about 20%, while the differentiation marks Lamb1, Hoxb1, and Stra6 are downregulated about 40%–60%. These results are consistent with the notion that Jhdm2a functions as a H3K9 demethylase to positively regulate transcription. In contr"

Stable patterns of DNA methylation are established during development, resulting in creation of persisting cellular phenotypes. There is growing evidence that the nervous system has co-opted a number of cellular mechanisms used during development to subserve the formation of long term memory. In this study, we examined the role DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase (DNMT) activity might play in regulating the induction of synaptic plasticity. We found that the DNA within promoters for reelin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, genes implicated in the induction of synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus, exhibited rapid and dramatic changes in cytosine methylation when DNMT activity was inhibited. Moreover, zebularine and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, inhibitors of DNMT activity, blocked the induction of long term potentiation at Schaffer collateral synapses. Activation of protein kinase C in the hippocampus decreased reelin promoter methylation and increased DNMT3A gene expression. Interestingly, DNMT activity is required for protein kinase C-induced increases in histone H3 acetylation. Considered together, these results suggest that DNMT activity is dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and that DNMT may play a role in regulating the induction of synaptic plasticity in the mature CNS.

The mammalian brain consists primarily of postmitotic neurons and glial cells that possess relatively low proliferative potential. In addition, there are small populations of stem cells in various regions of the brain that have the potential to develop into new neurons (15Emsley J.G. Mitchell B.D. Kempermann G. Macklis J.D. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, reports that the adult central nervous system (CNS) possesses relatively high levels of DNMT mRNA and enzyme activity were surprising (5Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D.

Important recent studies also have implicated misregulation of DNMT specifically or DNA methylation in general in such cognitive disorders as schizophrenia, Rett syndrome, and Fragile X mental retardation (20Sutcliffe J.S.

Epigenetics refers to a set of self-perpetuating post-translational modifications of DNA and nuclear proteins that produce lasting alterations in chromatin structure as a direct consequence and lasting alterations in patterns of gene expression as an indirect consequence. In a previous study (23Levenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), we investigated the hypothesis that neurons have co-opted the epigenetic processes used to form “cellular” memories during development to subserve induction of long term synaptic plasticity and consolidation of long term memory (24Levenson J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We found evidence for regulation of histone acetylation by contextual fear conditioning in the hippocampus, suggesting that at least one form of epigenetic mark is regulated during formation of long term memory in mammals (23Levenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Other studies have implicated the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein in formation of hippocampus-dependent long term memory (25Korzus E. Rosenfeld M.G. Mayford M. Neuron. 2004; 42: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 26Alarcon J.M. Malleret G. Touzani K. Vronskaya S. Ishii S. Kandel E.R. Barco A.

Mem. 2005; 12: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that epigenetic modulation of the genome is a necessary component to formation of long term memory. Methylation of DNA represents another epigenetic tag. DNA methylation has been shown to induce long term changes in gene expression through direct interference with transcription factor binding and recruitment of chromatin remodeling enzymes via the action of methyl-CpG-binding proteins (28Becker P.B. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 51: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 29Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A.

Thus, DNA methylation could have lasting effects on neuronal gene expression and overall functional state. We hypothesize that direct modification of DNA, in the form of DNA (cytosine-5) methylation, is another epigenetic mechanism for long term information storage in the nervous system. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have observed decreases in methylation of BDNF3 (rat) and BDNF4 (mouse) promoters in response to depolarization (33Chen W.G. Chang Q. Lin Y. Meissner A. West A.E. Griffith E.C. Jaenisch R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2003; 302: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 34Martinowich K. Hattori D. Wu H. Fouse S. He F. Hu Y. Fan G. Sun Y.E. Science. 2003; 302: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In the studies described below, we further tested our hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms regulate memory formation, by determining the effects of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is the leading candidate cellular mechanism for storage of memory in vivo. Long term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses has received a great deal of experimental attention, since this form of synaptic plasticity utilizes many of the same mechanisms involved in consolidation of long term memory (35Lynch M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 87-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Successful formation of LTP requires engagement of NMDA receptors, activation of the Ras-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, and ultimately post-translational modifications of histones that mediate a transcriptional program resulting in lasting changes in neuronal function (23Levenson J.M.

Because DNA methylation and histone post-translational modification are intimately associated, we speculated that DNMT activity might regulate synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the CNS. We found that inhibition of DNMT alters DNA methylation within the promoter region of both reelin and BDNF1, indicating that acute regulation of DNA methylation occurs in the adult nervous system. Treatment with phorbol-12,13-diacetate (PDA) induced significant regulation of DNMT3A, suggesting that the PKC signaling pathway regulates the expression of DNMT genes. Moreover, inhibition of DNMT blocked induction of LTP, suggesting that DNMT activity is required for induction of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we provide evidence that PKC-mediated changes in histone H3 acetylation are sensitive to DNMT activity. These findings provide the first evidence for DNA (cytosine-5) methylation in dynamic signaling in the adult nervous system and suggest that DNMT activity is required for normal hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Young adult (4–8 weeks) male C57BL/6J mice were used for all experiments. Mice were housed under 12:12 light/dark cycles, with food and water available ad libitum. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and with national regulations and policies. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, followed by decapitation. The brain was immersed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5%CO2) ice-cold cutting saline (CS) (110 mm sucrose, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 28 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 0.6 mm ascorbate) prior to isolation of the hippocampus. Transverse slices (400 mm) were prepared with a Vibratome (Vibratome 1000, The Vibratome Co., St. Louis, MO). During isolation, hippocampal slices were stored in oxygenated ice-cold CS. After isolation, hippocampal slices were equilibrated in a mixture of 50% CS and 50% artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glucose) at room temperature for 45 min prior to use. Transverse hippocampal slices, pooled from 6–8 animals and randomized, were incubated in oxygenated ACSF (32 °C) for 1 h prior to treatment. For DNA methylation assays, slices were treated with either zebularine (100 μm, 40 min), PDA (3 μm, 20 min), or vehicle (0.5% Me2SO). For experiments investigating regulation of DNMT gene expression, slices were treated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or PDA (3 μm) for 45 min. For DNMT inhibition experiments, slices were treated with either vehicle (0.5% Me2SO) or zebularine (100 μm) or with either vehicle (0.001% CH3COOH) or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (30 μm) for 40 min followed by incubation with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or PDA (3 μm) for 20 min. Immediately after all treatments, Area CA1 was isolated in ice-cold CS. For DNA methylation assays and experiments measuring DNMT gene expression, tissue was immediately frozen on dry ice. For experiments measuring histone acetylation, tissue was immediately processed for histone extraction. DNA was isolated from hippocampal tissue, purified (Wizard genomic DNA purification kit; Promega, Madison, WI), and processed for bisulfite modification (CpGenome DNA modification kit; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Quantitative real time PCR was used to determine the DNA methylation status of the Reelin and BDNF1 promoter. Methylation-specific PCR primers were designed using Methprimer software (available on the World Wide Web at www.urogene.org/methprimer/). One set of primers targeted a large CpG island present in the reelin promoter (see also Ref. 37Mitchell C.P. Chen Y. Kundakovic M. Costa E. Grayson D.R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and another set of primers targeted two CpG islands detected in silico in the promoter upstream of exon I in the mouse BDNF gene. Detection of Unmethylated DNA—Detection of unmethylated DNA in the reelin promoter was performed using the following primers: Region 1, forward (5′-GGTTGTAGTTGGTGTAGATAAAGAATAGT-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCAAAAAAACAAAACTACTCAAC-3′); Region 2, forward (5′-TTTTTGTTTGAGGAATTTTTTAGTAATG-3′) and reverse (5′-AAACCAAATCATCAAACTTCTCAAC-3′). Detection of unmethylated DNA in the BDNF promoter was performed using the following primers: CpG island 1, forward (5′-GGGTAGTGATTTTGGGGAGGAAGTAT-3′) and reverse (5′-CAACCTCTATACACAACTAAATCCACC-3′); CpG island 2, forward (5′-TTGGGGAAATTTGAAAAGTAGTGT-3′) and reverse (5′-CACAACAAAACAAAAAAACCAAA-3′). PCRs were performed in a total volume of 20 μl, consisting of 2 μl of bisulfite-modified DNA, 10 μl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 1 μl of primer (18 μm), and 7 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated double-distilled H2O. Reactions were performed in a Chromo4 real time PCR system (Bio-Rad) using the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and either 77.5 °C (reelin, Region 1), 72.5 °C (reelin, Region 2), 74 °C (BDNF, CpG island 1), or 60 °C (BDNF, CpG island 2) for 15 s. Detection of the fluorescent products occurred at the end of the 15-s temperature step. For a melting curve analysis, PCR products were melted by increasing the temperature in 1 °C increments beginning at 60 °C. To further verify specificity of the final product, 10 μl of the amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Detection of Methylated DNA—Detection of unmethylated DNA was performed using primers complementary to Region 1 of reelin and CpG Islands 1 and 2 of BDNF listed above. Sequences for primers to the reelin promoter were as follows: forward, 5′-GTAGTCGGCGTAGATAAAGAATAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGAAAAAACAAAACTACTCGAC-3′. Primer sequences to detect methylated DNA in the BDNF1 promoter were as follows: CpG island 1, forward (5′-GTAGCGATTTTGGGGAGGAAGTAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CAACCTCTATACGCGACTAAATCCG-3′); CpG island 2, forward (5′-ATCGGGGAAATTTGAAAAGTAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCAACGAAACAAAAAAACCGAA-3′). Reactions were performed as described above, with the final step at 75.5 °C (BDNF, CpG island 1) or 60 °C (BDNF, CpG island 2) for 15 s. Due to low levels of methylation at the region of the reelin promoter, a “kick start” method was used to ensure detection of a product. First, a conventional PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μl, consisting of 6 μlof bisulfite-modified DNA, 10 μl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix, 1 μl of primer (18 μm), 3 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated double-distilled H2O. Reactions were carried out in a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycle (Bio-Rad) with the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 20 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final 10 min cycle at 72 °C. The product from the conventional PCR was then further amplified with the same primer sequence and similar cycling conditions as described above with the following changes: 50 cycles instead of 20 and the final step occurring at 79 °C. Likewise, a melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis was carried out to verify specificity of the final product. For every quantitative PCR, samples were assayed in triplicate, and the Ct value for each sample was chosen within the linear range. Samples were normalized to β-tubulin-4 (forward, 5′-GGAGAGTAATATGAATGATTTGGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CATCTCCAACTTTCCCTAACCTACTTAA-3′), and the comparative Ct method was used to calculate differences in gene expression between samples (38Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar, 39Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA samples were further purified with CHCl3, and concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. Real time, reverse transcription quantitative PCR was performed in one step using commercially available reagents (iScript one-step supermix; Bio-Rad) and Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All probes were designed to span exon boundaries, ensuring amplification of only mRNA. Equal amounts of RNA were analyzed in triplicate for each probe used; equal loading was confirmed by amplification of β-tubulin 4. Ct values were chosen in the linear range of amplification, and the comparative Ct method was used to calculate differences in gene expression between samples (38Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar, 39Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). Hippocampal tissue was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer using six strokes in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.9 mm Na+-butyrate). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 7,700 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was taken as the cytoplasmic fraction. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 250 μl of 0.4 n H2SO4, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 4 °C again for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and proteins were precipitated with 125 μlof 100% trichloroacetic acid containing 4 mg/ml deoxycholic acid (Na+ salt; Sigma) by incubation on ice for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice-cold acidified acetone (0.1% HCl) followed by 1 ml of ice-cold acetone for 5 min each. Protein precipitates were collected between washes by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting purified proteins were resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein extracts (1 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% resolving gel with a 4% stacking gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were briefly rinsed with 100% methanol, air-dried for 15 min, and washed with 25 ml of TTBS (0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 5 min at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antiserum against proteins of interest in primary buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% bovine serum albumin). This was followed by three washes in TTBS and incubation for 2 h with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody in TTBS (1:10,000) at room temperature. The membranes were washed in TTBS, and blots were developed using ECL and exposed to film (BioMax; Eastman Kodak Co.). The anti-rabbit primary antibodies used and their dilutions were as follows: anti-histone H3 (1:1,000), anti-acetyl-histone H3 (Lys-14; 1:1,000), anti-histone H4 (1:1,000), and anti-acetyl-histone H4 (Lys-5/Lys-8/Lys-12/Lys-16; 1:1000). All antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Electrophysiology was performed in an interface chamber (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Oxygenated ACSF (95% O2, 5%CO2, 30 °C) was perfused into the recording chamber at a rate of 1 ml/min. Electrical signals were amplified (model 1800; A-M Systems, Sequim, WA), digitized (Digidata 1320A; Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and stored on a PC (Clampex; Axon Instruments). Extracellular stimuli were delivered (model 2200 stimulus isolator; A-M Systems) by placing isonel enamel-coated, bipolar platinum-tungsten (92%:8%, 0.0011-inch diameter) electrodes on the border of Areas CA3 and CA1 along the Schaffer collaterals. fEPSPs were recorded in stratum radiatum with an ACSF-filled glass recording electrode (1–3 megohms). All analyses of electrophysiologic traces were performed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). The relationship between the left slope of the fiber volley (presynaptic depolarization) and the left slope of the fEPSP (postsynaptic depolarization) over various stimulus intensities was used to assess base-line synaptic transmission. All subsequent experimental stimuli were set to an intensity that evoked an fEPSP that had a left slope of 50% of the maximum fEPSP left slope. NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission was assessed as per base-line synaptic transmission above in the presence of the AMPA-R antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 μm) and a modified ACSF (same as above, except 0 mm MgCl2, 4 mm CaCl2). These conditions allow unblocking of the NMDA-R and allow assessment of NMDA-R function by measuring base-line fEPSPs mediated by this receptor. Paired pulse facilitation was investigated at various interstimulus intervals (20, 50, 100, 200, and 300 ms). LTP was induced by administering three trains of θ-burst stimulation. Each train consisted of 10 sets of bursts (4 stimuli, 100 Hz) with an interburst interval of 200 ms. There was 20 s between each stimulus train. Synaptic efficacy was monitored 30 min prior to and 180 min following induction by recording fEPSPs every 20 s (traces were averaged for every 2-min interval). Drug or vehicle was administered to slices for the duration of the experiment beginning 20 min prior to LTP induction. Slices that did not exhibit stable fEPSP slopes during the first 10 min of recording were excluded from the study. Zebularine and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine were purchased from Calbiochem. 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione was purchased from Tocris Cookson, Inc. (Ellisville, MO). PDA was purchased from Sigma. One-sample t tests were used to assess changes in the methylation state of regions 1 and 2 of the reelin and BDNF1 promoters and changes in expression of DNMT genes in the hippocampus. One-way analysis of variance combined with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was used to analyze changes in unmethylated DNA between Regions 1 and 2 of the reelin promoter. Data relating fEPSP slope to fiber volley slope was fit with a single exponential function (Y = TOP × (1 – e–K × X)); TOP and K were compared between treatment groups using an F test. Paired-pulse facilitation and LTP experiments were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Analysis of histone acetylation was performed using analysis of variance; post hoc comparisons were made using the Tukey-Kramer test. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05 for all tests. We hypothesized that (cytosine-5) DNA methylation in the CNS is, at least in part, a dynamic process that plays a role in information storage. Therefore, we investigated whether genes in the hippocampus could undergo acute changes in methylation status in response to inhibition of DNMT. Reelin is a large (∼340-kDa) extracellular protein that was first discovered in the context of neural development but has since been implicated in formation of long term memory, synaptic plasticity, and cognition (40Impagnatiello F.

Here, we used an automated optical trapping apparatus in conjunction with a novel motility assay that employed chemically modified surfaces to probe the mechanochemistry of Eg5. Individual dimers, formed by a recombinant human construct Eg5–513–5His, stepped processively along microtubules in 8-nm increments, with short run lengths averaging approximately eight steps. By varying the applied load (with a force clamp) and the ATP concentration, we found that the velocity of Eg5 was slower and less sensitive to external load than that of conventional kinesin, possibly reflecting the distinct demands of spindle assembly as compared with vesicle transport. The Eg5–513–5His velocity data were described by a minimal, three-state model where a force-dependent transition follows nucleotide binding."
https://openalex.org/W2119711891,"Hepatic dysfunction is a common clinical complication in malaria, although its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Using a variety of in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we have shown for the first time that malarial infection induces hepatic apoptosis through augmentation of oxidative stress. Apoptosis in hepatocyte has been confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin-nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activation. Gene expression analysis using RT-PCR indicates the significant down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax expression in liver of malaria infected mice suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. The levels of Fas expression and caspase-8 activity in infected liver were same as that of uninfected control mice indicating death receptor (Fas) pathway did not contribute to liver apoptosis during malarial infection. Moreover, evidence has been presented by confocal microscopy to show the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria in apoptotic hepatocyte, resulting in opening of permeability transition pores, which in turn decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and induces cytochrome c release into cytosol. Malarial infection induces the generation of hydroxyl radical (*OH) in liver, which may be responsible for the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis as administration of *OH specific antioxidant as well as spin trap, alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl-nitrone in malaria-infected mice significantly inhibits the development of oxidative stress as well as induction of apoptosis. Thus, results suggest the implication of oxidative stress induced-mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in the pathophysiology of hepatic dysfunction in malaria."

Many of these complexes have been found to reposition nucleosomes but with different directionalities. We find that the yeast Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not. Importantly, the inherent positioning properties of the DNA play an important role in determining where nucleosomes are relocated to by all of these enzymes. However, a key difference is that the Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes are unable to move nucleosomes to positions closer than 15 bp from a DNA end, whereas Isw1b can. We also find that there is a correlation between the inability of enzymes to move nucleosomes close to DNA ends and the preferential binding to nucleosomes bearing linker DNA.

These observations suggest that the accessibility of linker DNA together with the positioning properties of the underlying DNA play important roles in determining the outcome of remodeling by these enzymes. Nucleosomes are the fundamental subunits of eukaryotic chromatin. The assembly of DNA into chromatin fulfils important functions in both packaging DNA into nuclei and regulating access to genetic information. Crystallographic structures of nucleosomes provide a detailed picture of how DNA is bound to the surface of the histone octamer (1Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). However, in solution nucleosomes exhibit dynamic properties that include the ability to spontaneously relocate to different positions on DNA fragments (2Beard P. Cell. 1978; 15: 955-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M.

The positioning of nucleosomes has the potential to positively or negatively regulate access to DNA and consequently all genetic processes.In addition to undergoing spontaneous thermal movements, nucleosomes can be repositioned by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. These enzymes consist of a catalytic subunit with a region of homology to the yeast Snf2 protein and a variable number of accessory subunits. Snf2 family proteins fall into distinct subfamilies. For example the ISWI subfamily is named after its founding member, the Drosophila ISWI protein (5Elfring L.K. Deuring R. McCallum C.M. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ISWI protein was subsequently found to be a component of several distinct protein complexes that have the ability to alter chromatin structure in an ATP-dependent reaction (6Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Related ISWI complexes have since been identified in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes from yeast to humans (7Tsukiyama T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These complexes have been found to function in a range of processes ranging from the regulation of transcription and DNA replication to the maintenance of chromatin structure (7Tsukiyama T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Characterization of ISWI-driven chromatin remodeling reactions has revealed that one outcome is the repositioning of nucleosomes along DNA (8Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 9Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B.

Although the redistribution of nucleosomes may represent the major means by which these complexes alter chromatin structure, this is not necessarily the case for other subfamilies of Snf2 proteins which have been shown to cause other transitions in chromatin structure (11Mizuguchi G.

In addition, there are differences in the way that different ISWI containing complexes redistribute nucleosomes. For example, while the Drosophila ISWI-containing complex NURF and its isolated catalytic subunit redistributes nucleosomes to positions closely related to those observed in thermal nucleosome redistribution reactions (4Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7767-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Kang J.G. Hamiche A. Wu C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the ACF, CHRAC, and Isw2 complexes have been reported to preferentially move nucleosomes to positions closer to the center of short DNA fragments (9Langst G.

This subfamily is also represented in multicellular eukaryotes and in Drosophila and yeast appears to be mainly monomeric (21Lusser A. Urwin D.L. Kadonaga J.T. Nat. Struct. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).The differences in the directionality with which nucleosomes are redistributed are likely to significantly influence the functions for which these complexes are used. To understand what these differences, we have systematically analyzed the positions to which nucleosomes are redistributed in different contexts using yeast Isw1a, Isw1b, Isw2, and Chd1 remodeling enzymes. We find that the enzymes that relocate nucleosomes to more central locations preferentially engage with nucleosomes bearing linker DNA. This may explain why these enzymes are unable to move nucleosomes to positions close to DNA ends where linker DNA would be lost. In addition to this inability to move nucleosomes close to DNA ends we find that the inherent nucleosome positioning properties of the DNA play an important role in determining where nucleosomes are moved to.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNucleosome Binding—Binding of Isw1a and Isw1b was monitored in 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. For Chd1 reactions contained 2.5% Ficoll, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. All reactions contained 0.5 nm 5′-32P-labeled nucleosomes (concentrations were obtained by scintillation counting of nucleosomes and comparing the value to that of the parent DNA, whose concentration was obtained by absorbance at 260 nm). Reactions were set up on ice and electrophoresed through 0.2× Tris borate-EDTA, 5% acrylamide gels for 4 h at 150 V at 4 °C with running buffer recirculation.Enzymes—Isw1a and Isw1b were purified from yeast strains (YTT1168 and YTT1167) in which the Ioc3p or Ioc2p factors, respectively, were expressed as fusions with the TAP 2The abbreviations used are: TAP, tandem affinity purification; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). double affinity tag (23Vary Jr., J.C. Gangaraju V.K. Qin Landel J. Kooperberg C.C. Bartholomew C. Tsukiyama B.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Chd1 and Isw2 were purified from Chd1-TAP or Isw2-TAP strains, which were purchased from Euroscarf. Remodelers were purified by IgG and calmodulin affinity chromatography from 20 liters of yeast (24Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. 1 illustrates the purity of these complexes.Nucleosomes—Histone octamers were assembled from individual Xenopus laevis histones expressed in bacteria (25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Octamers for high resolution repositioning assays contained a S47C mutation in H4 and a C110A change in H3. These octamers were subsequently reacted with the thiol-reactive EDTA derivative (EDTA-2-aminoethyl)2-pyridyl disulfide (26Bruno M. Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Octamers were reconstituted into nucleosomes using PCR prepared DNA derived from the MMTV nucleosome A (4Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7767-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or 601.3 (27Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) positioning sequences. Reconstitutions were performed at 1 μm concentration and pH 7.5 by stepwise dialysis from 2 m NaCl or KCl to 0.85, 0.65, 0.5, and finally 0 m.Mononucleosome Repositioning Assays—Nucleosome repositioning was carried out in 10-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, 1 pmol of nucleosome (32P-end-labeled at a single 5′-DNA end) and various concentrations of enzyme as described in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. After 20-min incubation at 30 °C reactions were stopped by transfer to ice and addition of competitor DNA (0.1 μg/μl final) and additional salt (200 mm KCl final). One-tenth of the reaction was electrophoresed through 0.2× Tris borate-EDTA, 5% acrylamide gels for 3.5 h at 300 V at 4 °C with running buffer recirculation; the remainder was subjected to site-directed mapping to determine the exact nucleosome position (28Flaus A. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This involved the addition of 1 μl of 40 μm ammonium ferrous sulfate and 5 μl each of 19.2 mm ascorbic acid and 0.2% hydrogen peroxide to each reaction followed by a 1-h incubation on ice. DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), recovered by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in 5 μl of formamide loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were run on 8% acrylamide sequencing gels containing 6 m urea, fixed with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to image plates. Markers for sequencing gels were obtained by limited cleavage at G residues of the appropriate DNA template.FIGURE 2High resolution mapping of nucleosome repositioning by Isw1a, Isw1b, Chd1, and temperature. To precisely determine the positions to which nucleosomes were relocated following assembly on the off center (54A18; A) or end positioned (54A0; B) fragments, repositioning assays were carried out using histone octamers derivatised with nucleosome mapping reagent (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nucleosomes were initially assembled predominantly at the +70 location (70 bp upstream of the MMTV transcription start site). Following incubation of the 54A18 fragment with Isw1b (37.5 fmol (lane 2) and 75 fmol (lane 3)) or at high temperature (47 °C, 1 h), nucleosomes were redistributed predominantly to the +22 and +27 locations. In contrast following incubations with Isw1a (160 fmol (lane 7) and 320 fmol (lane 8)) nucleosomes were moved to the +39, +42, +47, and +52 positions. The 54A0 nucleosome was relocated by Isw1a (160 fmol (lane 2) and 320 fmol (lane 3)), Isw2 (1.6 fmol (lane 5) and 3.2 fmol (lane 6)), and Chd1 (3.6 fmol (lane 8) an 7.2 fmol (lane 9)) to positions at +39, +42, and +47. In addition Isw2 caused an increase in nucleosomes located at the +39 location (lane 6). In contrast incubation of this nucleosome at 47 °C for 1 h resulted in its relocation to the +22 and +27 sites. G tracks of the same DNA molecules were used to confirm the start positions of the nucleosomes and are shown in the lane marked G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Isw1a moves nucleosomes to a subset of locations no closer than 15 bp from a DNA end. A, to systematically investigate the positions to which nucleosomes are redistributed by Isw1a, remodeling reactions were performed on a series of fragments with successively shorter DNA extensions. The amounts of Isw1a used were 36 fmol (lanes 14, 17, 20, and 21), 107 fmol (lanes 11, 15, 18, 21, and 25), 320 fmol (lane 12). 10% of each remodeling reaction was loaded on a 5% native gel (B).

Thermal redistribution of histone octamers with symmetrical linkers of 36, 38, 44, or 48 bp was analyzed by site-directed mapping (A) and native gels (B). Nucleosomes with shorter linker DNAs were observed to move to the +39, +42, and +47 locations that are also used by Chd1, Isw2, and Isw1a (see Fig. 2). Nucleosomes deposited predominantly at the +42 location are found to be repositioned to the thermally favored locations at +27 and +22 by Isw1a using site-directed mapping (C) and native gel electrophoresis (D). Amounts of Isw1a used were 0, 36, 107, or 320 fmol (lanes 13–16).

Nucleosomes were assembled onto 147-bp DNA (W147) or with 54-bp linker DNA on one side (W201). The binding of Isw1b (A), Isw1a (B), and Chd1 (C) to these templates was investigated by native gel electrophoresis. While Isw1b bound to both templates similarly, Isw1a and Chd1 preferentially engage with nucleosome bearing linker DNA. Remodeler concentrations were varied between 0.74 and 12.8 nm for Isw1a, between 2.6 and 45 nm for Isw1b, and between 1.4 and 24 nm for Chd1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSDifferences in the Directionality of Nucleosome Redistribution by Isw1b, Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1—To test the ability of the purified Isw1 and Chd1 enzymes to catalyze nucleosome sliding, recombinant X. laevis histone octamers were assembled onto DNA fragments containing the MMTV nucleosome A positioning sequence flanked by different lengths of linker DNA. The DNA fragments used were designed such that the nucleosomes were initially flanked by 54-bp linkers on either side, off center (54 bp on one side and 18 bp on the other), or located at one end of a DNA fragment with 54 bp of linker DNA on one side and none on the other. The position of these nucleosomes was analyzed by native acrylamide gel electrophoresis following treatment with Isw1a, Isw1b, or Chd1 and ATP. The Isw1a complex caused nucleosomes initially located at the end and off center locations to run slower on the gel in an ATP dependent manner (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–8). However, no obvious ATP-dependent change was observed for the centrally located nucleosome (Fig. 1A, lanes 9–12). Conversely, treatment with the Isw1b complex and ATP caused the off-center and centrally located nucleosomes to increase in mobility, whereas no obvious change occurred with the end positioned nucleosome (Fig. 1B). The activity of Chd1 was similar to Isw1a except less alteration to the 54A18 nucleosome was observed (Fig. 1C).It is known that when a histone octamer is positioned close to the end of a DNA fragment the mobility through a gel is greater than when the octamer is close to the center of the same piece of DNA (3Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore these observations suggest that Isw1a and Chd1 relocate nucleosomes closer to the center of the DNA (“end to center” type sliding) and that Isw1b causes nucleosomes to move to locations that are near to, or at, the ends of the DNA (“center to end” type sliding). To study this in more detail, site-directed nucleosome mapping was used to determine the positions nucleosomes were relocated to at high resolution. Briefly, this involves the tethering of cysteaminyl EDTA to a recombinant histone octamer via a thiol group introduced at H4 cysteine 47 (29Flaus A. Luger K. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The chelation of Fe2+ ions by this reagent provides a means of generating localized hydroxyl radicals that are capable of cleaving DNA but only within a range of less than 1.5 nm. The site at which the reagent is attached on histone H4 comes closest to DNA 2 bp from either side of the nucleosome dyad, meaning that the sites of cleavage can be used to determine nucleosome positions at base pair resolution.In Fig. 2A the positions to which Isw1a and Isw1b reposition nucleosomes on an DNA fragment designed to position nucleosomes initially at an off center location with 54 bp of DNA on one side and 18 bp on the other. The untreated nucleosomes display a characteristic pattern of strong and weak DNA cleavage separated by 7 bp, indicating that nucleosomes assembled onto this DNA fragment were initially positioned predominantly at +70 relative to the MMTV transcription start site (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 6, and 10). Following incubation with Isw1b, the cleavage at the +70 location is reduced, and new cleavage sites indicating predominant new locations at +22 and +27 are detected. These position nucleosomes close to the end of the fragment, consistent with the increased mobility following electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). Nucleosomes are also redistributed to these positions following thermal equilibration (Fig. 2A, lanes 10 and 11). However, the positions following redistribution by Isw1b exhibit a subtle bias for the locations closest to the end of the fragment. The movement of nucleosomes to positions closely related to those used during thermal redistribution reactions is consistent with previous studies of NURF (16Kang J.G. Hamiche A. Wu C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and recombinant Drosophila ISWI protein (4Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7767-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, Isw1a relocates this nucleosome to a series of more centrally located positions at +39, +42, +47, and +58 (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). This cluster of locations is too close together to be resolved by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). Isw1a moves nucleosomes to a similar distribution of locations when the nucleosome is initially located at the end of the DNA fragment (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). The enzymes Chd1 and Isw2 also move nucleosomes to the same distribution of locations (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–9).The finding that the Isw1 protein when associated with different accessory subunits in the Isw1a and Isw1b complexes moves nucleosomes with different directionalities illustrates that it is not the catalytic subunit alone that is responsible for this. While the locations to which nucleosomes are moved by Isw1b are clearly related to the most favorable locations available on these fragments, the mechanism for selecting the sites used by Isw1a, Chd1, and Isw2 is less clear. Nethertheless, the observation that these enzymes use the same subset of locations suggests that sequence or structural properties of the DNA fragment may contribute to the selection of sites to which nucleosomes are repositioned.Isw1a Moves Nucleosomes to a Subset of Locations No Closer than 15 bp from a DNA End—To investigate what underlies the selection of these more central positions, nucleosome repositioning by Isw1a was investigated on a series of nucleosomes with successively shorter DNA extensions. Nucleosomes were redistributed predominantly to the +39, +42, and +47 locations on the template with a 54-bp extension (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). As the length of the DNA extension is reduced to 44 and 38 bp, there is a progressive decrease in the proportion of nucleosomes accumulating at the +39 and +42 locations, while nucleosomes are still relocated to the +47 position efficiently (Fig. 3, lanes 4–9). It is also notable that the proportion of nucleosomes accumulating at the +58 location increases as the length of the linker DNA is reduced. For the fragments with 34- and 31-bp extension nucleosomes that have relocated 12 bp to the +58 location are the major new species observed following remodeling. It is possible that this 12-bp movement represents a minimal distance that the mechanical action of the Isw1a ATPase motor can move a nucleosome. However, it is also possible that this is the first location that is sufficiently stable to be detected.Overall, it was found that reducing the length of the DNA extension caused nucleosomes to be moved to locations progressively closer to the starting position. It is also notable that the efficiency of redistribution decreases as the length of linker DNA is reduced, with a greater proportion of nucleosomes remaining at their original location on the shorter fragments.The nearest to a DNA end that we have observed Isw1a relocate nucleosomes is 15 bp (Fig. 3, lanes 7–9). However, the range over which DNA ends influence positioning varies depending on the context. For example, the +47 location is disfavored despite being 31 bp from a DNA end in the presence of a 34 or 54 bp downstream linker (supplemental Fig. 2, lanes 6–13).Isw1a Repositions Nucleosomes to Thermodynamically Favorable Locations—In addition to the exclusion of nucleosomes from regions close to the DNA ends, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 show that Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 move nucleosomes to discrete locations that are not located at the geometric center of the DNA fragment. We next sought to investigate what underlies the selection of these more central locations. We first characterized the positions to which nucleosomes relocate during thermal incubation in more detail. Nucleosomes were assembled onto series of DNA fragments designed to form nucleosomes with progressively shorter DNA extensions. On nucleosomes with 48 and 44 bp extensions we observed nucleosomes being redistributed to the positions at +22 and +27 as reported previously (4Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7767-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2–6). To determine the location of less favorable positions, thermal redistribution was carried out on shorter fragments where these most favorable locations were no longer present. Reduction of the DNA extensions to 38 and 36 bp revealed new locations at +31, +39, +42, and +47 (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 8–13). It is notable that of these less strongly preferred positions, the +39, +42, and +47 locations were also observed during Isw1a-driven redistribution. This supports the hypothesis that the positioning properties of the DNA contribute to the sites selected by Isw1a. In fact, the positions observed following redistribution by Isw1a appear to result from rearrangement between favorable locations with the exception that locations too close to a DNA ends are excluded.A prediction of this hypothesis would be that if DNA fragments were designed on which the most highly preferred +22 and +27 locations were sufficiently far from DNA ends, then they would be occupied following redistribution by Isw1a. Fig. 4C shows that this is indeed true. Nucleosomes initially located predominantly at the +39 position with a 44-bp DNA extension are redistributed to the highly favorable positions at +27 and +22 (Fig. 4C, lanes 13–16). Similarly it would be anticipated that the bias against an unfavoured location would be reduced by increasing the linker DNA that flanks it. This is illustrated for the +70 location. Although nucleosomes are deposited during assembly at this location, it is not favored following redistribution on a DNA fragment with an asymmetric extension. However, extension of linker DNA on the downstream side of this location such that it is placed more centrally progressively increases occupancy at this site (supplemental Fig. 2).Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes Display a Preference for Interacting with Linker DNA That Correlates with the Orientation in Which They Reposition Nucleosomes—It has previously been proposed that a factor contributing to the preference of the Isw2 remodeling enzyme for the repositioning of nucleosomes to central locations could be the preference of this enzyme for interaction with nucleosomes containing additional linker DNA (30Kagalwala M.N. Glaus B.J. Dang W. Zofall M. Bartholomew B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). If this model is generally applicable to other remodeling enzymes that move nucleosomes to more central locations, then it would be anticipated that any enzyme displaying a preference for the relocation of nucleosomes to more central locations would also display this property. To extend the repertoire of remodeling enzymes for which this type of investigation has been performed, we investigated the binding of Isw1a, Isw1b, and Chd1 to nucleosomes with minimal and extended linker DNA. Isw1a and Chd1, which both preferentially relocate nucleosomes to more central locations, were both found to display a preference for interacting with nucleosomes containing linker DNA. In contrast Isw1b, which can move nucleosomes to DNA ends, was able to interact with nucleosomes in a way that was not influenced by the presence of linker DNA (Fig. 5). These observations provide additional support for the model proposed by Bartholomew and co-workers (18Zofall M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10047-10057Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in which the preference of the remodeling enzymes for nucleosomes bearing linker DNA facilitates the removal of nucleosomes from DNA ends.DISCUSSIONWe have characterized nucleosome redistribution by the Isw1a, Isw1b, Isw2, and Chd1 remodeling complexes. Although they share the same Isw1p catalytic subunit, the Isw1a and Isw1b complexes redistribute nucleosomes with different apparent directionalities: the Isw1a complex removes nucleosomes from locations within about 15 bp from DNA ends whereas Isw1b does not. We also find that the Chd1 protein is able to move nucleosomes and does so with the same directionality as Isw1a and Isw2. Importantly, we find that the inherent nucleosome positioning properties of the underlying DNA play an important role in determining the destinations to which nucleosomes are moved by all of these enzymes. This is consistent with prev"

Sulfide is provided by cysteine desulfurases that use l-cysteine as sulfur source. So far, the physiological iron donor has not been clearly identified. CyaY, the bacterial ortholog of frataxin, an iron binding protein thought to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation in eukaryotes, is a good candidate because it was shown to bind iron. Nevertheless, no functional in vitro studies showing an involvement of CyaY in [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis have been reported so far. In this paper we demonstrate for the first time a specific interaction between CyaY and IscS, a cysteine desulfurase participating in iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Analysis of the iron-loaded CyaY protein demonstrated a strong binding of Fe3+ and a weak binding of Fe2+ by CyaY. Biochemical analysis showed that the CyaY-Fe3+ protein corresponds to a mixture of monomer, intermediate forms (dimer-pentamers), and oligomers with the intermediate one corresponding to the only stable and soluble iron-containing form of CyaY. Using spectroscopic methods, this form was further demonstrated to be functional in vitro as an iron donor during [Fe-S] cluster assembly on the scaffold protein IscU in the presence of IscS and cysteine. All of these results point toward a link between CyaY and [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, and a possible mechanism for the process is discussed.

All of these results point toward a link between CyaY and [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, and a possible mechanism for the process is discussed. Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionary ancient prosthetic groups that are required to sustain fundamental life processes. They are involved in electron transfer, substrate binding/activation, iron/sulfur storage, regulation of gene expression, and enzyme activity reactions (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Formation of intracellular [Fe-S] clusters does not occur spontaneously but requires a complex biosynthetic machinery. In Escherichia coli three different types of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis systems have been identified so far, namely the iron-sulfur cluster, sulfur mobilization, and cysteine sulfinate desulfinase systems (2Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 3Barras F. Loiseau L. Py B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These different machineries have in common the involvement of a cysteine desulfurase that allows utilization of cysteine as source of sulfur atoms (4Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The ISC and SUF systems, furthermore, both contain scaffold proteins that provide an intermediate assembly site for [Fe-S] clusters or [Fe-S] cluster precursors (5Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Important questions related to [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis include: (i) the molecular mechanism by which iron and sulfide are assembled on the scaffold protein; (ii) how accessory proteins (chaperones in particular) participate in the process; and (iii) how the cluster is transferred from the scaffold to an apo target protein. Another essential question is the identity of iron and sulfur donors for the formation of [Fe-S] clusters. Whereas l-cysteine has been identified as the ultimate source of sulfur, the question “Where does the iron come from?” still remains unanswered. Whereas some preliminary answers have been provided to most of the above issues, very little is known regarding the last question. It is simply assumed that, because of its toxicity, iron has to be stored and transported by proteins from which it can be mobilized for assembly of iron sites. In bacteria, IscA and YggX, which were shown to be able to bind iron and to be, to some extent, involved in [Fe-S] metabolism, are potential candidates requiring further investigations (9Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Gralnick J.A. Downs D.M. J. Biol.

However, this is controversial because IscA was proposed to be an [Fe-S] scaffold protein (5Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22604-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14069-14080Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), whereas a recent report could not establish iron binding to YggX (13Osborne M.J. Siddiqui N. Landgraf D. Pomposiello P.J. Gehring K. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). More information concerning a putative iron donor protein is available in eukaryotic systems. In eukaryotes, [Fe-S] cluster assembly requires two biosynthetic protein machineries. One is localized in the mitochondria and functions in the assembly of all cellular [Fe-S] proteins, whereas the other one is cytosolic, specifically involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear [Fe-S] cluster proteins (14Lill R. Fekete Z. Sipos K. Rotte C. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the proposed role of the frataxin protein as an iron donor for assembly of [Fe-S] clusters in eukaryotes: (i) low expression of the frataxin gene in humans results in Friedreich's ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by reduced levels of mitochondrial [Fe-S] enzyme activities (15Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar); (ii) the yeast frataxin (Yfh1p) is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis (16Pandolfo M.

On the other hand, a YFH1 deletion is not lethal in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that another iron donor might exist in mitochondria (17Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The bacterial ortholog of frataxin is the CyaY protein, which displays ∼25% sequence identity to human and yeast frataxin. The situation in bacteria appears to be more complex. Indeed, a knock-out of the cyaY gene alone confers no phenotype: no defect in iron content, no sensitivity to oxidative stress, and no auxotrophy (31Li D.S. Ohshima K. Jiralerspong S. Bojanowski M.W. Pandolfo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is possible that the specific growth conditions wherein the cyaY gene expression plays a prominent role have not been defined yet. Interestingly, during the preparation of this manuscript, it was reported that a double knock-out in cyaY and yggX in Salmonella enterica resulted in defects in [Fe-S] cluster metabolism (32Vivas E. Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of E. coli CyaY (x-ray structure at 1.4 Å resolution and NMR structure) and yeast and human frataxin revealed a common protein fold for all frataxin homologs (33Cho S.J. Lee M.G.

NMR spectroscopic studies on CyaY showed that is able to bind iron in both Fe2+ and Fe3+ oxidation states through conserved Asp and Glu residues in the same region of the protein as in the case of human frataxin (34Nair M. Adinolfi S. Pastore C. Kelly G. Temussi P. Pastore A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2037-2048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It was shown that CyaY can accommodate 2 Fe2+/protein when incubated with Fe2+ anaerobically. Under these conditions the protein was shown to be a tetramer in solution. Upon ferrous iron oxidation CyaY is able to bind an initial group of 6 Fe3+/protein and up to 26 Fe3+/protein using a large excess of iron (35Adinolfi S. Trifuoggi M. Politou A.S. Martin S.

The iron-loaded form of CyaY is present in solution as a mixture of monomer and oligomers, with only the latter containing iron (35Adinolfi S. Trifuoggi M. Politou A.S. Martin S. Pastore A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, iron-containing oligomers are resistant to iron chelation by EDTA or citrate, showing strong affinity of CyaY oligomers for Fe3+ (35Adinolfi S. Trifuoggi M. Politou A.S. Martin S. Pastore A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). So far, no functional in vitro studies showing an involvement of CyaY in [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis have been reported. In this work we demonstrate for the first time a specific interaction between E. coli CyaY and an ISC protein (IscS), which provides a link between CyaY and [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show a functional role for the iron-containing CyaY oligomers during [Fe-S] cluster assembly on the scaffold protein IscU in vitro.

Following metal-chelate chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Amersham Biosciences) a gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences) was performed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT). 4The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. After these two purification steps the protein was judged 99% pure by SDS-PAGE. The protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration using an YM10 membrane (Amicon) and was stored at –80 °C. Recombinant E. coli IscU (non-His-tagged), E. coli His-tagged IscU, E. coli His-tagged IscS (both N-terminal His-tagged), E. coli IscS (non-His-tagged), and E. coli IscSC328S (non-His-tagged) were expressed and purified as previously described (38Hoff K.G.

For non-His-tagged IscU an additional gel filtration step on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT was added to further purify the protein. Concentrated protein solutions were stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL harboring plasmid pRKISC, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pTrcIscU and E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-22b-CyaY were grown as previously described (36Lee M.G.

Overexpression of proteins of the isc operon, of non-His-tagged IscU and of His-tagged CyaY was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After collecting the cells by centrifugation, the bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl), and cells were broken by sonication (10 × 10 s; amplitude 25%). The soluble protein fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 45000 rpm (Ti50.2 rotor), 4 °C for 90 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The obtained supernatant (cell-free extract) was directly used for protein-protein interaction studies (see below). Protein-Protein Interactions between CyaY and Proteins of the isc Operon—His-tagged pure CyaY was loaded onto a gravity flow 0.2-ml nickel-loaded metal chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Cell-free extracts from a 2- or 3-liter culture of E. coli cells overexpressing the complete isc operon or non-His-tagged IscU were passed over this CyaY column. The column was washed with 30 column volumes of buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl containing 0–20 mm imidazole), and bound proteins were eluted using buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. These experiments were performed aerobically at 20 °C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and identified by N-terminal sequencing. The same experiment was performed either aerobically or anaerobically with pure non-His-tagged IscU and non-His-tagged wild-type or mutated (C328S) IscS (between 0.5 and 1 equivalent with regard to CyaY). Iron Binding to CyaY—Purified CyaY (235 μm) was incubated with a 15-fold molar excess of either FeCl3 (aerobically) or Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (anaerobically) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation the mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf table centrifuge (Eppendorf AG) and subsequently desalted on a NAP10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots of iron-loaded CyaY were stored at –80 °C. The iron binding properties of CyaY-Fe3+ and CyaY-Fe2+ were investigated by dilution with subsequent desalting, incubation with iron chelators like EDTA or citrate, and incubation with chemical reducing agents like DTT or dithionite. To study the dilution effects the iron-loaded protein was passed over a NAP10 column, which resulted in a dilution of 1:1.5. After 1 h of incubation the diluted protein was again passed over a NAP 10 column, which again resulted in a dilution of 1:1.5. These steps were repeated three times and the iron content before and after each dilution step was determined. To study the effects of iron chelators, iron-loaded CyaY (80 μm in iron) was incubated with a 60-fold molar excess (over iron) of either EDTA or citrate for 1 h. After desalting the iron content was determined and compared with that before chelator treatment. The effect of chemical reducing agents on the iron-loaded CyaY was investigated by incubation of CyaY (300 μm in iron) with a 10–20-fold molar excess of either DTT or dithionite for 1 h. After incubation the mixtures were desalted, and the iron content was determined and compared with that before the treatment. Oligomerization State of Iron-loaded CyaY—The oligomerization state of CyaY loaded with either Fe3+ or Fe2+ was determined by gel filtration on an analytical Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) and on a Tricorn high performance Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min under aerobic conditions. Separation of Different Oligomerization States of CyaY-Fe3+—Different oligomeric forms of Fe3+-loaded CyaY were separated by preparative gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions of different oligomeric forms were collected, combined, and concentrated. The integrity of the separated forms after concentration was verified by reinjection onto a Tricorn high performance Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. Reduction of CyaY-Fe3+ by Biological Reducing Agents—CyaY-Fe3+ (150 μm in iron) was incubated with 2 mm l-cysteine or reduced glutathione in a total volume of 100 μl, and changes in the UV-visible absorption spectrum were followed spectrophotometrically. To verify the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ the Fe2+-chelator ferrozine (750 μm) was added to the mixtures, and formation of a Fe2+-ferrozine complex was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Reconstitution of Iron-Sulfur Clusters on IscU—Cluster reconstitution was performed in an anaerobic chamber (Jacomex B553 (NMT)). Purified IscU was incubated with 5 mm DTT for 30 min. The DTT was removed from the solution by passage of the protein over a Micro-Biospin 6 Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad). Subsequently His-tagged IscU was incubated with catalytic amounts of His-tagged IscS and an excess of l-cysteine for 2 h. Following this preincubation CyaY-Fe3+ was added to the mixtures. Final concentrations were 50 μm IscU, 1 μm IscS, 2 mm l-cysteine, and 150 μm iron (within CyaY-Fe3+) in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl. Formation of iron-sulfur clusters on IscU was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy using a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. The yield of [2Fe-2S] clusters formed on IscU was determined using an extinction coefficient ϵ = 5.8 mm–1 cm–1 (8Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A plot of the yield (%) of [Fe-S] as a function of time was fitted to a rate equation for a first order process, and the observed rate constant (kobs) was determined. Preparation of Mössbauer Samples—For Mössbauer measurements reconstituted IscU was prepared as described above in a total volume of 5 ml. After cluster reconstitution, the mixture was desalted by passage over a NAP25 column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM10 membrane (Amicon) to a final volume of 400 μl. The protein solution was transferred into a Mössbauer cup and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The final concentration of IscU in the sample was 527 μm. Mössbauer Spectroscopy—57Fe-Mössbauer spectra were recorded using 400-μl cuvettes containing 527 μm protein. Spectra were recorded on a spectrometer operating in constant acceleration mode using an Oxford cryostat that allowed temperatures from 1.5 to 300 K and a 57Co source in rhodium. Isomer shifts are reported relative to metallic iron at room temperature. Iron Determination—The iron content of proteins was determined as previously described (45Beinert H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Concentration—The Bio-Rad protein assay was used according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). CyaY Interacts with IscS—Protein-protein interactions can provide a useful hint for identifying unknown protein functions. Because the CyaY protein is proposed to be a potential iron donor protein for [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, observable interactions of the protein with proteins involved in this process (ISC proteins) would provide an important hint toward CyaY function. To study the possible interactions of CyaY with proteins of the isc operon, an affinity chromatography approach was chosen. The His6-tagged CyaY, expressed and purified as already described (36Lee M.G. Cho S.J. Yang J.K. Song H.K. Suh S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 920-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), was loaded on a gravity flow Ni2+-charged metal chelating column, and in a first experiment, an E. coli cell-free extract (∼400 mg) prepared from a 3-liter culture of BL21(DE3)-RIL cells overexpressing the whole isc operon was passed over the CyaY-loaded column. Because all of the cellular proteins were not His-tagged, proteins retained on the column and eluted together with CyaY are those that interact with CyaY specifically. Bound CyaY and potential partners were then eluted in the presence of 0.5 m imidazole. Fig. 1 (lane 2) shows the analysis of eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE (15%). In addition to the band corresponding to CyaY (12200 Da), other bands are visible on the gel. N-terminal sequencing of the most intense bands revealed that the upper one, more intense, corresponds to IscS (∼45,000 Da), the lower one (∼14,000 Da), less intense, to IscU and that the intermediate ones (∼25000 Da) did not correspond to proteins of the isc operon (Fig. 1, lane 2). Binding of these proteins was due to high histidine contents favoring direct interaction with the nickel-loaded chelating Sepharose column. Apart from IscS and IscU, no other proteins from the isc operon were detected in significant amounts by SDS-PAGE. In a control experiment, performed either aerobically or anaerobically, using pure non-His-tagged IscS in place of the extracts, we observed that IscS eluted with CyaY in the 0.5 m imidazole fraction (Fig. 1, lane 3). Under identical conditions, no IscS could bind to the column in the absence of CyaY (data not shown). This demonstrated a specific interaction between CyaY and IscS. Because IscU had been previously shown to form a tight complex with IscS (47Kato S. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 48Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we then addressed the question whether the presence of a small amount of IscU from the extracts on the gel (lane 2) was an indirect consequence of its binding to IscS rather than caused by direct binding to CyaY. To verify this hypothesis the same experiment as described above was repeated by passing extracts from a 2-liter culture of BL21(DE3) cells overexpressing only the IscU protein over a CyaY-loaded nickel-loaded chelating Sepharose column. Under these conditions IscU was again observed in small amounts in the imidazole fraction as shown by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1, lane 4) and N-terminal sequencing. More surprising was the presence of a much higher amount of I"

The inherited disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), in which abnormal LDL-cholesterol trafficking from the endo/lysosomal compartment leads to substantial cholesterol and glycolipid accumulation in lysosomes, is caused by defects in either of two genes that encode for proteins designated as NPC1 and NPC2. NPC2 is a small intralysosomal protein that has been characterized biochemically as a cholesterol binding protein. We determined the rate and mechanism by which NPC2 delivers cholesterol to model phospholipid membranes. A fluorescence dequenching assay was used to monitor the kinetics of cholesterol transfer from the protein to membranes. The endogenous tryptophan fluorescence of the NPC2 was quenched upon binding of cholesterol, and the subsequent addition of acceptor vesicles resulted in dequenching of the tryptophan signal, enabling the monitoring of cholesterol transfer to membranes. The rates of cholesterol transfer were evaluated as a function of acceptor vesicle concentration, acceptor vesicle phospholipid headgroup composition, and aqueous phase properties. The results suggest that NPC2 rapidly transports cholesterol to phospholipid vesicles via a collisional mechanism which involves a direct interaction with the acceptor membrane. Transfer of cholesterol to membranes is faster in an acidic environment and is greatly enhanced by the presence of the unique lysosomal/late endosomal phospholipid lyso-bisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) (also known as bismonoacylglycerol phosphate). Finally, we found that the rate of transfer of cholesterol from vesicles to NPC2 was dramatically increased by the presence of lyso-bisphosphatidic acid in the donor vesicles. These results support a role for the NPC2 protein in the egress of LDL derived cholesterol out of the endosomal/lysosomal compartment."

ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are required in many nuclear processes, such as replication and transcription, in which factors need access to the DNA. Recent research has shown that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are also required for chromatin maintenance and genome stability (for reviews see Refs. 1Sif S. J. Cell.

Eukaryotic cells have several ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which can be divided into at least four different classes depending on the ATPase in the complex as follows: SWI/SNF complexes, ISWI (Imitation of SWI)-containing complexes, Mi-2 complexes, and Ino80 (1Sif S.

Genomics. 2000; 63: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but they do not share an extended sequence homology. The individual proteins give specificity to the different complexes, and the ISWI protein provides the ATPase activity responsible for the remodeling of the nucleosome.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3881-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) Because WSTF can be part of two ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, it has been suggested that WSTF acts as a platform to which other proteins bind depending on functional requirement (10Kitagawa H.

However, ISWI complexes, such as the NURF complex and the NoRC, also regulate transcription. These complexes act in transcription conducted by different RNA polymerases; NURF acts on developmental RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) genes in Drosophila and man (16Badenhorst P. Voas M. Rebay I. Wu C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3186-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Barak O. Lazzaro M.A. Lane W.S. Speicher D.W. Picketts D.J. Shiekhattar R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6089-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas NoRC is a silencer of rRNA genes, inhibiting RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) transcription (18Santoro R. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2539-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). RNA pol I transcribes the 47/45 S rRNA gene in the nucleolus (reviewed in Ref. 19Grummt I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Similar to WSTF, TIP5 has binding sites for acetylated histones and recruits the NoRC to rDNA by binding to acetylated H4, specifically lysine 16, in the promoter (20Zhou Y. Grummt I. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NoRC, in turn, targets histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and DNA methyltransferases to the rRNA gene to be silenced (18Santoro R. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2539-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). So far, no ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex has been found to be associated with RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) transcription. RNA pol III is the polymerase responsible for the transcription of short, untranslated RNAs, such as 5 S rRNA, tRNA, 7SL RNA (in the signal recognition particle), and U6 snRNA (reviewed in Ref. 21White R.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because RNA pol I and RNA pol III transcripts act in translation, the activities of these RNA polymerases are closely linked to cell growth. We report here the isolation of a high molecular weight WSTF assembly, designated B-WICH, that contains the human ISWI protein SNF2h and is involved in transcription. We identified the following six novel association partners to WSTF-SNF2h by mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation: the transcription factor Myb-binding protein 1a (Myb-bp1a) (22Tavner F.J.

The formation of B-WICH depends on active transcription, which suggests that WSTF-SNF2h has a role in transcription, in addition to its role in replication. The B-WICH was also sensitive to RNase treatment, and we have shown that the 45 S rRNA, the 5 S rRNA, and the 7SL RNA are parts of the B-WICH assembly. This led us to suggest that the B-WICH is assembled upon RNA pol I and RNA pol III transcription. In support of a role for the WSTF-SNF2h in RNA pol III transcription, we found that these proteins, together with NM1, were present at the 5 S RNA and 7SL RNA genes and that silencing of WSTF by shRNA reduced the RNA levels of 5 S rRNA and 7SL RNA. The interactions between the WSTF-SNF2h core and nuclear proteins involved in replication, transcription, and DNA repair suggest a wide role for WSTF-SNF2h in the nucleus by acting as a platform for other proteins. Cell Cultures—HeLa cells were grown in 5% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under a 7% CO2 atmosphere. Transfection of cells was performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) with an efficiency of ∼50%. Fractionation of HeLa Nuclei and Salt Extraction—HeLa cells were fractionated into a nucleoplasmic fraction and a chromatin (nuclear structures) fraction at different KCl concentrations as described by Remboutsika et al. (30Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of WSTF-ISWI Complex (B-WICH)—HeLa cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and a protease mixture containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml leupepstatin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) in a Dounce homogenizer, ∼12 strokes. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2,800 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer containing 0.7 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml leupepstatin, 0.1 mm DTT; and the extract was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The nuclear extract was then passed through a G-25 Sephadex column equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl in fractionation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF), and the protein fraction was fractionated on a 20-ml phosphocellulose-11 (P-11) column equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl in fractionation buffer. The column was washed with 0.3 m KCl in fractionation buffer, and the ISWI-containing complexes were eluted by increasing the KCl concentration stepwise to 0.5, 0.65, and 0.85 m. The different P-11 fractions were subsequently separately passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl in fractionation buffer, and then applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein complexes were eluted by a 20-ml KCl gradient from 0.2 to 0.8 m at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5-ml volume were collected. Mono Q fractions containing WSTF were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal C-terminal WSTF antibody (Cell Signaling) and collected for identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Superose 6HR fractionation of the WSTF-enriched Mono Q fractions was performed in 0.3 m KCl in fractionation buffer. Preparation of the HeLa Cell Nuclear Extracts—The protocol described above was followed when preparing 0.7 KCl HeLa cell nuclear extract. HeLa cell nuclear extract was also prepared using the buffer containing 0.42 m KCl as described by Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were treated with RNase A (0.33 μg/μl) at room temperature for 20 min. RNaseOut (Invitrogen) was added to the untreated nuclear extracts. HeLa cells were treated with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) to obtain nuclear extract from transcriptionally inhibited cultures, and nuclear extracts were prepared after 30 min. Immunoprecipitation of the WSTF-containing Complex—WSTF-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated from both whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts extracted with extraction buffer as described above containing 0.7 m KCl, without DTT. The whole cell extract (0.5 mg) and nuclear extract (0.3–0.4 mg) were quickly diluted to a final concentration of 0.35 m KCl with IP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors as above) and incubated with antibody for 18 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were precipitated using protein A/protein G-Sepharose. The pellet was washed six times with 0.25 m KCl or 0.35 m KCl IP wash buffer as indicated (0.25 or 0.35 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and the protease mixture described above) and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. WSTF-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated from nuclear extract that had been treated with RNase A (0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature before immunoprecipitation or from nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples were separated on 7% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon membrane filter (Millipore) using a transfer buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 1.3 mm SDS, 5% methanol. The membranes were probed with polyclonal ISWI antibodies (kind gifts from P. Wade), polyclonal anti-Dek (kind gift from G. Grosveld), polyclonal anti-Myb-bp1a (kind gift form R. Keough), a polyclonal anti-RNA helicase II/Guα (kind gift from B. C. Valdez), a polyclonal Sf3b155/SAP155 antibody (kind gift of R.

Varga-Weisz) and one against the C-terminal part of the Xenopus WSTF (kind gift of T. Hirano). The signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Coomassie-stained bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The peptides were extracted from the gel, desalted on Zip-Tip (Millipore), and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (34Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry,. 2000; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Crossref Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and WSTF-shRNA—The RNAs in B-WICH were isolated from the immunoprecipitated complex by extraction by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and DNase-treated (Invitrogen). The RNA was then converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase using random primers (Invitrogen), in the presence of RNaseOut, and the cDNA was analyzed using PCR with primers for 45 S RNA, 18 S RNA, 28 S RNA (35Philimonenko V.V.

The protein level of WSTF was knocked down in cells using WSTF-shRNA (expressed from the pSuper vector) with the sequence 5′-GAACAGGSSGTTGCTGAGC. Total RNA was prepared 36 h after transfection using Trizol (Invitrogen) and then treated with DNase (Invitrogen). The RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Superscript III; Invitrogen) using random primers, followed by PCR using specific primers for 5 S, 7SL, tRNA (36Winter A.G. Sourvinous G.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP analyses were performed as described previously (38Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and repeated in six independent experiments. Chromatin was prepared from HeLa cells after cross-linking with formaldehyde. The chromatin was sheared by sonication to a DNA size of 500–1500 bp. Chromatin fragments were precipitated with antibodies against WSTF (Cell Signaling), SNF2h (Abcam), NM1 (32Fomproix N. Percipalle P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and TFIIIC220 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to protein A/G-Sepharose beads (50% of each). Two controls were used: beads only and donkey IgG (Abcam) bound to the beads. The resulting precipitated DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with specific primers for the genes for 5 S rRNA, 7SL RNA, tRNATyr, tRNALeu (36Winter A.G. Sourvinous G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The WSTF Protein Associates Tightly with Chromatin—Extraction of HeLa cell nuclei at different salt concentrations revealed that the WSTF protein was tightly associated with the chromatin fraction. The major part of the WSTF was extracted at concentrations above 0.42 m KCl, and most of the protein was released at 1 m KCl (Fig. 1A). This finding prompted us to determine in which constellations the WSTF protein was released at different KCl concentrations, as it interacts both with the SNF2h protein and with the SWI/SNF complexes. The WSTF protein extracted from nuclei at 0.7 m KCl eluted from a Superose 6HR size exclusion column in two distinct peaks, one at 700–800 kDa and one at 2–3 MDa (Fig. 1B). The same two WSTF peaks were also seen with two other polyclonal antibodies against WSTF, one against the N-terminal part (6Bozhenok L. Wade P.A. Varga-Weisz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and one against the C-terminal part (7MacCallum D.E. Losada A. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (not shown). Only the WSTF peak at the lower mass, 800 kDa, was present in the nuclear extract prepared at 0.42 m KCl (Fig. 1B). The WICH complex has a molecular mass of 700 kDa (6Bozhenok L. Wade P.A. Varga-Weisz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), to which the lower molecular mass peak corresponds. The ISWI protein eluted in two major peaks from 0.7 m KCl nuclear extracts, one peak co-eluting with the high molecular weight WSTF peak and the other peak at 600–900 kDa, partially coeluting with the low molecular weight WSTF peak. The 0.42 m KCl extract also contained high molecular weight ISWI complexes, but the main protein peak appeared at 700 kDa to 1 MDa. The lower ISWI peak co-eluted with different proteins found in ISWI complexes, Acf1 and TIP5, whereas the large peak co-eluted with SMC1 (not shown), the cohesin present in a large ISWI-NuRD-cohesin complex involved in sister-chromatin segregation (40Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Schmiesing J.A. Dong Y. Barak O.G. Speicher D.W. Yokomori K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2002; 418: 994-99821Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). WSTF-SNF2h Associates with Several Other Nuclear Proteins—We subsequently purified the large WSTF-containing assembly through three chromatographic steps, using a purification scheme as shown in Fig. 2A. Nuclear extract was first applied on a P-11 column, from which proteins were eluted in several steps at different KCl concentrations as shown in Fig. 2A, before being separated on a Mono Q column and a final Superose 6HR size exclusion column. The large WSTF-containing peak was only detected in the 0.5–0.65 m KCl fraction from the P-11 column. The fraction eluting at 0.65–0.85 m KCl contained only the 700-kDa WSTF peak (not shown). The WSTF protein eluted from the final Superose 6 HR column in a broad peak, centered at a molecular mass of 3 MDa, with a further smaller peak at 1 MDa (Fig. 2B). The ISWI protein also eluted at a molecular mass of 3 MDa, but the main peak eluted at 1 MDa (Fig. 2B). Other ISWI complexes, such as ACF/WCRF and NoRC, eluted at 1 MDa (supplemental Fig. 1), and the large ISWI-Mi2-cohesin eluted in a broad peak at 1–3 MDa (supplemental Fig. 1). The WSTF in the 3-MDa peak interacted with ISWI. Immunoprecipitation using the WSTF antibody of the 3 MDa peak (fractions 15 and 16 from the Superose of nuclear extract prepared at 0.7 m KCl, presented in Fig. 1) precipitated ISWI protein (Fig. 2C). We performed immunoprecipitations of"

However, no nuclear receptor has been implicated in the mechanism for estrogen-induced hepatotoxicity.

Upon EE2 treatment, estrogen receptor α (ERα) repressed the expression of bile acid and cholesterol transporters (bile salt export pump (BSEP), Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), OATP1, OATP2, ABCG5, and ABCG8) in the liver. Consistently, biliary secretions of both bile acids and cholesterol were markedly decreased in EE2-treated wild-type mice but not in the EE2-treated Era–/– mice. In addition, ERα up-regulated the expression of CYP7B1 and down-regulated the CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, shifting bile acid synthesis toward the acidic pathway to increase the serum level of β-muricholic acid. ERβ, FXR, PXR, and CAR were not involved in regulating the expression of bile acid transporter and biosynthesis enzyme genes following EE2 exposure. Taken together, these results suggest that ERα-mediated repression of hepatic transporters and alterations of bile acid biosynthesis may contribute to development of the EE2-induced hepatotoxicity.

EE2 treatment decreases the ATP-dependent taurocholate transport in the hepatic canalicular membrane, which is thought to be due to impaired expression of the canalicular bile salt export pump (BSEP) (5Lee J.M.

Moreover, treatment with EE2 also decreases sinusoidal uptake of bile acids by down-regulating the expression of the Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide protein (NTCP) (6Simon F.R. Fortune J. Iwahashi M. Gartung C. Wolkoff A. Sutherland E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G1043-G1052PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that estrogens induce cholestasis by reducing both the influx and efflux of bile acid in hepatocytes, resulting in a decrease in bile flow. In addition, EE2 treatment is shown to alter bile acid composition, which is associated with cholestatic features (7Koopen N.R. Post S.M. Wolters H. Havinga R. Stellaard F. Boverhof R. Kuipers F. Princen H.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 100-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of these EE2-dependent alterations is still not fully understood. Bile acid homeostasis is tightly regulated by multiple nuclear receptors including FXR, PXR, and CAR in physiological and/or pathological conditions (8Karpen S.J. J.

It is well understood that bile acids repress bile acid biosynthesis by down-regulating transcription of the rate-limiting enzyme CYP7A1 through the FXR-SHP-LRH1 cascade (11Sinal C.J. Tohkin M.

Simultaneously, FXR up-regulates the expression of BSEP, which increases bile acid efflux from the liver into the bile (11Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J.

The activation of PXR inhibits production of additional bile acid by inhibiting CYP7A1 and inducing OATP2, which increases the uptake of bile acids from sinusoidal blood to the hepatocytes (15Staudinger J.L.

Consistent with preventive roles of PXR and CAR in the cholestatic condition, the double null mouse lacking PXR and CAR has a more severe disruption of bile acids and cholesterol homeostasis (18Zhang J.

In the present study, we investigated whether nuclear receptor could be involved in the pathogenesis of estrogen-induced hepatotoxicity, using Era–/–, Erb–/–, Fxr–/–, Pxr–/–, and Car–/– mice. We provide direct in vivo evidence that synthetic estrogen EE2 exposure induces liver damage by activating the ERα signaling pathways, leading to an alteration of bile acids biosynthesis and repression of multiple bile acid and cholesterol transporters. Materials—17α-Ethynylestradiol and 1,2-propanediol were obtained from Sigma. Animal Treatment—All protocols and procedures were approved by the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Era–/–, Erb–/–, Pxr–/–, Fxr–/–, and Car–/– mice were generated and characterized previously (10Guo G.L. Lambert G. Negishi M. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Kliewer S.A. Gonzalez F.J. Sinal C.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Era–/– and Erb–/– mice on a background of C57BL/6 were obtained from Taconic Farms (German-town, NY). Pxr–/–, Fxr–/–, and Car–/– mice used in these studies were maintained in 129/Sv and C57BL/6 mixed genetic background. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles with access to standard chow and water ad libitum. Age-matched groups of 8–12-week-old mice were used for all the experiments. Four to eight mice were used for each treatment group. Adult mice received subcutaneous injections of EE2 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (80% 1,2-propanediol with 0.15% NaCl) once daily for 5 successive days. Twenty hours after the last injection, the mice were fasted for 4 h before harvesting blood from the retroorbital plexus for subsequent serum analyses and livers for RNA isolation and histology. Histology and Mitosis Measurements—Liver samples from each mouse were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard protocols and examined microscopically for structural changes. Hepatocyte proliferation was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 using rat anti-mouse Ki67 (TEC3) antibody (Dako Corporation). Immunoreactivity was visualized with the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. To assess proliferative responses to liver lesions, mitotic nuclei were counted in 20 randomly selected fields under ×200 magnification, and the mitotic index was calculated by dividing the number of mitotic cells by the total number of hepatocytes. Measurement of Serum Chemistries—Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bile acids were measured using reagents and controls from Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd. and the Cobas Mira plus CC analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Individual bile acid concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS using a PE SCIEX API2000 ESI triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) controlled by Analyst software as described previously (23Inoue Y. Yu A.M. Inoue J. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2480-2489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analyses of Biliary Lipids—Biliary lipid secretion was measured following surgery for bile collection. Animals were fasted for 4 h before surgery following EE2 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle injection for 5 successive days. Bile collection started between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. to minimize influence of circadian variations. Animals were anesthetized with a single dose of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and maintained under this condition throughout the experiments. The gallbladder was cannulated with PE-10 tubing after ligation of the common bile duct and secured with a silk suture. Bile collection was measured gravimetrically, assuming a bile density of 1.0 g/ml. The initial 15 min of biliary secretion that contained concentrated gallbladder bile was not used for analysis. Bile collection continued for up to 1 h and was constant over this period. Body temperature was maintained with a heat pad to prevent hypothermic alterations of bile flow. The biliary concentration of bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids were measured using the total bile acid test, cholesterol E test, and phospholipids B test (Wako Chemicals). The biliary excretion rates were calculated as the product of the bile flow and the biliary concentration. Reporter Assays—HepG2 cells, grown in phenol red-free minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal dextranstripped fetal bovine serum, were transfected with a Gal-responsive luciferase reporter and Gal-DNA binding domain fused ERα-LDB, ERβ-LDB, FXR-LDB, PXR-LDB, and CAR-LDB (24Yamamoto Y. Kawamoto T. Negishi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), using the calcium phosphate method (Amersham Biosciences). At 16 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 nm 17β-estradiol, 10 μm 17α-ethynylestradiol, or Me2SO for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the phRL-TK vector as an internal control. Analyses of Gene Expressions—Total RNAs were isolated from mouse hepatic tissue using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized from total RNAs with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers. Real time PCR measurements of individual cDNAs were performed with the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. Gene-specific primers and probes were designed using Prime Express software (PE Applied Biosystems) or purchased as the predesigned TaqMan gene expression assays gene-specific probe and primer mixture (PE Applied Biosystems).

Although body weights were similar between EE2-treated mice and vehicle control mice (data not shown), liver weights were significantly increased in EE2-treated Wt+/+, Erb–/–, Fxr–/–, Pxr–/–, and Car–/– mice, but no hepatomegaly was evident in EE2-treated male and female Era–/– mice (Fig. 1A). Serum bile acid levels were also elevated in EE2-treated Wt+/+, Erb–/–, Fxr–/–, Pxr–/–, and Car–/– mice but not in Era–/– mice (Fig. 1B). Serum ALP activities, a marker for hepatocyte damage, were significantly increased in EE2-treated mice but not in Era–/– mice (Fig. 1C). Era+/+ mice are shown as representative wild-type (Wt+/+) mice. The other corresponding wild-type mice also showed similar responses following EE2 treatment to those of Era+/+ mice (supplemental Fig. 1). As shown in previous studies (11Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 25Kitada H. Miyata M. Nakamura T. Tozawa A. Honma W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), Fxr–/– mice exhibited increased basal bile acid levels. Importantly, levels of bile acids and ALP activity were further increased by EE2 in Fxr–/– mice, suggesting that EE2 treatment induced hepatotoxicity via an FXR-independent mechanism. These results clearly demonstrate that ERα is required for the development of EE2-induced hepatotoxicity. The livers of EE2-treated Wt+/+ and Era–/– mice were examined histologically. Liver sections of vehicle-treated mice showed normal morphology (Fig. 2A), whereas EE2-treated Wt+/+ mice exhibited hepatocyte degeneration and infiltration of inflammatory cells in hepatic sinusoids. However, EE2-treated Era–/– mice did not show any liver damage. Accordingly, livers from the EE2-treated Wt+/+ mice but not the EE2-treated Era–/– mice contained many Ki67-positive proliferating hepatocytes. To further quantify the response to liver damage, we counted the number of mitotic nuclei in these samples. The percentage of mitotic nuclei was markedly increased with EE2 treatment in Wt+/+ mice. However, no such increase was observed in EE2-treated Era–/– mice (Fig. 2B). To confirm the specificity of EE2 in receptor activation, we performed gene reporter assays by cotransfecting a Gal-responsive luciferase reporter gene construct with Gal-fused ERα, ERβ, FXR, PXR, and CAR-LBD in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). As shown in previous reports, both ERα and ERβ were exclusively activated by EE2 as well as by the endogenous ligand 17β-estradiol (E2) (26Pettersson K. Grandien K. Kuiper G.G. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, EE2 treatment activated FXR and PXR ∼2-fold, although there was no activation by E2. CAR was slightly activated by E2 treatment (24Yamamoto Y. Kawamoto T. Negishi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but not by EE2 treatment. Both ERα and ERβ are predominantly expressed in reproductive organs. However, ERα is significantly expressed in liver, whereas the level of ERβ mRNA in liver is very low (27Couse J.F. Lindzey J. Grandien K. Gustafsson J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4613-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Although E2 and EE2 activate both ERα and ERβ, ERβ probably does not play a significant role in hepatocytes because of its low expression level, which is in agreement with the hepatotoxic phenotypes in Erb–/– mice following EE2 treatment. Alteration of Bile Acid Biosynthesis—We examined the expression of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis: Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Cyp7b1, Cyp27, Fxr, and Shp (Fig. 4A). The biosynthesis of the primary bile acids, cholic acid, and β-muricholic acid is mediated by either the neutral or acidic pathway (28Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 29Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting reaction in the neutral pathway is catalyzed by CYP7A1. The expression of CYP7A1 was decreased in EE2-treated Wt+/+, Erb–/–, Fxr–/–, Pxr–/–, and Car–/– mice but was not altered in the EE2-treated Era–/– mice. Although basal expression of CYP7A1 remained unchanged in Era–/– mice compared with that of Wt+/+ mice (supplemental Fig. 2), the repression of CYP7A1 reflected the response activity of ERα to EE2. Similarly, Erb–/– and Pxr–/– mice did not change basal expression of CYP7A1. Fxr–/– and Car–/– mice showed an increase in basal expression of CYP7A1 mRNA of 4- and 1.6-fold, respectively. However, FXR and CAR did not contribute to the repression of CYP7A1 by EE2 treatment. The expression of CYP8B1, another enzyme involved in the neutral pathway, was also decreased in all EE2-treated mouse lines, except that the Era–/– mice retained the original level of CYP8B1. In contrast, the expression of CYP7B1, an important enzyme in the acidic pathway, was markedly induced in all EE2-treated mouse lines but not in the Era–/– mice. In addition, the expression of the gene encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase CYP27 was not changed in any of the mouse lines treated with EE2. Furthermore, no differences were found in the expression of a key regulator of bile acid homeostasis FXR and SHP, suggesting that the FXR-SHP negative feedback was not involved in the regulation of these biosynthesis enzymes by EE2 treatment. To investigate the effect of altered CYPs expressions by EE2, we measured the composition of bile acids in male and female Wt+/+ and Era–/– mice using LC-MS/MS. Indeed, consistent with the expression of CYP7A1, CYP7B1, and CYP8B1, the ratios of β-muricholic acid to cholic acid were significantly increased in Wt+/+ mice following EE2 treatment with no alteration in Era–/– mice (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that alterations in bile acid biosynthesis may contribute to the development of hepatotoxicity by EE2 treatment. Repression of Bile Acid Transporters and Cholesterol Transporters—To further understand the molecular basis of EE2-induced hepatotoxicity, we examined the expression of key hepatic transporters involved in bile acid, cholesterol, and phospholipid transport. We first examined the expression of canalicular transporters BSEP and MDR2 that have been identified as the genes responsible for familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC2 and PFIC3), respectively (30Jansen P.L. Muller M. Sturm E. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Expression of BSEP was decreased in EE2-treated Wt+/+, Erb–/–, Fxr–/–, Pxr–/–, and Car–/– mice but was not altered in the EE2-treated Era–/– mice (Fig. 5). In contrast, MDR2 levels were not significantly changed in any of the mouse lines treated with EE2. NTCP is responsible for bile acid uptake into hepatocytes, and OATP transporters are also involved in sodium-independent hepatic uptake of bile acids. A reduction in NTCP and OATP-C (the human homologue of rodent OATP2) is observed in patients with cholestasis (31Zollner G. Fickert P. Zenz R. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Kenner L. Ferenci P. Stauber R.E. Krejs G.J. Denk H. Zatloukal K. Trauner M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Indeed, NTCP expression was decreased in all EE2-treated mouse lines except the Era–/– mice. OATP1 and OATP2 levels were also decreased by EE2 treatment in all mouse lines except Era–/– mice. We also analyzed the expression of cholesterol efflux transporters ABCG5, ABCG8, and ABCA1. Expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNAs was significantly decreased by EE2 treatment in all mouse models except the Era–/– mice. In contrast, EE2 treatment had no effect on ABCA1 expression. ABCG5 and ABCG8 play a crucial role in cellular cholesterol efflux from hepatocytes to bile (32Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). EE2 decreased both ABCG5 and ABCG8 levels, suggesting abrogation of cholesterol homeostasis. To evaluate whether the repression of hepatic transporters reflected biliary lipids secretion, biliary bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipid secretion rates were determined directly by cannulating the gallbladder after ligation of the common bile duct (Fig. 6). In agreement with the decreased expression of hepatic transporters, the secretion of bile acids and cholesterol was significantly decreased by EE2 in male and female Wt+/+ mice but not in Era–/– mice. The secretion of biliary phospholipids was also decreased by EE2. Although the degree of repression of the major phospholipid transporter MDR2 was small, a significant decrease of phospholipids secretion was observed. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that biliary phospholipids secretion is coupled to biliary bile acids secretion. Thus, these data indicate that the activation of ERα is associated with a marked impairment in biliary secretion. We have provided direct evidence that ERα can become a risk factor for the development of hepatotoxicity following estrogen exposures. Using various nuclear receptor knock-out mice, we have now shown that ERα is the receptor responsible for repressing multiple hepatic bile acid and cholesterol transporters; repressing hepatic transporters reduces biliary lipids secretions resulting in liver damage (Fig. 7). In addition, the ERα-mediated alteration of bile acids biosynthesis may have also contributed to the EE2-induced development of hepatotoxicity. None of the other nuclear receptors (ERβ, FXR, PXR, and CAR) were shown to be involved in developing hepatotoxicity. Our present study with Era–/– mice is the first to demonstrate directly the involvement of ERα in estrogen-induced hepatotoxicities, although it has been reported that treatment with ERα agonists causes adverse effects such as gallstone formation in humans and experimental animal models (33Grodstein F. Colditz G.A. Hunter D.J. Manson J.E. Willett W.C. Stampfer M.J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 84: 207-214PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wang H.H. Afdhal N.H. Wang D.Q. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of how ERα regulates CYPs and transporters remains an open question at the present time. Some of the genes analyzed in our present study can also be regulated by other nuclear receptors such as LXR, LRH1, and HNF4 (9Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 35Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Although expression of the known HNF4-regulated gene (Vlacsr) was found to be repressed in the EE2-treated Wt+/+ mice but not in EE2-treated Era–/– mice (supplemental Fig. 3), the possibility remains that ERα indirectly repressed NTCP and OATP1 through antagonizing HNF4 activity. However, BSEP that was repressed by EE2 in our study was up-regulated in HNF4-null mice (35Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Hence even an indirect mechanism such as HNF4-mediated repression may explain some but not all of ERα-mediated regulation. Neither LXR targets (SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1), FAS, and SPOT14) nor the LRH1 target, scavenger receptor BI, was affected by EE2 treatment, suggesting no involvement of these two nuclear receptors in EE2 actions. We have performed promoter analyses for both Cyp7b1 and Cyp8b1 genes to delineate ERα response elements but failed to identify these elements. The molecular mechanism of EE2-induced hepatotoxicity may be complex and could require both direct and indirect regulations. ICP is the most common liver disease during pregnancy. Although numerous studies have investigated ICP, the molecular basis for its development remains unknown. Because hepatic transporters BSEP and MDR3 (the human homologue of rodent MDR2) are identified as the genes responsible for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC2 and PFIC3, respectively) (30Jansen P.L. Muller M. Sturm E. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), several studies have investigated the association of these cholestatic genes with ICP. Mutations in the BSEP gene are not implicated in sporadic cases of ICP in Swiss patients (36Pauli-Magnus C. Lang T. Meier Y. Zodan-Marin T. Jung D. Breymann C. Zimmermann R. Kenngott S. Beuers U. Reichel C. Kerb R. Penger A. Meier P.J. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, common mutations in MDR3 are not found in familial and sporadic cases of ICP in Finnish patients (37Savander M. Ropponen A. Avela K. Weerasekera N. Cormand B. Hirvioja M.L. Riikonen S. Ylikorkala O. Lehesjoki A.E. Williamson C. Aittomaki K. Gut. 2003; 52: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although mutations in these genes may raise the susceptibility to ICP, the results of these studies do not confirm a direct correlation between mutational events in these candidate genes and ICP. However, it has been reported that BSEP expression is decreased in livers of ICP patients (4Rodriguez-Garay E.A. Ann. Hepatol. 2003; 2: 150-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zollner G. Fickert P. Zenz R. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Kenner L. Ferenci P. Stauber R.E. Krejs G.J. Denk H. Zatloukal K. Trauner M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, the deletion of BSEP causes intrahepatic cholestasis in mice (38Wang R. Salem M. Yousef I.M. Tuchweber B. Lam P. Childs S.J. Helgason C.D. Ackerley C. Phillips M.J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our current finding that ERα plays a key role to repress multiple transporters in the development of cholestasis suggests that mutations or polymorphisms in the ERα gene may be implicated in some form of ICP in humans. Primary biliary cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease that results in cholestasis, predominantly affects women and is characterized biochemically by elevated serum ALP. Interestingly, tamoxifen, an ERα antagonist used to treat breast cancer, is found to dramatically decrease ALP levels in primary biliary cirrhosis patients, suggesting that tamoxifen can also be used to treat cholestasis (39Invernizzi P. Alvaro D. Crosignani A. Gaudio E. Podda M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1175-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Reddy A. Prince M. James O.F. Jain S. Bassendine M.F. Liver Int. 2004; 24: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These clinical reports support the notion that the hepatic gene regulation through ERα plays a key role in estrogen-induced cholestasis. Our present findings that ERα regulates bile acid transporters including BSEP have provided the molecular basis of ERα-mediated estrogen-induced hepatotoxicity. FXR is also known to regulate the same genes involved in bile acid homeostasis. Although treatment with the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 is shown to be effective in improving cholestasis and reducing gallstone formation in experimental animal model (41Liu Y. Binz J. Numerick M.J. Dennis S. Luo G. Desai B. MacKenzie K.I. Mansfield T.A. Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. J. Clin.

Med. 2004; 10: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), no FXR agonist such as GW4064 has been approved as a therapeutic drug. Treatment of cholestasis with ursodeoxycholic acid is widely used and reduces pruritus in ICP. However, ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is not completely effective in preventing fetal death or premature delivery associated with fetal distress (43Lammert F. Marschall H.U. Matern S. Curr. Treat. Options Gastroenterol. 2003; 6: 123-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The development of liver-specific ERα antagonists could yield alternative therapeutics for treatment of chronic cholestasis patients as well as ICP patients. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1966780564,"A novel estrogen receptor (ER)α coactivator complex, the MLL2 complex, which consists of MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5, was identified. ERα directly binds to the MLL2 complex through two LXXLL motifs in a region of MLL2 near the C terminus in a ligand-dependent manner. Disrupting the interaction between ERα and the MLL2 complex with small interfering RNAs specific against MLL2 or an MLL2 fragment representing the interacting region with ERα significantly inhibited the ERα transcription activity. The MLL2 complex was recruited on promoters of ERα target genes along with ERα upon estrogen stimulation. Inhibition of MLL2 expression decreased the estrogen-induced expression of ERα target genes cathepsin D and to a lesser extent pS2. In addition, MCF-7 cell growth was also inhibited by the depletion of MLL2. These results demonstrate that the ERα signaling pathway is critically dependent on its direct interaction with the MLL2 complex and suggest a central role for the MLL2 complex in the growth of ERα-positive cancer cells.

There are two types of estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ. The well studied ERα is involved in normal mammary gland development as well as breast cancer initiation and progress (1Kuiper G.G. Enmark E.

ERα has two transcriptional activation domains, the N-terminal activation domain AF-1 and the C-terminal activation domain AF-2. Upon estrogen binding, ERα undergoes a conformational change and regulates the expression of its target genes (5Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

A large number of ERα coactivators, including the three members of the SRC-1 family (SRC-1, SRC-2/GRIP1/TIF2, and SRC-3/AIB1/ACTR/pCID/RAC3/TRAM1) (7Xu J. Li Q. Mol.

Most of the coactivators interact with the AF-2 domain of ERα in a ligand-dependent manner. Some of these cofactors are intrinsic enzymes with the activity of acetyltransferase or methyltransferase or are able to recruit such enzymes (12Kitagawa H. Yanagisawa J. Fuse H. Ogawa S. Yogiashi Y.

The varying patterns of histone modification are now referred to as a histone code and are proposed to be epigenetic markers for determining gene activation status (15Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7648) Google Scholar). Some nuclear receptor coactivators (corepressors) are presented as multiprotein complexes, and these steady-state protein complexes probably act as functional units of nuclear receptor coregulators (16Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). ERα coactivator TRAP220/PBP exists in the multiprotein TRAP complex, which has molecular mass of ∼2 MD and is composed of more than 30 subunits (17Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The TRAP complex facilitates ERα actions by synergizing basal transcription machineries. The ERα coactivator PRIP (TRBP, TRAP250, NRC, and AIB3) is also demonstrated to stay in a massive steady-state complex ASCOM (18Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kang M.J. Jung D.J. Kwak E.

Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL, also termed ALL-1, HRX, and HTRX) is often involved in chromosome translocations in human acute leukemia and functionally essential for maintaining the expression of the HOX gene during embryo development (19Ayton P.M.

MLL is the mammalian homolog of the yeast SET1 protein, which is present as a SET1 complex harboring the methyltransferase to modify chromatin histone H3 (19Ayton P.M. Cleary M.L.

Despite extensive research work being done on MLL, little is known about the function of MLL2 (or ALR), a close homologue of MLL, which is a polypeptide of 5262 amino acids encoded by an mRNA that is over 18-kb long (27Prasad R. Zhadanov A.B. Sedkov Y. Bullrich F. Druck T. Rallapalli R. Yano T. Alder H. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Mazo A. Canaani E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Identifying ERα interacting complexes is essential to understanding how ERα controls gene transcription and how it is involved in the development of breast cancer. Here we describe the identification of a novel protein complex, the MLL2 complex, consisting of MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5, which is required for ligand-dependent ERα transactivation. Disruption of the complex repressed estrogen-dependent expression of ERα target genes and also inhibited growth of MCF-7 cells. Plasmids and Antibodies—pCDNA3.1-ERα, ERE-TK-LUC, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ERα (LBD) were described as before (28Qi C. Chang J. Zhu Y. Yeldandi A.V. Rao S.M. Zhu Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28624-28630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). GST-MLL2set was constructed by inserting the C-terminal 172-amino-acid coding region of mouse MLL2 into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). PCMV-ASH2 and PCMV-RBQ3 clones were purchased from Open Biosystems. PCMV-WDR5 was generated by releasing WDR5 full-length cDNA from pOTB7-WDR5 (Open Biosystems) and inserted into the EcoRI/SalI site of pCMV-Sport6. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create amino acid mutations of the fifth and sixth LXXLL motifs in PCMV-MLL2 (from LXXLL to LXXAA) with mutagenic primers 5′-CTGCTCTTGCAGAAGGCAGCCCGGGCAAAGAATGTGC-3′and 5′-AAGCGGCTTCGGCTGGCGGCGACCATCCAGAAGGGC-3′. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. GST-MLL2set proteins were produced in the Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus strain (Stratagene), and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads 4B. The 172-amino-acid MLL2 fragment was released from the GST fusion protein by treatment with thrombin. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal 172-amino-acid of MLL2 was developed by the Spring Valley Laboratory. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ash2 and anti-RBQ3 antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-ERα monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit anti-PRIP was generated in previous work (29Zhu Y. Qi C. Cao W.Q. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10380-10385Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-WDR5 antiserum was a kind gift of Dr. W. Herr (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Isolation of ERα AF2-associated Complexes—DU4475 cells, an ER-negative breast cancer cell line, were grown in a suspension culture by the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). DU4475 cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar) and precleaned by incubating with an excess amount of GST-Sepharose 4B beads. Immobilized GST-ERα (LBD) fusion proteins were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C in GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Bead-immobilized proteins were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with precleaned DU4475 nuclear extract in the presence or absence of 100 nm 17β-estradiol (E2). After washing with GST wash buffer (GST binding buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40) four times, proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 30 mm reduced glutathione. Elutants were concentrated and layered on top of a 4.5-ml linear 10–40% glycerol gradient in 5-ml tubes. Following a 16-h centrifugation at 4 °C using an SW40 rotor (Beckman) with a speed of 40,000 rpm, 200 μl of solution from each fraction was collected from top to bottom. Ovalbumin (44 kDa), β-globulin (158 kDa), and thyroglobulin (667 kDa) were used as protein standards. Immunoprecipitation—DU4475 nuclear extracts, 2.0 mg, were precleaned with polyclonal rabbit anti-PRIP for 2 h at 4 °C and high speed centrifugation to remove precipitates. The supernatant was divided equally and immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies or control IgG in GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After extensive washing using the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies as indicated. GST Pull-down Assays—GST and GST fusion proteins were produced in the E. coli BL21 codon plus strain (Stratagene) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were in vitro translated using TnT quick coupled in vitro transcription and translation kit (Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. A 20-μl volume of GST fusion protein bead slurry was incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated protein for 2 h in 500 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence or absence of 100 nm E2. After the beads were washed four times with binding buffer, 30 μl of Laemmli protein loading buffer were added and boiled for 3 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, amplified, dried, and autoradiographed. Cell Culture and Transfection—A total of 2 × 105 MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1.25 μg of ERE-Luc, 20 ng of pCDNA3.1-ERα, 2 μg of siRNA or plasmid as indicated, and 0.1 μg of pCMVβ (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were split equally into two different wells on the next day, and the cell medium was changed to phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium containing 10% of charcoal stripped FBS. The cells were treated with or without 100 nm E2 overnight and lysed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Three independent transfections were performed for each assay. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—MCF-7 cells were maintained in phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. After the hormone treatment for 45 min, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After the cells were collected, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (31Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were prepared by incubating the cells in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were precipitated and lysed with nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, phosphatase and protease inhibitors) for 10 min on ice. The chromatin was sheared by sonication to an average size of 500–1000 base pairs. Soluble chromatin was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with salmon sperm DNA-blocked preimmune IgG protein A beads. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the precleared cell lysate with specific antibodies at 4 °C for 12 h. Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein A beads and were washed sequentially for 10 min with washing buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1). DNAs were extracted from precipitates and used as templates in PCR amplifications. The primer pair for cathepsin D (CTSD) 5′-GCAGGCCTGGACGCGGG-3′ and 5′-GGCAACCTCGGCGCACG-3′ and primer pair for pS2 5′-CCAACCTGACCTTAATCCA-3′ and 5′-CTGCTTTGGCCTCCCAAA-3′ were used in PCRs. In all cases, PCR was performed with a serial dilution of input and various cycles (29–35 cycles) to ensure that amplification was maintained in the linear range. siRNA Transfection and Real Time PCR—siRNA smart pool oligonucleotides targeting human MLL2 and control siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon. MCF-7 cells were transfected with control siRNA or MLL2 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and cultured in phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10 nm E2 for 4 h, and total RNA was then isolated using TRIzol reagent. TaqMan probes targeting human MLL2, pS2, and cathepsin D mRNA were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The mRNA levels were detected on Applied Biosystems 7900HT fast real time PCR system. The primers for β-actin are 5′-CGAGCACAGAGCCTCGCCT-3′ and 5′-ACGATGGAGGGGAAGACGG-3′, and its probe is 5′-TTGCCGATCCGCCGCC-3′. The primers for MLL2 are 5′-GAGCCTAAAATCCTCACAC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTAGACATGCTGGTGC-3′, and its probe is 5′-CGGCCCCATACCCTGA-3′. The primers for pS2 are 5′-GATCTGCGCCCTGGTCCT-3′ and 5′-GGAAAACCACAATTCTGT-3′, and its probe is 5′-CAGACAGAGACGTGTA-3′. The primer for cathepsin D are 5′-TGATGCAGCAGAAGCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCTGTGCCACCCAGCA-3′, and its probe is 5′-CCTGAGCAGGGACCCA-3′. Cell Proliferation Assay—MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105cells/well in 6-well plates. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent on the following day. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded into 24-well plates with a density of 2 × 104cells/well in fresh phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 nm E2. Following every 2 days, viable cells were counted after trypan blue staining. Isolation of the MLL2 Complex Interacting with ERα AF2 Domain—To isolate potential protein complexes that facilitate the ligand-dependent transcription activity of ERα, the GST-fused ERα ligand binding domain GST-ERα (LBD) was used to pull down its interacting proteins from the DU4475 cell line nuclear extracts in either the presence or absence of E2. Glycerol gradient segmentation was subsequently performed to collect the high molecular mass fractions (>600 kDa), which were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analyses. As expected, we detected the TRAP/PBP complex, which was abundant and consisted of more than 30 subunits, three members of SRC-1 family, PRIP, and CBP/P300. In addition, mass spectrometry identified multiple peptides from the MLL-related protein MLL2 (ALR-1) (GenBank™ accession number 4505197), ASH2 (accession number 4009336), retinoblastoma-binding protein RBQ-3 (accession number 755750), and WD repeat domain 5 protein (WDR5) (accession number 12804457) (Fig. 1A), which likely formed a new protein complex. The presence of MLL2, ASH2, RBQ-3, and WDR5 in the proteins pulled down by GST-ERα (LBD) was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5 indeed formed a complex, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal 172 amino acids of mouse MLL2 that specifically recognizes MLL2 of both mouse and human origin. The DU4475 cell nuclear extract was precipitated with anti-MLL2, and the precipitates were then examined by Western blot using antibodies against ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5. As shown in Fig. 2A, anti-MLL2 but not the control IgG was able to precipitate ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5, suggesting that MLL2 interacted with ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5. Similarly, we demonstrated that ASH2 could be coprecipitated with RBQ3, WDR5, and MLL2, whereas RBQ3 was coimmunoprecipitated with ASH2, WDR5, and MLL2 (Fig. 2A). These results suggested that MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5 were in one complex, which we designated as the MLL2 complex. ASCOM consisting of MLL4, PRIP (ASC2), MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and α/β-tubulins (18Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kang M.J. Jung D.J. Kwak E. Barlev N.A. Berger S.L. Chow V.T. Roeder R.G. Azorsa D.O.

However, the results from mass spectrometry indicated that the MLL2 complex and ASCOM complex belong to two distinct complexes. This was evident as the abundance of MLL2 in the pull-down proteins as revealed by mass spectrometry was 20 times more than that of PRIP, and no MLL4 was detected by mass spectrometry. In addition, WDR5 is present in MLL2 complex but not in ASCOM complex. To confirm that the MLL2 protein complex is not an ASCOM complex, we performed an immunodepletion in which we incubated DU4475 nuclear extract with an excess amount of protein A-bound anti-PRIP. As a control, a same amount of DU4475 nuclear extract was immunodepleted with preimmune rabbit IgG. The remaining proteins from both groups were subjected to Western blot to compare relative abundances of individual proteins. As shown in Fig. 2B, although PRIP was almost completely cleared by precleaning with anti-PRIP, AHS2, RBQ3, and MLL2 proteins remained at similar levels to those in the preimmune rabbit IgG immunodepletion group, indicating that the vast majority of these proteins did not associate with PRIP in DU4475 nuclear protein. These results suggest that the MLL2 complex was a novel protein complex distinct from the ASCOM complex. ERα Interacts with the MLL2 Complex through MLL2 in a Ligand-dependent Fashion—To address which protein of the MLL2 complex interacts directly with ERα, we carried out an in vitro pull-down assay with each component of the complex and GST-ERα (LBD). As shown in Fig. 3A, no detectable interactions were seen between GST-ERα (LBD) and full-length ASH2, RBQ3, or WDR5 in the presence or absence of estrogen. As MLL2 is a huge protein with 5262 amino acids, we tested those regions containing LXXLL motifs, which are required for the interaction between nuclear receptor and coactivators in a ligand-dependent fashion. GST-ERα (LBD) efficiently bound to a [35S]methionine-labeled fragment of MLL2 (amino acids 4167–4780) containing two LXXLL motifs only in the presence of estrogen. When this region was divided into two fragments (amino acids 4167–4471 and amino acids 4471–4780) with each containing one LXXLL motif, the in vitro binding assay demonstrated that both fragments interacted with estrogen-bound GST-ERα (LBD). When the two LXXLL motifs were mutated, the fragment no longer interacted with GST-ERα (LBD) (Fig. 3B). The other two MLL2 regions (amino acids 2377–2835 and amino acids 3783–3905), each carrying two LXXLL motifs, showed no interactions with GST-ERα (LBD) (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that ERα binds to the MLL2 complex through two LXXLL motifs in MLL2 (located between amino acids 4167 and 4780) in the presence of estrogen. MLL2 protein contains a highly conserved SET domain, which was found to strongly interact with ASH2 but not with RBQ3 and WDR5 by GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3C). MLL2 Complex Is Needed for ERα Transcriptional Activity—We next sought to determine whether the observed interaction between ERα and the MLL2 complex is functionally relevant in the ERα signaling pathway. A pool of four siRNA target against human MLL2 (siMLL2) was employed to deplete intracellular MLL2, whereas a pool of four small interfering RNA with no specific target (siControl) was used as a control. As seen in Fig. 4A, transfection of MLL2 siRNA in MCF-7 cells led to ∼70% reduction of estrogen-dependent activation of the ERE-TK-Luc reporter gene (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the ERα signaling pathway requires MLL2. Given that ERα interacts with the MLL2 complex via two LXXLL motifs in MLL2, disruption of this interaction could be achieved by overexpressing the truncated MLL2 fragment containing these two LXXLL motifs. Cotransfection of ERα and ERE-TK-Luciferase with the truncated MLL2 fragment (4167–4780 amino acids in MCF-7 cells) caused a 43% reduction of estrogen-dependent transactivation of ERα compared with the control (Fig. 4B), whereas the truncated MLL2 carrying mutated LXXLL motifs did not decrease the activity of ERα, further demonstrating the importance of MLL2 complex in the transcriptional activity of ERα. MLL2 Is Required for the Expression of Endogenous Estrogen-inducible Genes—To investigate if the MLL2 complex is recruited to liganded ERα in the nuclei of living cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with the promoters of endogenous estrogen-responsive target genes cathepsin D and pS2. The antibodies against ASH2, RBQ3, and MLL2, along with the antibody against ERα could efficiently precipitate the estrogen-responsive regions of cathepsin D and pS2 (Fig. 5A) only when MCF-7 cells were treated with estrogen. These results suggest that estrogen treatment induced the recruitment of ERα and the MLL2 complex onto the promoter regions of estrogen-responsive target genes, which contain the estrogen-responsive element (ERE) in MCF-7 cells. The effect of MLL2 depletion on the expression of endogenous ERα target genes was assessed by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR following siRNA transfection in MCF-7 cells. TaqMan probes for human MLL2, cathepsin D, pS2, and β-actin were used in the experiments, and all data were normalized over endogenous β-actin levels. As seen in Fig. 5B, siMLL2 transfection led to nearly an 80% reduction in the MLL2 mRNA level compared with MLL2 mRNA levels in cells transfected with siControl, indicating the efficiency of the transfection method and the specificity of siMLL2. Consistent with the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment, estrogen-dependent activation of cathepsin D mRNA expression was significantly reduced to ∼50% of the control level by siMLL2 transfection (Fig. 5B). We also observed a consistent, but to a lesser extent, reduction of pS2 mRNA, suggesting that MLL2 is differentially required for the mRNA expression of different estrogen-responsive ERα target genes. MLL2 Is Required for Estrogen-dependent Growth of MCF-7 Cells—ERα regulates mammary gland development and is involved in the growth of ER-positive breast tumor cells. Because silencing of MLL2 by siRNA inhibited ERα-mediated transcription in MCF-7 cells, we sought to determine whether estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 cells was affected by depletion of MLL2. In comparison with the transfection of control siRNA, MLL2 siRNA treatment significantly inhibited the estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that MLL2 complex is involved in estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells. In an effort to identify novel molecules involved in ERα mediated signal transduction in mammary gland epithelium, we employed GST-ERα (LBD) to capture its interacting proteins from human breast carcinoma cell line DU4475 nuclear extract, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation to fractionate associated proteins according to their molecular masses. We identified the MLL2 complex, which contains MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5. The MLL2 complex is a novel Set1-like complex in mammalian cells (23Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T.

A. 2005; 102: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The yeast Set1-like complex COMPASS, containing proteins homologous to ASH2 and Trithorax, is involved in chromatin remodeling through the methylation of histone H3 at lysine residue 4. Although yeast only contains one Set1 complex, humans appear to have multiple Set1-like complexes, including the MLL1 complex and ASCOM. A major feature of the MLL1 complex is that it contains tumor suppressor menin, which should not be a component of MLL2 complex as it was not detected by mass spectrometry in our proteins pull downs with GST-ERα (LBD). The MLL2 complex is closely related to ASCOM as they share three components, but we demonstrated that they are distinct complexes. As MLL2 and ASCOM were isolated from different cells, it is possible that different cells possess different Set1-like complex for the ERα signaling pathway. ERα strongly binds to the MLL2 protein through two LXXLL motifs in the region (amino acids 4167–4780) but does not bind to the other three components of the complex, indicating the MLL2 as a key component linking the MLL2 complex with ERα. Full-length MLL2 protein, structurally similar to MLL, contains a SET domain and five PHD fingers. Although SET domains have been shown to exhibit histone methyltransferase activity (23Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T. Wassell R. Dubois G. Mazo A. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Mol.

The function of the PHD domains in MLL family proteins remains to be understood. MLL2 also contains an N-terminal Ring finger domain, often harboring the ubiquitin ligases (36Jackson P.K.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), which is not found in the MLL molecule. It is well established that the activation of ERα is coupled with its degradation (38Alarid E.T. Bakopoulos N. Solodin N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39El Khissiin A. Leclercq G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 40Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M.

Hence, it is intriguing to question whether the MLL2 complex participates in the ligand-induced degradation of ERα through adding ubiquitin to ERα. Because of the gigantic molecular size of MLL2, which spans over 18 kb of mRNA, it is difficult to obtain its full-length cDNA for performing cotransfection to evaluate the effect of overexpression of MLL2 on ERα transcriptional activity. Indeed, silencing MLL2 by MLL2-specific siRNA in MCF-7 cell did impair ERα transcription activity. In addition, the MLL2 fragment, which only contains the region necessary for binding to ERα, acted as a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of the ERα transactivation. Just as the MLL1 complex, which is recruited to the HOX gene promoter (41Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), we observed that components of the MLL2 complex were recruited onto the promoters of ERα target genes directly after ligand induction in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with this observation, suppression of MLL2 by its specific siRNA decreased estrogen-induced expression of ERα target genes. Suppression of MLL2 also inhibited estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a key role of the MLL2 coactivator complex in ERα-mediated signal transduction pathways. It should be noted that certain coactivators such as SRC-3 and PBP are amplified and overexpressed in some breast cancers (42Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y.

Besides, the MLL2 gene was mapped to chromosome band 12q12–13 (27Prasad R. Zhadanov A.B. Sedkov Y. Bullrich F. Druck T. Rallapalli R. Yano T. Alder H. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Mazo A. Canaani E.

https://openalex.org/W2032776853,"Mucolipidosis type IV is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe neurodegeneration, achlorhydria, and visual impairments such as corneal opacity and strabismus. The disease arises due to mutations in a group 2 transient receptor potential (TRP)-related cation channel, TRPML1. Mammals encode two additional TRPML proteins named TRPML2 and TRPML3. Information regarding the propensity of these proteins to multimerize, their subcellular distribution and mechanisms that regulate their trafficking are limited. Here we demonstrate that TRPMLs interact to form homo- and heteromultimers. Moreover, the presence of either TRPML1 or TRPML2 specifically influences the spatial distribution of TRPML3. TRPML1 and TRPML2 homomultimers are lysosomal proteins, whereas TRPML3 homomultimers are in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, TRPML3 localizes to lysosomes when coexpressed with either TRPML1 or TRPML2 and is comparably mislocalized when lysosomal targeting of TRPML1 and TRPML2 is disrupted. Conversely, TRPML3 does not cause retention of TRPML1 or TRPML2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data demonstrate that there is a hierarchy controlling the subcellular distributions of the TRPMLs such that TRPML1 and TRPML2 dictate the localization of TRPML3 and not vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W2107715878,"Additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1, 170 kDa), a mammalian homolog of Drosophila ASX, was identified as a protein that interacts with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). Systematic binding assays showed that the C-terminal nuclear receptor box (LVMQLL) of ASXL1 and the activation function-2 activation domain (AF-2 AD) core of the RAR are critical for ligand-dependent interaction. The interaction was confirmed using in vitro glutathione S-transferase pulldown and in vivo immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. Confocal microscopy revealed that ASXL1 localizes in the nucleus. In addition to the intrinsic transactivation function of ASXL1, its cotransfection together with an RA-responsive luciferase reporter increased the RAR activity. This ASXL1 activity appears to be mediated through the functional cooperation with SRC-1, as shown by GST pulldown, IP, chromatin IP, and transcription assays. In the presence of ASXL1, more acetylated histone H3 was accumulated on the RA-responsive promoter in response to RA. Finally, stable expression of ASXL1 increased the expression of endogenous RA-regulated genes and enhanced the antiproliferative potential of RA. Overall, these results suggest that ASXL1 is a novel coactivator of RAR that cooperates with SRC-1 and implicates it as a potential antitumor target of RA in RA-resistant cancer cells.

Metab. 2001; 12: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These pleiotropic effects of RA are transduced by two families of nuclear receptors (NRs), the retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ). RA-bound receptors associate with cis-acting RA-response elements (RARE), located in the regulatory regions of target genes, and activate gene transcription. Both RARs and RXRs contain two activation functions (AFs) (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar) as follows: the ligand-independent N-terminal AF-1 and the RA-induced AF-2 associated with the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Transcriptional regulation by NRs (including RARs and RXRs) involves the binding and recruitment of coactivators to target gene promoters (4McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In the past decade, a large number of coactivators that associate with retinoid receptors and enhance their ability to activate the transcription of target genes have been cloned and characterized (5Wei L.N.

First, they generate a transcriptionally permissive state within the promoter region by modifying the chromatin structure via the histone acetyltransferase activity of p160 proteins in concert with other factors, including GCN5/PCAF and p300/CBP, the histone methyltransferase activity of CARM1/PRMT1, and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity of SWI/SNF complexes. Second, they recruit the RNA polymerase II complex to the promoter region by bridging the transcriptional machinery to NRs via interactions with either p300/CBP or the TRAP/SMCC/DRIP/ARC complex. These coactivators share a typical receptor interaction region composed of one or more copies of a consensus leucine-rich motif, LXXLL, also called the NR box (15Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies have shown that the NR box is critical for interactions with the ligand-bound AF-2 core domain of NRs, thereby providing a molecular basis for NR-coactivator recruitment and NR activation (16Plevin M.J. Mills M.M. Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of action of RAR (and RXR) coactivators have been well documented at the molecular level, the physiological roles of such coactivators in RA-mediated biological processes are poorly understood. One set of RA-regulated genes is the Hox gene family, which plays a crucial role in development and cell differentiation (17Boncinelli E. Simeone A. Acampora D. Mavilio F. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Most interestingly, Hox genes show a colinear response to RA in cell culture, and each Hox gene has a limited window of sensitivity to RA in animals (20Papalopulu N. Lovell-Badge R. Krumlauf R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5497-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAR binds to RAREs in Hox regulatory regions in the presence of RA and activates Hox gene expression (22Marshall H. Studer M. Popperl H. Aparicio S. Kuroiwa A. Brenner S. Krumlauf R. Nature. 1994; 370: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 23Dupe V. Davenne M. Brocard J. Dolle P. Mark M. Dierich A. Chambon P. Rijli F.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2167-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role of RAR in Hox gene expression, little is known about how RAR regulates Hox gene activation and what other factors are involved. In Drosophila, the Polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (TrxG) group proteins maintain spatial patterns of Hox gene expression in appropriate segments (25Simon J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 26Schumacher A. Magnuson T. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 167-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In general, PcG proteins are repressors that maintain the off-state, whereas TrxG proteins are activators that maintain transcription. Like their Drosophila counterparts, the mammalian PcG/TrxG proteins maintain the correct expression patterns of the Hox genes. In addition, evidence has accumulated that PcG/TrxG proteins play a critical role in certain human cancers. Recent knock-out studies with M33, a mouse PcG, have suggested that mammalian PcG/TrxG participates in the regulation of Hox gene expression in response to RA (27Bel-Vialar S. Core N. Terranova R. Goudot V. Boned A. Djabali M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis underlying the mechanism is not clear. Here we address the hypothesis that unidentified PcG/TrxG proteins are present in mammals and mediate the RA response through a functional association with RAR. To identify such factor(s), we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and found Additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) (28Fisher C.L. Berger J. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a mammalian homolog of Drosophila ASX, which interacts with RAR in the presence of RA. In this study, we demonstrate that mammalian ASXL1 interacts with the AF-2 AD core of RAR (and RXR) through a novel, promiscuous NR box (LVMQLL) and enhances transcriptional activity of the receptors in certain cells. We also show that ASXL1 associates specifically with SRC-1 and cooperates synergistically in the transcriptional activation. In addition, overexpression of ASXL1 in HeLa cells results in increased cytotoxicity of RA. Therefore, ASXL1 may represent a new RAR coactivator that cooperates with SRC-1 functionally and mediates the RA response in vivo. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—HeLa, MCF-7, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic/antimycotic (all from Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For transcription assay, FBS was pretreated with charcoal. Plasmids and Cloning—All cDNAs were constructed according to standard methods and verified by sequencing. The multicopy yeast expression plasmids used in the two-hybrid assays were described elsewhere (29Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. J. Biol.

Deletion mutants of the desired genes were created by PCR amplification and subcloned into the pBTM116 or pASV3. FLAG (2×)-tagged mASXL1 genes were placed on pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Gal4-tagged mASXL1 deletions were placed on pG4MpolyII vector. GFP- and HcRed-tagged constructs were created into pEGFP-C3 and pHcRed (BD Biosciences), respectively. For GST-fused proteins, either pGEX2T or pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Assays—A HeLa cDNA library in the prey plasmid pACT2 (BD Biosciences) was screened for proteins that interact with hRAR using yeast reporter strain L40. Experimental procedures were the same as reported previously (29Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32020-32028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except LexA-fused hRARα DEF was used as bait in this study. To map the RAR/RXR interaction domain in ASXL1, deletion derivatives of ASXL1 were fused with a VP16 AD by subcloning into pASV3, and to also localize the ASXL1-binding motif on the RAR/RXR, AF-2 AD core mutants of RAR DEF or RXR DE were fused with a LexA DBD by subcloning into pBTM116. The level of interaction was determined by quantitative β-galactosidase assays. Glutathione S-transferase Pulldown Assays—Various GST fusions of ASXL1 were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods. The indicated NR proteins were translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Detailed experimental procedures were described previously (29Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32020-32028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that assays were performed in the presence of a ligand in this study. Immunoprecipitation Assays—After transfection with the indicated plasmid DNA, either NIH3T3, MCF-7, HeLa, or HEK293 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 ml of TEN modified buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were percolated by preincubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 15 min, incubated at 1:200 dilution of anti-NRs or SRC-1 antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4°C, and further incubated for 1 h at 4°C with beads. Beads were washed three times with PBS, and the immune complexes were released from the beads by boiling. Following electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sc-8334; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (F-3165; Sigma) (1:1000). Confocal Microscopy—NIH3T3 cells seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates, transfected with GFP-mRAR and/or HcRed-mASXL1. One day after transfection, 1 μm AtRA was treated. Other procedures were the same as reported previously (29Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32020-32028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HeLa or NIH3T3 cells were seeded in a 12-well culture plate at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with Gal4-tk-luciferase or RARE-tk-luciferase. Depending on the experimental conditions, Gal4-ASXL1, Gal4-RAR (or RAR), or Gal4-RXR (or RXR) expression vector was cotransfected. After 4 h of transfection, cells were washed, fed with 5% charcoal-stripped medium, and incubated for an additional 20 h in the presence of ligand. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, collected, resuspended in 100 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (Promega), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Luciferase activity was measured by adding 20 μl of luciferin into 30 μl of lysates using an analytical luminescence luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was determined in 96-well plates that were read at 405 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Stable Transfection and RT-PCR—HeLa cells were transfected with either mASXL1 (or mASXL1ΔPHD) subcloned into the G418-resistant vector pcDNA3 (2× FLAG-tagged) or empty vector in the presence of Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) for 48 h and treated with 1 mg/ml. After 5–7 days, cells were incubated with fresh culture medium containing G418, and G418-resistant colonies were selected for 2 weeks. Cells stably expressing FLAG-mASXL1 (or mASXL1ΔPHD) was verified by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). For RT-PCR, HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-mASXL1 (or mASXL1ΔPHD), grown in DMEM with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS, were treated with 2 μm AtRA as indicated. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random oligo(dT) primers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). RT products were amplified by PCR using pairs of primers as follows: for the RARβ2 coding sequence (421 bp), forward, 5′-TGGATGTTCTGTCAGTGAGTCCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCACTTCAAAGCACTTCTG-3′; for the PDCD4 coding sequence (504 bp), forward, 5′-ATGGATGTAGAAAATGAGCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTAGCTCTCTGGTTTAA-3′; for control GAPDH coding sequence (212 bp), forward, 5′-GTGGATATTGTTGCCATCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GACTCCACGACGTACTCA-3′. MTT Assay—The growth rate of HeLa cells stably expressing mASXL1 (or mASXL1ΔPHD) was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazonium) bromide assay (MTT; Sigma). Briefly, cells were harvested from exponential phase cultures growing in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, counted, plated in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (200-μl cell suspensions, 2 × 103 cells/ml), and treated with medium containing various concentrations of AtRA. Me2SO controls (0.01%) did not affect cell growth. After 48 h, 50 μl of MTT solution (2 mg/ml in PBS) was added to the culture medium, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed, and 200 μl of Me2SO was added. The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of FLAG-mASXL1 expression plasmid and grown in DMEM, 5% charcoal-treated FBS for 1 day before being treated with AtRA (2 μm) for 2 h. Cells were then treated with the cross-linking reagent formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice with cold PBS, and swollen on ice in SDS Lysis Buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min. Nuclei were collected and sonicated on ice. Supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP Dilution Buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). Fragmented chromatin mixture was incubated with 2 μl of anti-FLAG antibody, anti-RAR antibody (Sc-551; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-SRC-1 antibody (Sc-8995; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 antibody (05-614; Upstate), or anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (06-599; Upstate) on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitation was performed using protein A/G Plus-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Cross-linked, precipitated chromatin complexes were then recovered and reversed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate, Chicago). Final DNA pellets were recovered and analyzed by PCR using a pair of primers that encompass the RARβ2 promoter region (288 bp). The primers used were forward 5′-AAGCTCTGTGAGAATCCTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGATCCTACCCCGACGGTG-3′. Isolation of ASXL1—From a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cDNA library, using the ligand-binding domain (or DEF) of hRARα as bait, we obtained partial C-terminal fragments of a protein with an amino acid sequence identical to that of human ASXL1. The longest fragment corresponded to amino acids 659–1541 of human ASXL1 For further studies, we used the mouse full-length cDNA that was kindly provided as a KIAA clone (mKIAA0978 or GenBank™ accession number AK122413) from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Japan). A conserved domain search of data bases revealed a C4HC3 cluster, also known as a PHD, at the extreme C terminus of ASXL1 (Fig. 1A). A BLAST search using the conserved PHD region identified two paralogs of ASXL1 at different chromosome loci, which were designated ASXL2 (30Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 845-850PubMed Google Scholar) and ASXL3 (31Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 1617-1622PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment of the human ASXL family indicated that there were three homologous regions as follows: the ASXN, ASXM, and PHD domains (Fig. 1B). The locations of the ASXL1 clones (B3, C8, A346, and A104) isolated in our screen are shown in Fig. 2A. The yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that like SRC-1, the fragments of ASXL1 interact with RAR in an AtRA-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). As a control, the interaction between NcoR-1 and RAR was abrogated in the presence of AtRA. Like other NR coactivators, ASXL1 could interact with RAR, RXR, TR, ER, and GR in the same manner as SRC-1 in the presence of their cognate ligands (Fig. 2C). Mapping the Interaction Domains between RAR and ASXL1—The AF-2 AD core of NR is critical for the NR-mediated transcriptional activation. It locates in helix 12 of NR LBD and serves to recruit coactivators, such as SRC-1/p160/TIF2 and CBP/p300, in the presence of a ligand. To test whether the AF-2 core AD of RAR/RXR is responsible for the interaction with ASXL1, LexA DBD fusions of RAR or RXR AF-2 mutants and ASXL1 clone A104 harboring a Gal4 AD fusion were introduced into yeast, and the β-galactosidase activities were measured. As indicated in Fig. 3, wild-type RAR DEF and RXR DE showed ligand-dependent interactions with ASXL1, whereas the interaction was abolished in the deletion mutants of the AF-2 AD core, as shown by the dominant negative and most of the AD core point mutants, except the Glu → Gln mutant. Consistently, all mutants except the Glu → Gln mutant showed no transcriptional activity when fused to Gal4 DBD and transfected with the Gal4-responsive luciferase (Gal4-LUC) reporter in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3, B and D). A similar pattern of interaction was observed with SRC-1. These results suggest that the AF-2 AD core of RAR/RXR is involved in the interaction with ASXL1. Because the AF-2 AD core of NR is required for coactivator binding and consequently enhancing the transcriptional activity of NR, ASXL1 may be categorized in the coactivator family. To map the RAR binding domain within ASXL1, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using VP16 AD fusions of ASXL1 and its deletion derivatives, and LexA DBD fusion of RAR DEF in the absence and presence of AtRA. The original clone (A104) isolated from the screen contained amino acid residues 1088–1541. A conserved motif search in this region revealed a single putative NR box (LVMQLL; amino acids 1107–1112). Deletion analysis indicated that ASXL1 fragments with this region retained the interaction, whereas fragments lacking the region abrogated the interaction (Fig. 4A). The expression level of each mutant was nearly equal, as determined by Western analysis using anti-VP16 antibody (data not shown). The amino acid alignment indicated that the C-terminal NR box is well conserved within the ASXL family and in mammals (Fig. 4B). To determine whether amino acid residues in the region are critical for the interaction with ASXL1, four point mutants (combinations of Leu → Ala and Val → Leu) and one deletion were generated by PCR and subcloned into pASV3 vector. As shown in Fig. 4C, all three leucines and the NR box are required for ligand-dependent binding to RAR. Notably, replacement of Val-1083 with Leu resulted in increased interaction with RAR, suggesting that this NR box is evolutionarily promiscuous. Combined, our interaction data suggest that the C-terminal NR box in ASXL1 and the AF-2 AD core in RAR are important for the ligand-dependent interaction between two proteins, at least in yeast. Interaction in Vitro and in Mammalian Cells—To confirm the physical interaction of NRs with ASXL1 in vitro and in mammalian cells, we performed GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. For GST pulldown assays, GST-fused ASXL1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and mixed separately with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled NRs. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data, the 35S-labeled mRAR, mRXR, cTR, or hER was retained by ASXL1 only in the presence of the cognate ligand (Fig. 5A). For IP assays, various cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged mouse full-length ASXL1 expression vector in the absence and presence of NR ligand as indicated. IP with an anti-NR (RAR, RXR, ER, or GR) antibody and subsequent Western blotting (WB) with an anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the ligand-dependent interaction of AXL1 with these NRs in mammalian cells (Fig. 5B). Additional IP in HeLa cells with anti-GFP antibody and subsequent WB with anti-FLAG-antibody revealed that both the wild-type (WT) and the V1083L mutant retained the AtRA-dependent interaction with RAR, whereas the NR box mutant (ΔNR, deletion of amino acids 1107–1112) was defective in RAR binding (Fig. 5C). Again, the interaction of the V1083L mutant was slightly stronger than that of the wild type. These in vitro and in vivo findings confirmed the interaction observed in yeast, further emphasizing that the newly identified NR box is required for the AtRA-dependent interaction of ASXL1 with RAR. To determine the subcellular localization and interaction of ASXL1 and RAR in vivo, GFP-tagged RAR and HcRed-tagged ASXL1 were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells. Confocal microscopy showed that both RAR and ASXL1 were colocalized in the nucleus (Fig. 5D). The presence of AtRA had no effect on the nuclear colocalization of two proteins (data not shown). Effect of ASXL1 on the Transcriptional Activity of RAR—Before investigating the significance of the physical interaction between ASXL1 and RAR, we determined whether ASXL1 alone shows autonomous transcriptional activity when recruited to the promoter. To this end, Gal4 DBD-fused ASXL1 was constructed and cotransfected with the Gal4-LUC reporter into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, overexpression of Gal4-ASXL1 resulted in a great increase in luciferase activity. Similar effects were observed in NIH3T3 and MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Next, the effect of ASXL1 on RAR (or RXR) activity was investigated using three transient transfection experiments. First, cells were transfected with Gal4-RAR DEF (or Gal4-RXR DE), Gal4-LUC reporter, and increasing amounts of ASXL1 expression vector in the presence of AtRA (or 9-cis-RA). In a second set of transfections, RAR (or RXR) and RARE (or RXRE)-tk-luciferase reporters were used instead. In both experiments, ASXL1 strongly enhanced the RA-induced transcriptional activity of RAR (and RXR) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B–D). In the final set of transfections, the expression vector for wild-type ASXL1, ΔNR, or the V1083L mutant was treated under conditions similar to those used for the second set of transfections. No stimulatory effect on RAR activity was observed with the ASXL1 lacking the NR box (ΔNR), which was defective in RAR binding (Fig. 6E). In contrast, an increase in V1083L mutant expression led to even greater enhancement of AtRA-induced transcription activity of RAR than in the wild type. From these transfection assays, we concluded that ASXL1 mediates AtRA-dependent transcriptional activation by RAR, for which the defined NR box is critical. Combined with the interaction data, our results suggest that ASXL1 is a novel member of the RAR coactivator family in certain mammalian cells. Cooperation of ASXL1 with SRC-1—To understand the molecular basis underlying the ASXL1 regulation of RAR activity, we first sought to elucidate the effect of other known coactivators on the autonomous transcription activity of ASXL1. Transfection with increasing amounts of CBP, pCAF, or SRC-1 expression vector revealed that only SRC-1 could potentiate ASXL1 activity (Fig. 7A). The effect of SRC-1 was further demonstrated by other transfection assays. Increasing amounts of either the SRC-1 or the ASXL1 expression plasmid slightly enhanced RAR activity under low level expression conditions, but the expression of both SRC-1 and ASXL1 under the same conditions resulted in a cooperative, synergistic increase in the RA-dependent activity of RAR (Fig. 7B). How does ASXL1 cooperate with SRC-1 to enhance RAR activity? To answer this question, we determined whether ASXL1 can associate with SRC-1. IP with an anti-SRC-1 antibody and subsequent WB with anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated the interaction between two proteins (Fig. 7C). To map the ASXL1 region responsible for SRC-1 binding, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length ASXL1 or two half-fragments (ASX(1–655) and ASX(655–1514)). As shown in Fig. 7D, full-length and ASX(1–655), but not ASX(655–1514), was present in the immunoprecipitate of SRC-1. Further mapping within the N-terminal region indicated that ASX(300–655) is responsible for the interaction with SRC-1 (Fig. 7E). This interaction was confirmed by GST pulldown using GST-AS"

PIKK proteins contain a conserved C-terminal FAT/kinase domain/FATC domain structure. The FATC domain of ATM mediates the interaction between ATM and Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates activation of ATM. Here, we examined whether the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, and Trrap were also able to interact with Tip60. Deletion of the FATC domain of ATM blocked the interaction between ATM and Tip60 and suppressed the activation of ATM kinase activity by DNA damage. Replacement of the FATC domain of ATM with the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, or Trrap restored the activation of ATM and its association with Tip60. These results indicate that the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, Trrap, and ATM are functionally equivalent. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Tip60 is constitutively associated with DNA-PKcs and that the histone acetyltransferase activity associated with DNA-PKcs is up-regulated by DNA damage. When Tip60 expression was suppressed by small interfering RNA, the activation of DNA-PKcs (measured by autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at serine 2056 and threonine 2609) was inhibited, demonstrating a key role for Tip60 in the activation of DNA-PKcs by DNA damage. The conserved FATC domain of PIKK proteins may therefore function as a binding domain for the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase. Further, the ability of Tip60 to regulate the activation of both ATM and DNA-PKcs in response to DNA damage demonstrates that Tip60 is a key component of the DNA damage-signaling network.

In addition to functioning in cellular responses to DNA damage, members of the PIKK family are also involved in the control of cell growth (mTor) (3Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin.

Dev. 2004; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PIKK proteins are defined by the presence of several conserved protein domains. The N terminus of each is predicted to consist of multiple HEAT domains, a protein domain involved in mediating protein-protein interactions (10Perry J. Kleckner N.

Biol. 2004; 145: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The C-terminal of PIKK proteins contains the conserved FAT/kinase domain/FATC structure that is present as a single unit in all known PIKK proteins (12Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The FAT domain is weakly conserved between family members, whereas the kinase domain is highly conserved and is essential for the function of these proteins (2Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The exception is Trrap. Trrap is the core component of NuA4, a multisubunit chromatin-remodeling complex containing both histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and ATPase activity (1Doyon Y. Cote J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This domain is required for the kinase activity of the mTor (16Takahashi T. Hara K. Inoue H. Kawa Y. Tokunaga C. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Kuroda Y. Yonezawa K.

Recently, we demonstrated that the ATM protein forms a complex with the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Following exposure to ionizing radiation, Tip60 acetylates ATM, leading to the activation of ATM kinase activity. Tip60 is therefore a key upstream regulator of the ATM protein. The interaction between ATM and Tip60 is mediated by the FATC domain of ATM, and the introduction of point mutations into the FATC domain of ATM inhibits this interaction (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). One potential function for the FATC domain of ATM is to mediate the association between ATM and Tip60. Because the FATC domain is conserved between PIKK proteins, this predicts that the FATC domain of the PIKK proteins DNA-PKcs, Atr, and Trrap may also mediate association with Tip60. Here, we report on studies designed to test this possibility. Cells and Antibodies—Culture conditions for 293T, HeLa, and GM5849 AT cells and generation and selection of transfected cell lines is described in Ref. 21Turenne G.A. Paul P. Laflair L. Price B.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5100-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. siRNAs T3 (GGAAGCUGCUGAUCGAGUUUU), T4 (GACGUAAGAACAAGAGUUAUU), and green fluorescent protein were obtained from Dharmacon and were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Antibodies used were ATM antibodies 5C2 or 2C1 (Genetex), anti-phosphoserine 1981 (Rockland Biochemicals), antiacetyl lysine or Tip60 antibody (Upstate Biotech), ATM antibody PC116 (Oncogene Science). DNA-PKcs antibody (clone 25–4), Ku70 (clone N3H10), and Ku80 (clone GE2.9.5) were purchased from Neomarkers. Cell survival was as previously described (22Fernandes N. Sun Y. Chen S. Paul P. Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Price B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was carried out using ATM antibody 5C2 (Genetex) and signal detected with Texas Red secondary antibody as previously described (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Kinase Assays, and HAT Assays—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml of aprotinin, 3 μg/ml of leupeptin). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in base buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunokinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed twice in kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2) and incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μm ATP, p53 peptide (2 μg of EPPLSQEAFADLWKK), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 30% acetic acid (20 μl) and an aliquot spotted onto P81 paper. Filters were washed five times in 15% acetic acid, air dried, and counted. For HAT assays, immunoprecipitates were washed twice in HAT assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated in 60 μl of HAT assay buffer supplemented with acetyl-CoA (100 μm) and biotinylated histone H4 peptide (0.5 μg) for 30 min at 30 °C. An aliquot of the reaction was immobilized onto streptavidin plates and acetylation detected using a HAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). ATM Constructs—A Blp1-XhoI fragment encoding the C-terminal and 3′-untranslated region of ATM was subcloned into pBluescript. Point mutations were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis to create restriction sites for SpeI (nucleotide 9279: A9281T/G9282A) and EcoR1 (nucleotide 9373: A8378C). The nucleotide sequence encoding the C-terminus of ATM was then removed by SpeI/EcoR1 digestion. Oligonucleotides containing overhanging SpeI/EcoR1 sites encoding the FATC domains of Trrap, Atr, DNA-PKcs, or that inserted a stop codon to delete the FATC domain, were then inserted. Full-length ATM was digested with Blp1/XhoI to remove the FATC domain and the corresponding new constructs ligated in. Oligonucleotides used were: Deletion, ctagtctgatcttgagtagagg; Atr, ctagtccattaccttatacaagaagctactgatgaaaacttactatgccagatgtatcttggttggactccatatatgtg; Trrap, ctagtgaacaccctggtggccgcggcaaacagcctggacaatctgtgccgcatggaccccgcctggcacccctggctgtg; DNA-PKcs, ctagtgaagtgcctgatggaccaggcaacagaccccaacatccttggcagaacctgggaaggatgggagccctggatgtg. The FATC domain spans the C-terminal 33 amino acids of the ATM, Atr, DNA-PKcs, and Trrap proteins (Fig. 1a), and is conserved in the yeast Tor1 (3Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and mec1 (23Nakada D. Hirano Y. Tanaka Y. Sugimoto K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) proteins. The FATC domain contains a group of invariant amino acids that constitute the conserved core of this domain. Mutation of these highly conserved residues in the FATC domain of ATM prevents the formation of ATM-Tip60 complexes in vivo (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), implying that the FATC domain may mediate the interaction between ATM and Tip60. Here, we examined whether the FATC domains of ATM, Atr, DNA-PKcs, and Trrap were functionally equivalent. The last 24 amino acids, including the most highly conserved region of the FATC domain, were deleted from ATM, creating ATMΔFATC. In addition, 3 chimeric constructs, in which the FATC domain of ATM was replaced with the FATC domain of either Atr, Trrap, or DNA-PKcs, were constructed. Each of these chimeric constructs was expressed in the ATM-deficient GM5849 cell line, derived from an ataxia telangiectasia patient. ATMAtr, ATMDNAPK, and ATMTrrap constructs were expressed at similar levels to ATM, whereas ATMΔFATC was present at lower levels compared with ATM (Fig. 1b). Deletion or replacement of the FATC domain of ATM did not, therefore, significantly destabilize the protein. To examine whether the interaction between ATM and Tip60 required the FATC domain, AT cells expressing either ATM, ATMΔFATC, or the chimeric ATM proteins were immunoprecipitated with ATM antibody and then examined for the presence of co-precipitating Tip60. In AT cells that lack ATM expression no coprecipitating Tip60 was detected (Fig. 1b, Vector). When ATM was expressed in AT cells, Tip60 was readily detected in association with ATM (Fig. 1b). Further, the interaction between ATM and Tip60 was not altered following exposure to the DNA-damaging agent bleomycin. When the FATC domain of ATM was deleted, the interaction between ATM and Tip60 was abolished, indicating that the FATC domain is required to mediate this interaction. However, when the FATC domain of ATM was replaced with the FATC domain of Atr, DNA-PKcs, or Trrap, the interaction between ATM and Tip60 was restored. This demonstrates that the FATC domains of Atr, DNA-PKcs, and Trrap are functionally interchangeable. We next examined whether the chimeric ATM constructs retained the ability to be activated in response to DNA damage. Previously, we showed that the Tip60-dependent acetylation of ATM was essential for the activation of ATM kinase activity (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The activation of ATM kinase activity was measured by monitoring the autophosphorylation of ATM on serine 1981 (7Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar), and the acetylation of ATM was monitored using a pan-specific acetyl-lysine antibody. No ATM acetylation or autophosphorylation was detected in AT cells (Fig. 1b, Vector). Introduction of exogenous ATM into AT cells restored both acetylation and autophosphorylation of ATM in response to bleomycin. Deletion of the FATC domain of ATM, which prevents interaction with Tip60, abolished both the autophosphorylation and acetylation of ATM. When the FATC domain of ATM was replaced with the FATC domain of Atr, DNA-PK, or Trrap, each of the chimeric proteins was acetylated and autophosphorylated in response to bleomycin. Fig. 1b demonstrates that the FATC domain of ATM is required for the DNA damage-induced autophosphorylation and acetylation of the ATM protein. Further, the FATC domains of the Atr, DNA-PKcs, and Trrap proteins can functionally replace the FATC domain of ATM. To ensure that the chimeric ATM proteins retained functional activity and were correctly localized to the nucleus of cells, the cellular location, intrinsic kinase activity, and the ability of each to complement the increased radiosensitivity of AT cells were measured. All of the chimeric constructs, including ATMΔFATC, were localized to the nucleus of the cell (supplemental Fig. S1). In Fig. 2a, immunokinase assays were carried out to monitor intrinsic ATM kinase activity. AT cells immunoprecipitated with ATM antibody displayed no significant ATM kinase activity (Fig. 2a, Vec). AT cells expressing ATM exhibited ATM kinase activity that was increased in response to bleomycin. ATMΔFATC had similar basal kinase activity to full-length ATM; however, ATMΔFATC did not exhibit DNA damage-induced activation of its kinase activity in response to bleomycin (Fig. 2a). Mutations in ATM frequently lead to loss of ATM kinase activity (24Scott S.P. Bendix R. Chen P. Clark R. Dork T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The observation that the ATMΔFATC protein retained basal kinase activity suggests that deletion of the FATC domain (which is adjacent to the kinase domain) did not significantly disrupt the overall protein structure. The inability of ATMΔFATC to increase its kinase activity in response to DNA damage is therefore consistent with the observation that the association of Tip60 with the FATC domain of ATM is required for activation of ATM kinase activity (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). When the FATC domains Atr, DNA-PK, or Trrap were inserted into ATMΔFATC, the activation of ATM kinase activity by bleomycin was restored (Fig. 2a). The ability of ATM to phosphorylate and activate key target proteins is required for ATM to regulate the cell response to ionizing radiation (21Turenne G.A. Paul P. Laflair L. Price B.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5100-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the FATC domain of ATM is adjacent to the kinase domain, the FATC domain may influence the ability of ATM to phosphorylate key target proteins. That is, replacing the FATC domain of ATM with the FATC domain of Atr, Trrap, or DNA-PK may restore activation of ATM kinase activity but prevent ATM from efficiently phosphorylating downstream effector proteins. The failure of the chimeric proteins to correctly phosphorylate downstream effector proteins would prevent ATM from regulating the ability of the cells to survive exposure to ionizing radiation. To test this possibility, we examined whether the chimeric ATM proteins could complement the increased radiosensitivity of AT cells. In Fig. 2b, AT cells were sensitive to ionizing radiation and re-expression of ATM increased cell survival. In contrast, expression of ATMΔFATC had no effect on radiosensitivity, consistent with the failure of this protein to exhibit either increased kinase activity or autophosphorylation of serine 1981 of ATM in response to bleomycin-induced DNA damage (Figs. 1b and 2a). ATMAtr, ATMDNAPK, and ATMTrrap were all able to complement the increased sensitivity of AT cells to ionizing radiation, although they were all slightly less effective then ATM. Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that the FATC domain of ATM is required for the formation of ATM-Tip60 complexes, the activation of ATM kinase activity, and the subsequent phosphorylation and acetylation of ATM. Further, the FATC domains of Trrap, Atr, and DNA-PK are functionally equivalent, implying that the FATC domains of these proteins mediate association with Tip60. Both ATM (Fig. 1b) and Trrap (1Doyon Y. Cote J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 25Boudreault A.A. Cronier D. Selleck W. Lacoste N. Utley R.T.

Cole M.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have been previously found in association with the Tip60 protein. Here, we examined whether DNA-PKcs were also associated with Tip60. To identify the potential association between DNA-PKcs and Tip60, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with Tip60 antibody and co-precipitating DNA-PKcs detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3a). DNA-PKcs was co-precipitated with Tip60 antibody, but not IgG (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 2). The levels of DNA-PKcs in whole cell extracts (lane 5) and immunoprecipitated with DNA-PKcs (lane 4) are shown for comparison. To further confirm this interaction between Tip60 and DNA-PKcs, we utilized HeLa cells that stably express HA-Tip60 (described in Refs. 20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 27Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Fig. 3b demonstrates that immunoprecipitation of HeLa cells expressing HA-Tip60 with DNA-PKcs antibody yielded both DNA-PKcs and HA-Tip60. The reciprocal experiment, in which cells were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, also yielded both HA-Tip60 and DNA-PKcs. Furthermore, this interaction between Tip60 and DNA-PKcs was constitutive, because there was no detectable change in the interaction between DNA-PKcs and HA-Tip60 after exposure to bleomycin (Fig. 3b). The Tip60-DNA-PKcs immune complex also contained associated Ku70 protein (supplemental Fig. 2a), a regulatory subunit of DNA-PKcs. Further, the Tip60-DNA-PKcs complex could not be dissociated by treatment with ethidium bromide (supplemental Fig. S2, panel b), demonstrating that DNA is not required for the interaction between Tip60 and DNA-PK. DNA-PKcs and Tip60 are therefore components of a complex containing the Ku70 regulatory protein in vivo. We also examined whether Atr could also associate with Tip60. However, no significant interaction between endogenous Atr and Tip60 was detected (data not shown). Whether this is a technical problem related to antibody specificity or availability of epitopes, or because Atr does not interact with Tip60 in vivo, is not known. We previously demonstrated that the HAT activity of the Tip60 bound to ATM was specifically activated in response to DNA damage (20Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Because DNA-PKcs is constitutively associated with Tip60, the HAT activity of Tip60 associated with DNA-PK may also be activated in response to DNA damage. Trrap is a key component of NuA4, a chromatin-remodeling complex that contains the Tip60 protein (13Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In yeast, NuA4 is recruited to sites of DNA damage where it may acetylate histones at sites of DNA strand breaks (28Downs J.A. Allard S. Jobin-Robitaille O. Javaheri A. Auger A. Bouchard N. Kron S.J. Jackson S.P. Cote J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Thus, the Tip60 bound to NuA4 (via Trrap) may also be up-regulated in response to DNA damage. We therefore examined whether the HAT activity of the ATM-Tip60, DNA-PKcs-Tip60, and Trrap-Tip60 complexes was increased in response to bleomycin treatment. Tip60, ATM, DNA-PKcs, or Trrap were immunoprecipitated and the associated HAT activity monitored using an N-terminal peptide derived from histone H4 that includes lysine residues specifically acetylated by Tip60 (25Boudreault A.A. Cronier D. Selleck W. Lacoste N. Utley R.T. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Fig. 3c demonstrates the efficient immunoprecipitation of Tip60, ATM, DNA-PKcs, and Trrap from cell extracts, and Fig. 3d details the associated HAT activity. Cells immunoprecipitated with IgG displayed minimal HAT activity (Fig. 3d). To examine the total cellular pool of Tip60, cells were immunoprecipitated with Tip60 antibody, which potentially isolates all cellular Tip60 complexes. Significant amounts of Tip60 HAT activity were detected in unstimulated cells, and the HAT activity of this Tip60 was increased 2.5-fold in cells exposed to bleomycin (Fig. 3d). As we previously reported, ATM has significant amounts of Tip60 HAT activity associated with it, and this activity is increased 6-fold in response to bleomycin (Fig. 3d). DNA-PKcs immunoprecipitated from untreated cells contained minimal amounts of HAT activity; however, exposure to bleomycin caused a significant increase in the HAT activity associated with DNA-PKcs. Because we did not detect any change in the interaction between DNA-PKcs and Tip60 (Fig. 3a), this change presumably reflects activation of the HAT activity of Tip60. The level of DNA-PKcs-associated HAT activity is only a small percentage of the total cellular Tip60 HAT activity and is significantly less than that detected in association with ATM (Fig. 3d). Because DNA-PKcs is a highly abundant cellular protein compared with ATM, this implies that only a small fraction of the DNA-PKcs protein is associated with Tip60, a conclusion supported by the low levels of Tip60 that coprecipitate with DNA-PKcs during immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3, a and b). The effect of bleomycin on the HAT activity of the Trrap complex was also measured. The yeast NuA4 complex contains both Trrap and Tip60 (1Doyon Y. Cote J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and is recruited to sites of DNA damage (28Downs J.A. Allard S. Jobin-Robitaille O. Javaheri A. Auger A. Bouchard N. Kron S.J. Jackson S.P. Cote J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, although the Trrap-Tip60 complex contained significant amounts of HAT activity, this activity was not increased by exposure to the DNA-damaging agent bleomycin (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3d therefore demonstrates that the majority of the increase in Tip60 HAT activity in response to bleomycin is due to activation of the Tip60 associated with ATM. The DNA-PKcs complex makes a small contribution to the increased HAT activity, whereas the Trrap complex does not contribute any significant increase in HAT activity. However, the high levels of basal HAT activity associated with Trrap are consistent with its known role in histone acetylation during normal cell cycle functions (1Doyon Y. Cote J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).

To investigate the gene expression profile during different stages of this process, we performed serial analysis of gene expression, representing a quantitative and qualitative description of all expressed genes. Stellate cells were isolated from human livers and cultured. Serial analysis of gene expression was performed on RNA isolated from quiescent, activated, and transdifferentiated HSC. Comparison of the three resulting transcriptomes showed that less than 5% of all genes changed significantly in expression. Established markers of liver fibrosis showed enhanced expression in accordance with the transdifferentiation process. In addition, induction was seen for several genes not yet recognized to be involved in liver fibrosis, such as insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) and antagonists of bone morphogenic proteins: follistatin and gremlin. The induction of these genes was validated in vivo in mice developing liver fibrosis. The expression of IGFBPs and gremlin was measurable in the livers of these mice, whereas it was low or undetectable in control mice without liver fibrosis. Since gremlin modulates the activity of bone morphogenic growth factors, it may represent a novel pathway and a target for therapeutic intervention and together with IGFBPs it could be a specific marker of liver fibrosis.

Hepatic fibrosis is the common response to most chronic liver injuries like viral hepatitis, parasitic infection, metabolic or autoimmune diseases, congenital abnormalities, and drugs or alcohol abuse (1Friedman S.L.

It is characterized by increased production of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HSC, hepatic stellate cell(s); SAGE, serial analysis of gene expression; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; Mdr2(-/-), disrupted Mdr2 P-glycoprotein gene; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription quantitative PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP-rP, insulin-like growth factor binding protein related protein; BIGH3, transforming growth factor β-induced 68 kDa. like fibril-forming collagens I and III, proteoglycans, fibronectins, and hyaluronic acid (3Gressner A.M. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 293-311PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the primary source of excess ECM accumulation in liver fibrosis. HSC in normal human liver comprise roughly one-third of the nonparenchymal cell population or about 5–8% of total liver cells (4Hautekeete M.L. Geerts A. Virchows. Archiv. 1997; 430: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). HSC are the main storage site for retinoids (5Blomhoff R. Wake K. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and are situated in the sinusoid within the subendothelial space of Disse in close contact with the hepatocytes. During the development of liver fibrosis, HSC undergo a process of activation, resulting in a reduced retinoid storage capacity and transdifferentiation to a myofibroblast-like phenotype that is characterized by expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Actually, this myofibroblast-like phenotype is not limited to the liver but also is a prominent feature of fibrosis in other tissues, including pancreas, kidney, lung, and skin (6Serrini G. Gabbiani O. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The HSC activation process is the result of a complex interplay between the different hepatic cell types through cytokines, growth factors, and oxidative stress signals (7Gressner A.M. J. Hepatol. 1995; 22: 28-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular transformation that develops gradually in vivo can be mimicked in vitro by short term culture of HSC on plastic, providing a model to study the intra- and extracellular determinants that regulate the transformation/activation process. The hallmarks of activation include excessive cellular proliferation and an abundant ECM protein production that is not counteracted by increased ECM degradation (8Arthur M.J. Digestion. 1998; 59: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another major feature of the activation process is the responsiveness of stellate cells to cytokines, resulting in expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (9Wong L. Yamasaki G. Johnson R.J. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1563-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Pinzani M. Gentilini A. Caligiuri A. De Franco R. Pellegrini G. Milani S. Marra F. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 232-239PubMed Google Scholar) and members of TGF-β receptor family. Platelet-derived growth factor is a major mitogen for stellate cells (11Marra F. Choudhury G.G. Pinzani M. Abboud H.E. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1110-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and TGF-β appears to be the primary fibrogenic cytokine (12Casini A. Pinzani M.

Although several genes play a role in the activation of HSC, it is yet not clear which specific genes are responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of the fibrotic response. To identify genes involved in the transformation of HSC into myofibroblasts, we performed transcriptional profiling during different stages of activation. For this purpose, we have chosen to use the technique of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (14Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

This technology provides both a quantitative and qualitative measurement of gene transcription by any cell type or tissue. Under the auspices of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, an analysis of differential gene expression by SAGE in normal and tumor tissues and normal and malignant cell types has been applied (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/and cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/). This project represents over 1.2 × 106 unique SAGE tags from more than 300 libraries of human origin and has been designed to assist in unraveling the molecular basis of cancer. A similar analysis of quiescent and activated HSC might provide insight into the development of hepatic fibrosis and could be used as a paradigm for fibrotic processes in other tissues (1Friedman S.L.

Here, we present a global gene expression pattern in human hepatic stellate cells in three stages: the resting, quiescent phase; activated HSC; and the fully transdifferentiated form, the hepatic myofibroblasts. Subsequently, we have validated the induction of several genes by real time PCR, and in addition we confirmed the induction of these genes in vivo in an animal model of liver fibrosis. Animals—Mdr2(–/–) mice (FVB strain) (15van Nieuwkerk C.M. OudeElferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Ottenhoff R. Tytgat G.N. Dingemans K.P. Van den Bergh Weerman M.A. Offerhaus G.J.A. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 165-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), 4 months old, and congenic control mice were fed with a purified control diet (Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) supplemented with 0.03% sodium cholate (Merck). Food and water were supplied ad libitum. After 6 weeks, the mice were sacrificed, blood was collected, and livers were resected for further analysis. All animal experiments were performed under approved protocols of the Academic Medical Center Committee on Animal Research. Cells and Culture—HSC were isolated from wedge sections of normal human liver unsuitable for transplantation or from tumor-free human liver after partial hepatectomy as previously reported (12Casini A. Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Galli G. Jezequel A.M. Schuppan D. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tiggelman A.M. Boers W. Linthorst C. Brand H.S. Sala M. Chamuleau R.A. J. Hepatol. 1995; 23: 295-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a combined digestion with collagenase/Pronase, HSC were separated from other liver nonparenchymal cells by ultracentrifugation over gradients of Larcoll (Sigma, Zwijndrecht, Netherlands). The percentage of HSC in these isolates was >90% as assessed by transmission microscopy, autofluorescence of vitamin A, and immunofluorescence of vimentin (16Tiggelman A.M. Boers W. Linthorst C. Brand H.S. Sala M. Chamuleau R.A. J. Hepatol. 1995; 23: 295-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immediately after isolation, RNA was extracted for the construction of the SAGE library of quiescent HSC. To obtain activated stellate cells, these cells were cultured for 15 days on plastic culture dishes in modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 0.6 units/ml insulin, 2.0 mmol/liter glutamine, 0.1 mmol/liter nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, antibiotic antifungal solution (Invitrogen), and 20% fetal bovine serum. To obtain fully transdifferentiated hepatic stellate cells or myofibroblasts, the cells were cultured until they had reached passage 6–7. Myofibroblast phenotype was confirmed by detection of vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) using immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies from Dako (Heverlee, Belgium) and Sigma, respectively (not shown). Medium was refreshed twice a week, and at the indicated period RNA was extracted using Trizol (Qiagen). SAGE Procedure—The SAGE libraries were obtained essentially following the SAGE protocol (14Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1995; 270: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Additional information, including graphical presentation of the SAGE technique can be found on the World Wide Web at www.sagenet.org. In short, using 100 μl of oligo(dT) biotinylated beads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen), mRNA was isolated from 5–20 μg of total RNA derived from freshly isolated, 15 days cultured human hepatic stellate cells or completely transdifferentiated human hepatic stellate cells. First and second strand cDNA synthesis were performed using Super Script II (Invitrogen). The double-stranded cDNA was digested with NlaIII for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and divided into two pools. Using T4 ligase, both pools were ligated to two different linkers both containing the BsmFI recognition site. Subsequently, both pools were digested with BsmFI for 1 h at 65 °C. Upon removal of the beads, both pools were mixed and ligated. The resulting ligation product was amplified with 28 cycles of PCR, and amplicons were digested with NlaIII and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel to isolate the 28-bp ditags. The ditags were ligated to form concatemers. Concatemers between 400 and 1000 bp were isolated from an 8% polyacrylamide gel, cloned into the SphI site of pZero (Invitrogen), and transformed into TOP 10F′ electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen). Clones containing inserts between 400 and 1000 bp were selected using colony-PCR with M13 primers and analyzed with NlaIII digestion for the presence of concatemers. Sequencing and Data Analysis—DNA sequencing was done on an ABI 377XL automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using a DYEnamic ET-T7 primer (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using Sequence Analysis Software version 3.4. SAGE data analysis was performed using USAGE V2 software, a World Wide Web-based application developed in the Bioinformatics Laboratory of our Institute (17van Kampen A.H. van Schaik B.D. Pauws E. Michiels E.M. Ruijter J.M. Caron H.N. Versteeg R. Heisterkamp S.H. Leunissen J.A.M. Baas F. van der Mee M. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), for extraction of single tags from sequence data and subsequent identification on the NCBI human gene data base. The three obtained nonnormalized SAGE libraries were evaluated using SAGEstat (18Ruijter J.M. van Kampen A.H. Baas F. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 11: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and differences were evaluated as being statistically significant with p values less than 0.01. To further study tag identification and expression, the NCBI/CGAP/SAGEMAP program was used on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/ or cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/. The normal liver library was obtained from these Web sites at cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/SAGELibInfo?LID=135&ORG=Hs. Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)—RT-qPCR analysis on various stages of stellate cell activation was performed on cDNA prepared for the SAGE analysis using real time PCR (Light Cycler (Roche Applied Science)) with SYBR Green. The primers used are shown in Table 1. To allow comparison with the SAGE data, mRNA expression levels were normalized to the copy number of GAPDH.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used for quantitative real time PCR of cDNA from human stellate cells and myofibroblastsGeneAccession numberPrimer sequenceGAPDHM33197Forward: CCGTCTAGAAAAACCTGCCReverse: AGCCAAATTCGTTGTCATACCα-SMANM_001613Forward: CTGTTCCAGCCATCCTTCATReverse: CGGCTTCATCGTATTCCTGTCollagen Iα1NM_000088Forward: GAACATCACCTACCACTGCAReverse: GTTGGGATGGAGGGAGTTTATIMP-1A10416Forward: AGACGGCCTTCTGCAATTCCReverse: GAAGCCCTTTTCAGAGCCTTGIGFBP-5NM_000599Forward: GAAGCAGTGAAGAAGGACCGReverse: GAATCCTTTGCGGTCACAATGremlinAF110137Forward: GCAAATACCTGAAGCGAGACReverse: CGATGGATATGCAACGACACFollistatinNM_013409Forward: TGTGGTGGACCAGACCAATAReverse: CCGAAATGGAGTTGCAAGATBIGH3M77349Forward: ATCTCCACCATCACCAACReverse: TCCAGAGAGATGATTGCC Open table in a new tab RT-qPCR to Detect Fibrosis Markers in the Mdr2(–/–) Mice—Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers using Trizol reagent (Qiagen) and transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase.

Total tags represent the entire number of tags sequenced for each stage. The unique tags represent the number of the different, distinct, and exclusive tags in the total library. In principal, each unique tag should identify a single gene. However, due to internal priming and variable polyadenylation, more tags can identify the same gene. Most unique tags were detected less than five times, indicating that the expression of the genes recognized by these tags is low. Only a small percentage of the tags was detected more than 10 times: 2.3% in quiescent, 3.6% in partially activated, and 2.8% in the fully transformed cells. The relative distribution of the tags was independent of the magnitude of the sample.TABLE 3Tag distribution in the three stages of transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblasts as measured by serial analysis of gene expressionHSC freshHSC 15 daysMyofibroblastsNumberPercentageaPercentage relative to unique tags.NumberPercentageaPercentage relative to unique tags.NumberPercentageaPercentage relative to unique tags.%%%Total16,18728,48613,353Unique777510010,1881006305100Count 1610578.52724871.14489877.68Count 2-5123615.90211820.79103816.46Count 5-102523.244564.481953.09Count 10-201141.471881.851051.67Count >20680.871781.75691.09a Percentage relative to unique tags. Open table in a new tab Analysis of SAGE Libraries of Human HSC—An important issue is the purity of the freshly isolated HSC. Careful examination of the SAGE data revealed no markers for hepatocytes, endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, or cholangiocytes. The presence of only four tags for CD14 (supplemental Table S1B) at this stage suggests some minor contamination; any effect of this on the transcriptome will be negligible. Statistical analysis of the three nonnormalized SAGE libraries revealed that no significant difference was seen for more than 95% of the unique tags (p < 0.01). This implicates that during activation of human stellate cells and subsequent transformation into myofibroblast, less than 5% of all expressed genes do show a significant change in expression. In the library of the quiescent human stellate cells, 98 genes were identified with a significantly higher expression when compared with both other libraries. Tags representing 28 different genes were only detected in freshly isolated stellate cells (supplemental Table S1A). Their absence in both later stages indicates that the expression of these genes seems to be lost rapidly during stellate cell activation. Six genes are unique for quiescent stellate cells, since these tags were not present in a public SAGE library of a normal liver. For 62 genes, the expression seems to decrease more slowly during stellate cell activation. The number of tags of these genes was reduced in partially activated cells compared with that in quiescent cells, whereas no tags were present in the fully transdifferentiated cells (supplemental Table S1B). All genes of which the expression is lost during activation seem to be suitable as markers of quiescent stellate cells. Some of them may play a role in determining the resting state in stellate cells. In the partially activated stellate cells, 135 genes were significantly higher expressed compared with the quiescent cells. Of these, 31 genes were completely absent in the quiescent state, suggesting that their expression is linked to stellate cell activation (supplemental Table S2A). 220 genes were significantly more highly expressed in the partially activated HSC than in the fully transformed cells; 96 were completely absent in the myofibroblasts (supplemental Table S2B). In the partially activated cells, 19 genes were identified, which were absent both in resting and in completely transdifferentiated stellate cells (supplemental Table S2C). Their increased expression during the transition state indicates that they could play a role in the transdifferentiation of stellate cells. Five tags identified in the partially activated stellate cells were not present in a public SAGE library of a normal liver, suggesting that they are specific for this cell type. Finally, in the fully transformed HSC, expression of 83 genes was significantly different from that in both other stages. Of these, 49 tags (supplemental Table S3A) were only detected in the myofibroblasts. Apparently, the myofibroblast have a particular phenotype, since 37 tags present in these cells were not found in a SAGE data base of a normal liver. Tags representing 19 different genes were not expressed in quiescent stellate cells but had a low expression in the partially activated stellate cells as shown in supplemental Table S3B. The gradual up-regulation of these genes suggests that they may have a role in the activation of these cells. 12 of these tags were not found in normal liver, again indicating the particular character of hepatic myofibroblasts. All genes expressed exclusively in the myofibroblasts could play a role in phenotyping these fully transdifferentiated stellate cells. Markers of Activation of HSC—To validate our SAGE libraries, we evaluated the expression of known markers of activated stellate cells, including collagens, enzymes involved in matrix remodeling like urokinase plasminogen activator and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, and genes coding for cytoskeletal proteins like actin β and γ, vimentin, and α-smooth muscle actin. As shown in Table 4, the expression of most of the established markers of fibrosis did increase upon activation (in particular the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and -3 and their inhibitors TIMP-1 and -2), whereas MMP-2 did not display a difference in expression. The up-regulation in the myofibroblasts of procollagen proline 4-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of collagens, is in agreement with the increased matrix production occurring in fibrotic liver. In a SAGE library of a normal human liver composed of total 66,308 tags, of which 15,496 are unique, the expression of all these genes was much lower (see Table 4). Even when taking into account that only a few percent of mRNA from total liver will be derived from stellate cells, this small number of tags indicates that the expression of these genes is low in nonactivated stellate cells present in normal liver. The expression of GAPDH, which as a housekeeping gene is used as a reference, is up-regulated 2-fold upon activation.TABLE 4Relative expression of GAPDH and standard markers for transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblastsGeneExpression levelaNormalized to number of tags per 100,000.HSC freshHSC 15 daysMyofibroblastsLiverGAPDH465843764170Collagen I α12275038533Collagen I α21041767780Collagen III α155494366Collagen VI α1559832714Collagen VI α2043663Collagen VI α300220TIMP-131184122TIMP-273141905MMP-1001120MMP-23725243MMP-300220P4HB01815740uPA00220pAI431371212α-SMA731551422Vimentin86601572Actin β9822156220Actin γ111610927712Actin γ264602a Normalized to number of tags per 100,000. Open table in a new tab Potential Novel Markers of HSC Transformation—Genes of which the expression was statistically different and which could be identified as new markers of HSC transformation are listed in Table 5. Interesting is the difference in expression of several insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) and IGFBP-related proteins (IGFBP-rP). IGFBP-4, -5, and -6 were all up-regulated during transformation of HSC, and the expression of IGFBP-5 in the hepatic myofibroblasts is extremely high. IGFBP-rP1 (also known as IGFBP-7) showed the highest expression in the midphase of the transdifferentiation process. Other IGFBPs demonstrated a relatively low expression level that did not differ significantly between the three stages (IGFBP-3) or were below the detection limit (like IGFBP-1 and -2).TABLE 5Relative expression of putative novel markers for transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblastsGeneExpression levelaNormalized to number of tags per 100,000.HSC freshHSC 15 daysMyofibroblastsLiverIGFBP-10002IGFBP-200027IGFBP-31214225IGFBP-480137240116IGFBP-56111226355IGFBP-60111270IGFBP-71096199441970Gremlin0183220Follistatin071120TGF-β—induced 68 kDa1101342999TGF-β—induced transcript I00300Disabled 200370a Normalized to number of tags per 100,000. Open table in a new tab Other genes that are induced and seem to be of interest are two members of the TGF-β antagonists, gremlin and follistatin. Gremlin is not present in normal stellate cells, whereas in myofibroblasts, 322 tags were found. This strong induction suggests a potential role of this member of the cysteine knot superfamily in stellate cell activation. Finally, two TGF-β-induced genes are up-regulated during the transdifferentiation process: TGF-β-induced 68 kDa (BIGH3) and TGF-β-induced transcript 1. The latter is not detected in the SAGE libraries of quiescent and partially activated HSC. To identify potential markers for liver fibrosis, we compared our SAGE data for these novel genes with a public SAGE library of a normal human liver. In this library, no tags were present for several markers (see Tables 4 and 5), including collagen Iα2, collagen VIα3, MMP-1, MMP-3, IGFBP-6, gremlin, follistatin, and TGF-β-induced transcript 1, indicating that these proteins are specific for (activated) stellate cells and could be suitable markers for liver fibrosis. Confirmation of SAGE Data by Quantitative PCR—We selected eight genes (one housekeeping gene, three genes that are well known markers of HSC activation, and four genes that could be classified as putative new markers) for validation by RT-qPCR analysis using the SYBR Green I-based LightCycler method. The results of the SAGE data are summarized in Fig. 1, giving the relative expression as found in the three SAGE libraries from quiescent HSC, partially activated HSC, and fully transdifferentiated HSC, respectively. To be able to compare SAGE data (Fig. 1) with the RT-qPCR data (Fig. 2), both are normalized to the relative expression of GAPDH. However, since our SAGE data indicate that the GAPDH expression is induced 2-fold during stellate cell activation, this normalization results in a 2-fold underestimation of the actual effect. The expression of collagen Iα1 and TIMP-1 was highly up-regulated in the hepatic myofibroblasts. The increases by RT-qPCR and SAGE were similar. For all putative new markers tested (IGFBP-5, gremlin, follistatin, and BIGH3), the relative expression measured by RT-qPCR was comparable with that measured by SAGE.FIGURE 2Relative expression profile of standard and putative novel markers for transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblasts as measured by quantitative real time PCR. At the indicated stages of transdifferentiation, mRNA was isolated from the cultured cells, transcribed to cDNA, and analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. All points were measured in quadruplicate with the corresponding S.D. The expression of the different genes is shown relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The following genes were analyzed as standard markers of transdifferentiation: α-SMA, collagen Iα1(Col1α1), and TIMP-1. As putative novel markers of transdifferentiation, the following genes were analyzed: IGFBP-5, gremlin, follistatin (FST), and BIGH3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression in Vivo of Putative New Markers of Fibrosis—The novel markers of liver fibrosis identified by SAGE were present in mRNA isolated from human stellate cells culture"

However, poor intestinal absorption of intact proteins is a major challenge. To overcome this limitation, we investigate here the concept of receptor-mediated oral delivery of chloroplast-expressed foreign proteins. Therefore, the transmucosal carrier cholera toxin B-subunit and green fluorescent protein (CTB-GFP), separated by a furin cleavage site, was expressed via the tobacco chloroplast genome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analyses confirmed site-specific transgene integration and homoplasmy. Immunoblot analysis and ELISA confirmed expression of monomeric and pentameric forms of CTB-GFP, up to 21.3% of total soluble proteins. An in vitro furin cleavage assay confirmed integrity of the engineered furin cleavage site, and a GM1 binding assay confirmed the functionality of CTB-GFP pentamers. Following oral administration of CTB-GFP expressing leaf material to mice, GFP was observed in the mice intestinal mucosa, liver, and spleen in fluorescence and immunohistochemical studies, while CTB remained in the intestinal cell. This report of receptor-mediated oral delivery of a foreign protein into the circulatory system opens the door for low-cost production and delivery of human therapeutic proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2093396134,"Recently, we have shown that macrophage uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol accumulation can occur by nonreceptor mediated fluid-phase macropinocytosis when macrophages are differentiated from human monocytes in human serum and the macrophages are activated by stimulation of protein kinase C (Kruth, H. S., Jones, N. L., Huang, W., Zhao, B., Ishii, I., Chang, J., Combs, C. A., Malide, D., and Zhang, W. Y. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2352–2360). Differentiation of human monocytes in human serum produces a distinct macrophage phenotype. In this study, we examined the effect on LDL uptake of an alternative macrophage differentiation phenotype. Differentiation of macrophages from human monocytes in fetal bovine serum with macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) produced a macrophage phenotype demonstrating constitutive fluid-phase uptake of native LDL leading to macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Fluid-phase endocytosis of LDL by M-CSF human macrophages showed non-saturable uptake of LDL that did not down-regulate over 48 h. LDL uptake was mediated by continuous actin-dependent macropinocytosis of LDL by these M-CSF-differentiated macrophages. M-CSF is a cytokine present within atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, macropinocytosis of LDL by macrophages differentiated from monocytes under the influence of M-CSF is a plausible mechanism to account for macrophage foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions. This mechanism of macrophage foam cell formation does not depend on LDL modification or macrophage receptors.

Macrophage cholesterol accumulation is considered a critical process in the development of atherosclerotic plaques, the cause of most heart attacks and strokes.

Macrophage cholesterol accumulation converts the macrophages into so-called foam cells and stimulates the macrophages to secrete proteases and tissue factor that contribute to plaque rupture and thrombosis, respectively (1Galis Z.S.

Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 246-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because incubation of macrophages with native LDL did not produce substantial macrophage cholesterol accumulation in past studies, it was proposed that LDL modifications that promote recognition and uptake of large amounts of the modified LDL by macrophage scavenger receptors is required to generate macrophage foam cells (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LDL oxidation has been the most commonly studied LDL modification that stimulates LDL uptake (5Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages with protein kinase C activators such as PMA stimulates fluid-phase macropinocytosis of native (unmodified) LDL (6Kruth H.S.

This results in uptake of LDL in amounts directly proportional to its concentration in the medium. As a result, incubation of human monocyte-derived macrophages with LDL at concentrations similar to those that exist within the normal vessel wall (0.7–2.7 mg/ml) (8Smith E.B. Ashall C. Biochim.

Human monocytes can differentiate into macrophage phenotypes with different morphology and function depending on the culture conditions and differentiation factors included in the culture medium (11Akagawa K.S. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 76: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the studies discussed above, we differentiated human monocytes into macrophages in the presence of human serum, producing the macrophage phenotype that resembles a “fried egg.” In the present study, we show that differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages in the presence of fetal bovine serum with added M-CSF produces a macrophage phenotype having an elongated shape and showing high levels of constitutive macropinocytosis not dependent on activation of the macrophage with PMA. The constitutive macropinocytosis in these macrophages mediated fluid-phase uptake of LDL causing high levels of macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Thus, our findings demonstrate a macrophage model system showing constitutive cholesterol accumulation without the need for either LDL modification or LDL uptake mediated by receptors. Culture of Human Monocyte-derived Macrophages—Human monocytes were purified with counterflow centrifugal elutriation of mononuclear cells obtained by monocytopheresis of normal human donors. M-CSF monocyte-derived macrophage cultures were begun with the elutriated human monocytes suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (MediaTech) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) seeded in 6-well plates (MatTek and Corning) at a density of 4 × 105 monocytes/cm2. After 2-h incubation in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C, the attached monocytes were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 and then incubated with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 50 ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech), and 25 ng/ml interleukin-10 (IL-10) (PeproTech) (12Hashimoto S. Yamada M. Motoyoshi K. Akagawa K.S. Blood. 1997; 89: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was exchanged with fresh medium on day 6, and monocyte-derived macrophages were used for experiments on day 8. Elutriated human monocytes differentiated in human serum were cultured in 12-well plates as described previously (6Kruth H.S. Huang W. Ishii I. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34573-34580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For experiments, monocyte-derived macrophage cultures (about 0.25 mg of protein/well and 0.15 mg of protein/well for human serum and FBS+M-CSF+IL-10 cultured macrophages, respectively) were first rinsed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640. Cultures were incubated in RPMI 1640 without serum with the indicated concentration of LDL and the reagents specified in each experiment. For monocytes differentiated in FBS+M-CSF+IL-10, experimental incubations with these monocyte-derived macrophages were carried out with M-CSF and IL-10 added to RPMI 1640 medium. Preparation of Lipoproteins for Use in Experiments—Before use, human lipoproteins, LDL, oxidized LDL, and HDL (Intracel) were dialyzed against 1 liter of 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) for 12 h at 4 °C, then against RPMI 1640 medium (2 changes, 1 liter/each change) for 24 h. LDL was incubated 24 h at 37 °C with 5 μm CuSO4 to prepare oxidized LDL as described previously (13Mori M. Itabe H. Higashi Y. Fujimoto Y. Shiomi M. Yoshizumi M. Ouchi Y. Takano T. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1771-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Human 125I-LDL (Biomedical Technologies) was dialyzed against 0.15m sodium chloride and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) over 36 h at 4 °C (three changes, 1 liter/each change). All dialysis was carried out with Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off). After dialysis, lipoproteins were sterilized by passage through a 0.45-μm (pore size) low protein-binding filter (Gelman Acrodisc). 125I-LDL specific activity was adjusted to 2.25 × 10–5 μCi/ng by adding unlabeled LDL. LDL concentration is expressed in terms of protein. Assays of 125I-LDL Cell Association and Degradation—Macrophage cell association and degradation of 125I-LDL were determined according to the methods of Goldstein et al. (15Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein degradation was quantified by measurement of trichloroacetic acid-soluble organic iodide radioactivity in supernatants of culture media samples that were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Values obtained in the absence of cells were <5% of those values obtained with cells. Cell-associated 125I-LDL was determined by rinsing macrophages three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) plus Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by 3 times with DPBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+ all at 4 °C. Then, macrophages were dissolved overnight in 0.1 n NaOH at 37 °C. Aliquots of cell samples were assayed for 125I radioactivity with a γ counter. Values were subtracted for 125I radioactivity determined for wells incubated with 125I-LDL but without macrophages. These values were <1% of the cell-associated 125I-LDL. Determination of Fluid-phase Endocytosis—125I-BSA (MP Biomedicals) cell association and degradation by macrophages was determined similar to 125I-LDL described above and served as a means to determine fluid-phase uptake by the macrophages. Before incubations, 125I-BSA specific activity was adjusted to 2.25 × 10–5 μCi/ng by adding unlabeled BSA. Macrophages were incubated 24 h with varying concentrations of 125I-BSA (31, 62, 125, and 250 μg/ml) to show non-saturable uptake of BSA. Macrophages were incubated with 250 μg/ml 125I-BSA in incubations parallel to 125I-LDL when fluid-phase uptake was to be determined. The amount of fluid that macrophages ingested was calculated by dividing the total amount of 125I-BSA taken up by the macrophages (i.e. cell-associated plus degraded 125I-BSA) by the concentration of 125I-BSA added to the medium (i.e. 250 μg/ml). Assay of Cholesterol and Protein Contents of Macrophages—After incubations, macrophages were rinsed three times each with DPBS plus Mg2+, Ca2+, and 0.2% BSA and then DPBS plus Mg2+ and Ca2+. Macrophages were harvested from wells by scraping into 1 ml distilled water and then processed as described previously (16Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from an aliquot of cell suspension using the Folch method (17Folch J. Lees M. Sloan Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cholesterol content of macrophages was determined according to the fluorometric method of Gamble et al. (18Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage protein content was determined on another aliquot of cell suspension by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Time-lapse Microscopy—Time-lapse phase-contrast video microscopy was carried out by observing macrophages grown in a T-25 flask with a 10× long working distance planfluor objective lens (0.3 N.A.) mounted on an Olympus L70 inverted microscope. 5% CO2/95% hydrated air and 37 °C were maintained in an enclosed chamber during recording from the macrophages. Analogue video images were recorded using a Dage-MTI CD100 camera and JVC BR9000-U VHS video recorder. Video images were captured and digitized using MGI VideoWave software. When viewed at standard rates (i.e. 30 frames/s), the movie prepared from the time-lapse phase-contrast video is 180× real time. Electron Microscopic Analysis of Macrophages—For immunolabeling of LDL, macrophages were seeded in 6-well culture plates. After incubation with LDL, macrophages were fixed, embedded in LR White resin, and prepared for immunogold labeling as described previously (16Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that 1% dry skim milk instead of 1% BSA was used to block nonspecific staining. LDL was labeled by incubating thin sections with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit anti-human LDL antibody (catalog number BT-905, Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) and then with a 1:10 dilution of 10 nm gold-conjugated goat F(ab)2 anti-rabbit IgG (BBInternational). For controls, the rabbit anti-human LDL antibody was substituted with the same concentration of purified rabbit IgG. This control showed no labeling. Detection of Cell Death—Following a 1-day incubation with 2 mg/ml LDL or 125 μg/ml oxidized LDL, macrophages were rinsed once with serum-free culture medium, then the macrophages were incubated 30 min at 37°C with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, 100 ng/ml annexin V FITC conjugate (Sigma, catalog number A9210) (to detect apoptosis), and 1 μg/ml propidium iodine (to detect cell membrane permeability). The cells were rinsed once with PBS immediately. The annexin V FITC conjugate and propidium iodide bound to the macrophages were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (excitation at 460–490 nm and emission at 515 nm for FITC; excitation at 520–550 nm and emission at 580 nm for propidium iodide). Five predetermined microscopic fields for each of three culture wells were photographed by phase and fluorescence microscopy, and macrophage staining was assessed. Averages of 735 ± 181, 672 ± 173, and 339 ± 66 macrophages were counted in each photographed field for control, LDL, and oxidized LDL-incubated cultures, respectively. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean. The means were determined from three culture wells for each data point. Standard error bars are not shown where the error range is smaller than the symbol size. Statistical comparisons of means were made using the Student's t statistic (unpaired). A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. We first determined whether human monocytes differentiated with M-CSF and IL-10 (hereafter referred to as M-CSF macrophages) metabolized LDL differently from monocytes differentiated in human serum. Unexpectedly, M-CSF-differentiated macrophages showed an extremely high level of 125I-LDL uptake (35 times greater) compared with human serum differentiated macrophages (Fig. 1). Greater than 90% percent of the 125I-LDL that was taken up by the M-CSF macrophages was degraded. Degradation of the 125I-LDL was not due to extracellular proteolysis of the 125I-LDL, as incubation of M-CSF macrophage conditioned media with 125I-LDL did not cause degradation of 125I-LDL. Furthermore, 125I-LDL degradation was inhibited 83% when the lysosomal inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, was added to incubations of macrophages with 125I-LDL. Macrophage uptake of 125I-LDL was linear over a 48-h incubation (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Time course of 125I-LDL uptake by M-CSF-differentiated macrophages. Monocytes were differentiated 7 days in FBS containing M-CSF and IL-10, then the differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated in serum-free medium, M-CSF, and IL-10 for the indicated times with 500 μg/ml 125I-LDL. 125I-LDL uptake was determined as the sum of cell-associated and degraded 125I-LDL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Macrophage uptake of LDL led to macrophage accumulation of cholesterol. Incubation of M-CSF macrophages with concentrations of LDL up to 4 mg/ml did not show saturation of cholesterol accumulation (Fig. 3). This resulted in a tripling of macrophage cholesterol content to a level that exceeded 300 nmol/mg of cell protein with almost 50% of the cholesterol esterified. When macrophages were incubated 24 h with HDL and LDL at similar total cholesterol concentrations (i.e. 7928 nmol/ml equivalent to 9.5 mg/ml for HDL and 2 mg of protein/ml for LDL), the macrophages accumulated 252 and 485 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein, respectively, showing that cholesterol accumulation was not specific for LDL. Monocytes were routinely differentiated in the presence of M-CSF plus IL-10 because addition of IL-10 has been shown to produce a more homogeneous macrophage culture assessed by morphology and to augment the growth and differentiation of human monocytes stimulated with M-CSF (12Hashimoto S. Yamada M. Motoyoshi K. Akagawa K.S. Blood. 1997; 89: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monocyte-derived macrophages differentiated with M-CSF alone also showed cholesterol accumulation during incubation with LDL. However, these macrophages accumulated 29% less cholesterol than macrophages differentiated from monocytes with M-CSF and IL-10. Monocytes maintained in FBS without M-CSF did not survive as reported previously (11Akagawa K.S. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 76: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Macrophage uptake of 125I-LDL was not inhibited by addition of C7 antibody that blocks binding of LDL to the LDL receptor (20Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). Methylation of LDL also blocks its binding to the LDL receptor (21Schechter I. Fogelman A.M. Haberland M.E. Seager J. Hokom M. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence that LDL uptake was not mediated by the LDL receptor was shown by the finding that methylation of LDL did not decrease LDL-induced cholesterol accumulation (data not shown).TABLE 1Effect of competitive inhibitors on 125I-LDL uptake by macrophagesCompetitorTotal 125I-LDL uptakeμg of protein/mg of cell proteinAnti-LDL receptor C7 monoclonal antibody (0.9 mg/ml)32 ± 2Control IgG (0.9 mg/ml)31 ± 1LDL (2 mg/ml)39 ± 3HDL (2 mg/ml)31 ± 2 Open table in a new tab To learn more about the mechanism of macrophage LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation, we examined the concentration dependence of 125I-LDL uptake by the M-CSF macrophages. We observed that uptake of 125I-LDL was linear not showing any evidence of saturation with 125I-LDL concentrations up to as high as 250 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Thus, 125I-LDL uptake was directly proportional to its concentration in the medium. These results suggested that the mechanism of LDL uptake was fluid-phase rather than receptor-mediated endocytosis. Next, we determined the amount of macrophage fluid uptake to learn whether macrophage uptake of LDL in the fluid phase could account for 125I-LDL uptake by macrophages. There is no known receptor-mediated uptake of BSA by macrophages, and so we used this probe to measure macrophage fluid uptake as was done previously for fibroblasts (22Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we validated that uptake of 125I-BSA was linear and did not show saturation with increasing concentration. This was the case as M-CSF macrophage uptake of 125I-BSA was linear up to the highest concentration tested, 250 μg/ml (data not shown). One set of M-CSF macrophages was incubated with 250 μg/ml of 125I-BSA, and another set of macrophages was incubated with 500 μg/ml 125I-LDL both for 24 h. The total uptake (i.e. cell-associated and degraded) of the fluid-phase marker, 125I-BSA, was determined to be 125 ± 19 μg/mg cell protein/24 h (>90% of the BSA taken up was degraded). The fluid uptake that would have produced this amount of 125I-BSA uptake was 500 μl/mg cell protein/24 h. This amount of macrophage fluid uptake would have delivered 250 ± 23 μg LDL protein/mg cell protein/24 h. The actual 125I-LDL uptake was 230 ± 32 μg of LDL protein/mg of cell protein/24 h, a value not significantly different from the predicted value. Thus, macrophage fluid endocytosis could account for the entire amount of 125I-LDL that these macrophages took up. Consistent with the finding that the entire 125I-LDL uptake could be accounted for by fluid-phase endocytosis was the finding that a 20-fold excess of LDL or HDL did not inhibit 125I-LDL uptake by macrophages (Table 1). Fluid-phase endocytosis can occur by either micropinocytosis in small vesicles less than 100 nm or macropinocytosis in large vacuoles typically greater than 500 nm. Because micropinocytosis is usually actin-independent and macropinocytosis is actin-dependent, we examined the effect of cytochalasin D, an agent that interferes with actin function, on macrophage LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation. Cytochalasin D blocked by greater than 95% both macrophage 125I-LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation (Fig. 5) suggesting that macrophage LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation were mediated by fluid-phase macropinocytosis of LDL. Time-lapse phase microscopic analysis of living M-CSF macrophages showed that macropinosomes were constitutively generated in these macrophages, and as a result, the macrophages contained numerous macropinosomes (Fig. 6A and movie in the supplemental material). We next confirmed that LDL was being internalized within the macropinosomes by examining with the electron microscope macrophages incubated with 2 mg/ml LDL for 20 min and then immunogold labeled for LDL. Macrophages incubated with LDL showed anti-LDL immunogold labeling of LDL scattered throughout the macropinosomes (Fig. 6B). Control macrophages incubated without LDL showed no anti-LDL immunogold labeling (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6Demonstration of LDL uptake in M-CSF-differentiated macrophage macropinosomes. Monocytes were differentiated 7 days in FBS containing M-CSF and IL-10. A is a phase-contrast photomicrograph of the monocyte-derived macrophages and shows many phase-lucent vacuoles greater than 500 nm throughout the macrophage cytoplasm. Time-lapse microscopy of these macrophages showed that the vacuoles were macropinosomes continuously formed within the macrophages (see movie in the supplemental material). B shows immunogold-labeled LDL dispersed within a macropinosome of macrophages incubated with 2 mg/ml LDL for 20 min. C shows the absence of LDL in macropinosomes of control macrophages incubated without LDL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we reported that monocytes differentiated to macrophages in human serum showed PMA-stimulated macropinocytosis of LDL that was protein kinase C-dependent and could be inhibited with the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203X. However, GF109203X (4 μm) did not inhibit M-CSF macrophage uptake of 125I-LDL (500 μg/ml) during a 24-h incubation. This showed that the constitutive macropinocytosis of LDL by M-CSF macrophages was not protein kinase C-dependent (data not shown). Finally, we examined whether macrophage cholesterol accumulation mediated by macropinocytosis was cytotoxic. Although incubation of macrophages for 24 h with 2 mg/ml LDL enriched macrophages with both unesterified and esterified cholesterol (net accumulation of 115 and 116 nmol/mg of cell protein, respectively), cholesterol accumulation did not induce apoptosis or necrosis of the macrophages. Only 1.2 ± 0.8% of macrophages showed staining with annexin V FITC conjugate (to detect apoptosis) following incubation with LDL. This was not different from the labeling frequency of control macrophages, which was 1.7 ± 1.5%. Also, neither control nor LDL-incubated macrophages showed staining with propidium iodide (to detect cell membrane permeability). In contrast, following incubation with extensively oxidized LDL, most macrophages (86 ± 7%) stained with annexin V FITC conjugate, and some macrophages (12 ± 6%) stained with propidium iodide consistent with the known apoptosis inducing effect of oxidized LDL on cells including human macrophages (23Marchant C.E. Law N.S. van der Veen C. Hardwick S.J. Carpenter K.L. Mitchinson M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Hessler J.R. Morel D.W. Lewis L.J. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 215-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have demonstrated a plausible model for macrophage foam cell formation that does not depend on LDL modification or macrophage receptors. Differentiation of human monocytes in the presence of FBS and M-CSF produces a macrophage phenotype that shows high levels of constitutive macropinocytosis. Because of the constitutive macropinocytosis in these M-CSF-differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages, the macrophages can take up large amounts of LDL and accumulate high levels of cholesterol. LDL uptake was directly proportional to its concentration consistent with LDL uptake occurring in the fluid-phase independent of any receptor. Because fluid-phase endocytosis is non-selective, any lipoprotein could be taken up by this pathway and produce macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Indeed, we found that incubation of macrophages with HDL also produced cholesterol accumulation. The amount of cholesterol accumulation that occurred with HDL was less than what accumulated with a similar amount of LDL cholesterol, presumably because HDL is known to stimulate cholesterol efflux from macrophages. In contrast to LDL, it is unlikely that HDL can contribute substantially to macrophage cholesterol accumulation in the vessel wall. This is because while LDL concentration in the vessel wall can exceed 1 mg protein/ml, the vessel wall concentration of HDL is only about 12% of the LDL concentration (8Smith E.B. Ashall C. Biochim.

Earlier studies showed non-saturable LDL uptake by cultured human fibroblasts that was attributed to fluid-phase endocytosis in these cells (22Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1976; 191: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Because fibroblasts are not known to carry out macropinocytosis, the fluid-phase endocytosis in those cells was most likely mediated by micropinocytosis. However, LDL taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis in fibroblasts does not cause cholesterol accumulation because the cholesterol delivered by LDL is excreted by the fibroblasts (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1976; 191: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have shown that LDL entering macrophages by fluid-phase endocytosis mediated by macropinocytosis does cause cholesterol accumulation. It remains to be determined whether this difference in cholesterol trafficking is because of a difference in processing of cholesterol delivered by macropinocytosis and micropinocytosis or because of a difference in fibroblast and macrophage processing of cholesterol delivered to these cells. Macrophage macropinocytosis delivered fluid (and as a result LDL cholesterol) at a rate some 18 times that shown by fibroblasts (calculated from Table 5 in Ref. 22Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this may be another factor contributing to macrophage accumulation of cholesterol delivered by fluid-phase endocytosis. Receptor-independent uptake of LDL not only occurs in cultured cells but occurs in animals and humans where it contributes substantially to LDL metabolism and tissue cholesterol balance (28Spady D.K. Huettinger M. Bilheimer D.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 32-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shepherd J. Bicker S. Lorimer A.R. Packard C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 999-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reticuloendothelial system in which macrophages are a prominent cell type functions in receptor-independent catabolism of LDL (30Slater H.R. Packard C.J. Shepherd J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 307-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that macrophage receptor-independent macropinocytotic uptake of LDL that we have demonstrated in vitro contributes to receptor-independent catabolism of LDL in vivo. In previous work, we have shown that when monocytes are differentiated into macrophages using human serum, they do not show constitutive macropinocytosis. Rather, these macrophages show macropinocytosis of LDL causing foam cell formation when protein kinase C is stimulated in these macrophages (6Kruth H.S. Huang W. Ishii I. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34573-34580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Kruth H.S. Jones N.L. Huang W. Zhao B. Ishii I. Chang J. Combs C.A. Malide D. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2352-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, human monocyte-derived macrophages can show two distinct phenotypes with respect to foam cell formation mediated by fluid-phase macropinocytosis of LDL: macropinocytosis can be either constitutive as in macrophages differentiated from monocytes in M-CSF and FBS or inducible as in macrophages differentiated from monocytes in human serum. The signaling that mediates macropinocytosis in these two macrophage phenotypes also appears to be different because macropinocytosis in the M-CSF-differentiated macrophages was not protein kinase C-dependent. M-CSF acutely stimulates macropinocytosis when added to mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (31Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the case of the human monocyte-derived macrophages differentiated in the presence of M-CSF, macropinocytosis did not depend on the continuous presence of exogenously supplied M-CSF. Macropinocytosis and cholesterol accumulation during incubation with LDL continued after removal of the exogenous M-CSF. 3B. Zhao and H. S. Kruth, unpublished data. This may be because the macrophages secrete M-CSF or because M-CSF functions differently in mouse and human macrophages, acutely stimulating macropinocytosis in the former but chronically stimulating macropinocytosis in the latter through a differentiation process. Accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in macrophages has been associated with triggering of macrophage apoptosis (32Kellner-Weibel G. Jerome W.G. Small D.M. Warner G.J. Stoltenborg J.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, macrophage cholesterol accumulation, which included a substantial increase in unesterified cholesterol content, did not induce apoptosis in our study. Recent work shows that other factors such as scavenger receptor engagement and location of accumulated unesterified cholesterol are important factors in triggering apoptosis (34Devries-Seimon T.

Differentiation of human monocytes with M-CSF added to FBS results in development of a macrophage phenotype that shows constitutive macropinocytosis-mediating uptake of large amounts of LDL without requiring LDL modification. M-CSF is an important factor necessary for atherosclerotic lesion development in mice (36Qiao J.H. Tripathi J. Mishra N.K. Cai Y. Tripathi S. Wang X.P. Imes S. Fishbein M.C. Clinton S.K. Libby P.

A. 1995; 92: 8264-8268Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Because M-CSF is present in atherosclerotic plaques (38Rosenfeld M.E. Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Ord V.A. Witztum J.L.

Pathol. 1992; 140: 301-316PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that monocytes differentiate into macrophages capable of macropinocytosis in vivo similar to what we have shown here in vitro. A recent report shows that scavenger receptors, which function in macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL, are not necessary for in vivo macrophage foam cell formation (40Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M.

Our finding that macrophage foam cell formation can occur through receptor-independent fluid-phase macropinocytosis helps explain why scavenger receptor function is not necessary for in vivo foam cell formation. Our findings further suggest that receptor-independent uptake of LDL is an important pathway to study for possible discovery of new drugs targeting foam cell formation in atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2057825557,"Gastric epithelial cells liberate prostaglandin E(2) in response to cytokines as part of the process of healing of gastric lesions. Treatment of the rat gastric epithelial cell line RGM1 with transforming growth factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta leads to synergistic release of arachidonate and production of prostaglandin E(2). Results with highly specific and potent phospholipase A(2) inhibitors and with small interfering RNA show that cytosolic phospholipase A(2)-alpha and group IIA secreted phospholipase A(2) contribute to arachidonate release from cytokine-stimulated RGM1 cells. In the late phase of arachidonate release, group IIA secreted phospholipase A(2) is induced (detected at the mRNA and protein levels), and the action of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)-alpha is required for this induction. Results with RGM1 cells and group IIA secreted phospholipase A(2)-transfected HEK293 cells show that the group IIA phospholipase acts prior to externalization from the cells. RGM1 cells also express group XIIA secreted phospholipase A(2), but this enzyme is not regulated by cytokines nor does it contribute to arachidonate release. The other eight secreted phospholipases A(2) were not detected in RGM1 cells at the mRNA level. These results clearly show that cytosolic and group IIA secreted phospholipases A(2) work together to liberate arachidonate from RGM1 cell phospholipids in response to cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2045742636,"BAD is a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is regulated by phosphorylation in response to survival factors. Binding of BAD to mitochondria is thought to be exclusively mediated by its BH3 domain. We show here that BAD binds to lipids with high affinities, predominantly to negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, and cardiolipin, as well as to cholesterol-rich liposomes. Two lipid binding domains (LBD1 and LBD2) with different binding preferences were identified, both located in the C-terminal part of the BAD protein. BAD facilitates membrane translocation of Bcl-XL in a process that requires LBD2. Integrity of LBD1 and LBD2 is also required for proapoptotic activity in vivo. Phosphorylation of BAD does not affect membrane binding but renders BAD susceptible to membrane extraction by 14-3-3 proteins. BAD can be removed efficiently by 14-3-3ζ, -η, -τ and lesxs efficiently by other 14-3-3 isoforms. The assembled BAD·14-3-3 complex exhibited high affinity for cholesterol-rich liposomes but low affinity for mitochondrial membranes. We conclude that BAD is a membrane-associated protein that has the hallmarks of a receptor rather than a ligand. Lipid binding is essential for the proapoptotic function of BAD in vivo. The data support a model in which BAD shuttles in a phosphorylation-dependent manner between mitochondria and other membranes and where 14-3-3 is a key regulator of this relocation.

The dynamic interaction of BAD with membranes is tied to activation and membrane translocation of Bcl-XL. Programmed cell death is a conserved pathway essential for all multicellular organisms. Many growth factors and cytokines, such as interleukin-3, function as survival factors that suppress apoptosis. Proteins of the Bcl-2 family represent crucial players in the regulation of apoptosis. Whereas some members prevent cell death (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL), others exhibit proapoptotic activities (e.g. Bax and Bak). Bcl-2 family members are characterized by conserved domains designated Bcl-2 homology domains 1-4 (BH1-BH4). 3The abbreviations used are: BH1-BH4, Bcl-2 homology domains 1-4, respectively; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CL, cardiolipin; CNF, cytotoxic necrotizing factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, lipid binding domain; PA, phosphatidic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phoshatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; SM, sphingomyelin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BADwt, wild type BAD; RU, response units; NGF, neural growth factor.

The balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins can be influenced by a third group of proteins termed BH3-only proteins (e.g. Bik, Bid, Bim, Puma, BAD, and Noxa). BAD promotes apoptosis by forming heterodimers with the survival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Complex formation prevents Bcl-2/Bcl-XL from binding with Bax (2Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H.

In fact in the absence of Bag-1 there is a marked reduction of Akt and RAF at mitochondria and Ser-136 of BAD remains specifically unphosphorylated. Presumably, the BAD phosphorylation complex is not properly assembled in the absence of Bag-1 (16Gotz R. Wiese S. Takayama S. Camarero G.C. Rossoll W. Schweizer U. Troppmair J. Jablonka S.

Most members of the Bcl-2 family contain a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain, indicating that these proteins may exist as integral membrane proteins. The lipophilic properties of the C-terminal domains of some pro- and antiapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2) have been investigated recently (17Martinez-Senac Mdel M. Corbalan-Garcia S.

Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) reported that Bid and Bax require interactions with specific mitochondrial lipids, such as cardiolipin, for their proapoptotic effects. Since the three-dimensional structure of BAD is not known and the interactions of BAD with lipids have not been reported, we investigated in this study the possible associations of BAD with membranes (21Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Complex lipid compositions resembling plasma membranes, cholesterol-rich domains, and mitochondrial membranes were employed. We report here for the first time that BAD exhibits pronounced lipophilic properties, associating with negatively charged phospholipids and cholesterol-rich liposomes. Based on both in vivo and in vitro data, we postulate a regulated relocation of BAD between mitochondria and cholesterol-rich domains (rafts). We identified two novel regions in BAD that are responsible for association with lipids (LBD1 and LBD2) and that mediate protein-independent membrane association. Originally, it was proposed that BAD association with mitochondrial membranes takes place via complex formation with the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Lipid binding is required for interaction with Bcl-XL in membranes and for full induction of apoptosis. We used biosensor technology to investigate in a quantitative manner the binding of mammalian 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated BAD and found that they differ in their efficiency to bind BAD and to extract it from membranes. Antibodies and Reagents—The phospholipids (PC, PE, PS, CL, PA, and PI), SM, cholesterol, benzamidine, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, thrombin, CHAPS, Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), and polyclonal anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Ceramides (natural sources) were purchased from BIO-TREND. Glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose from Qiagen. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) was obtained (22Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and applied as described (23Kerkhoff E. Leberfinger C.B. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Rapp U.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Phosphospecific antibodies against BAD phosphoserines 112, 136, and 155 were from Cell Signaling Technology and BIOSOURCE. Rabbit polyclonal BAD antibody (C-20), anti-protein kinase Aα (C-20), anti-GFP (sc-8334), flotillin-2 (B-6), cytochrome c oxidase, and anti-14-3-3 antibodies (K-19 and H-8) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit and antimouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. The 25-mer BAD-BH3 peptide used was as described by Petros et al. (24Petros A.M. Nettesheim D.G. Wang Y. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Mack J. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Zhang H. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

Cloning of BAD, Deletion Mutants, and Site-directed Mutagenesis— Human BAD full-length and its deletions were PCR-amplified, with primer overhangs containing the restriction sites for cloning. PCR products were cleaved with NdeI + XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-TT cleaved with the same enzymes. For expression of histidine-tagged BAD in insect cells, the BAD cDNA was cloned into pFastBacHTA (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using QuikChange™ (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent versions of BAD used in cell survival assays were prepared by fusing BAD mutants with the C terminus of pEGFP vector (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cell Fractionation—HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP-BAD mutants were washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were homogenized in buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged two times at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and intact cells. After further centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, cell pellets containing mitochondria-enriched fraction were washed twice in homogenization buffer and solubilized in Laemmli buffer. To obtain the cytosolic fraction supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The light membrane pellet was washed twice in homogenization buffer and solubilized with Laemmli buffer. Protein concentrations of all fractions were determined and equal amounts of total protein have been subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Colony Yield Assay—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine. The day after transfection cells were split, and around 500 cells of each set of transfection were seeded in 6-cm dishes. Colony assays were performed in triplicate by scoring the number of colonies (consisting of at least 20 cells) in the dishes grown for 14 days under selection (450 μg/ml neomycin; Calbiochem). To visualize the growing colonies, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa dye (Sigma). Fluorescence Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells transfected with pEGFP-BAD mutants were grown on coverslips for 36 h in 10% fetal calf serum plus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After two washings with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed for 30 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst-33342 dye (Sigma) for 30 min. Excess dye was washed out with PBS (three times) and water. The cells were covered with Mowiol (Calbiochem) and subjected to fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). For localization of BAD in raft microdomains, HeLa cells transfected with GFP-BAD were treated with 100 nm CNF for 6 h. Cells were rinsed once with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and rinsed again in PBS. After 10-min quenching with 10 mm NH4Cl in PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 2 h with a filipin solution (50 μg/ml in PBS with 10% fetal calf serum). After three washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted with Mowiol and dried. Actin staining was carried out with 0.2 μg/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, and 5% fetal calf serum. For the experimental procedure, the cells were cultured for 24 h under low serum conditions and treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 2 min. The cells were then fixed with ice-cold methanol and kept at -20 °C until further use. The cells were washed with TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8% NaCl, 0.2% KCl), 10% goat serum, and 0.1% Tween 20. Immunostaining with the indicated antibodies (flotillin-2, cytochrome c oxidase, or mouse anti-BAD) was done for 24 h at 4 °C. Control samples were treated in the absence of the first antibody. Cells were washed three times with TBS containing 10% goat serum and incubated for 30 min with 2 ng/ml Cy-3-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Biomol) or 2 ng/ml Cy-2-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Biomol). Cells were washed again three times with TBS and 10% goat serum and then covered with Mowiol in 50% glycerol/PBS (v/v) and observed under a Leica confocal microscope (TCS; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Immunohistochemical signals were analyzed using Leica Confocal Image software. Single estimations were pooled, and the results were expressed as mean and S.E. Statistical significance of differences was assessed by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Mitochondrial Binding Assay—In order to perform in vitro binding of BAD to mitochondria, these organelles were isolated from HeLa cells according to a standard protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed in a mitochondrial isolation buffer consisting of 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After homogenization of the cell suspension using a Dounce homogenizer (40 strokes), the postnuclear supernatant was obtained and the mitochondrial pellet was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were resuspended in a storage buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm ATP, 0.08 mm ADP, 2 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm Mops, pH 7.2. The protein concentration was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce). Rabbit reticulocyte lysates were produced and radiolabeled by Redivue-Cys-Met35S-Mix using the T7 TNT Quick-coupled Transcription-Translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each mitochondrial binding reaction, a mixture of 100 μg of mitochondrial proteins and 5 μl of reticulocyte lysate in storage buffer was used. Mitochondria were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated time and isolated with an additional step of centrifugation. The mitochondrial pellet was rinsed with storage buffer and resuspended in loading buffer. For quantification, the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity was detected by an autoradiography enhancer En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using ECL films (Amersham Biosciences). The results were quantified using the software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Tryptic Treatment of Mitochondria—In order to remove proteins from the surface of the isolated mitochondria, purified preparations were incubated with trypsin. For each treatment, 100 μg of mitochondrial sample were incubated with 20 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 500 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The mitochondria were then isolated and used for binding assays as described above. Protein Expression and Purification—For purification of His6-BAD protein, Sf 9 cells were infected with baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C. The Sf 9 cell pellets were lysed in 10 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of standard proteinase inhibitors for 45 min with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g (SS34 rotor, Sorvall centrifuge) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (10 ml) containing His6-BAD were incubated with 0.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40), and His6-BAD was eluted with imidazole using a 20-200 mm step gradient. BAD, Bcl-XL, and 14-3-3 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins using pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. 14-3-3 proteins and Bcl-XL were released by thrombin cleavage. GST-Bcl-XL and GST-BAD proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione using standard protocols. The purity of proteins was validated by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot analysis, the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. After washing, the membranes were incubated with specific secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Activity Assay—Human GST-BADwt and mutants (20 pmol) were incubated with purified protein kinase A in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm ATP. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The extent of BAD phosphorylation at serine 155 was detected by a phosphospecific antibody. Preparation of Liposomes and Biosensor Measurements—Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the extrusion method using a Liposo-Fast extrusion apparatus (Avestin Inc.) as described (21Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine quantitatively the interactions between BAD and different 14-3-3 isoforms and for BAD interactions with liposomes, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique was applied. The biosensor measurements were carried out either on BIAcore-X or BIAcore-J machines (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C. For BAD interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, the biosensor chip CM5 was first loaded with anti-GST antibody using covalent derivatization. Purified GST-14-3-3 proteins were injected in biosensor buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, resulting in a deposition of ∼1200 response units (RU). Next, the purified Sf 9 His6-BAD was injected at the indicated concentrations. The values for nonspecific binding measured in the reference cell were subtracted. To monitor BAD interactions with artificial membranes, liposomes were captured onto the surface of either Pioneer L1 or HPA sensor chips (Biacore). The surface of the sensor chips was first cleaned with 20 mm CHAPS, followed by the injection of liposomes (0.4 mm lipid concentration) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, which resulted in a deposition of ∼2000-3000 RU for HPA, and 4000-5000 RU for the L1 sensor chip. To prove whether reassociation of analyte occurs in the dissociation phase, reduced concentrations of lipids (40 μm) were also used. To measure the interactions of BAD or BAD mutants with lipids, purified BAD (100-200 nm diluted in biosensor buffer) was applied to the captured liposomes at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After binding of BAD to lipids, the dissociation was monitored at the same flow rate. At the end of the binding assay, the sensor chip surface was regenerated by injection of 20 mm CHAPS. The evaluation of kinetic parameters was performed by nonlinear fitting of binding data using the BiaEvaluation 2.1 software. The apparent association rate (ka) and dissociation rate (kd) constants were evaluated from the differential binding curves (Fc2 - Fc1), assuming an A + B = AB association type for the protein-protein interaction. The affinity constant KD was calculated from the equation KD = kd/ka. BAD Associates with Negatively Charged Phospholipids and Cholesterol-rich Liposomes—Although the primary structure of BAD contains no stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that could function as membrane anchor, we asked whether it could interact with membranes via direct association with lipids. To this end, we explored interactions of purified GST-BAD with artificial lipid membranes resembling plasma and mitochondrial membranes. In addition, we investigated BAD association with liposomes mimicking rafts (i.e. containing high levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin) (25Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5160) Google Scholar). Interactions were measured quantitatively by the SPR technique. In contrast to negatively charged lipids (see below), we observed a relatively weak association with liposomes composed of neutral lipids, such as PC, PE, and SM. Therefore, we used liposomes composed of PC/SM/PE (50:13:37 mol %) as a basic lipid mixture in further experiments. When PC is reduced by 20% and substituted by PS, this mixture represents the lipid composition of the inner leaflet of plasma membranes (26Gennis R.B. Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function. 1988; (Springer, New York)Google Scholar). In other vesicles, the PC content was substituted by 10% of PA, PI, CL, ceramides, or cholesterol. As shown in Fig. 1, BAD associated effectively with negatively charged lipids, such as PS, PA, and CL, as well as with cholesterol-rich vesicles. Liposomes consisting of mitochondrial lipids bound BAD with an affinity comparable with PA- and CL-containing vesicles. The mitochondrial membrane represents one of the most strongly negative charged biological membranes (27Hovius R. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B.

Control proteins, such as GST alone or 14-3-3 proteins, displayed only background levels of binding without any specificity for particular lipids (data not shown). For positive control, binding assays were done with raft-like liposomes and purified C-RAF (21Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Representative association-dissociation curves are shown in Fig. 1B. The apparent KD values for BAD interactions with various lipid combinations were in the range of 17-69 nm (Table 1). The association rate constants (ka) show that the interaction of BAD with cardiolipin, PA, and mitochondrial liposomes is stronger than interactions with PI or ceramide-containing liposomes (Table 1). BAD also bound efficiently to liposomes prepared from soybean lipid extract (asolectin; Fig. 1). To compare the interactions obtained with spheric highly curved liposomal membranes with those with planar lipid monolayers and to guard against possible artifacts caused by asymmetric distribution of lipid components between the inner and outer membrane of liposomes, we investigated BAD association with lipids immobilized on the surface of the HPA sensor chip. This chip enables formation of stable lipid monolayers. No significant differences were recorded (Fig. S1).TABLE 1Interactions of BADwt with lipid vesicles BADwt concentration was 100 nm.VesicleskdkaKDs–1m–1 s–1nmStandard vesicles (PC/SM/PE) (A in Fig. 1, A and B)6.67 × 10–4 ± 7.32 × 10–63.22 × 104 ± 124021PI and ceramide (B and C in Fig. 1, A and B)6.38 × 10–4 ± 5.35 × 10–63.82 × 104 ± 62317PS (D in Fig. 1, A and B)2.81 × 10–3 ± 3.98 × 10–54.09 × 104 ± 22469Cholesterol (E in Fig. 1, A and B)2.49 × 10–3 ± 3.84 × 10–55.26 × 104 ± 74447Mitochondria (F in Fig. 1, A and B)2.02 × 10–3 ± 3.24 × 10–58.42 × 104 ± 59924CL (G in Fig. 1, A and B)1.82 × 10–3 ± 2.05 × 10–58.81 × 104 ± 62221PA (H in Fig. 1, A and B)1.99 × 10–3 ± 3.06 × 10–58.33 × 104 ± 68824Asolectin (I in Fig. 1, A and B)2.50 × 10–3 ± 2.03 × 10–56.99 × 104 ± 90936 Open table in a new tab Two Distinct Domains (LBD1 and LBD2) Differentially Mediate BAD Interactions with Lipids—To localize the putative lipid-interacting domain(s) of BAD, we chose several breakpoints in its primary structure (see Fig. 2A, arrows). The first point was set at the beginning of the BH3-containing helix-4, the second at the end of the BH3 domain, and the third at the beginning of the C-terminal helix-5 (Fig. 2). Proteins truncated at one of the chosen breakpoints (BADΔC36, BADΔC47, BADΔC62, BADΔN102, BADΔN120, and BADΔN131; see Fig. 2B) were expressed as GST fusions in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Correct folding of chosen mutants was verified by protein kinase A phosphorylation that is known to phosphorylate preferentially the serine 155 (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Except for BADΔN120 and BADΔC62 (where Ser-155 was deleted), all other mutants were phosphorylated by protein kinase A at this site (Fig. S2). To investigate whether C-terminal truncations and point mutations of BAD (see below) affect the association with Bcl-XL, we performed binding studies using biosensor technology (Fig. S3).

https://openalex.org/W2045895646,"NR2C-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are highly expressed in cerebellar granule cells where they mediate the majority of current in the adult. NMDA receptors composed of NR1/NR2C exhibit a low conductance and reduced sensitivity to Mg2+, compared with the more commonly studied NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors. Despite these interesting features, very little is known about the regulation of NR2C function. Here we investigate the role of phosphorylation of NR2C in regulating NMDA receptor trafficking and ion channel properties. We identify a phosphorylation site, serine 1244 (Ser1244), near the extreme COOH terminus of NR2C, which is phosphorylated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. This residue is located adjacent to the consensus PDZ ligand, a region that regulates protein-protein interactions and receptor trafficking in NR2A and NR2B. We show that Ser1244 on NR2C is phosphorylated in vitro, in heterologous cells, and in neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that NR2C interacts with the PSD-95 family of PDZ domain-containing proteins but that phosphorylation of Ser1244 does not influence this PDZ interaction. Furthermore, Ser1244 phosphorylation does not regulate surface expression of NR1/NR2C receptors. However, we find that this site does regulate the kinetics of the ion channel: a phosphomimetic mutation at Ser1244 accelerates both the rise and decay of NMDA-evoked currents in excised patches from HEK-293 cells. Therefore, phosphorylation of Ser1244 does not regulate trafficking but unexpectedly affects ion channel function, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser1244 on NR2C may be important in defining the functional properties of NMDA receptor-mediated currents in the cerebellum.

Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). They are members of the larger family of ionotropic glutamate receptors that also include AMPA and kainate receptors. Endogenous NMDA receptors are heteromeric channels containing two NR1 subunits combined with additional NR2 (NR2A–D) and NR3 (NR3A-B) subunits (2Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin.

In contrast to the widespread distribution for NR1, NR2 subunits display unique spatiotemporal expression patterns throughout the central nervous system (4Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2819) Google Scholar) and confer distinct pharmacological and functional properties on NMDA receptors (2Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors in the cerebellum are composed of NR1 and NR2A–C subunits; the NR2C subunit is notably enriched in cerebellar granule cells and is up-regulated developmentally such that in the adult, NR1, NR2A, and NR2C are the predominant NMDA receptor subunits assembling to form functional receptors (2Cull-Candy S.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4376-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, NR2C-containing receptors have unique properties of low conductance and reduced sensitivity to Mg2+ compared with NR2A- or NR2B-containing receptors (2Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M.

Phosphorylation is an important mechanism regulating glutamate receptors and synaptic plasticity and occurs primarily in the cytosolic COOH-terminal domain of the receptor subunits. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by PKA and CaMKII directly affects channel function (7Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L.

Phosphorylation is an important regulator of NMDA receptor function and trafficking (13Crump F.T. Dillman K.S. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lan J.Y.

Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar); however, the direct phosphorylation of NR2C has not been reported. Interestingly, NR2C contains a prototypic PKA phosphorylation site in the distal COOH-terminal region that is not conserved in NR2A and NR2B, suggesting that phosphorylation at this location might play a specific role in regulating NR2C-containing NMDA receptor complexes. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of NR2C by phosphorylation. We demonstrate that Ser1244 is phosphorylated by both PKA and PKC in vitro and also on native NR2C in neurons. This serine is just upstream of the PDZ binding domain, which is conserved in NR2 subunits and is critical for NMDA receptor binding to PSD-95. We demonstrate that NR2C interacts directly with PSD-95; however, we find no effect of Ser1244 phosphorylation on PSD-95 binding to NR2C. Unlike the PKA regulation of AMPA receptors (10Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), we find no effect of Ser1244 phosphorylation on surface expression of NR1/NR2C NMDA receptors. However, we find that this site alters NMDA receptor channel function, because a phosphomimetic mutation (S1244E) accelerates channel kinetics. Thus, we find that this phosphorylation site in the distal COOH terminus regulates NR2C channel function. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The rat NR2C cDNA was obtained from Dr. Peter Seeburg (Max Planck Institute, Heidelberg, Germany). The COOH terminus of NR2C (amino acids 1076–1250) was amplified by PCR using synthetic primers that include flanking EcoRI recognition sequences and subcloned into glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-6T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and the LexA fusion vector pBHA (16Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length NR2C in the mammalian expression vector pRK5 was epitope tagged with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) between amino acids 36 and 37 using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The FLAG-NR2C-IRES-EGFP plasmid was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-SalI DNA fragment of pRK5-FLAG-NR2C into pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences). The rat PSD-95 and SAP102 cDNA were obtained from the yeast two-hybrid brain cDNA library. PSD-95 (amino acids 1–724), PSD-95-N (amino acids 1–404), PSD-95-C (amino acids 405–724), SAP102 (amino acids 1–849), SAP102-N (amino acids 1–490), and SAP102-C (amino acids 491–849) were amplified by PCR using synthetic primers that include flanking EcoRI recognition sequences and subcloned into the Gal4 activation domain fusion vector pGAD10. NR2C (S1244A and S1244E) mutations on GST fusion constructs, LexA fusion constructs, and pRK5-NR2C, pRK5-FLAG-NR2C, or FLAG-NR2C-IRES-EGFP were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. FLAG epitope insertion and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—HEK-293 cells expressing NR2C were rinsed twice with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (PBS+) and then incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS+ for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then quenched with PBS+ containing 50 mm glycine for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 20 min) and solubilized in PBS containing 1% SDS for 15 min at 37 °C. Ten volumes of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 were added to the lysate resulting in a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4°C and washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the relevant antibodies as indicated. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with NR1-1a and FLAG-NR2C-IRES-EGFP as described previously (17Hayes D.M. Braud S. Hurtado D.E. McCallum J. Standley S. Isaac J.T. Roche K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK-293 cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA (PBS/EDTA) and then incubated with PBS/EDTA for 10 min at 4 °C. Detached cells were transferred to polystyrene test tubes (VWR Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ) and labeled with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (100 ng/μl) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (100 ng/μl) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and suspended in PBS. The cells were immediately analyzed using a dual-laser FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Both EGFP and phycoerythrin signals were excited using a 488-nm laser light and the resulting emissions captured with bandpass filters set at 525 ± 20 nm and 613 ± 20 nm, respectively. Cell Quest Acquisition and Analysis software (BD Biosciences) was used to acquire and quantify the fluorescence signal intensities and to graph the data as bivariate dot density plots. Fluorescence emissions of individual fluorophores were initially corrected for spectral overlap using “simple” single color controls and appropriate electronic compensation. Immunoprecipitation—Four P30 Sprague-Dawley rat cerebella were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 9,200 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet (P2) (18Sans N. Prybylowski K. Petralia R.S. Chang K. Wang Y.X. Racca C. Vicini S. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was solubilized in PBS containing 1% SDS for 15 min at 37 °C. Ten volumes of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 were added to the lysate resulting in a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of IgG or anti-NR2C antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used. The supernatant was incubated with antibody-bound protein A beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with/without phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 2 h at room temperature and analyzed by immunoblotting with the relevant antibodies as indicated. Fusion Protein Production and in Vitro Phosphorylation—GST fusion proteins were purified essentially following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) with minor modifications. Briefly, DNA constructs were transformed into BL21 bacterial cells. 100-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6–0.8 after adding 1 ml of overnight cultures. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (0.5 mm) was added to cultures to induce fusion protein expression. The cells were grown for 4 h at room temperature following induction and then lysed using a sonicator in PBS buffer containing 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bacterial sonicates were incubated with 1 ml of the 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C and washed three times with PBS buffer. The fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm reduced glutathione) and dialyzed against BC100 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GST fusion proteins (GST alone, GST-NR2C WT, and GST-NR2C S1244A) were phosphorylated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm ATP, 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) with 50 ng of purified PKA catalytic subunit (Promega, Madison, WI) at 30 °C for 30 min. For PKC phosphorylation, reactions were performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1.67 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm ATP, 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) with 10 ng of purified PKC (Calbiochem) at 30 °C for 30 min. For CaMKII phosphorylation, reactions were performed following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.2 μm calmodulin, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm ATP, 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) with 25 ng of αCaMKII at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Generation of Phosphorylation State-specific Antibody and Immunoblotting—Rabbit phosphorylation state-specific antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Ser1244 of NR2C were generated by Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic phosphopeptide Ac-C(Ahx)TWRRV[pS]SLESEV-OH corresponding to amino acids 1238–1250 of NR2C. Sera were collected and affinity-purified using the antigen phosphopeptide. Anti-NR2C antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), and FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. HEK-293 cells or HeLa cells were transfected with full-length NR2C wild-type or NR2C S1244A using the calcium phosphate method (BD Biosciences), and the PKA activator forskolin (20 μm) was applied for 20 min at 37 °C. Cell membranes were prepared as described under “Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay.” Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Phosphorylation of Ser1244 on NR2C COOH-terminal fusion proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with the NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody. Cerebellar Granule Cell Culture—Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described previously (19Fu Z. Logan S.M. Vicini S. J. Physiol. 2005; 563: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebella removed from postnatal day 7–9 rat pups were dissociated with trypsin and plated in 100-mm Petri dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were cultured in basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin (all from Invitrogen). The final concentration of KCl in the culture medium was adjusted to 25 mm. The cultures were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2. At 5 days in vitro (DIV), the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 5 mm KCl (minimal essential medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml transferrin, 0.025 mg/ml insulin, 2 mm glutamine, 20 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside (Sigma)). At 7 days in vitro, cells were cultured in the presence of 25 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor for 96 h to up-regulate NR2C expression (20Suzuki K. Sato M. Morishima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9535-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We were able to increase NR2C expression by 3–4-fold upon treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (data not shown). Cells were treated with the PKA activator forskolin (20 μm) or the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (100 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C and compared with control untreated cultures. Cell membranes were prepared as described under “Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay.” Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-NR2C antibody. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Phosphorylation of Ser1244 on NR2C was analyzed by immunoblotting with the NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using the L40 yeast strain (MATa HIS3D200 trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ GAL4) (21Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) to detect protein-protein interactions. Briefly, constructs in LexA-fusion vector pBHA (TRP1 plasmid) and the Gal4 activation domain fusion vector pGAD10 (LEU2 plasmid) were co-transformed into L40 yeast. After transformation, the yeast were plated in synthetic complete medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Three independent yeast colonies were selected and assayed for expression of the reporter HIS3 gene in synthetic complete medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Electrophysiology Methods—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with NR1-1a and FLAG-NR2C-IRES-EGFP as described previously (17Hayes D.M. Braud S. Hurtado D.E. McCallum J. Standley S. Isaac J.T. Roche K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Between 2 and 3 days after transfection, cells were used for electrophysiology with transfected cells identified by visualizing GFP fluorescence. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made using electrodes (3–5 MΩ) containing (in mm): 117 CsMeSO4, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.4, 290 mosmol. The extracellular solution contained (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 25 HEPES, 30 d-glucose, 0.1 glycine, pH 7.3. Recordings were made using an Axopatch multiclamp 700B. Data were filtered at 5 KHz, digitized at 10 KHz, and analyzed on-line and off-line using Clampex 9.0. software. Patches were excised after obtaining a whole-cell recording and were positioned in front of a fast perfusion system consisting of a theta glass pipette from which control extracellular solution was continuously flowing from one barrel and extracellular solution containing 200 μm NMDA flowed from the other barrel. The solution interface was rapidly moved across the patch using a piezo electric device. After each recording of NMDA-evoked currents, open tip currents produced by a 10-fold diluted extracellular solution were also recorded. 10–90% exchange time across the electrode tip was <400 μs. Patches were voltage-clamped at –70 mV. The NR2C COOH Terminus Is Phosphorylated by PKA in Vitro—To investigate the regulation of NR2C by PKA phosphorylation, we first characterized the phosphorylation of the NR2C COOH terminus in vitro, specifically focusing on the distal COOH-terminal domain. The extreme COOH terminus of NR2C contains the PSD-95 binding motif, which is conserved in NR2A and NR2B; however, the adjacent upstream residues are quite divergent (Fig. 1A). Most notably, a tyrosine important in NR2B trafficking (Tyr1472, indicated with an asterisk; Fig. 1A) (22Roche K.W. Standley S. McCallum J. Dune Ly C. Ehlers M.D. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) that is conserved in NR2A, is not present in NR2C. Instead, NR2C contains a strong prototypical PKA consensus motif in this region (Ser1244; Fig. 1A), which is not conserved in NR2A or NR2B. Therefore, we generated GST fusion proteins containing the last 175 amino acids of the NR2C COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 1076–1250) of both wild-type NR2C (GST-NR2C) and NR2C containing an alanine mutation of Ser1244 (GST-NR2C S1244A). We incubated GST, GST-NR2C, and GST-NR2C S1244A with purified PKA and [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min to allow in vitro phosphorylation. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1B). We found that the NR2C COOH terminus was robustly phosphorylated by PKA, and mutation of serine 1244 to alanine (S1244A) reduced PKA phosphorylation. However, there was clearly residual PKA phosphorylation of the NR2C COOH terminus with the Ser1244 mutation, demonstrating that one or more additional residues were phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. To specifically monitor the regulation of Ser1244 phosphorylation in vitro and potentially in vivo, we raised a phosphorylation state-specific antibody recognizing NR2C phosphorylated on Ser1244. We performed the in vitro phosphorylation assay of GST, GST-NR2C, and GST-NR2C S1244A, resolved the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and transferred the proteins to PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting with the NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody revealed that the antibody specifically recognized the NR2C COOH terminus containing phosphorylated Ser1244 (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the GST-NR2C S1244A mutant subjected to the same in vitro phosphorylation assay showed no specific immunoreactivity with this antibody, highlighting the specificity of this reagent for NR2C phosphorylated on Ser1244. NR2C Is Phosphorylated on Ser1244 in Heterologous Cells and in Neurons—To determine whether full-length NR2C is phosphorylated upon PKA activation in intact cells, we expressed both wild-type NR2C and NR2C S1244A in HEK-293 cells and treated the cells with or without forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. By probing immunoblots of cell lysates with the NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody, we found that there was a very low level of phosphorylation on NR2C Ser1244 under basal conditions. However, phosphorylation of Ser1244 was dramatically increased upon treatment with forskolin (Fig. 2A). No signal was detected from lysates of cells expressing NR2C S1244A either with or without forskolin treatment when probed with the Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody, confirming the specificity of this antibody for NR2C phosphorylated on Ser1244. Similar regulation of NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation was observed when NR2C was expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B), another non-neuronal mammalian cell line. To investigate the possibility of NR2C phosphorylation in vivo, we next analyzed phosphorylation of endogenous NR2C on Ser1244 in cerebellum. We solubilized rat cerebella (P30), isolated NR2C, and probed immunoblots with our NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody. We found that endogenous NR2C was phosphorylated on Ser1244 (Fig. 2C). The NR2C band on the immunoblot was specific because no signal was detected when IgG was used as a control for NR2C immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C). In addition, treatment of the membrane with λ-phosphatase prior to immunoblotting eliminated the NR2C band recognized with the Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody, confirming that the immunoreactivity was specific for phosphorylated NR2C. To determine whether endogenous NR2C is phosphorylated upon PKA activation in neurons, we examined Ser1244 phosphorylation in cultured cerebellar granule cells in the presence or absence of forskolin. In agreement with the results in heterologous cells, we detected strong phosphorylation of NR2C Ser1244 in response to forskolin treatment (Fig. 2D). Thus, Ser1244 is clearly regulated on endogenous NR2C in neurons when adenylate cyclase is activated. NR2C Is Phosphorylated by PKC—The prototypical consensus sequence for PKA phosphorylation (RRXS) is consistent with consensus motifs for other serine/threonine kinases. For example, the CaMKII and PKC consensus sequence (RXXS) includes a positively charged amino acid preceding the phosphorylated residue. Therefore, we explored whether PKC and CaMKII could also phosphorylate NR2C on Ser1244. We incubated GST, GST-NR2C, and GST-NR2C S1244A with purified PKA, PKC, or CaMKII at 30 °C for 30 min to allow in vitro phosphorylation. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblots were probed with Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody. Both PKA and PKC phosphorylated Ser1244 robustly, but we observed no phosphorylation by CaMKII (Fig. 3A). We next investigated whether the activation of PKC could stimulate the phosphorylation of endogenous NR2C on Ser1244. We treated cultured cerebellar granule cells (11 days in vitro) with (or without) 100 nm PMA for 20 min. We evaluated phosphorylation by immunoblotting with NR2C Ser1244 phosphorylation state-specific antibody and observed a robust increase in immunoreactivity with PMA treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus PKC activity increases phosphorylation of NR2C Ser1244 in vivo. NR2C Interacts with PDZ Domain-containing Proteins Independent of Ser1244 Phosphorylation—The phosphorylation site that we identified on NR2C is particularly intriguing because it is located just a few amino acids upstream of the consensus PSD-95 binding motif. Members of the PSD-95 family of proteins contain PDZ domains, which are well characterized protein-protein interaction motifs (23Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The PDZ ligand, -XS/TXV, is conserved in NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C (Fig. 1A). The binding of PSD-95 and related proteins to NR2A and NR2B has been demonstrated by many groups; however, whether NR2C is capable of binding the PSD-95 family of proteins has"

Previous efforts to generate an L. donovani strain deficient in both hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) and xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT) using gene replacement approaches were not successful, lending indirect support to the hypothesis that either HGPRT or XPRT is crucial for purine salvage by the parasite. We now report the genetic confirmation of this hypothesis through the construction of a conditional Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant strain that exhibits an absolute requirement for 2′-deoxycoformycin, an inhibitor of the leishmanial adenine aminohydrolase enzyme, and either adenine or adenosine as a source of purine. Unlike wild type parasites, the Δhgprt/Δxprt strain cannot proliferate indefinitely without 2′-deoxycoformycin or with hypoxanthine, guanine, xanthine, guanosine, inosine, or xanthosine as the sole purine nutrient. The Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant infects murine bone marrow-derived macrophages <5% as effectively as wild type parasites and cannot sustain an infection. These data establish genetically that either HGPRT or XPRT is absolutely essential for purine acquisition, parasite viability, and parasite infectivity of mouse macrophages, that all exogenous purines are funneled to hypoxanthine and/or xanthine by L. donovani, and that the purine sources within the macrophage to which the parasites have access are HGPRT or XPRT substrates.

Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that is the etiologic agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a devastating and often fatal disease in humans. Leishmania spp. are digenetic, existing in both insect vector and mammalian forms. The flagellated, motile, extracellular promastigote proliferates in the midgut of phlebotomine sandfly family members, whereas the nonflagellated, nonmotile, intracellular amastigote resides in phagolysosomes of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells within the vertebrate host. Because of the absence of effective vaccines, chemotherapy has offered the only avenue of defense for the treatment and prevention of leishmaniasis and other parasitic diseases. Unfortunately, drug therapy for leishmaniasis is compromised by toxicity, expense, prolonged and invasive routes of administration, and resistance. Thus, the need for new and more efficacious drugs is acute. The institution of an effective parasite-specific therapeutic regimen for the treatment of leishmaniasis, or for that matter any parasitic disease, depends upon exploiting fundamental biochemical or metabolic differences between parasite and host. Perhaps the most striking metabolic disparity between parasites and their mammalian hosts is the avenue by which they synthesize purine nucleotides. Whereas mammalian cells can generate the purine ring de novo, all of the protozoan parasites studied to date are incapable of synthesizing the purine ring (1Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As a consequence, each genus of parasite has evolved a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes that enables it to scavenge host purines (1Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Looker D.L. Berens R.L. Marr J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 9: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Leishmania expresses a number of purine salvage enzymes. These enzymes include hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), 3The abbreviations used are: HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; APRT, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; XPRT, xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; AK, adenosine kinase; dCF, 2′-deoxycoformycin; AAH, adenine aminohydrolase; UTR, untranslated region; DME-L, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle-Leishmania; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT), and adenosine kinase (AK), and the genes encoding all four L. donovani proteins have been isolated and sequenced (3Allen T.

Furuya T. Pal S. Kessler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The parasite also accommodates a variety of purine interconversion enzymes including nucleosidases (1Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, the purine salvage pathway of Leishmania is divagating and redundant, and this metabolic complexity, as well as the diploid nature of the parasite, has hindered a thorough characterization of the pathway. The ability of Leishmania to carry out efficient homologous gene replacement (12Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 13LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Implementing targeted gene replacement strategies, L. donovani promastigotes deficient in HGPRT, APRT, XPRT, and/or AK were created in almost every conceivable combination (5Jardim A. Bergeson S.E.

These genetic studies underscored our central hypothesis governing purine metabolism that either HGPRT or XPRT is both necessary and sufficient for all of purine acquisition by L. donovani. The inability to create the Δhgprt/Δxprt double knock-out, however, was negative evidence that did not confirm the premise. We have now isolated and characterized a conditional Δhgprt/Δxprt line of L. donovani that was selected by targeted gene replacement in the presence of 2′-deoxycoformycin (dCF), an inhibitor of the leishmanial adenine aminohydrolase (AAH) enzyme (11Kidder G.W. Nolan L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3670-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and adenine as a source of purine. The creation and characterization of this Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant confirms our main supposition that either HGPRT or XPRT is absolutely essential for purine acquisition and parasite viability.

The pX63-NEO-Δhgprt/Δxprt construct was created by replacing the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of XPRT in the pX63-NEO-Δxprt vector with the 5′-UTR of the HGPRT. The pX63-PHLEO-Δxprt replacement plasmid was generated by excising the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of XPRT from pX63-HYG-Δxprt and inserting them into the appropriate sites within pX63-PHLEO (19Freedman D.J.

The other two episomal constructs, pSNBR-HYG-hgprtΔ(209–211) and pXG-BSD-xprtΔAKL, which lack a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 and therefore produce cytosolic hgprt and xprt, respectively, were generated as described (7Shih S.

The HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt and Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt lines were generated and maintained in the M199-based medium, whereas the Δhgprt/Δxprt null mutant was selected and maintained in the modified DME-L medium described above. The HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt, Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt lines were all maintained continuously under selective pressure in the drugs for which they contained resistance markers. The Δhgprt/Δxprt line was also transfected separately with pXG-BSD-HGPRT, pXG-BSD-XPRT, or pXG-BSD-xprtΔAKL, and transfectants selected in 20 μg/ml blasticidin and either 100 μm hypoxanthine or 100 μm xanthine to generate the complemented lines Δhgprt/Δxprt-[pXG-BSD-HGPRT], Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXG-BSD-XPRT], and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXG-BSD-xprtΔAKL], respectively.

Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas amastigote enzymatic assays were conducted with lysates that were not fractionated by centrifugation. These assays measure the rates of radiolabeled preformed purine nucleoside and nucleobases into phosphorylated, anionic metabolites, i.e. nucleotides and nucleic acids. Purine Metabolism in Live Cells—The rates of conversion of radiolabeled purine into nucleotides were measured using the earlier described DE-81 filter disk method (22Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Allen K. Kaur K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in either promastigote or amastigote medium containing 2 μm radiolabeled purine but lacking bovine serum albumin, FBS, and hemin. At each time point 1 × 107 cells were removed, washed once in PBS, lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and spotted onto DE-81 filter disks. Parasite metabolism of various radiolabeled purines was quantified by liquid scintillation. Growth Phenotypes—To assess the abilities of genetically manipulated strains to grow in various different purine sources, all parasites were washed several times with PBS, resuspended in modified DME-L medium lacking purine, and incubated at 26 °C for 4 h before they were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in 1.0-ml aliquots of modified DME-L containing 100 μm purine and 5% dialyzed FBS. Amastigotes were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/ml into amastigote medium containing 20% FBS and 100 μm purine, incubated for 7–10 days, and counted by hemacytometer. Macrophage Infections—Stationary phase promastigotes were washed two times in purine-free promastigote medium and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 10% FBS. 2 × 105 bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages, from Balb/c mice, and 2 × 106 promastigotes were placed in 4-well Lab-TekII CHAMBER SLIDES (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL) containing 1.0 ml of macrophage growth medium and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After 16 h, adherent macrophages were washed 10 times in PBS to eliminate residual extracellular promastigotes after which fresh growth medium was added and then again 24 h later. After an additional 24-h incubation, the chambers were washed three times with PBS, and macrophages were stained using the Diff-Quik kit (International Medical Equipment Inc., San Marcos, CA). Parasites were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M scope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) using 60× oil immersion light and photographed with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss), and parasites were enumerated. Color photographs of parasitized macrophages were visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using 40× oil immersion and photographed with a Leica DC 300 camera (Leica Camera AG, Solms, Germany). The Δhgprt/Δxprt knock-out was created after three rounds of transfection with drug resistance cassettes carrying 5′- and 3′-UTRs of HGPRT and XPRT (Fig. 1). Because HGPRT and XPRT are colocalized within a 4359-bp EcoRI fragment in the L. donovani genome (5Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34403-34410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the first copy of both genes was displaced with X63-NEO-Δhgprt/Δxprt (linearized pX63-NEO-Δhgprt/Δxprt), a construct containing the 5′-UTR of HGPRT and the 3′-UTR of XPRT, to create the HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt double heterozygote. The heterozygote was then transfected with X63-HYG-Δhgprt to generate the Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt line, and the latter was transfected with X63-PHLEO-Δxprt to create the Δhgprt/Δxprt double knock-out (Fig. 1). The last round of transfection was performed in medium containing 20 μm dCF and 100 μm adenine, whereas the HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt and Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt progenitors of the double knock-out were isolated in medium lacking dCF and containing 100 μm adenine as a purine source. 50–100 drug-resistant colonies were obtained within days after the first two cycles of transfections, but surprisingly only two barely visible colonies were obtained after 4 weeks following the last round of transfection in the adenine-dCF medium. Both colonies were picked and expanded in liquid culture medium containing adenine and dCF. Southern blot analysis of the HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt, Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt strains divulged the new alleles that had been created by the homologous gene replacement events (Fig. 2). The digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI and hybridization to the HGPRT and XPRT open reading frames revealed the presence of the common 4359-bp restriction fragment in the wild type and HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt lines and its absence in the Δhgprt/Δxprt null mutant. The Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt strain, as expected, lacks a band for HGPRT but exhibits a hybridization signal at 5939 bp when probed with the XPRT open reading frame that reflects the appropriate integration of the hygromycin resistance marker within the X63-HYG-Δhgprt cassette into the HGPRT locus. For comparison, a Southern blot analysis of previously isolated single knock-outs of HGPRT, APRT, and XPRT are also depicted, and the signals are appropriate for the expected homologous integrations (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis of wild type, HGPRT/hgprt/XPRT/xprt, Δhgprt/XPRT/xprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt extracts confirmed the absence of HGPRT and XPRT protein in strains in which the corresponding gene had been eliminated (Fig. 3). The single Δhgprt, Δaprt, and Δxprt null mutants for which Southern blot data are shown in Fig. 2 also lacked the proteins corresponding to the deleted genes. The abilities of wild type and Δhgprt/Δxprt promastigote lysates to incorporate individual radiolabeled purines into nucleotides were assessed over a 15-min time interval (Fig. 4). Whereas wild type promastigotes were capable of incorporating all purine bases and nucleosides tested, the Δhgprt/Δxprt could not convert guanine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, or inosine to nucleotides. The double knock-out could, however, incorporate radiolabeled adenine and adenosine into phosphorylated products during the 15 min assay interval, whether or not dCF was added to the extracts (Fig. 4). [14C]Xanthine conversion to nucleotides could not be measured in promastigote extracts for technical reasons. The ability of live promastigotes to metabolize various [14C] radiolabeled purine bases and nucleosides was also measured. These results corroborated the results from the enzymatic assays described above. Additionally, the metabolism of [14C]xanthine could be measured in intact wild type cells but not in the double knock-out (Fig. 5). [14C]Adenine and [14C]adenosine metabolism could be measured in both wild type and mutant cells during the 2-h time course in the presence or absence of dCF. The ability of Δhgprt/Δxprt promastigotes to proliferate in various purine sources was assessed (Fig. 6). Whereas wild type parasites could grow in modified DME-L medium with any of the added purine nucleobases or nucleosides as a purine source, continuous and robust growth of Δhgprt/Δxprt promastigotes could be maintained only in adenine or adenosine in the presence of 20 μm dCF. A small number of mutant parasites were observed at the end of the experiment in adenine or adenosine alone (when the knock-out parasites in dCF had reached stationary phase growth), but these parasites were not capable of further proliferation in the absence of dCF and soon died (data not shown). The double mutant could not grow in xanthine, xanthosine, guanine, guanosine, inosine, or hypoxanthine, although a limited amount of growth was observed when inosine was added as the purine in the presence of dCF. The Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites incubated in inosine and dCF were also not capable of long term survival after several additional weeks of incubation. The limited proliferation in inosine was further investigated with immucillin H, an iminoribitol analog of inosine that is a potent inhibitor of the leishmanial inosine-uridine nucleoside hydrolase activity (23Shi W. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21114-21120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although immucillin H at 20 μm allowed the Δhgprt/Δxprt double knock-out to replicate for several cell cycles in 100 μm inosine, indefinite growth in the inosine-immucillin H combination could also not be sustained (data not shown). The Δhgprt/Δxprt transfectants Δhgprt/Δxprt[pHGPRT] and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] exhibited the same growth phenotypes as the Δxprt and Δhgprt single mutants, respectively; Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] parasites could grow on all purines, whereas Δhgprt/Δxprt[pHGPRT] could grow on all purines except guanine, xanthine, and xanthosine (data not shown). dCF was not necessary for growth with adenine or adenosine in the complemented lines. Complementation of the Δhgprt/Δxprt line could also be achieved with episomes expressing cytosolic versions of hgprt and xprt that lacked their glycosomal targeting signals (7Shih S. Hwang H.Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1534-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Zarella-Boitz J.M. Rager N. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Δhgprt/Δxprt[phgprtΔSKV] and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pxprtΔAKL] cell lines grew robustly in either hypoxanthine or xanthine thus confirming that proper localization of either enzyme is not necessary for enzyme function in the promastigote stage of the parasite (7Shih S. Hwang H.Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1534-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Zarella-Boitz J.M. Rager N. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both wild type and Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites were capable of transformation to axenic amastigotes, as assessed by their expression of A2 proteins, a family of amastigote-specific markers (24Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). No A2 was observed in the promastigotes. The growth phenotypes of both wild type and knock-out axenic amastigotes were identical to their promastigote counterparts (data not shown). The metabolic capacities of the axenic amastigotes toward sundry purines were also indistinguishable from the promastigote equivalent. Wild type L. donovani promastigotes were capable of sustaining a robust infection of bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, whereas the Δhgprt/Δxprt knock-out could not (Fig. 7). Parasitemia of the wild type strain was ∼21 parasites/macrophage, whereas the double knock-out infectivity was ∼1 parasite/macrophage, a 20-fold difference. The inability of Δhgprt/Δxprt cells to proliferate inside macrophages could not be imputed to a failure to infect the mammalian cells, because similar numbers of intracellular parasites were observed for both wild type and knock-out parasites 4 h postinfection (data not shown). Supplementation of the macrophage medium with either 100 μm adenine or a combination of 100 μm adenine plus 20 μm dCF allowed the Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant to reach a parasite load of 7.5 parasites/macrophage and 12 parasites/macrophage, respectively, indicating that it is possible for the Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant to proliferate within macrophages if vital nutrients are provided to its host cells (Fig. 7D). Both complemented lines, Δhgprt/Δxprt[pHGPRT] and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT], also sustained robust infections in the macrophages, although the infectivity was lower than that of wild type parasites. Parasite loads of ∼8 parasites/macrophage and ∼13 parasites/macrophage were observed for Δhgprt/Δxprt[pHGPRT] and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT], respectively (data not shown). The purine salvage pathway of Leishmania is myriad and complex, although determining which of the many routes of purine salvage are functional has defied genetic dissection (1Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press Ltd., London, San Diego1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar). Mutational and gene replacement schemes in L. donovani have demonstrated that none of the four known enzymes capable of converting host purine nucleobases or nucleosides to the nucleotide level, HGPRT, APRT, XPRT, or AK, is essential by itself (5Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1984; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability to generate viable Δhgprt/Δaprt/ak– (16Hwang H.Y. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19488-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Δxprt/Δaprt/ak–4 L. donovani promastigotes reveals that the parasite can rely on either a functional XPRT or HGPRT activity for all of its purine nutritional requirements. Indeed, it has been possible to generate mutant parasites by targeted gene replacement in every conceivable combination except mutants accommodating a combined Δhgprt and Δxprt genotype. These results were the basis for our fundamental hypothesis that either HGPRT or XPRT is necessary and sufficient for Leishmania parasites to salvage purines, maintain viability, and sustain proliferation. The hypothesis was sustained by the inability to generate a Δhgprt/Δxprt double knock-out even within a genetic background complemented with an episomal copy of either HGPRT or XPRT. 4J. M. Boitz and B. Ullman, unpublished observation. We now report genetic proof of our principal hypothesis by the creation and characterization of a conditional Δhgprt/Δxprt double knockout. Taking advantage of the colocalization of the HGPRT and XPRT genes in the leishmanial genome (5Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34403-34410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant was selected after three rounds of targeted gene replacement, with the final transfection being achieved in the presence of 100 μm adenine and 20 μm dCF, an inhibitor of the L. donovani AAH (11Kidder G.W. Nolan L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3670-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant is absolutely reliant on the presence of dCF and either adenine or adenosine as a purine source for lasting survival and growth. No other naturally occurring purine tested could enable indefinite, long term proliferation of either stage of the parasite. However, several rounds of replication by the double knock-out could be sustained with adenine or adenosine in the absence of dCF, but this proliferation could not be perpetuated interminably (Fig. 6). The ability of the Δhgprt/Δxprt to undergo several cell divisions in adenine or adenosine can be ascribed to the time interval required for AAH to convert the 6-aminopurine source to hypoxanthine. This contention is buttressed by short term radiolabel incorporation experiments demonstrating that Δhgprt/Δxprt lysates (Fig. 4), as well as intact parasites (Fig. 5), were perfectly capable of converting adenine or adenosine to the nucleotide level via APRT. Eventually, however, the actions of AAH convert adenine or adenosine, which is cleaved to adenine by L. donovani promastigotes (11Kidder G.W. Nolan L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3670-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Allen K. Kaur K. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1984; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), to hypoxanthine, a dead end nutrient for Δhgprt/Δxprt cells. The limited ability of the mutant promastigotes to grow sparingly in inosine plus dCF or immucillin H suggests that L. donovani express an activity capable of salvaging the nucleoside. Although inosine kinase activity has not been detected in Leishmania (1Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a nucleoside phosphotransferase activity capable of phosphorylating the pyrazolopyrimidine nucleoside analogs allopurinol riboside and formycin B, has been observed in L. donovani promastigotes (27Nelson D.J. Bugge C.J. Elion G.B. Berens R.L. Marr J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3959-3964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rainey P. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whether this phosphotransferase is also capable of recognizing inosine is not known. To date, there are no effective vaccines to protect against visceral leishmaniasis (29Breton M. Tremblay M.J. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6372-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Generating a strain with intrinsic attenuating mutation(s) could theoretically be exploited as a live attenuated vaccine for immunizing against the disease is a valid alternative strategy to control leishmaniasis rather than the conventional paradigm of treatment with toxic drugs. Previous studies using noninfectious Leishmania tarentolae or attenuated strains of Leishmania major have demonstrated that these lines are capable of triggering a protective immune response against further challenge by virulent Leishmania in susceptible rodents (29Breton M. Tremblay M.J. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6372-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Uzonna J.E. Spath G.F. Beverley S.M. Scott P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3793-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The inability of the Δhgprt/Δxprt knock-out to sustain an infection of murine macrophages bolsters this mutant strain as a candidate for such a live vaccine strategy against visceral leishmaniasis. The Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant infects macrophages at a level <5% of that of wild type parasites. Preliminary results indicate that the overall infection rate of the Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant in macrophages can be increased by the addition of either adenine alone or, a combination of adenine and dCF, to the growth medium. Thus, it should be theoretically feasible to sustain an infection of the Δhgprt/Δxprt strain in susceptible mammals by dietary supplementation with adenine and/or dCF until a protective immune response has been established. The strain could then be eliminated by withdrawal of the dietary additions. It is important, of course, to determine the stability of the mutant genotype and phenotype. Genetic studies are currently underway to determine whether the Δhgprt/Δxprt double mutant is stable and does not revert by down-regulating its AAH activity thereby allowing the parasite to presumably grow on adenine or adenosine alone.

The mitochondrial targeting properties of the presequence and the influence of the mature part of Grx2 were analyzed by the characterization of the import kinetics of specific fusion proteins. Import of the mitochondrial isoform is relatively inefficient and results in the accumulation of a substantial amount of unprocessed form in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Substitution of Met35, the second translation start site, to Val resulted in an exclusive targeting to the mitochondrial matrix.

Reactive oxygen species formed in side reactions of aerobic respiration can serve physiological roles (1Rhee S.G. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), but in excess they can damage proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, resulting in severe alterations of their structure and function. In the eukaryotic cell, mitochondria are the main source of reactive oxygen species, which in turn are involved in the onset of mitochondrially triggered apoptosis (2Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Many human diseases as well as aging are related to an accumulation of oxidatively damaged biomolecules (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine,. 1999; (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK): 617-859PubMed Google Scholar).

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proteins Grx1 and Grx2 belong to subfamily 1 (22Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Grx3, Grx4, and Grx5 are monothiolic members of the second subgroup. Grx3 and Grx4 possess an additional Trx domain and are constituents of subfamily 3 (12Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell.

Grx1 is cytosolic, Grx3 and Grx4 are nuclear (17Molina M.M. Belli G. de la Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Herrero E. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and Grx2 has a dual localization in the cytosol and mitochondria (16Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Grx2 stands out among other Grxs for its efficiency in transferring reducing equivalents from reduced lipoamide to oxidized glutathione (25Porras P. Pedrajas J.R. Martínez-Galisteo E. Johansson C. Holmgren A. Padilla C.A. Bárcena J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Grx5 is essential for the functional assembly of iron-sulfur centers (24Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and Grx3 and Grx4 need their Trx domain for nuclear targeting and for Grx-like activity (17Molina M.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51923-51930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).A major aspect of the understanding of protein functions in eukaryotic cells is represented by the analysis of the mechanisms by which proteins are targeted and distributed to their subcellular localizations (26Karniely S. Pines O. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and are processed by a specific machinery (“translocases”) consisting of several sets of proteins, whose functions involve specific binding, translocation, maturation, and membrane insertion (27Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Proteins targeted to the mitochondrial matrix bear a presequence, which is recognized by Tom20 and Tom22 at the outer membrane. Proteins cross this membrane through a general insertion pore that is formed by the TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) complex. Transfer through the outer membrane is followed by the insertion into the inner membrane via the TIM23 (translocase of the inner membrane) complex, in a membrane potential-dependent manner. Subsequently, most of the polypeptide chains of mitochondrial matrix proteins are transported into the matrix compartment by the action of the import motor complex (28Strub A. Lim J.H. Pfanner N. Voos W. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Once in the matrix, the presequence is eventually cleaved by matrix processing peptidase (MPP).An increasing number of proteins have been identified that reside and function in more than one cellular compartment. They employ a variety of strategies to reach such dual destinations (29Danpure C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 230-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Grx2 represents an example for the localization in multiple subcellular compartments, in this case the cytosol and mitochondria. Localization of human Grx2 in mitochondria has been shown to be due to alternative splicing of one single gene (20Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This variant Grx2 has deglutathionylase and glutathione S-transferase activity and can be reduced by TrxR, a member of the Trx system what constitutes an interesting link between both “redoxin” systems (30Johansson C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7537-7543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It also attenuates apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release in HeLa cells (31Enoksson M. Fernandes A.P. Prast S. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mammalian protein, Grx2 from the yeast S. cerevisiae has a dual subcellular localization but originates from one single transcript (16Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only a very few other proteins with a similar behavior have been identified to date (29Danpure C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 230-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The dual localization of yeast Grx2 is related to the presence of an in-frame translation start site (TSS) upstream of the canonical one, which produces a potential mitochondrial N-terminal targeting sequence (16Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spreading of the protein over subcellular compartments is apparently the consequence of post-transcriptional phenomena taking place during and/or after translation.With this in mind we have performed experiments to establish the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the multiple subcellular locations of yeast Grx2. We have introduced specific mutations into the coding sequence of GRX2 to ascertain whether the cytosolic isoform arises from translation initiation at the second AUG (32Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), by retrograde movement from the mitochondria (33Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46111-46117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or by other unknown mechanisms. To characterize the biogenesis of the mitochondrial isoforms, we have determined the submitochondrial localization of Grx2. The targeting properties of the N-terminal extension, generated by translation initiation from the first AUG, was determined by the analysis of the in vitro import behavior of specifically designed fusion proteins containing different segments of Grx2. The analysis of subcellular distribution and import kinetics of the Grx2 mutants showed that specific properties of the N-terminal extension were responsible for the specific distribution of Grx2 to multiple cellular compartments. The characterization of its subcellular localization will provide the basis for the definition of the cellular functions of the multiple Grx2 isoforms.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains—S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table 1. Cells were grown on YPG (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 3% (w/v) glycerol), YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose), or SD-Leu-His (0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) dextrose, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.03% (w/v) histidine, and 0.03% (w/v) leucine). The Escherichia coli strain used for general transformation procedures was HB101, except for the Su9-Grx2 and PreGrx2-DHFR constructs, where One-Shot cells (Invitrogen) were used.TABLE 1List of strains usedStrainRelevant genotypeReferenceCommentsYPH499MATa ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3-52 trp1-Δ63 lys2-801(57Sikorski R.S.

Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) was used to perform site-directed mutagenesis of GRX2, cloned into the pGEM-Te Vector System (Promega) as indicated in a previous study (16Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following primers were used (mutated sequences are underlined): FS, 5′-TCTACTCCAAAAATGGTATCCCAG-3′; M1V, 5′-CTGTTATATATTGTTTCGTGGAGACC-3′; M35V, 5′-CTACTCCAAAAGTGGTATCCCAGG-3′. The mutated fragments were cloned into the yEP-352 vector and transformed into the MML-44 yeast strain, in which the GRX2 gene was deleted (Δgrx2), using the lithium acetate method (36Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). The Su9-Grx2, Su9-STPK-Grx2, and PreGrx2-DHFR chimeras were produced using the following primers: Su9-Start-f, 5′-CGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCTAGTATCTC-3′; Su9-End-NdeI-r, 5′-AACCATATGGCCGTCGGAAGA-3′; grx2-Start-NdeI-f, 5′-TCTACTCCACATATGGTATCC-3′; grx2-End-r, 5′-TGCGTAATTTAAACTATTGAA-3′; PreGrx2-Start-f, 5′-GGGAATTGTTATATATTGTTTCATG-3′; PreGrx2-NdeI-r, 5′-CTGTTTCCTGGGATACCATATGTGGAGTAG-3′; DHFR-NdeI-f, 5′-TCTTCCGACGGCCATATGGTT-3′ and DHFR-End-r, 5′-TTAGTCTTCTTCTCGTAGACTTCAAACTT-3′. These primers were used on plasmids pGEM-Te containing GRX2 and pCR-Blunt II-TOPO containing Su9-DHFR, amplified with Vent-Klenow polymerase, and two bluntended PCR fragments were generated. We performed the cloning with the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were digested with NdeI and PstI and ligated to generate the chimeras. Additional site-directed mutagenesis was required to generate Su9-STPK-Grx2 and PreGrx2-DHFR chimeras and was performed using the following primers (mutated sequences are underlined): SG-STPK, 5′-CTACTCTTCCACCCCCAAAATGGTATCCCAGG-3′ and PD-Lys, 5′-CTACTCCAAAAATGGTTCGACCATTG-3′. All the constructions were confirmed by sequencing analysis performed by the Sequencing Service at the SCAI (Central Facility for the support to Research), University of Córdoba.In Vivo Analysis of Mutants—Mitochondria were isolated and purified from strains CML235 (WT) and MML44 (Δgrx2) grown on YPG to 1.5–2.5 A600 nm when used for in vivo analysis using a variation of the method described by Glick and Pon (37Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Once the post-mitochondrial supernatant was obtained, three centrifugation steps were carried out as follows: first, centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, to remove the light mitochondrial fraction; then centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the rough reticulum fraction; and finally centrifugation at 100,000 × g 45 min to separate the smooth reticulum (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. Both reticular fractions were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. SDS-PAGE was performed with Bio-Rad Criterion XT Precast gels (12% Bis-Tris), using XT MES as running buffer, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or electrophoretic wet transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were processed by the method of Towbin (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44704) Google Scholar). The primary anti-Grx2 antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL2) system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were obtained as described previously (16Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were visualized with a chemiluminescence reader (Syngene).For fluorescent analysis by confocal microscopy, parental and mutant strains of S. cerevisiae were cultured in YPG medium to 2–3 A600 nm, collected, and spheroplasts were fixed onto polylysine-coated glass slides for immunostaining. Specific antibodies to Grx2 and either to porin or phosphoglycerate kinase, as mitochondrial and cytosolic markers, respectively, were then added. Anti-Grx2 was revealed with fluorescein (green fluorescence) and organellar markers with rhodamine (red fluorescence).In Vitro Imports—Yeast mitochondria were isolated from YPH499 cells grown on YPG medium (final A600 nm: 1.5–2.5), according to published methods (39Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rassow J. Dekker P.J. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), resuspended in SE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) to a final concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml and stored at –80 °C. Radiolabeled Grx2 was synthesized by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of [35S]methionine after in vitro transcription using SP6 polymerase (Promega) (40Rassow J. Dekker P.J. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 41Sollner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Specific primers for each mutant form of Grx2 were used to produce the respective radiolabeled precursor proteins. Import into isolated mitochondria was performed in import buffer (3% (w/v) fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm KPi) containing 2 mm NADH and 2 mm ATP. Mitochondria (25 μg of protein/100-μl reaction) were added, and the import reaction was started by adding 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate. After incubation for 2–30 min at 25 °C, the import reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μm valinomycin. Samples were then divided into two sets of 45-μl volume, and one of them was incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K (PK) for 15 min at 0 °C. Mitochondria were subsequently re-isolated and washed once with SE buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to deactivate the PK. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% acrylamide) and analyzed by autoradiography. The imported proteins were quantified using the program ImageQuaNT (General Electric).Submitochondrial Fractionation—Mitochondria for subcellular fractionation were obtained as indicated in the import experiments section above. Samples were prepared by resuspending 25 μg of mitochondria in 100 μl of SE buffer and subjected to the following treatments. PK treatment over whole mitochondria was performed by adding 5 μg of PK and incubating for 15 min at 4 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of 100 mm PMSF. Mitochondria were then pelleted by 12,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min, resuspended in 100 μl of SE buffer and trichloroacetic acid precipitated. Disruption of the membranes was performed by adding 5 μl of 10% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubating for 10 min at 4 °C with vigorous shaking. Elimination of the outer membrane (swelling) was performed by applying a mild osmotic shock to mitochondria by addition of 500 μl of EM buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and incubating for 15 min at 4 °C. Further processing of both swelling and Triton-treated samples was carried out by digestion with PK when appropriate and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated under the same conditions as indicated above for whole mitochondria samples. To remove lightly associated proteins from the inner mitochondrial membrane, mitoplasts obtained by mild osmotic shock as described above, were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and washed with 100 μl of EM buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Both the pellet resuspended in 100 μl of SE buffer and the supernatant were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Carbonate extraction of the membranes was performed by pelletting and resuspending mitochondria in 200 μl of 100 mm Na2CO3, followed by incubation for 30 min at 0 °C and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pelleted membranes were carefully washed and then solubilized directly in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, whereas the supernatant was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. All the samples were then analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Miscellaneous—Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (Bio-Rad) (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) using ovalbumin as a standard. Enzymatic activities were determined by standard methods. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was determined by the standard procedure (43Deutsch J. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 1983; (Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL): 190-197Google Scholar). Anti-porin antibodies were provided by Dr. C. Santos, and antisera against yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and Sec61 were provided by Dr. T. H. Stevens.RESULTSPreparation and Phenotypical Analysis of grx2 Mutants—In a previous study we have demonstrated that wild-type S. cerevisiae contains two mitochondrial and one cytosolic isoforms of Grx2 (16Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We asked which properties of the protein were responsible for this unusual subcellular distribution of Grx2. Because we have observed that the GRX2 gene contained two in-frame AUG codons serving as potential translation start sites (TSS) we have constructed mutant forms of GRX2 by site-directed mutagenesis to test whether the second AUG was operative. Table 2 describes the nature of these mutants. A deletion strain lacking GRX2 (Δgrx2) was transformed with plasmids encoding for the constructs. Cells were grown in non-fermentable medium, and their cytosolic and mitochondrial subcellular fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting to detect Grx2 (Fig. 1A). Fractions were analyzed for the presence of porin as mitochondrial marker or for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, an enzyme that is located in the cytosol.TABLE 2Description of DNA nucleotide and protein amino acid sequences of GRX2 mutant constructs Open table in a new tab As controls, cells transformed with full-length unmodified GRX2 showed a pattern of subcellular distribution identical to that of WT, i.e. a short isoform in the cytosol and another in the mitochondrion where a long immature isoform is also present. In addition, cells carrying the empty vector showed no signal for Grx2, confirming the specificity of the used antiserum against Grx2. Mutant Δ1–34, which was devoid of the whole presequence and possessed only the second AUG, produced a short isoform of Grx2, which localized exclusively to the cytosol. This demonstrated that the second AUG was a functional TSS at least when it was at the 5′-end of mRNA in the absence of native 5′-UTR. To approximate the in vivo genetic environment, we generated mutant M1V that possessed the presequence, but its first start codon was rendered non-functional by mutation of AUG to GUG. In this case, the second AUG functioned as an internal TSS in the absence of an upstream AUG, producing a short form of Grx2 lacking the mitochondrial targeting peptide. Again, this short form predominantly localized to the cytosol. It is worth mentioning that in this mutant a trace of Grx2 was consistently found in the mitochondria, likely as a consequence of non-canonical residual translation initiation at GUG as has been shown to occur occasionally in yeast (44Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Mutant FS carried an additional nucleotide (A) just before the second AUG to change the reading frame so that the context around 5′-UTR AUG remained unmodified, but its function as TSS would produce an aberrant undetectable mitochondrial protein. In this mutant, a cytosolic isoform was markedly present that could only originate by translation initiation from the internal AUG. Because the translation from the second TSS (Met35) was very important for the expression of the cytosolic form of Grx2, we introduced a point mutation to generate mutant M35V, destroying the TSS and essentially abolishing expression of the short cyto"
https://openalex.org/W2015948549,"The packaging signal of HIV-1 RNA contains a stem-loop structure, SL1, which serves as the dimerization initiation site for two identical copies of the genome and is important for packaging of the RNA genome into the budding virion and for overall infectivity. SL1 spontaneously dimerizes via a palindromic hexanucleotide sequence in its apical loop, forming a metastable kissing dimer form. Incubation with nucleocapsid protein causes this form to refold to a thermodynamically stable mature linear dimer. Here, we present an NMR structure of the latter form of the full-length SL1 sequence of the Lai HIV-1 isolate. The structure was refined using nuclear Overhauser effect and residual dipolar coupling data. The structure presents a symmetric homodimer of two RNA strands of 35 nucleotides each; it includes five stems separated by four internal loops. The central palindromic stem is surrounded by two symmetric adenine-rich 1–2 internal loops, A-bulges. All three adenines in each A-bulge are stacked inside the helix, consistent with the solution structures of shorter SL1 constructs determined previously. The outer 4-base pair stems and, proximal to them, purine-rich 1–3 internal loops, or G-bulges, are the least stable parts of the molecule. The G-bulges display high conformational variability in the refined ensemble of structures, despite the availability of many structural restraints for this region. Nevertheless, most conformations share a similar structural motif: a guanine and an adenine from opposite strands form a GA mismatch stacked on the top of the neighboring stem. The two remaining guanines are exposed, one in the minor groove and another in the major groove side of the helix, consistent with secondary structure probing data for SL1. These guanines may be recognized by the nucleocapsid protein, which binds tightly to the G-bulge in vitro.

The packaging signal is located in the 5′-untranslated region of unspliced RNA; it contains four stem-loop structures, SL1, SL2, SL3, and SL4 (Fig. 1A). Three of them, SL1, SL2, and SL3 are specifically recognized in vitro by the NC domain of the viral Gag polyprotein (2Shubsda M.F. Paoletti A.C. Hudson B.S. Borer P.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5276-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a key component of RNA packaging. SL1 is a 35-nt hairpin; its apical loop contains a 6-nt self-complementary sequence and three flanking residues, most commonly purines. This hairpin was identified as a dimerization initiation sequence (3Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 4Clever J.L. Wong M.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5902-5908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); RNA constructs containing SL1 are capable of spontaneously dimerizing in vitro via loop-loop interaction, forming metastable kissing dimer structures. Incubation of kissing dimers at 55 °C converts them into a more stable linear, or mature, dimeric form with 1–2 internal loops, or A-bulges, being formed on both flanks of the palindromic sequence (Fig. 1B). A similar effect is achieved by incubation of kissing dimers at 37 °C together with NC protein, in a process possibly reflecting maturation of genomic RNA in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 1Paillart J.C. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Marquet R. Mak J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Another feature of SL1 is a very conserved G-rich 1–3 internal loop (G-bulge) at the bottom of the hairpin, important for the RNA packaging. The sequence of the G-bulge is not essential for the dimerization step (4Clever J.L. Wong M.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5902-5908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is important for the packaging and overall infectivity (5Clever J.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NC protein binds tightly in vitro to both SL1 sites, central palindrome with flanking A-bulges and the G-bulge (2Shubsda M.F. Paoletti A.C. Hudson B.S. Borer P.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5276-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Delineating structure of SL1 is important for understanding dimerization and packaging of HIV-1 RNA, and it is potentially valuable for structure-based development of therapeutic drugs interfering with these processes. Several structures of the palindromic moiety of SL1 surrounded by the A-bulges have been solved for shorter RNA constructs, i.e. not including the G-bulge, for both kissing (6Mujeeb A. Clever J.L.

Structures for the G-bulge have been determined in monomeric constructs that excluded the palindromic sequence and the A-bulges (8Baba S. Takahashi K. Noguchi S. Takaku H. Koyanagi Y. Yamamoto N. Kawai G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 138: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Lawrence D.C. Stover C.C. Noznitsky J. Wu Z. Summers M.F. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the full SL1 RNA was modeled using the two shorter structures (8Baba S. Takahashi K. Noguchi S. Takaku H. Koyanagi Y. Yamamoto N. Kawai G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 138: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) determined by NMR. Here, we present the NMR structure for the full-length linear dimer of SL1, which has a wild-type sequence of the Lai HIV-1 isolate (subtype B) with the exception of inversions in the terminal and penultimate base pairs (Fig. 1C). The structure has been determined with the help of NOE distance and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—35-nt RNA (SL1) was synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 15Batey R.T. Battiste J.L. Williamson J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 300-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), purified by PAGE and electroelution, and dialyzed. The sample was heated to 90 °C for 3 min and slowly cooled to room temperature at an RNA concentration of ∼7 μm, then concentrated to 0.75 mm. The formation of the linear isomer of the SL1 dimer was verified by PAGE as described (16Takahashi K.I. Baba S. Chattopadhyay P. Koyanagi Y. Yamamoto N. Takaku H. Kawai G. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The NMR sample had RNA at concentration of 0.75 mm in 300 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer with 250 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm MgCl2 at pH 6.4, either in D2O or in a 90/10% H2O/D2O mixture. A uniformly doubly 13C,15N-labeled SL1 sample was prepared in a similar way but starting with in vitro transcription using a mixture of 13C,15N-labeled nucleoside triphosphates (Silantes, München, Germany).For the measurement of RDC constants, RNA was weakly aligned with the filamentous phage Pf1 as described (17Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), so that deuterium quadrupolar splitting was 9 Hz. Attempts to align SL1 RNA with n-alkyl poly(ethylene glycol) C12E6 led to severe deterioration of NMR signals (data not shown).NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were acquired either on Varian Inova spectrometers operating at 600 MHz (for protons) equipped with a cryogenic or a conventional probe at the University of Californai at San Francisco or on a Varian Unity Inova 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a conventional probe at National Magnetic Resonance Facility, Madison, Wisconsin. Spectra were processed with nmrPipe/nmrDraw (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11386) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (19Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY.3.0 Ed. University of California, San Francisco1998Google Scholar). Spectra in D2O were acquired at 30 °C, and spectra in H2O were acquired at 10 or 15 °C. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions of multidimensional experiments was achieved using the States-TPPI (time-proportional receiver phase incrementation) method. Water suppression in two-dimensional NOESY experiments in H2O was achieved using either the 1-1 echo (20Sklenàr V. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 74: 469-479Google Scholar) or a symmetrically shifted shaped pulse (21Smallcombe S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4776-4785Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Spectra in D2O were recorded without any suppression of the residual HDO signal. Decoupling of 13C during acquisition was achieved using GARP and WURST80 decoupling schemes on the 600- and 900-MHz spectrometers, respectively.Resonances were assigned as described previously (22Du Z. Ulyanov N.B. Yu J. Andino R. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5757-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with the help of homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY spectra, three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HMQC (acquired separately with optimization for aromatic and ribose correlations) and HCCH-TOCSY spectra, and two-dimensional versions of triple-resonance HCN spectra. NOE intensities for the determination of interproton distances were integrated by line fitting in homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY spectra acquired with mixing times of 15, 50, 75, 150, and 300 ms. RDC constants were measured by comparing separations between the bottom-right and bottom-left components in the non-decoupled constant time 1H-13C TROSY-HSQC spectra (23Weigelt J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10778-10779Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar) acquired in isotropic and liquid crystalline solutions. To minimize overlap, these experiments were set up such that only one multiplet component appeared in each spectrum; the two spectra containing the bottom-right and bottom-left components were collected in an interleaved fashion. The constant time parameters were optimized separately for aromatic, anomeric, and aliphatic correlations.Structural Restraints—Bounds for interproton distances were calculated based on two-dimensional NOE intensities using a complete relaxation matrix method, MARDIGRAS (24Borgias B.A. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 475-487Google Scholar), with the RANDMARDI analysis of experimental errors in the intensities (25Liu H. Spielmann H.P. Ulyanov N.B. Wemmer D.E. James T.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), as described previously (22Du Z. Ulyanov N.B. Yu J. Andino R. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5757-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No correction of NOE intensities was made due to a potentially strong anisotropy of the RNA molecule. Instead, relative NOE errors, used as input for RANDMARDI, were increased to 20%. MARDIGRAS calculations were run for a series of correlation times. In the end, a correlation time was selected that best reproduced fixed and nearly fixed distances (such as H1′-H2′ or H1′-H3′). Sugar conformations were restrained to C2′-endo for residues with observed H1′-H2′ correlation in TOCSY spectra, as explained below; the remaining sugar conformations were restrained to C3′-endo. All RDC restraints were used as measured in the non-decoupled HSQC spectra, with error bars of ±2 Hz. Idealized hydrogen bond distance restraints were used for all Watson-Crick GU and GA pairs. All glycosidic torsion angles were restrained to the anti-conformation, except G31, which was restrained to the syn-conformation in some calculations, as explained below. Idealized A-type backbone torsion angle restraints were used for stem residues during DYANA calculations. In addition, “non-NOE” distance restraints (lower bounds of 5 Ä) were used for proton pairs that did not have any intensity in any of the 2- or 3-dimensional NOESY data sets but that tended to have short distances in preliminary rounds of structure refinement.Structure Calculations—The NMR structures for SL1 RNA were calculated in two stages, using DYANA (26Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) and miniCarlo (27Zhurkin V.B. Ulyanov N.B. Gorin A.A. Jernigan R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the first stage, DYANA was used to perform simulated annealing with 20,000 steps of torsion angle dynamics starting with 100 randomized conformations. The weights of NOE-derived distance restraints, non-NOE restraints, and hydrogen bond restraints were 1.0, 1.0, and 5.0, respectively. The weights of sugar pucker-related torsion and bond angle restraints and of glycosidic angle restraints were 10.0, and the weights of backbone torsion angle restraints in stems were 20.0. Additional distance restraints were used to ensure proper closure of the five-member furanose rings in DYANA as described (22Du Z. Ulyanov N.B. Yu J. Andino R. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5757-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No RDC restraints were used in the DYANA calculations. In the second stage, the 30 best DYANA structures were passed to miniCarlo for further refinement. The miniCarlo program is specialized software for modeling, energy minimization, and Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of nucleic acids. It uses generalized helical parameters of nucleic bases as internal coordinates. These parameters define relative positions of idealized aromatic bases and sugars, as well as internal conformations of sugar moieties. The atomic coordinates of the sugar-phosphate backbone are then calculated by a chain closure algorithm (28Zhurkin V.B. Lysov Y.P. Ivanov V.I. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 377-412Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The force field used in miniCarlo was optimized specifically for nucleic acids (29Zhurkin V.B. Poltev V.I. Florentiev V.L. Mol. Biol. (Eng. trans.). 1981; 14: 882-895Google Scholar). To pass the DYANA structures to miniCarlo, helical parameters were calculated from the atomic coordinates as described (30Ulyanov N.B. James T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 90-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The structures were then refined using restrained Metropolis Monte Carlo simulated annealing followed with restrained minimization (31Ulyanov N.B. Schmitz U. James T.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 547-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Ulyanov N.B. Bauer W.R. James T.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At first, the structures were restrained-minimized, followed by 10,000 Metropolis steps at 1500 K with the weight of restraint energy gradually increasing from zero to its full term. The structures were again restrained-minimized and another Metropolis simulation run for 20,000 steps at 200 K with the full weight of restraints. The structures calculated during this low temperature segment of the Monte Carlo chain were averaged based on the helical parameters (31Ulyanov N.B. Schmitz U. James T.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 547-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the average structure was again restrained-minimized. The above protocol was applied to the fragment of SL1 comprising residues 1–18 and 17*–35* (Fig. 1), i.e. to one-half plus 1 base pair of the symmetric homodimer. In the end, full homodimer was calculated using a dyad symmetry transformation of helical parameters, and the full SL1 molecule was once more restrained-minimized. Restraints used in miniCarlo calculations included distance restraints as described above, sugar pucker restraints (these were used only during high-temperature Monte Carlo simulations), and RDC restraints. A flat-well potential (33Kerwood D.J. Zon G. James T.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used for all restraints. The full force constants for distance and RDC restraint energy terms were 10.0 kcal/(mol-Ä2) and 0.2 kcal/(mol-Hz2), respectively. RDC constants are calculated in miniCarlo similarly to AMBER (34Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham I.T.E. Wang E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C. Darden T. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.

NMR. 2000; 16: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), using a symmetric traceless alignment tensor, which is optimized during the refinement.Molecular graphics were prepared with UCSF Chimera (36Pettersen E.F.

Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar); molecular surface representation was calculated with the MSMS package (38Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) running from Chimera; the helical axis was calculated with CURVES (39Lavery R. Sklenar H. CURVES 5.1, Helical Analysis of Irregular Nucleic Acids. Laboratoire de Biochimie Theoretique, CNRS, Paris1996Google Scholar).The refined structures, chemical shifts, and NMR restraints will be deposited to PDB (code 2GM0) and BMRB.RESULTSResonance Assignments and Analysis of NOE Data—Imino protons in SL1 RNA were assigned (summarized in Fig. 2) based on two-dimensional NOESY spectra acquired at 10 and 15 °C in water. Imino protons of U11 and G23 had a strong cross-peak, characteristic of a wobble base pair (data not shown). No cross-peaks were observed for imino protons in pairs G1-C35*, G4-C32*, C6-G28*, and G12-C22*; because of that, these imino protons were not assigned in a sequence-specific manner. These base pairs are located at the ends of stems 1 and 2 (Fig. 1), and the exchange with solvent is presumably increased due to end fraying. Nevertheless, these base pairs, even though destabilized, are apparently formed as deduced from the connectivities observed in two-dimensional NOESY spectra acquired in D2O. These connectivities are characteristic of an A-type helical conformation in each of three stems, including the ends of the stems. In particular, very strong sequential H2′-H6/H8 cross-peaks were observed even at a low mixing time of 15 ms (supplemental data) for residues G1-A2, U34-C35 (consistent with the formation of the G1-C35* pair), C3-G4, C32-G33 (G4-C32* pair), C6-U7, A27-G28 (C6-G28* pair), and U11-G12, C22-G23 (G12-C22* pair). In addition, strong cross-strand and sequential cross-peaks involving adenine H2 protons also indicated an A-type helical geometry (e.g. H2A2-H1′C35*, H2A27-H1′G28). Interestingly, G15 at the end of stem 3 manifests a strong imino proton signal (Fig. 2B), so that palindromic stem 3 appears to be the most stable of the three stems. In contrast, the outer stem 1 appears to be the least stable; imino protons of U34 and G33 were relatively weak, and U34 exhibited species (Fig. 2) suggesting that alternative conformers exist for this stem exchanging slowly on the NMR time scale. Signals, implying multiple species for the residues of stem 1, were observed for non-exchangeable protons as well. Also of note is that imino proton resonances are not very strong in U7 and U8 (Fig. 2). These residues form a UU:AA stretch in stem 2, separated by one GC base pair from the G-bulge; a diminished intensity of the imino proton signals indicates a somewhat increased flexibility of this end of stem 2.FIGURE 2A, 600 MHz homonuclear one-dimensional imino proton spectrum at 15 °C. B, 600 MHz 1H-15N HMQC spectrum at 15 °C.

Noznitsky J. Wu Z. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Yuan Y. Kerwood D.J. Paoletti A.C. Shubsda M.F. Borer P.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the imino proton of G5 was not observed in spectra acquired in water due to rapid exchange with solvent. However, D2O NOESY data are consistent with the formation of G5-A29* base pair stacked on the top of stem 3, in particular the observation of strong cross-peaks C6H1′-A29*H2 and G28H2′-A29H8.Unexpectedly, presaturation of the residual HDO signal in D2O spectra led to a severe diminution in signal-to-noise ratio. This effect is likely explained by an extensive hydration of this RNA and a very effective dipole-dipole relaxation expected for a molecule of this size (70 nucleotides). Indeed, strong cross-peaks between aromatic protons and water were observed in two-dimensional NOESY spectra acquired in H2O (data not shown). Because of this effect, all spectra in D2O were acquired without any suppression of the residual HDO signal.Broad line widths were observed for non-exchangeable protons, especially in labeled samples, due to the added 13C-1H relaxation mechanism in such samples (Fig. 3). Because of that, signal-to-noise ratio was very low in three-dimensional carbon-selected spectra; only strong cross-peaks were observed in three-dimensional NOESY. Consequently, most sequence-specific assignments were made using homonuclear spectra acquired with unlabeled samples; heteronuclear spectra were mostly used to confirm the sequence-specific proton assignments obtained by homonuclear methods and to obtain the 13C assignments. To aid with the assignments, a series of two-dimensional NOESY spectra with a range of mixing times covering more than an order of magnitude were acquired. A data set with short mixing time (15 ms) was very helpful for assigning H2′ protons (supplemental data). A data set with long mixing time (300 ms) provided a multitude of cross-peaks near anomeric (Fig. 4) and aromatic (supplemental data) diagonals. These cross-peaks correspond to relatively long interproton distances (5.5–6.5 Ä); they are weak or not observed at lower mixing times. A long mixing time has an additional advantage for these spectral regions, because diagonal peaks manifest decreased intensity and less overlap with the cross-peaks. All aromatic, H1′ and H2′ protons were assigned; H3′, H4′, H5′ and H5″ protons were assigned for a subset of residues.FIGURE 3Aromatic region of the 900 MHz constant time 1H-13C HSQC-TROSY spectrum at 30 °C.

However, these NOEs are always affected by spin diffusion, which is expected to be very significant for a molecule of this size. As a rule, these cross-peaks were not observed at a short mixing time of 15 ms. One notable exception was the H1′-H8 cross-peak in G31, which was observed at 15 ms, suggesting that either this residue has a syn-conformation, or the syn- and anti-conformations are in equilibrium for G31. In contrast, sequential H2′(i)-to-aromatic proton (i+1) distances are very short in A conformations, and the corresponding NOEs are less affected by spin diffusion. All these NOEs were observed as very strong cross-peaks at a mixing time of 15 ms for all three stems of SL1 (supplemental data). In addition, G12H2′-A13H8 and C20H2′-A21H8 were observed as strong cross-peaks at the junctions of the A-bulge. At the same time, H2′(i)-H6/H8(i+1) connectivities were observed as relatively weak cross-peaks or were even absent at 15 ms for dinucleotide steps G4-G5, G5-C6, A13-A14, A14-A15, A29-G30, G30-G31, and G31-C32. All these steps are associated with one of the two bulges of SL1, suggesting a non-A conformation of the bulges. Apart from the species multiple for stem 1, each nucleus had a single signal, consistent with a symmetric structure of SL1 where both strands have identical conformations.Structural Restraints and Structure Refinement—To a greater or a lesser extent, the intensities of all NOE cross-peaks are always affected by indirect magnetization transfer, so-called spin diffusion (40Keepers J.W. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 57: 404-426Google Scholar). To account for this effect, distance bounds were calculated using MARDIGRAS, a complete relaxation matrix method (24Borgias B.A. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 475-487Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2087660940,"The competition model for β-like globin gene switching during development predicts that differential binding of transcription factors to globin gene promoters and/or proximal enhancers regulate the competitive interactions of globin gene family members with the powerful locus control region (LCR). Direct interactions of individual genes with the LCR are essential for high level expression in erythroid cells. In this paper, we have demonstrated, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, that erythroid-Krupple-like factor (EKLF) binds to embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters in primitive (but not in definitive) erythroid cells. EKLF binds strongly to adult globin gene promoters and to LCR sequences HS4, HS3, HS2, and HS1 in both primitive and definitive erythroid cells. Trimethylation of histone H3K4 and H3K27 at the embryonic/fetal and adult globin gene promoters is equivalent in definitive cells; therefore, the differential binding of EKLF to these promoters does not appear to result from changes in chromatin configuration. Interestingly, the level of EKLF in definitive cells is 3-fold higher than the level in primitive cells. These results suggest that temporal-specific changes in EKLF abundance result in differential binding of this essential erythroid transcription factor to embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters during development and that these changes in EKLF binding specificity mediate the competitive interactions of globin gene family members with the LCR.

Although erythroid-specific expression of human ε-, γ-, and β-globin genes in the yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow has been known for decades, the precise molecular mechanisms that direct this exquisite regulation are still unknown. The ε-, γ-, and β-globin genes are linked on chromosome 11 in the order in which they are expressed during development, and this gene family is positioned downstream of a potent 22-kb enhancer/chromatin remodeling sequence termed the locus control region (LCR) 2The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; EKLF, erythroid Krupple-like factor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild-type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; dpc, days postcoitus; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TAP, tandem affinity purification.

Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) proposed that developmental control of human ε-, γ-, and β-globin gene expression is achieved by the competition of individual globin gene family members for interaction with the LCR. This “competition model” was proposed to explain the unexpected discoveries that 1) human β-globin gene developmental specificity was lost in transgenic mice when the gene was linked directly to the LCR (LCRβ) and 2) human β-globin gene developmental specificity was restored by including a human γ-globin gene in the transgene construct (LCRγ-β) (7Townes T.M. Behringer R.R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that human γ-globin gene sequences are essential for correct human β-globin gene developmental control. Later experiments demonstrated that disruption of the γ-globin promoter CACCC box results in the loss of β-globin gene developmental specificity in transgenic mice (9Ryan T.M. Sun C.W. Ren J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2736-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sargent T.G. Lloyd J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41817-41824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the γ-globin gene CACCC box appears to be essential for correct globin gene switching. The competition model proposes that erythroid-specific yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow transcription factors (or stage-specific combinations of transcription factors) bind to globin gene promoters, which all contain CACCC boxes, and provide individual genes with a competitive advantage for interaction with the LCR at the appropriate developmental stage. Developmental stage-specific interactions between the LCR and embryonic/fetal and adult β-globin genes have recently been demonstrated in vivo by elegant RNA tagging and recovery of associated proteins (11Carter D. Chakalova L. Osborne C.S. Dai Y.F. Fraser P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and chromosome conformation capture experiments (12Palstra R.J. Tolhuis B. Splinter E. Nijmeijer R. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). EKLF, GATA-1, and FOG-1 are essential for LCR interactions with adult β-globin genes in definitive erythroid cells (13Drissen R. Palstra R.J. Gillemans N. Splinter E. Grosveld F.

Cell. 2005; 17: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar); however, the transcription factors that promote LCR interactions with embryonic/fetal globin genes in primitive erythroid cells are unknown. In this paper, we have demonstrated, by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), that EKLF binds to embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters in primitive (but not definitive) erythroid cells. Second, we have found that EKLF binds strongly to adult globin gene promoters in both primitive and definitive cells. Finally, we have demonstrated that EKLF concentrations increase ∼3-fold from primitive to definitive erythroid cells. We propose that this temporal-specific change in EKLF abundance is responsible for differential binding of EKLF to the embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters and, therefore, is critical for globin gene switching. Previously published functional data are consistent with this model. Underexpression of EKLF in heterozygous EKLF knock-out mice results in delayed switching (15Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M. Orkin S.H.

The mice used for ChIP analysis in Figs. 1 and 2 were also homozygous for the HbbS globin haplotype. The ΔLCR mice used for ChIP analysis in Fig. 4 were produced by removing HS1–4 in an 18-kb deletion on the HbbD background. 3K. M. Pawlik and T. M. Townes, unpublished data. ΔLCR mice were bred with HA/EKLF/TAP knock-in mice, and the offspring were mated to generate ΔLCR mutant mice (ΔLCR (D)/WT (S)) and wild-type mice (WT (D)/WT (S)); the ΔLCR and WT mice were also homozygous for HA/EKLF/TAP. Normal rabbit IgG (catalog number sc-2027), anti-HA antibody (catalog number sc-7392), and anti-GFP antibody (catalog number sc-9996) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-trimethyl-histone H3 K4-(07-473) and anti-trimethyl-histone H3 K27 (07-449, 05-851) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-trimethyl-histone H3 K9 (catalog number ab8898) was obtained from Abcam.FIGURE 2ChIP analysis of histone H3 trimethylation at the εy2- and βS-globin gene promoters in definitive erythroid cells. Chromatin obtained from a 14.5-dpc fetal liver was immunoprecipitated with control rabbit IgG (lanes 1 and 6), anti-trimethyl-histone H3K9 (lanes 2 and 7), anti-trimethyl-histone H3K4 (lanes 3 and 8), and two anti-trimethyl-histone H3K27 antibodies (lanes4, 5, 9, and 10). Histone H3 trimethylation at the myoD1 gene was analyzed as a control. The results demonstrate that the εy2 promoter contains chromatin marks that are consistent with an open domain in definitive erythroid cells; therefore, the promoter appears to be accessible to EKLF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4ChIP analysis of EKLF binding to β-globin promoter in the absence of the LCR. Ter119+ erythroid cells were purified from the bone marrow of either ΔLCR (A and B, lanes 1 and 2) or wild-type (A and B, lanes 3 and 4) mice. Chromatin DNA was prepared and precipitated with anti-HA or -GFP antibodies and analyzed by PCR. A, control experiment. Shown is allele-specific analysis of EKLF binding to HS3 in ΔLCR (D)/WT (S) mice by ChIP.

Duplex PCR was performed to determine the relative abundance of εy2 and βS transcripts. The εy2 and βS primer sequences are listed in the supplemental information. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (19Chen W.Y. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except for the following modification. To prevent protein A of the TAP tag from binding the antibody, anti-HA and anti-GFP-agarose were blocked with purified recombinant protein A (5 μg/ml) and denatured salmon sperm DNA (20 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 1 h at 4°C. Ter119+ and Ter119– cells were purified on Ter-119 MicroBeads as indicated by the manufacturer. MACS Ter119 microbeads (130–049-901) and recombinant protein A (PRTA11-R) were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec and Alpha Diagnostic International, respectively. Duplex PCR reactions were performed in 1× LA Taq PCR buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 pmol of each globin gene primer set, 1 pmol of the myoD1 gene primer set, 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 0.05 units of LA Taq. The PCR reaction included one cycle of 4 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. All of the PCR reactions were performed within the range of linear amplification. For allele-specific analysis, PCR products were digested with HaeIII. The PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging device. The enrichment of β-globin sequences relative to myoD1 in ChIP experiments was calculated as follows: enrichment = [(β-globin signal derived with anti-HA)/(myoD1 signal derived with anti-HA)]/[(β-globin signal derived with anti-GFP)/(myoD1 signal derived with anti-GFP)]. The DNA sequences for all of the ChIP primers are listed in the supplemental data. Semiquantitative PCR for HbbD and HbbS allele-specific analysis was performed as described previously (20Sawado T. Halow J. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were produced from Ter119+ cells purified from a 10.5-dpc yolk sac and from 14.5-dpc fetal liver cells. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell). Anti-HA antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect HA-tagged EKLF protein, and anti-GAPDH antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated; Abcam) was used to detect GAPDH, which served as a loading control. Western blot bands were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad), and HA/EKLF/TAP signals were normalized to GAPDH. EKLF Binds to εy2 and βh1 Promoters in Primitive (but Not Definitive) Erythroid Cells—Although much has been learned about EKLF function since Miller and Bieker (21Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) discovered this erythroid-specific protein in 1993, large gaps still exist in our understanding of the way in which EKLF regulates globin gene expression in vivo. One problem has been the difficulty of producing specific and sensitive EKLF antibodies that can be used in ChIP experiments to assess EKLF binding to LCR and β-like globin genes in primary primitive and definitive erythroid cells. To overcome this obstacle, we replaced the endogenous murine EKLF gene with a HA- and TAP-tagged version of the gene in embryonic stem cells and produced mice that are homozygous for the modified allele (18Zhou D. Ren J.X. Ryan T.M. Higgins N.P. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These mice were not anemic, and globin gene switching during development was normal compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the HA/EKLF/TAP knock-in mice could be used to define the developmental pattern of EKLF binding to globin locus regulatory sequences by ChIP experiments with the highly specific and sensitive anti-HA antibody. Fig. 1B illustrates the mouse β-globin locus and the location of primers used for PCR of immunoprecipitated chromatin DNA. Panels C–F illustrate ChIP results from bone marrow, fetal liver, and yolk sac cells of homozygous HA/EKLF/TAP mice. Fig. 1C is a control and demonstrates that no enrichment of globin sequences was detected in anti-HA (compared with anti-GFP)-precipitated chromatin from Ter119– bone marrow cells of HA/EKLF/TAP mice. The data in Fig. 1D demonstrate a dramatic enrichment of HS4, HS3, HS2, HS1, and βS promoter sequences in anti-HA-precipitated chromatin from Ter119+ bone marrow cells of HA/EKLF/TAP mice. These results strongly suggest that EKLF binds to these sequences in definitive erythroid cells in vivo. Interestingly, the data also demonstrate that EKLF does not bind to HS5 or to the εy2 and βh1 genes in definitive erythroid cells. Finally, the specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the absence of enrichment for sequences between HS2 and HS3 in HA-immunoprecipitated chromatin. These data are similar to the results recently reported by Im et al. (22Im H. Grass J.A. Johnson K.D. Kim S.I. Boyer M.E. Imbalzano A.N. Bieker J.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17065-17070Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) on EKLF binding to β-globin locus regions in G1E cells (23Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Im et al. demonstrate EKLF binding to HS3, HS2, HS1, and to the βmaj-globin gene promoter in this definitive erythroid cell line. Interestingly, EKLF binding to HS4 was not observed in G1E cells. EKLF binding to HS4 in Ter119+ bone marrow cells (see previous paragraph) (but not in G1E cells) may reflect differences in the cell types analyzed or in the antibodies utilized for ChIP. As expected, the same EKLF binding pattern that was observed in Ter119+ bone marrow cells was also observed in 14.5-dpc fetal liver cells (Fig. 1F). EKLF bound strongly to HS4, HS3, HS2, HS1, and βS promoter sequences in anti-HA-precipitated chromatin from HA/EKLF/TAP fetuses, and no binding was observed at HS5, IVS23, εy2, or βh1. Next, we performed ChIP analysis of EKLF binding in 10.5-dpc yolk sac cells isolated from HA/EKLF/TAP mice. The results of this experiment are illustrated in Fig. 1E. As observed in definitive cells, EKLF bound strongly to HS4, HS3, HS2, and HS1. Unexpectedly, we discovered that EKLF bound to the promoters of εy2-, βh1-, and βmaj-globin genes in these primitive erythroid cells. These results are surprising for several reasons. First, we did not anticipate EKLF binding to the adult β-globin genes in primitive erythroid cells. The adult genes are expressed at very low levels in primitive cells (Fig. 1F), and most models of globin gene switching have predicted that EKLF is not bound to adult globin gene promoters at this stage. However, our ChIP results clearly demonstrate that EKLF binds to the βS-globin gene promoter in primitive cells and that the association is quantitatively equivalent to binding in definitive cells. Secondly, we were surprised to find that EKLF bound efficiently to εy2- and βh1-globin gene promoters in primitive erythroid cells. Although Northern blot and in situ hybridization experiments have demonstrated that the EKLF gene is expressed in yolk sac erythroid cells (24Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 25Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), previous models of globin gene switching did not predict EKLF binding to εy2- and βh1-globin gene promoters at this developmental stage, because εy2- and βh1-globin genes are expressed at near wild-type levels in EKLF knock-out mice (26Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 27Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The knock-out result suggested that EKLF is not involved in expression of the embryonic/fetal globin genes. However, the ChIP results presented above clearly demonstrate that EKLF binds to εy2 and βh1 promoters in 10.5-day yolk sac cells and suggest that EKLF plays an important role in globin gene expression at this developmental stage. In EKLF knock-out mice, compensatory CACCC-binding proteins may stimulate εy2 and βh1 expression. However, in wild-type animals, these compensating proteins may not play a major role in globin gene regulation. There are several possible explanations for the lack of EKLF binding to εy2 and βh1 promoters in definitive cells. One possibility is that repressors bind to these promoters in definitive cells and inhibit EKLF access to the CACCC boxes. Several repressors have been proposed, and mutations of potential repressor binding sites in embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters result in up-regulation of these genes in definitive cells (28Omori A. Tanabe O. Engel J.D. Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3443-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Filipe A. Li Q. Deveaux S. Godin I. Romeo P.H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Grosveld F. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2778-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, genetic disruptions of the genes encoding these repressors have not demonstrated long term up-regulation of embryonic/fetal globin genes in definitive erythroid cells, and ChIP experiments have not convincingly demonstrated the binding of these factors to embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters in vivo. Pattern of Histone H3 Trimethylation at εy2 and βh1 Promoters in Definitive Cells Indicates an Open Chromatin Domain—Another possible explanation for the lack of EKLF binding to εy2 and βh1 CACCC boxes in definitive cells is that a repressive chromatin structure is formed on these genes. To test this possibility, we analyzed the εy2 and βS promoter for histone H3K27 trimethylation, which normally marks “closed” chromatin (31Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Reinberg D. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Two different polyclonal antibodies to trimethylated H3K27 were utilized. Fig. 2 demonstrates that H3K27 trimethylation is not significantly enriched on the εy2 promoter (lanes 4 and 5) compared with the βS promoter (lanes 9 and 10) in 14.5-dpc fetal liver cells. The myoD1 internal control demonstrates that H3K27 trimethylation is highly enriched on this gene, which is repressed in all erythroid cells. In addition, histone H3K4 trimethylation, which normally marks “open” chromatin domains (32Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 33Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), is equivalent on εy2 and βS promoters (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 8). Finally, histone H3K9 trimethylation, which marks actively transcribed globin genes (36Vakoc C.R. Mandat S.A. Olenchock B.A. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), is enriched on βS but not on εy2-globin genes (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 7) in 14.5-dpc fetal liver cells. This is a control experiment demonstrating that differences in histone modification can be detected in embryonic/fetal and adult globin genes in definitive erythroid cells. The data on H3K27, -K4, and -K9 trimethylation suggest that the differential binding of EKLF to embryonic/fetal globin gene promoters during development does not result from changes in chromatin configuration. EKLF Levels in Erythroid Progenitors Change Significantly during Development—A third explanation for the differential binding of EKLF to globin gene promoters in primitive and definitive cells is that the abundance of EKLF changes during development. Changes in the levels of other hematopoietic transcription factors have dramatic effects on gene regulation and lineage specification (37Dahl R. Walsh J.C. Lancki D. Laslo P. Iyer S.R. Singh H.

A. 1999; 96: 8705-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and in many cases, the changes in transcription factor levels result in a change of interacting partners (47Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured EKLF levels in primitive and definitive erythroid cells from homozygous HA/EKLF/TAP mice with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we found that EKLF levels increase ∼3-fold in definitive compared with primitive erythroid progenitors (see supplemental Fig. 1 for quantitation). This result is consistent with the 3-fold increase in EKLF mRNA levels that we previously observed in definitive, compared with primitive, erythroid cells (24Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the 3-fold increase in EKLF in definitive, compared with primitive, erythroid cells results in a switch of EKLF binding partners and that the new complex binds preferentially to adult β-globin gene promoters. Therefore, adult globin gene family members are preferentially activated in definitive erythroid cells. EKLF Binding to β-Globin Gene Promoters Does Not Require the LCR—Because EKLF binds to the LCR and to promoters of adult β-globin genes in erythroid cells at all developmental stages, we investigated whether EKLF binding to the β-globin gene promoter requires the LCR. We deleted HS1–HS4 of the LCR (ΔLCR) in murine embryonic stem cells and produced mice that were heterozygous for this 18-kb deletion.3 ΔLCR animals were bred with HA/EKLF/TAP mice to produce animals that were heterozygous for the ΔLCR allele and homozygous for HA/EKLF/TAP. To distinguish the binding of EKLF at WT and ΔLCR alleles, we used mice containing both HbbS (S) and HbbD (D) haplo-types and performed allele-specific ChIP as described by Sawado et al. (20Sawado T.

As demonstrated in the control experiments in Fig. 4A, both HS3 alleles were precipitated by anti-HA antibody in wild-type animals (lane 4; one wild-type HbbD allele and one wild-type HbbS allele), and only HS3 from the HbbS allele was enriched in ΔLCR heterozygotes (lane 2; one ΔLCR HbbD allele and one wild-type HbbS allele). When allele-specific ChIP analysis of adult β-globin gene promoters was performed, we found that EKLF was recruited to the adult βmaj-globin gene promoter of the ΔLCR allele as strongly as to the βS-globin gene promoter of the WT allele (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 2 and 4). These results demonstrate that EKLF binding to the adult β-globin gene promoter does not require the LCR. Similar data demonstrating polII, GATA-1, and Fog-1 binding to β-globin gene promoters in the absence of the LCR in vivo suggest that the LCR does not deliver these important proteins to globin gene promoters (14Vakoc C.R.

Halow J. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, EKLF is essential for LCR/globin gene interactions (13Drissen R. Palstra R.J. Gillemans N. Splinter E. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. de Laat W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2485-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and EKLF binding sites in HS3 and HS2 are essential for full LCR activity in primitive and definitive erythroid cells in vivo. 4A. A. Svendsen and T. M. Townes, unpublished data. Therefore, EKLF binding to both LCR and globin gene promoter sequences in the yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow appears to be critical for correct globin gene regulation during development. The “Results” presented above clearly demonstrate that EKLF binds to εy2 and βh1 promoters in primitive erythroid cells. The most straightforward interpretation of these data is that EKLF activates εy2 and βh1 gene expression at this developmental stage. EKLF has two powerful transcription activation domains (25Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Pandya K. Donze D. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8239-8243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the binding of EKLF to the εy2 and βh1 promoters strongly suggests a functional role for this important transcription factor in primitive erythroid cells. Although εy2- and βh1-globin genes are expressed at relatively high levels in EKLF knock-out mice, compensatory CACCC box-binding proteins may be responsible for this effect. Interestingly, yeast one-hybrid screens of yolk sac cDNA libraries identify predominately EKLF, but also Sp1 and Sp3, as embryonic/fetal globin gene CACCC box-binding proteins. 5C.-W. Sun and T. M. Townes, unpublished data. Therefore, Sp1 and Sp3 may bind to embryonic/fetal globin gene CACCC boxes in the absence of EKLF and stimulate εy2-, βh1-, or γ-globin gene expression. A simple model for globin gene switching that is consistent with the EKLF binding pattern described above is illustrated in Fig. 5. EKLF forms different complexes in primitive and definitive erythroid cells, and these different complexes direct globin gene switching. In primitive cells, the EKLF complex (Fig. 5, red and yellow ovals) binds to εy2-, βh1-, and adult β-globin gene CACCC boxes equivalently; however, εy2 and βh1 genes are preferentially expressed, because these genes are more proximal to the LCR. An alternative explanation for the preferential expression of εy2- and βh1-globin genes in primitive cells is that an EKLF repressor complex binds to the adult globin gene promoters at this stage (49Chen X. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 50Chen X. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10416-10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In definitive cells, a new EKLF complex (Fig. 5, red and blue ovals) is formed as a result of the 3-fold increase in EKLF protein levels. This complex binds to adult, but not to embryonic/fetal, globin gene CACCC boxes; therefore, the adult genes are expressed preferentially at this developmental stage. This model does not exclude an important role for other transcription factors, such as KLF2 (51Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in globin gene switching but emphasizes the essential role of EKLF. Also, other cis-acting elements may be necessary for correct globin gene switching. However, mutation of the γ-globin gene CACCC box is sufficient to produce a major change in developmental specificity (that is, high level expression of adult β-globin genes in primitive erythroid cells (9Ryan T.M. Sun C.W. Ren J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2736-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sargent T.G. Lloyd J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41817-41824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)); therefore, differential binding of EKLF to embryonic/fetal and adult globin gene CACCC boxes appears to be critical for correctly regulated globin gene switching. Previously published functional data are consistent with this model. Underexpression of EKLF in heterozygous EKLF knock-out mice results in delayed switching (15Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M. Orkin S.H.

Wijgerde M. Nuez B. von Lindern M. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We favor a simple model for globin gene switching in which temporal-specific changes of EKLF abundance result in 1) a switch of EKLF partners, 2) differential binding of EKLF complexes to globin gene promoters, and 3) developmental stage-specific globin gene expression. Purification of EKLF complexes from primitive and definitive erythroid progenitors should identify EKLF partners at these developmental stages and provide further insights into globin gene regulation. The results described in this paper are fully consistent with the competition model for globin gene switching (7Townes T.M. Behringer R.R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and suggest that developmental stage-specific changes in EKLF abundance mediate the competitive interactions of globin gene family members with the powerful locus control region.

https://openalex.org/W2162784999,"The understanding of endothelial cell responses to oxidative stress may provide insights into aging mechanisms and into the pathogenesis of numerous cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we examined the regulation and the functional role of cyclin D1, a crucial player in cell proliferation and survival. On H2O2 treatment, endothelial cells showed a rapid down-modulation of cyclin D1. Other D-cyclins were similarly regulated, and this decrease was also observed after exposure to other oxidative stress-inducing stimuli, namely 1,3-bis (2 chloroethyl)-1 nitrosourea treatment and ischemia. H2O2 treatment induced cyclin D1 ubiquitination followed by proteasome degradation. Phospholipase C inhibition prevented cyclin D1 degradation, and its activation triggered cyclin D1 down-modulation in the absence of oxidative stress. Activated phospholipase C generates inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ release from internal stores. We found that both IP3-receptor inhibition and intracellular Ca2+ chelation prevented cyclin D1 degradation induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, Ca2+ increase was transduced by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK). In fact, H2O2 stimulated CaMK activity, CaMK inhibitors prevented H2O2-induced cyclin D1 down-modulation, and CaMK overexpression induced cyclin D1 degradation. Finally, overriding of cyclin D1 down-modulation via its forced overexpression or via CaMK inhibition increased cell sensitivity to H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, cyclin D1 degradation enhances endothelial cell survival on oxidative stress."

Under homeostasis in the healthy kidney, the expression of HA in the cortical interstitium is low, with high levels found only in the renal papilla. Following acute ischemic injury, interstitial inflammation, or during progressive renal fibrosis, however, there is greatly increased peritubular expression of both HA and the cell surface HA receptor CD44 in the cortex (23Wells A.F.

This suggests that alterations in HA synthesis and turnover may be involved either in the maintenance of homeostasis or in the development of pathological events, but the role of HA remains unclear. To date, HAS2 appears to be the most frequently induced isoform in the context of clinical nephrology, and increased HAS2 transcription, together with raised levels of HA synthesis, have been reported in renal human proximal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells cultured in vitro in glucose concentrations similar to those found in diabetic nephropathy (29Jones S. Jones S. Phillips A.O. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1739-1749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HAS2 up-regulation has also been reported in the inflammation that occurs commonly as a consequence of peritoneal dialysis (20Yung S. Thomas G.J. Davies M. Kidney Int. 2000; 54: 1953-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and in autoimmune renal injury (30Wüthrich R.P. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 2554-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite the multifunctional role of HA in this wide variety of physiological and pathological processes, comparatively little is known about the transcriptional activation of the human HAS genes. Recent reports provide evidence for a natural antisense for HAS2 (31Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and for enhanced transcriptional activation by STAT3 and retinoic acid (RA) response elements (RAREs (32Saavalainen K.

However, details of the factors governing constitutive HAS2 activation have yet to be established. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the human HAS genes, we first deduced their genomic structures and thus identified putative proximal promoter regions for each isoform (33Monslow J.

In addition, we found that luciferase reporter construct F3, containing an insert spanning a 121-bp region upstream of the HAS2 TIS, mediated full constitutive transcriptional activity (34Monslow J.

Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar) identified a range of putative upstream transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs). These included Sp1, NF-Y, and CCAAT sites within the F3 region, and an NF-κB motif further upstream. In the present study, we have analyzed these TFBSs in HK-2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to three oligonucleotide probes spanning 63 bp immediately upstream of the HAS2 TIS. Mutation of key residues in consensus Sp1/Sp3 recognition sites within these regions ablated the ability of the F3 promoter region to drive transcription of the luciferase gene. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of mRNAs for either Sp1 or Sp3 resulted in a significant decrease in HAS2 transcription levels. However, although the stimulation of these cells with interleukin (IL)-1β has been reported to result in up-regulation of HAS2 mRNA via NF-κB (29Jones S. Jones S. Phillips A.O. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1739-1749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this effect was not mediated by the putative site for this transcription factor in the proximal promoter. In addition, putative recognition sites for transcription factors NF-Y and CCAAT failed to bind HK-2 nuclear proteins.

Where appropriate, binding of these polyclonal, rabbit-reared antibodies was compared with preimmune rabbit serum as reported previously (42Irvine S.A. Foka P. Rogers S.A. Mead J.R. Ramji D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of supershift reaction products with Sp-specific antibodies was carried out through 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 7 h at 4 °C, with autoradiography as described above. Synthesis of Promoter Construct Inserts—The mutant probe mut-HAS2-Sp1 was designed to alter key residues in the putative binding sites for Sp1 identified in the present study (Fig. 1) (38Bucher P. J.

In addition, on the basis of our EMSA data, we included a site within the Probe 1 sequence that was identified by visual inspection and not in silico, as discussed below. Two oligonucleotides spanning the Probes 1–5 sequences (Fig. 1) were thus designed with overlapping, central, complimentary portions and obtained from Sigma (Gillingham, Dorset, UK); their sequences are given in Table 1. A total of 1 μg of each oligonucleotide was diluted in 5 μl of H2O, mixed together, and annealed in a 100-μl reaction containing 10 μl of 10 × Buffer 3 (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK) and 80 μl of H2O. After 10 min at 100 °C, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The 65-bp 5′-overhangs either side of the central complimentary region of the annealed product were then filled using Klenow and the Megaprime kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the product was purified as described above. This purified template was then amplified by PCR using the HAS2-Sp1 primers shown in Table 1.

For each reaction, 1 μl of cDNA was added to 24 μl of a qPCR multiplex reaction mix for one target gene plus 18 S rRNA. Samples were assayed in quadruplicate in ABI Prism 96-well optical reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Default cycling parameters comprised an initial cycle of 50 °C for 1 min, one cycle of 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of both 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Output data were analyzed using ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system software (Applied Biosystems).

Selected putative TFBSs are shown in Fig. 1. Statistical Analysis of Promoter Activity Assay Data—Data were calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence values for each HAS2 promoter luciferase reporter construct to the corresponding value for the co-transfected Renilla vector, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test from SPSS 11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Statistical Analysis of qPCR Data—Fold changes in expression were calculated using 2–(ΔCt1–ΔCt2), where ΔCt represents the difference between amplification threshold for each target gene and 18 S rRNA.

The impact of PS2-LP on the progression of apoptosis, however, is not known. Here we show that PS2-LP is a potent inducer of the mitochondrial-dependent cell death pathway when transduced as a fusion protein with HIV-TAT. Biochemical and functional studies demonstrate that TAT-PS2-LP can interact with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and activate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that PS2-LP-mediated alteration of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis may be linked to the acceleration of apoptosis. Therefore, targeting the function of PS2-LP could provide a useful therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and degenerative diseases.

PS1 and PS2 proteins are composed of 467 and 448 amino acids, respectively, and share ∼70% identity (2Fraser P.E. Yang D.S. Yu G. Levesque L. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Serpell L.C. Rogaeva E.

They are both membrane proteins with eight predicted transmembrane domains and a large hydrophilic loop of ∼120 amino acids between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains. PS1 and PS2 appear to be ubiquitously expressed throughout all tissues (1Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H. Lin C. Li G.

A characteristic feature of PS1 and PS2 is their proteolysis by an endogenous presenilinase, generating amino-terminal (NTF) and carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTF) within cells (6Mercken M.

It is also known that in cells undergoing apoptosis, activation of caspase-3 leads to a specific cleavage of CTF, yielding a shorter form of CTF plus a 22-amino-acid hydrophilic peptide (amino acids 308–329 in PS2) (10Kim T.W.

For example, phosphorylation of PS2 at a caspase-recognition site (S330) that inhibited the cleavage of CTF by caspase-3 reduced the apoptotic activity of CTF (13Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, how the 22-amino-acid presenilin-2-loop peptide (PS2-LP) generated during the initial stage of apoptosis contributes to the execution of apoptosis. Mutations in PS have been linked to alterations of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis (14Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Disturbances in [Ca2+]i homeostasis can lead to the modification of a multitude of Ca2+-dependent phenomena in cells and initiate cell death (17Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun Lievremont F.J. Bird J. P.G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PS2-LP, as an apoptosis by-product, can act as an enhancer of apoptosis by perturbing [Ca2+]i homeostasis. We found that recombinant PS2-LP coupled with a TAT membrane penetrating peptide, can enter cells and induce apoptotic cell death. The proapoptotic effect of PS2-LP appears to correlate with its action on the intracellular Ca+2 release machinery at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our data suggests that perturbation of [Ca2+]i homeostasis can act as an amplifying factor contributing to the efficient execution of apoptosis.

All the oligonucleotides contain the SacI/HindIII restriction enzyme sites. After annealing, these oligonucleotides were cloned in-frame into the pET-28b-TAT vector (V2.1) between the SacI and HindIII sites. The obtained plasmids, pTAT-PS2-LP, pTAT-PS1-LP, and pTAT-PS2-SP, were used to transform E. coli strain HB101 that were subsequently screened by restriction analysis. Positive recombinant clones were sequenced prior to transformation into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. Bacterial cultures were grown overnight, and protein expression was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside treatment for 4–6 h followed by sonication in a buffer solution containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm, Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 7 m urea, pH 8.0 (Buffer B-7M). The His-tagged fusion proteins were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column, through sequential wash with B-7 M buffer and C-7 M buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, 7 m urea, pH 6.3, followed by the B-7 M buffer and elution with a buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, pH 4.5.

Caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the substrate leads to increase in fluorescence, determined by the fluorescence measurement at excitation wavelength of 342 nm and emission wavelength of 441 nm. A standard curve using known amounts of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was used to convert fluorescent values to specific catalytic activity. Mitochondria Isolation—Mitochondria were isolated from NRP-154 cells following the protocol of Unkila et al. (25Unkila M. McColl K.S. Thomenius M.J. Heiskanen K. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39132-39137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with TAT-PS2-LP or TAT-PS2-SP, NRP-154 cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was suspended in a solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors at 4 °C. Cells were then homogenized with 20 strokes in a 22-gauge syringe and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove intact cells and nuclei. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). For each sample, 30 μg of total proteins from the cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction were used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-cytochrome c antibody, also with anti-β-actin and anti-manganese superoxide dismutase as loading controls for cytosol and mitochondria, respectively (26Fantin V.R. Berardi M.J. Babbe H. Michelman M.V. Manning C.M. Leder P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6891-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Measurements—50–70% confluent NRP-154 cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2-AM for 45 min at 37 °C, in a balanced salt solution (BSS, 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Following wash out of fura-2-AM from the culture medium, cells were resuspended in BSS buffer and incubated with 10 μm TAT-PS2-SP, TAT-PS1-LP, or TAT-PS2-LP for 30 min at 37 °C. To measure the ATP-induced Ca2+ release from the ER, cells were then resuspended in BSS buffer containing 0 Ca2+ and 0.5 mm EGTA and transferred to a cuvette system attached to the PTI fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ). 0.5 mm ATP was added to the cell suspension solution within 45 s after resuspension in the Ca2+-free BSS solution. The ATP-induced Ca2+ release was assayed through ratiometric excitation of fura-2 at excitation wavelength of 340 and 380 nm, according to our published protocols (27Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation—After treatment with TAT-PS2-LP or TAT-PS2-SP, NRP-154 cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer. 20 μg of protein were separated on a 4–12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with primary antibody and secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody. Peroxidase activity was developed with ECL. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of TAT-PS2-SP, TAT-PS2-LP, InsP3R and SERCA2 were performed as follows. Lysates of NRP-154 cells treated with TAT-PS2-SP or TAT-PS2-LP was resuspended in 0.5 ml modified RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitors. 500 μg of whole cell lysate was incubated overnight with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-His-tag, anti-InsP3R, or anti-SERCA2 antibody. As a negative control, 5μg of preimmune rabbit IgG was used. The immunocomplexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads by incubating for 2 h and were washed four times with RIPA buffer. The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 2 × concentrated Laemmli electrophoresis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for the detection of His-tagged TAT-PS2-SP and TAT-PS2-LP, InsP3R, and SERCA2. Confocal Fluorescence Imaging—Detection of TAT-PS2-LP or TAT-PS2-SP inside NRP-154 cells was performed using fluorescence imaging of FITC that is conjugated with the various membrane-penetrating peptides. For assays of cell death, cells were treated with PI (1 μg/ml) and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss 510-META system. Electrophysiology—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were grown and maintained as describe (28Mak D.-O.D. White C. Ionescu L. Foskett J.K. Methods in Calcium Signaling Research. 2005; (CRC Press, Boca Raton): 203-229Google Scholar). Nuclei (5–10-μm diameter) were isolated and selected for electrophysiology based on unique morphology. For patch clamp measurements of InsP3R channel activity, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 μm [Ca2+], and 33 nm InsP3. All solutions were carefully buffered to desired free [Ca2+] (29Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which was confirmed by fluorometry. Single channel data were acquired as described (29Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Segments of current traces exhibiting a single InsP3R channel were used for determination of open probability (Po), and dwell time analyses by QuB software (30Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Biophys.

Expression and Purification of TAT Fusion Proteins and Delivery of TAT-PS2-LP into NRP-154 Cells—Previous studies have shown that PS2-LP could be generated via double cleavage of PS-2 by presenilinase and caspase-3 (Fig. 1A) (6Mercken M.

To test the cellular function of PS2-LP, we attempted to express the PS2-LP peptide by transfection of cDNA plasmids into cultured cells. However, multiple trials have failed to result in detectable expression of PS2-LP in these cells, e.g. NRP-154, HeLa, or HEK 293 cells. This is not surprising, because small peptide molecules are frequently vulnerable to degradation by cellular quality control mechanisms. As an alternative approach to test the in vivo function of PS2-LP, we took advantage of the well established HIV-mediated method for delivery of synthetic peptides into cells (19Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 20Vocero-Akbani A.M.

Extensive studies have shown that an 11-amino-acid TAT peptide “YGRKKRRQRRR” can enable peptides of various sizes to penetrate the cell membrane. Recently, Dowdy and co-workers (18Becker-Hapak M. McAllister S.S. Dowdy S.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M.

Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) developed the bacterial expression vector pHis-TAT for production of recombinant TAT fusion proteins and has kindly provided us with this plasmid. Using the pHis-TAT plasmid, we have generated the following three constructs, TAT-PS2-LP, TAT-PS1-LP, and TAT-PS2-PS. The TAT-PS1-LP and TAT-PS2-SP constructs were used for comparative studies and for control purpose (Fig. 1B). We used the BL21 E. coli strain for expression of these recombinant fusion proteins. Through the use of Ni2+-affinity columns, we found that abundant amount of TAT-PS1-LP, TAT-PS2-LP, and TAT-PS2-SP proteins could be purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1C). Based on gel electrophoresis and Western blot, the molecular size of the peptide appeared to be ∼7 kDa, as expected from the predicted molecular size for TAT-PS1-LP, TAT-PS2-LP, or TAT-PS2-SP. To analyze the ability of these TAT fusion proteins to penetrate into NRP-154 cells, two independent assays were employed. First, we used immunoblot to detect the presence of TAT-PS2-LP and TAP-PS2-SP inside NRP-154 cells after a brief incubation in the culture medium. For this purpose, we have generated a polyclonal antibody against the presenilin-2 loop peptide. This antibody could recognize the synthetic PS2-LP, CTF, and the full-length PS2 (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1D, TAT-PS2-LP could efficiently enter NRP-154 cells by a 30-min incubation with either 1 or 10 μm TAT-PS2-LP. Under these conditions, the cells retained TAT-PS2-LP expression for 3 h after the fusion protein was washed out of the medium. Second, we used fluorescence microscopy to detect the presence of FITC-conjugated TAT-PS2-LP inside individual NRP-154 cells (Fig. 1E). Clearly, green fluorescent cells could be observed following a 30-min incubation with 5μm TAT-PS2-LP, revealing the effective membrane penetrating capability of the TAT-PS2-LP peptide into NRP-154 cells. TAT-PS2-LP Triggers Apoptosis in NRP-154 Cells—Continuous monitoring of FITC-labeled NRP-154 cells demonstrated a potent cytotoxic effect of TAT-PS2-LP (Fig. 2A). At 30 min after incubation of 5 μm TAT-PS-LP with NRP-154 cells, most of the green fluorescent cells are healthy, as illustrated by the negative staining with PI. By 9 h, the majority of green fluorescent cells were PI-positive, illustrating that they were dead or dying. The pronounced cell death phenomenon was not observed in cells incubated with TAT-PS2-SP at either 30-min or 9-h incubation times. Quantitative analysis showed that greater than 90% of FITC-labeled TAT-PS2-LP cells were dead at 9 h, whereas less than 10% of FITC-labeled TAT-PS2-SP cells suffered such fate (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that TAP-PS2-LP has a potent cytotoxic activity in NRP-154 cells. TAT-PS2-LP Causes Release of Cytochrome c from Mitochondria and Activation of Caspase-3—To distinguish the nature of TAT-PS2-LP-induced cell death, e.g. apoptosis or necrosis, we performed the following two sets of experiments. First, we examined whether treatment of cells with TAT-PS2-LP could lead to activation of caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3A, activation of caspase-3 was observed in NRP-154 cells treated with TAT-PS2-LP (10 μm) but not with TAT-PS2-SP. In addition, 3 h after washing out the TAT-PS2-LP, the degree of caspase-3 activation was higher compared with that at 30 min, consistent with the cytotoxic effect of TAT-PS2-LP. Western blot analyses using the polyclonal anti-PS2-LP antibody showed that prolonged incubation of cells with TAT-PS2-LP led to maintenance of the integrity of the peptide inside the cell, because the apparent molecular size of the TAT-PS2-LP protein did not change, and there were no degradation products detected. For quantitative assay of the caspase-3 enzymatic activity, we used the EnzChek caspase-3 kit purchased from Molecular Probes. As shown in Fig. 3B, pretreatment of cells with TAT-PS2-LP significantly increased the caspase-3 activity, an effect that was not observed with treatment of cells with TAT-PS2-SP. Second, we assayed whether TAT-PS2-LP could trigger the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, another marker for cells undergoing apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment of NRP-154 cells with TAT-PS2-LP induced significant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. In contrast, TAT-PS2-SP had negligible effect on cytochrome c release as compared with the control. Furthermore, no release of other mitochondrial proteins such as manganese superoxide dismutase (26Fantin V.R. Berardi M.J. Babbe H. Michelman M.V. Manning C.M. Leder P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6891-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was detectable in the same samples (Fig. 3C). Together, our data demonstrate that TAT-PS2-LP triggers mitochondria-dependent cascade of cell death in NRP-154 cells. TAT-PS2-LP Reduces Intracellular Ca2+ Content in NRP-154 Cells—Previous studies (14Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) have shown that PS mutations are associated with alterations of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis have also been linked to the initiation and amplification of apoptosis (31Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Oakes S.A. Scorrano L. Opferman J.T. Bassik M.C. Nishino M. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). To test whether PS2-LP-mediated apoptosis is related to changes in intracellular Ca2+ stores, we measured the amount of Ca2+ inside the ER, by activating the InsP3-receptor-mediated Ca2+ release pathway using 500 μm ATP in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment of NRP-154 cells with 10 μm TAT-PS2-LP (30 min) significantly reduced the amount of Ca2+ released from the ER by ATP, an effect that was not seen with the TAT-PS2-SP protein (Fig. 4A). Moreover, compared with TAT-PS2-LP, pretreatment of cells with TAT-PS1-LP did not alter the ER Ca2+ storage (Fig. 4B). Because the PS1-LP and PS2-LP do not show conservation in a primary amino acid sequence, this result suggests that PS2-LP may have a specific effect on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. The reduction of the ER Ca2+ store may reflect two possibilities, either by altering Ca2+ uptake or Ca2+ release across the ER membrane. TAT-PS2-LP Interacts with the InsP3R and Regulates Its Channel Activity—To understand the mechanisms underlying the TAT-PS2-LP-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i homeostasis, we first examined the possible interactions between TAT-PS2-LP and InsP3R or SERCA2, through co-IP assays. As shown in Fig. 5A, the IP of TAT peptides with anti-His antibody could pull down InsP3R from cells treated with TAT-PS2-LP but not from cells treated with TAT-PS2-SP (left panel), and IP with anti-InsP3R antibody could pull down TAT-PS2-LP but not TAT-PS2-SP (right panel). This interaction appears to be specific, because we did not observe any interaction between TAT-PS2-LP and SERCA2 (lower panel). These results indicate that TAT-PS2-LP can interact with InsP3R, but not with the SERCA2, raising the possibility that PS2-LP may affect the activity of InsP3R. We next explored the functional consequences of the interaction of TAT-PS2-LP with the InsP3R by performing patch clamp studies of endogenous InsP3R channels in their native membrane environment (28Mak D.-O.D. White C. Ionescu L. Foskett J.K. Methods in Calcium Signaling Research. 2005; (CRC Press, Boca Raton): 203-229Google Scholar, 29Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 571-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). The pipette solution contained 1 μm free Ca2+ and 33 nm InsP3, agonist conditions that activate the channel submaximally (open probability, Po = 0.15 ± 0.04). As shown in Fig. 5B, addition of 0.5 or 2.5 μm TAT-PS2-LP to the pipette solution enhanced Po by ∼100% (Po = 0.25 ± 0.04 and 0.39 ± 0.04, respectively; n = 5 each). In contrast, 0.5 or 2.5 μm TAT-PS2-SP had no significant effects on channel Po (n = 5). Kinetic analyses demonstrated that stimulation of channel Po by TAT-PS2-LP was associated with reduced channel closed time, whereas channel open time was not affected (Fig. 5B). The number of channels activated by InsP3 (NA) was also enhanced in the presence of TAT-PS2-LP (Fig. 5B). The product NAPo, a measure of the total InsP3-mediated flux, was enhanced by nearly 3-fold and over 4-fold by 0.5 or 2.5 μm TAT-PS2-LP, respectively (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that the interaction of TAT-PS2-LP with the InsP3R leads to a marked activation of channel gating in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of InsP3. These results are consistent with our findings that TAT-PS2-LP decreases the ER Ca2+ store. In the present study, we have used the TAT protein-penetrating transduction system to investigate the possible involvement of PS2-LP in cell apoptosis and [Ca2+]i homeostasis. The advantage of this system results from the fact that it is technically challenging to use DNA transfection to introduce small peptides into living cells (35Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar, 36Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), as these peptides are often unstable and susceptible to cellular degradation. TAT-mediated protein transduction occurs in a rapid, concentration-dependent fashion that is independent of receptors and transporters. This technology has been used to introduce proteins ranging in size from 15 to 120 kDa into a wide variety of human and murine cells (36Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To determine whether this method could be used to deliver PS2-LP into cultured cells, we generated the recombinant TAT-PS2-LP fusion protein, plus the necessary control constructs. We found that transduction of TAT-PS2-LP, but not TAT-PS2-SP, into NRP-154 cells induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, increased the activity of caspase-3, and triggered cell apoptosis. We also observed that TAT-PS2-LP-treated cells exhibited significantly reduced Ca2+ storage inside the ER, but TAT-PS1-LP and TAT-PS2-SP did not exhibit such effect. TAT-PS2-LP interacts with the InsP3R and increases its Ca2+ release channel activity. These results provide the first physiological evidence for PS2-LP in regulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and cell apoptosis. A number of previous studies have explored the role of PS2 and its derivatives in cell apoptosis. For example, PS2 has been shown to function as a proapoptotic effector (13Walter J. Schindzielorz A.

Overexpression of the CTF of PS-2 has been shown to increase amyloid-β precursor protein recovery and to decrease cell viability, by augmenting caspase-3 activity (8Alves da Costa C. Mattson M.P. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12064-12069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results showed that PS2-LP, as a by-product of caspase-3 cleavage of CTF, could act as a potent amplifier of apoptosis. Previous studies have suggested that PS1 and PS2 also play different roles in cell death. Specifically, overexpression of PS2 in PC12 cells led to increased cell death in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli (42Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 43Deng G. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The expression of a PS2 mutation associated with Alzheimer disease led to increased levels of apoptosis at both basal and stimulated conditions (41Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. Lacana E. Sunderland T. Zhao B. Kusiak J.W. Wasco W. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 274: 1710-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the role of PS1 in cell death is less clear. Overexpression of L286V PS1 mutant but not wild-type PS1 resulted in increased susceptibility to cell death induced by trophic factor withdrawal and Ab-mediated neurotoxicity (44Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a separate study showed that overexpression of A246E mutant in PS1 did not enhance apoptosis (45Bursztajn S. DeSouza R. McPhie D.L. Berman S.A. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. Neve R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9790-9799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with our data indicating that PS2-LP, but not PS1-LP, could perturb intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and accelerate cell death. In summary, our data demonstrate that PS2-LP, as a by-product of apoptosis, can provide a potent feed-forward mechanism to accelerate the apoptosis process. Because altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is associated with the cellular function of PS2-LP, we suspect that this small peptide molecule may play important roles in the overall cell growth and death processes. Targeting PS2-LP may thus offer an attractive therapeutic approach for cancer-related human diseases."

They are capable of digesting proteinaceous components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as non-ECM proteins (2Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F.

Extensive analyses have shown that various MMPs are highly expressed in diverse developmental and pathological processes where cell fate change and/or cell migration occurs, consistent with the possible involvement of MMP in cell function through multiple pathways.Of particular interest among MMPs is stromelysin-3 (ST3) (MMP11), which was first isolated as a breast cancer-associated gene and has since been found to be expressed in diverse human carcinomas (6Wei L.

In addition, high levels of ST3 mRNA are present in a number of developmental processes where extensive cell death and tissue remodeling take place in mammals (6Wei L. Shi Y.-B. Histol.

Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 1996; 122: 181-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that ST3 participates in vertebrate development as well as carcinogenesis and tumor progression, although mice lacking ST3 were largely normal, likely due to redundancy in MMP activities (14Masson R. Lefebvre O. Noel A. Fahime M.E. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Kebers F. LeMeur M. Dierich A. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), thus lacking one major mechanism to regulate its activity, i.e. the activation of the proenzymes (zymogens) through the removal of the propeptide seen for most other MMPs (17van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 18Kleiner Jr., D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Curr. Opin.

APMIS. 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The transcription of the ST3 gene, therefore, plays a critically important role in regulating the biological function of ST3. This is especially true considering the strictly controlled expression profiles of ST3, whose mRNA is absent in most adult organs in mammals but is at high levels in a cell type-specific manner during many developmental and pathological processes (see above).We use amphibian metamorphosis as a model to study the regulation and function of ST3 in postembryonic vertebrate development. This process is controlled essentially by a single hormone, the thyroid hormone (T3), but involves drastically different changes in different tissues/organs (22Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Physiology of the Amphibia. 1976; (Academic Press, Inc., New York): 467-599Crossref Google Scholar, 23Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. 1999; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). Among the changes are total resorption of tadpole-specific organs such as the tail and gills, de novo development of frog-specific organs like the limbs, and remodeling of the vast majority of the organs into their frog forms. Given the complex changes, it is not surprising that a number of MMPs are activated by T3 during metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis and Rana catesbeiana (24Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev.

Of special interest is the fact that the expression of the Xenopus ST3 but not several other MMPs correlates tightly with larval or tadpole cell death (apoptosis) in different organs during metamorphosis (24Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Ishizuya-Oka A. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B.

Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis showed that, like the mammalian ST3, the frog ST3 is also expressed specifically in the fibroblasts, which underlie or surround the apoptotic cells during metamorphosis (24Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Ishizuya-Oka A. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B.

Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).To determine how ST3 gene is spatially and temporally regulated by T3 during frog development, we have previously characterized the promoter of the Xenopus ST3 gene (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We failed to identify any functional T3 response element (TRE) within 1000 bp upstream of the transcription start site even though expression analyses indicates that the ST3 gene is regulated by T3 directly at the transcription level through T3 receptors (TRs) (24Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that identification of a TRE consists of two near perfect direct repeats of AGGTCA separated by 4 bp, i.e. a DR4 (direct repeats with a 4-bp spacing) element, located in the large first intron. We show that this TRE binds to the heterodimers of TR and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it mediates T3 induction of the ST3 promoter in the context of chromatin in vivo, suggesting that it is responsible for the up-regulation of the ST3 gene by T3 during metamorphosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSPromoter Constructs—The construct bearing the HindIII fragment of the ST3 promoter (–985 to +25) driving luciferase gene was described before (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An EcoRI fragment encompassing the promoter region was subcloned from a λ genomic clone (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The subclone was sequenced on both strands and found to contain the sequence from –4340 to +1042, the end of the first exon (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and an additional 767 bp of the first intron.The construct pCR-ST3M1-luc (pM1) for transcriptional assay was generated through a PCR-mediated mutagenesis strategy. In brief, a fragment containing the ST3 promoter, the first exon, and the putative TRE (corresponding to DR4 in Fig. 1) within the first intron was amplified from X. laevis genomic DNA in the first PCR reaction (PCR 1) using primers P46 (bearing AccI, ClaI, and AseI at its 5′-end) and primer P47 (Table 1). A fragment encompassing the junction of the first intron and the second exon of ST3 gene was amplified from X. laevis genomic DNA in a separate PCR reaction (PCR 2) using primers P48 and P49 (Table 1). Both PCR products were gel-purified, and an aliquot of each was mixed and subjected to another PCR amplification (PCR 3) with primers P46 and P49 to produce a mutated ST3 promoter fragment (ST3M1) through the overlapped region in primers P47 and P48. Similarly, a fragment containing the coding region of firefly luciferase was amplified from pGL3 DNA (Promega) with primers P50 and P51 in PCR 4, and a fragment encompassing the SV40 poly(A) signal was amplified from pST65T-C1 (Clontech) with primers P52 and HA4 in PCR 5. Both PCR products were gel-purified and mixed together as the template in PCR 6 with primers P50 and HA4 to fuse the SV40 poly(A) signal to the end of luciferase gene through the overlapped regions in primers P50 and P51. Finally, PCR 7 was set up to amplify the entire expression unit containing the mutated promoter ST3m1 driving the expression of the luciferase followed by SV40 poly(A) signal (ST3M1-luc) with primers P46 and HA4 by using mixed aliquots of gel-purified products of PCR 3 and PCR 6 as the templates through the overlapped region in primers P49 and P50. All the PCR reactions were performed with Pfu polymerase (Promega) to minimize mutations during PCR. The final PCR fragment was ligated into pCR Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen), transformed into competent Escherichia coli TOP 10 cells, and spread on LB plates containing kanamycin. Clones were screened by colony PCR with primers P48 and P49. Positive clones (pM1) were selected to prepare small amounts of DNA and subjected to sequencing to confirm the sequence.TABLE 1Primers used in preparing promoter constructsPrimerSequence (5′ to 3′)P465′ -GTC GAC ATC GAT TAA TGC TTA AAG TTA TTA GTG ATC CAG G-3′P475′ -GGT AGG GCC TGG GTT TTC AAG TGT ATC TAC C-3′P485′ -GGT AGA TAC ACT TGA AAA CCC AGG CCC TAC CGC ACA TAT AGA ATA GA-3′P495′ -ACC GGT AGC GCT CCT TTA TAT GAG GAT AAT GTA ATG-3′P505′ -CAT TAC ATT ATC CTC ATA TAA AGG AGC GCT ACC GGT ACT GTT GGT AAA GCC ACC A-3′P515′ -GAA TTC AGA TCT TAC ACG GCG ATC TTT CCG CCC TTC-3′P525′ -CGG AAA GAT CGC CGT GTA AGA TCT GAA TTC TGA TCA TAA TCA GCC ATA CCA CAT-3′HA45′ -CTA TAG AAT GCA GTG AAA AAA ATG C-3′P535′ -TGC TGA AGG TAC TCC TCT CTG CCT TTT GTT CTC-3′P545′ -GAG AAC AAA AGG CAG AGA GGA GTA CCT TCA GCA CAG AAT CCA GGT AAG-3′P615′ -TGC TGA AGG GCG GAG GAG CTG TCC GGT GCT-3′P625′ -GAC AGC TCC TCC GCC CTT CAG CAC AGA ATC CAG GTA AG-3′P635′ -CTA TCT ACC TCA AAT CTC ACC TTA ACT GAC CTT CAG GCT GAA CCC CCC TA GCG GAG GAG CTG TCC GGT GCT-3′P645′ -TAA GGT GAG ATT TGA GGT AGA TAC AGC GCT ACC GGT ACT GTT GGT AAA GCC ACC A-3′P915′ -GCT TTG ATG TAG TCC TTT GTT CCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Deletions were introduced into pM1 through PCR-mediated mutagenesis strategy as above, with primers P46, P53, P54, and HA4 to generate pM2, with primers P46, P61, P62, and HA4 to generate pM3, and with primers P46, P63, P64, and HA4 to generate pM4. A fragment encompassing –985 to +499 was also amplified from X. laevis genomic DNA with primers P46 and P91, digested with SalI, gel-purified, and inserted into pre-digested (SalI and AfeI double digestion) pM1 DNA bearing a SalI and a blunt end to produce the construct pW.Transcription Assay in Xenopus Oocyte—The cytoplasm of stage VI oocytes from adult X. laevis (Nasco) was injected with 5.75 ng/oocyte mRNAs for FLAG-tagged TR and RXR (36Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The firefly luciferase reporter under the control of the ST3 promoter (0.33 ng/oocyte) (pW, pM1, -2, -3, and -4) and the control vector phRG-TK (0.03 ng/oocyte) (Promega), which contained the Renilla luciferase under the control of the T3-independent TK promoter, were co-injected into the germinal vesicle (nucleus) after mRNA injection. After overnight incubation at 18°C, 6 oocytes per sample were lysed by pipetting in 90 μl of 1× lysis buffer from the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), and 7.5 μl of the lysate was used for each luciferase assay. Triplicate assays were performed at the same time, and the experiments were repeated three times. The relative expression of firefly luciferase from the reporter plasmid to Renilla luciferase from the control plasmid was determined and reported here.Gel Mobility Shift Assay—After overnight incubation, stage VI oocytes injected with mRNAs for TR and RXR were lysed to prepare oocyte extract for gel mobility shift assay with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides DR2, DR4, or DR6 in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides as described (37Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were (with the direct repeats in bold letters) ST3TRE1A (5′-AGCTGAAGGTCAGTTAAGGTGAGA-3′) and ST3TRE1B (5′-AGCTTCTCACCTTAACTGACCTTC-3′) for DR4, ST3TRE2A (5′-AGCTTCAGGTGAACAGGACACC-3′) and ST3TRE2B (5′-AGCTGGTGTCCT-GTTCACCTGA-3′) for DR2, and ST3TRE3A (5′-AGCTCGAGGTCAGGGAACAGGTAAGC-3′) and ST3TRE3B (5′-AGCTGCTTACCTGTTCCCTGACCTCG-3′) for DR6.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay on oocyte samples for TR binding or the recruitment of corepressors was done as described (36Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Obata K. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30788-30795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The precipitated DNA was PCR-amplified with the PCR primers 5′-CAG CAC AGA ATC CAG GTA AG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAA ACC CTA ACC ACC GCT TA-3′ (reverse). Note that the forward and reverse primers recognize ST3 promoter and pGL2 vector sequences in pW, respectively, thus amplifying only the plasmid DNA rather than genomic DNA of the oocyte. Amplified DNA was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis. To quantitatively analyze the precipitated DNA, the samples were assayed by quantitative PCR on an ABI 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) (39Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The primers and probe for the ST3 TRE region were 5′-ACA CTC ACC CTA CAG CTT GTG-3′ (forward primer), 5′-CCA AGT ACA CAC AGT GCA GGT A-3′ (reverse primer), and 5′-AAG GAT GAG GAG ATG CAT TC-3′ (probe) (labeled with reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein and reporter nonfluorescent quencher).RT-PCR—Total RNA from injected oocytes was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Texas) to remove any DNA contamination and re-purified with TRIzol reagent. RT-PCR was performed by using Superscript One-Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen) by using 0.1 μg of total RNA as described (40Buchholz D.R. Hsia V.S.-C. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6750-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The primer pair (forward, 5′-CCT TCA GCA CAG AAT CCA G-3′ (corresponding to the end of exon 1 of the ST3 gene), and reverse, 5′-CTT TTT GGA AAC GAA CAC CAC G-3′ (located in firefly luciferase coding region)) was used in RT-PCR for detecting spliced RNA generated from the transcripts of ST3 promoter constructs. When indicated, the primer pair 5′-GCGAAGAGGGCGAGAAAATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGTTGCGGACAATCTGGACG-3′ (reverse) for Renilla luciferase was also included in the RT-PCR as an internal control. The RT-PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, visualized with ethidium bromide staining under UV lights, and photographed with a Kodak imaging system (Gel Logic 100 Imaging System, Eastman Kodak Co.).RESULTSA DR4-type TRE Is Located Downstream of the First Exon of ST3 Gene—In our previous transfection studies of the ST3 promoter in tissue culture cells, we failed to detect significant T3 induction of the promoter with constructs that included sequences from more than 4 kilobases upstream (to the EcoRI site, Fig. 1A) to about 500 bp downstream (to HindIII site, Fig. 1A) of the transcription start site (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results may suggest either that the TRE in the ST3 gene is located upstream of –4000 or downstream of +500 or that the ST3 gene is not a direct T3 response gene despite the apparent resistance of its up-regulation by T3 treatment to protein synthesis inhibition (26Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a TRE may be present but too far away from the start site to have a significant effect on the promoter activity in the transient transfection assay in tissue culture cells (possibly due to the lack of proper chromatin organization that is normally present in somatic cells). Thus, we sequenced a genomic subclone containing the 5 kilobases EcoRI fragment flanking the transcription start site as well as the region preceding exon 2 (Fig. 1, A–D, GenBank™ accession number AF019253). Because DNA elements made of two direct repeats or inverted repeats of AGGTCA or highly related sequences are known to be binding sites for nuclear hormone receptors, we searched for such sequences and identified 3 DNA elements made of two near perfect direct repeats of AGGTCA separated by 2, 4, or 6 bp (DR2, DR4, DR6), respectively (Fig. 1 B and C). The DR2 and DR6 elements are located upstream of the start site (not shown), and the DR4 is located downstream of the start site within the first intron and about 3.3 kilobases away from intron 1/exon 2 junction (Fig. 1, C and D) (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Because DNA elements of DR4 type are known to bind to TR/RXR heterodimers strongly, we investigated whether the DR elements in the ST3 gene were capable of binding to TR/RXR. Thus, we micro-injected mRNAs for TR and RXR into the frog oocytes and isolated oocyte extract after overnight incubation to allow the synthesis of the receptors. Gel mobility shift assay with the oocyte extracts and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the DR2, DR4, and DR6 sequences of the ST3 gene revealed that DR4 bound to TR/RXR heterodimer strongly, whereas no significant binding was detected with the DR2 and DR6 elements (Fig. 2A). To further investigate the binding of these DR elements to TR/RXR, 32P-labeled DR4 TRE of the ST3 gene was incubated with oocyte extracts in the presence of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors, and the resulting mixtures were analyzed by gel mobility shift assay. The results showed that the DR4-TR ·RXR complex was not competed by as much as a 50-fold excess of a mutated version of the TRE oligonucleotide derived from the T3-inducible promoter of the X. laevis TRβA (37Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5) or the DR2 or DR6 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–11). On the other hand, the complex was competed by unlabeled DR4 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B, lanes 15–17) as efficiently as by the TRE of the X. laevis TRβA promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 12–14), a well characterized strong TRE of the DR4 type (41Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that both the DR4 TRE and TRβA TRE differ by only one nucleotide from the consensus TRE (two direct repeats of AGGTCA separated by 4 bp). These results suggest that the DR4 sequence of the ST3 gene is likely the element mediating the induction of the promoter by T3 through strong binding to TR/RXR.FIGURE 2DR4 but not DR2 or DR6 element in ST3 gene binds to TR/RXR complex in gel shift assay. A, labeled DR2, DR4, and DR6 elements were incubated with oocyte extract containing overexpressed TR/RXR, and the resulting mixtures was analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Note that only DR4 formed a stable complex with TR/RXR. B, specific competition for TR/RXR binding by ST3 DR4 element. Labeled ST3 DR4 element was incubated with TR/RXR extract in the presence of a 0, 5, 25, or 50-fold excess of indicated unlabeled competitors. The resulting mixture was analyzed as above. Note that only the upper band representing the DR4-TR ·RXR complex as seen in A was shown here. TRβ TRE and TRβ mTRE were wild type and mutant TRE (DR4 type) from the T3 regulated X. laevis TRβA gene promoter, respectively (41Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ST3 Promoter Responds to Liganded TR/RXR in Vivo—Although our previous transfection studies of the ST3 promoter in a frog tissue culture cells failed to show a T3 response even with a construct containing the DR4 sequence (35Li J. Liang V.C.-T. Sedgwick T. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it was possibly due to either that the TR/RXR levels in the cells were too low or to the lack of proper chromatin structure in the reporter plasmid in transiently transfected cells. Thus, we chose the Xenopus oocyte system to study the ST3 promoter. The frog oocyte has a large storage of all factors necessary for early embryo development but has little or no TR and RXR. This allows one to introduce TR and/or RXR by microinjecting their mRNAs to reconstitute a T3 responsive in vivo transcription system (37Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, any reporter plasmid injected into the frog oocyte nucleus will be chromatinized with a regular array of nucleosomes, thus enabling the study of gene regulation by TR/RXR in the context of chromatin (42Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).To study the regulation of ST3 promoter in the frog oocyte, we placed the ST3 promoter from –985 to +499, containing the first exon and part of the first intron (+276 to +499) that included the DR4 TRE at +389 to +404, in front of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (construct pW, Fig. 3A). We introduced FLAG-tagged TR and RXR into frog oocyte by microinjecting their mRNAs into the cytoplasm. Two hours later the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and an internal control plasmid, which contained the Renilla luciferase under the control of the T3-independent TK promoter, were coinjected into the oocyte nucleus. After overnight incubation in the presence or absence of T3, the oocytes were collected to assay for the activities of the firefly luciferase over those of the Renilla luciferase. The results showed that the expression of TR/RXR in the absence of T3 had little or a small rep"
https://openalex.org/W1981983543,"Anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were raised against phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K92) phosphorylation sites (Suer, S., Sickmann, A., Meyer, H. E., Herberg, F. W., and Heilmeyer, L. M. Jr. (2001) Eur. J. Biochem. 268, 2099–2106). Characterization proved three of them (anti-pSer-294, anti-pSer-496, and anti-pThr-504 antibody) to be highly specific, recognizing solely PI4K92 phosphorylated at these sites, respectively. Indirect immunofluorescence reveals that PI4K92 phosphorylated on Ser-294 localizes exclusively at the Golgi. The enzyme phosphorylated on Ser-496 and Thr-504 is detected in nuclear speckles. Phosphorylation of Ser-294 on PI4K92 increases the lipid kinase activity and thus serves better in maintaining Golgi function and morphology (compare Hausser, A., Storz, P., Martens, S., Link, G., Toker, A., and Pfizenmaier, K. (2005) Nat. Cell Biol. 7, 880–886). Microinjection of anti-pSer-496, but not of anti-pSer-294 or anti-pThr-504 antibody, into the cytoplasm or into the nucleus of HS68 cells leads to development of hotspots, probably representing aggregated PI4K92, and in later stages, cells become apoptotic and finally die. The association of phosphorylated PI4K92 with nuclear speckles is dynamic and follows the morphological alteration of speckles upon inhibition of mRNA transcription with α-amanitin. Overexpressed PI4K92 phosphorylated on Ser-294 is not transported to the nucleus, and that phosphorylated on Ser-496 is found in the nucleus and mislocalized at the Golgi complex. We conclude that nuclear phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and consequently, synthesis of polyphosphoinositides are required for a correct nuclear function. Anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were raised against phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K92) phosphorylation sites (Suer, S., Sickmann, A., Meyer, H. E., Herberg, F. W., and Heilmeyer, L. M.

We conclude that nuclear phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and consequently, synthesis of polyphosphoinositides are required for a correct nuclear function. In the past 20 years, evidence has been accumulated for the presence of intranuclear polyphosphoinositides that form the components of a phosphoinositide-phospholipase C cycle (for review, see Ref. 1Irvine R.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 349-360Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which is independent from that at the plasma and other cytoplasmic membranes (2Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F.

Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In a recent study, the pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase C δ1 has been used as a probe to show that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) 2The abbreviations used are: PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate; PtdIns(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; PIPK, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; LMB, leptomycin B; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HA, hemagglutinin.2The abbreviations used are: PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate; PtdIns(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; PIPK, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; LMB, leptomycin B; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HA, hemagglutinin. is present intranuclear and is not detectable in the nuclear membrane (4Watt S.A. Kular G. Fleming I.N. Downes C.P. Lucocq J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a monoclonal antibody used for indirect immunofluorescence staining procedures reveals PtdIns(4,5)P2 in distinct subnuclear domains, identified as “nuclear speckles” (Refs. 5Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and 6Osborne S.L. Thomas C.L. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. J.

Physiol. 1999; 181: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Most probably, these latter polyphosphoinositides are not present in membranes but are associated with proteins (2Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 3Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L.

J. 1987; 248: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In principal, it explains why they are not extractable with Triton X-100, which, however, completely removes the nuclear double membrane (9Cocco L. Gilmour R.S. Ognibene A. Letcher A.J. Manzoli F.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Several distinct functions are well known for polyphosphoinositides in the cytoplasm in addition to their role as precursor for the generation of second messengers, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. In the middle of the 1990s, it was revealed that PtdIns(4,5)P2 itself may serve as a regulator or effector molecule on its own right (for review, see ref. 10Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In many cell types, stimulation with growth factors or hormones results in marked changes in cellular morphology. This alteration is thought to be due to a rearrangement of actin via influencing actin-binding proteins such as profilin, cofilin, α-actinin, vinculin, talin, and ezerin by binding to polyphosphoinositides (11Isenberg G. Niggli V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 73-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 plays an important role in membrane trafficking. It is suggested to regulate exocytotic fusion of synaptic (glutamate release) and dense core vesicles (dopamine release) with the plasma membrane (12Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 13Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Besides PtdIns(4,5)P2, the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and the generating enzyme, phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase (PI4K), seem to be directly involved in secretion processes and have an essential role in regulating clathrin-dependent endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and endosome motility (14Wiedemann C. Schäfer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the alternative function of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the nucleus other than that it is a precursor in the phosphoinositide cycle. In nuclei stripped of their envelope with detergent, PI4K and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase as well as diacylglycerol kinase activities are reported to be associated with the nuclear matrix using biochemical approaches (18Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A.J. Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase C β as well as protein kinase C appear to co-localize on the nuclear matrix as shown by immunoelectron microscopy (3Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 19Zini N. Martelli A.M. Cocco L. Manzoli F.A. Maraldi N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More precisely, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase isoforms, type I, i.e. the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, and type II, i.e. the phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase, have been shown to be associated with nuclear speckles (5Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Molecular details of several PI4K isoforms are known today. These are PI4K230, PI4K92 (also known as PI4Kβ), and PI4K55 (for review, see Ref. 20Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By blocking nuclear export with leptomycin B (LMB), two of these isoforms have been shown to accumulate in the nucleus, PI4K230 (21Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Vereb G. Jr. Vereb G. Kakuk A. Szivak I. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and PI4K92 (17De Graaf P. Klapisz E.E. Schulz K.F. Cremers A.F.M. Verkleij A.J. Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, the native PI4K230 seems to be localized in the nucleolus, whereas no specific nuclear location has been reported for PI4K92. In addition, PI4K92 has been shown to exert an important function in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi complex (16Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G.G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the intact cell, we have shown that PI4K92 can be phosphorylated on eight sites; however, nothing is known on the function of these phosphorylation sites so far (22Suer S. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Herberg F.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we will demonstrate that specifically phosphorylated forms of PI4K92 are associated with speckles in the nucleus and that an alternatively phosphorylated form is associated with the Golgi apparatus in the cytoplasm. Moreover, injection of anti-PI4K92 antibodies directed against a specific phosphorylation site into the nucleus leads to cell death, underlying the important function of the PI4K92 for cell survival. Reagents—Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11), monoclonal antibody against nuclear envelope pore complex protein and polyclonal anti-giantin and anti-actin antibody were from Covance Inc. Anti-PI4Kβ antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-Sc-35 antibody was from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-golgin97 antibody and the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit and monoclonal anti-mouse antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Peroxidase-conjugated Protein A was from Pierce. Monoclonal antibodies against PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) were from Echelon. Cell culture material was from Sigma. Standard molecular biological tools were from Stratagene if not designated otherwise. All other chemicals were of high performance liquid chromatography or analytical grade. Phosphorylation State and Site-specific Antibody Production and Purification—Individually designed polyclonal anti-phosphopeptide anti-sera and synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of human PI4K92 were obtained from NEOSYSTEM (Strasbourg, France). The following phosphopeptides (and cognate non-phosphopeptides) were used: H+ -KRTAS(PO3)NPKVY-OH (pSer-294); H+-RRRLS(PO3)EQLAY-OH (pSer-496); and H+-AHTPT(PO3)AFKRY-OH (pThr-504), corresponding to the human PI4K92 sequence (22Suer S. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Herberg F.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two rabbits per site were immunized, and the collected immunesera were clarified by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate precipitation was carried out by standard procedure (23Javois L.C. Immunocytochemical Methods and Protocols. 1999; (2nd Ed., Humana Press, Totowa, NJ): 11-18Google Scholar). IgG fractions were subjected to affinity chromatography. Phosphopeptides and nonphosphopeptides were coupled with carbodiimide-activated EAH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions, at 7 mg/ml resin. Columns were reused several times and stored in water at 4 °C. Anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, 0.5 m NaCl buffer (pH 2.7) into tubes containing NaOH. Elution fractions of affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were stored at 4 °C in 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% Triton X-100 for up to 4 weeks. Immune response was monitored by ELISA. 0.1 mg/ml phosphopeptide as well as the corresponding non-phosphopeptide were dissolved in 100 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6, and microplate wells were coated overnight at room temperature. DNA Constructs—The human PI4K92 encoding pFastBAC-HTa construct was obtained from Suer (22Suer S. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Herberg F.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and amplified by PCR, generating new restriction sites as follows: KpnI primer (forward), 5′-CGGGGTACCGGAGATACAGTAG-3′, and NotI primer (reverse), 5′-TAAAGCGGCCGCATGATGCCGTT-3′. The 2428-bp PCR product (the complete coding region of the human PI4K92) was ligated with T4-DNA Ligase (Roche Applied Science) with KpnI/NotI restricted pHM6 mammalian expression vector (Roche Applied Science). The created construct is the pHM6+PI4K92 that was used to express PI4K92 tagged with an N-terminal HA tag (HA marker peptide: MWPWDVPDWA) and a C-terminal His6 tag in Cos7 cells, as wild type (PI4K92-WT). The constructs were verified by sequencing. The integrity and expression levels of the fusion proteins were assessed by Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody against HA (Convance) with cell lysate prepared from Cos7 cells transfected with the constructs. Total Cell Lysate and Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells were scraped into denaturating lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25%(w/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (final concentrations: 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and protein phosphatase inhibitors (final concentrations: 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaOV4, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 μm microcystin) or non-denaturating lysis buffer (instead of 0.25% SDS, 0.25% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40, it contained 1% Triton X-100). Cell homogenate was passed through a 26-gauge needle few times and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by the Lowry method. Collected supernatant of non denaturating cell lysate was employed for immunoprecipitation followed by lipid kinase activity assays. Aliquots of denaturating lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked using 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)(50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for at least 1 h at room temperature. As primary antibody, anti-PI4Kβ antibody was used at 0.1 μg/ml in 1% milk powder in TBS, or affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were used at 1–10 μg/ml. The membrane was rinsed two times and then washed three times in TBS for 10 min and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody using peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at the dilution of 0.005 μg/ml in 1% milk powder in TBS for 1 h. After washing, the binding of antibodies was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Advance; Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). For antibody blocking experiments, affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were preincubated for 2 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml respective phospho- or dephosphopeptide. Immunoabsorption—Unspecific binding sites of Sepharose beads conjugated with anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) were preblocked with 3% (v/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at 4 °C. 5 μg of anti-PI4Kβ or affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were added to equal protein concentration containing aliquots of cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. The antigen-antibody complex was collected by adding 40 μl of preblocked anti-rabbit antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads. Control experiments included mock immunoprecipitation in the absence of antibody and the use of anti-giantin IgG. After 2 h of incubation, beads were washed with 2 × 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, 2 × 0.5 ml of lysis buffer additionally containing 400 mm NaCl, and 2 × 0.5 ml of PBS. Samples were subjected to Western blot analyses, or alternatively, immunoadsorbents on Sepharose beads were analyzed for PI4K92 activity. PI4K92 Activity Assay and Product Analysis—Incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into extractable organic solvent material was measured as described previously (24Gehrmann T. Vereb G. Schmidt M. Klix D. Meyer H.E. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Produced phospholipids were extracted according to Ref. 25Schacht J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. The chloroform phase was transferred to scintillation vials or spotted onto TLC plates NH2 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Plates were developed in 1-propyl acetate/2-propanol/ethanol/6% aqueous ammonia (3:9:3:9, v/v) (26Hegewald H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and visualized by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Metabolic Labeling—Cos7 cells were grown on 10-cm diameter dishes. One day before phosphate deprivation, cells were transfected with 8 μg of PI4K92-WT plasmid DNA at a density of 80% confluence. At the start of phosphate deprivation, cells were washed three times with sodium phosphate- and sodium pyruvate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and than incubated for 10 min. After phosphate deprivation, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) at a concentration of 1 mCi/ml in phosphate-free medium containing 0.5% dialyzed serum for 4 h. After labeling, cells were incubated with 100 μm calyculin A in phosphate-free medium for 10 min followed by washing three times with ice-cold PBS containing calyculin A. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of denaturating lysis buffer. Metabolically labeled cell lysate was used for immunoabsorption followed by Western blotting. To detect the amount of PI4K92, the same membrane was probed with anti-PI4Kβ antibody (0.1 μg/ml) followed by detection with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Cell Treatments, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—Human skin fibroblasts, cell line HS68, and Cos7 cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. For immunofluorescence microscopy, Hs68 cells or transfected Cos7 cells were grown on chamber slides (Nunc) and were fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. After five washes with PBS (5 min each), fixed cells were incubated in blocking and permeabilization solution (5% serum from the host animal of the secondary antibody and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min. This solution was also used for diluting the primary and secondary antibodies. Cells were sequentially incubated with primary and then fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h, respectively, at a concentration suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 after antibody incubations. Following the last washing step, the cells were postfixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS and then mounted with ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). For inhibition of transcription, HS68 cells were grown on chamber slides and were treated with 10 μg/ml α-amanitin for 4 h before immunofluorescence staining. Cos7 cells were transiently transfected with constructs containing the HA-tagged PI4K92 wild type cDNA using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were used for immunofluorescence microscopy or to analyze the CRM1-dependent nuclear export, where cells were treated with 5 ng/ml LMB (Sigma) for 2 h before immunofluorescence staining (27Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Optical sections were captured with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss Axioplan LSM 510) using ×100/1.3 (oil immersion lens) objective and a krypton argon laser to simultaneously excite Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 dye at 488 and 568 nm, respectively. Emissions were collected with filters BP 505-550 for Alexa Fluor 488 and LP 585 for Alexa Fluor 594. Microscopic images were obtained by using Confocal Assistant LSM 5.0 software and processed in Corel Photo Paint 12. Microinjection—HS68 cells were microinjected as described previously (28Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed at different times after injection and stained for the localization of microinjected anti-phosphopeptide antibodies using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit antibody or for the microinjected anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 and anti-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 antibodies using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse antibody. The chromatin was stained with Hoechst stain (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma), applied just before cells were mounted, and observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Determination of Cell Death—Cells were observed in 2-h intervals from 2 to 18 h after microinjection. Microinjected cells were detected by the fluorescent marker injected with the antibody (Texas Red-conjugated dextran). Microinjected cells with prominent nucleolar coalescence (as determined by phase contrast microscopy) and (after 14 h) detectable loss of adhesion were counted in a defined area. The levels of cell death were calculated as the percentage of cells showing both nuclear fragmentation and loss in cell adhesion in comparison with the background uninjected cells. As a control, a similar number of cells were injected with the same antibody after heat inactivation. Anti-phosphopeptide Antibodies Specifically Recognize Phosphorylated Forms of PI4K92—Anti-phosphopeptide sequence-specific antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptides covalently coupled to ovalbumin. Each peptide was built of four amino acids up- and downstream of the phosphoamino acid according to the described specific amino acid sequences of PI4K92 (22Suer S. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Herberg F.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was certified that these peptides are unique among known phosphopeptide sequences and that they are a typical feature of PI4K92 according to BLASTP 2.2.5. data base search (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59338) Google Scholar). In the ELISA tests, affinity-purified antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”), anti-pSer-294 (Fig. 1A, panel I), anti-pSer-496 (Fig. 1A, panel II), and anti-pThr-504 antibodies (Fig. 1A, panel III), react exclusively with the relevant phosphopeptides but not with the dephosphopeptides. Preimmune sera show no immunoreactivity. A commercially available anti-PI4Kβ antibody directed against residues 410–537 of human PI4K92, including the phosphorylation sites pSer-496 and pThr-504, does not yield a signal neither with the appropriate phosphopeptide nor with dephosphopeptide (not shown). In whole cell extracts prepared from HS68 human fibroblast cells (Fig. 1B), these three above mentioned affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antibodies selectively detect a 92-kDa protein corresponding to PI4K92, which was certified with the commercially available antibody against human PI4K92 (anti-PI4Kβ, later termed control antibody). In Cos7 cells containing recombinant PI4K92 (Fig. 1B), only the anti-pSer-294 and the anti-pSer-496 antibody detect the 92-kDa protein, whereas no reactivity was observed with the anti-pThr-504 antibody. Immunolabeling of the 92-kDa PI4K is inhibited by preincubation of antibodies with the appropriate phosphopeptide but is unaffected by preincubation with dephosphopeptide (Fig. 1B). Transfected Cos7 cells overexpressing wild type PI4K92 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (see “Materials and Methods”). A radioactively labeled 92-kDa protein is immunoabsorbed with anti-pSer-294 and anti-pSer-496 antibodies as well as with the control anti-PI4K92 antibody (Fig. 1C, X-ray). The protein bands detected by autoradiography were identified as PI4K92 by Western blotting with the control antibody (Fig. 1C, WB). In agreement with the Western blotting experiments reported in Fig. 1B, no reactivity was shown with the anti-pThr-504 antibody. Anti-phosphopeptide-antibodies immunoabsorb lipid kinase activity (Fig. 1D) from HS68 cell lysate prepared under non-denaturating conditions. More of the lipid kinase activity is precipitated with anti-pSer-294 antibody than with the control anti-PI4K92 antibody (defined as 100%). The anti-pSer-496 antibody precipitates approximately an equal amount of kinase activity, whereas anti-pThr-504 antibody yields much less. Based on parallel Western blotting experiments, it can be shown that the majority of the PI4K92 protein was obtained with the control anti-PI4K92 antibody (Fig. 1E), whereas anti-pSer-294 as well as anti-pSer-496 and anti-pThr-504 antibodies immunoabsorb much less (Fig. 1E). The assay for PI4K activity contains 0.4% Triton X-100 to block phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In agreement, all of the immunoprecipitated PI4K92 enzymes produce exclusively PtdIns(4)P. In a TLC system that allows separation of D3 and D4 phosphorylated derivatives, only the D4 phosphorylated species is detected (not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that these affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antibodies selectively and specifically recognize their and just their adequate phosphorylation site of native PI4K92; thus, they are suitable for localization studies by immunocytochemistry. Native Specifically Phosphorylated PI4K92 Reveals Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Localization—Immunofluorescent staining with affinity-purified anti-pSer-294 antibody shows the presence of Ser-294 phosphorylated PI4K92 at the Golgi structure (Fig. 2a). The identified subcellular structure is verified by merging the images obtained with anti-pSer-294 antibody with that of the Golgi marker, anti-Golgin97 antibody (Fig. 2c). When the anti-pSer-294 antibody was preincubated with an excess of phosphopeptide encompassing the Ser-294 phosphorylation site, this Golgi-associated staining disappeared completely (Fig. 2d), whereas incubation of the marker antibody retained the Golgi staining pattern (Fig. 2e). In agreement, no change is observed by merging the two micrographs (Fig. 2f). Thus, the phosphopeptide itself does not prevent the Golgi staining. No change in staining pattern was observed by preincubation with dephosphopeptide (not shown). The anti-pSer-496 antibody recognizes a speckled nuclear component (Fig. 3a). Indeed, as revealed in the merged image, anti-pSer-496 antibody co-localizes with a marker antibody directed against a splicing factor, Sc-35, which is a subcomponent of nuclear speckles (Fig. 3c.). Thus, in the nuclear speckles, the Ser-496"
https://openalex.org/W1984275426,"The crystal structure of the yeast galactokinase, Gal1p, in the presence of its substrates has been solved recently. We systematically mutated each of the amino acid side chains that, from the structure, are implicated to be involved in direct contact with the hydroxyl groups of the galactose ring. One of these mutations, D62A, abolished all detectable galactokinase activity but retained the ability to use d-glucose as a substrate. Mutation of Asp-62 to either leucine, phenylalanine, or histidine resulted in the formation of protein with similar characteristics to D62A. Yeast galactokinase is highly similar to Gal3p, the ligand sensor and transcriptional inducer of the GAL genes. Equivalent mutations in Gal3p also abolished its ability to respond to galactose and uncovered its ability to respond to d-glucose. It therefore appears that Gal1p and Gal3p respond to their substrates in a similar, perhaps identical, fashion. This work also validates the approach of screening for mutants in an easily assayable system prior to mutant analysis in a more experimentally difficult transcriptional regulator."

Unusual physical properties of CAG repeat tracts are thought to contribute to their instability. We investigated whether their unusual properties alter the organization of CAG repeat tract chromatin.

Long CAG repeat tracts cause more than 10 human hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and a number of hereditary ataxias (1Everett C.M. Wood N.W. Brain. 2004; 127: 2385-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Disease-causing repeat tracts are dynamic mutations that frequently expand during parental passage. The length of CAG repeat tracts correlate with their instability and with the severity and early onset of the disease. The underlying cause of CAG repeat tract instability and propensity to expand may be their ability to assume unusual DNA structures. First, single strands of CAG and its complement CTG can undergo intramolecular base pairing to form hairpin structures, and this is thought to interfere with their replication when the parental strands are unwound (2Mitas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 3Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T.

Second, double strand CAG repeat tracts may also have novel physical properties. For example, duplex CAG tracts have unusually rapid electrophoretic mobility that is proposed to result from a high degree of flexibility (5Bacolla A. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Kang S.

Biol. 1998; 275: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The physical properties of duplex CAG repeat tracts may be important for how CAG repeat tracts are packaged in chromatin. Studies carried out with purified histone cores show that they bind preferentially to CAG repeat tracts in comparison to random sequence DNA (8Mulvihill D.J. Edamura K.N. Hagerman K.A. Pearson C.E.

Curiously, repeat tracts as small as 6 units bind octamer cores, and the affinity of binding does not increase with tract length (9Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results have been taken to mean that CAG repeat tracts may position nucleosomes (9Godde J.S.

In this study we have revisited the issue of chromatin organization of CAG repeat tracts by attempting to directly assess nucleosome positioning in vivo. In doing so we have discovered that repeat tracts are bound by a high mobility group (HMG) 2The abbreviations used are: HMG, high mobility group; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IEL, indirect end labeling; AD, activation domain.2The abbreviations used are: HMG, high mobility group; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IEL, indirect end labeling; AD, activation domain. box protein that forms the basis of their unusual chromatin organization. Yeast Strains—All yeast strains in this study were derived from strains SSL204 (14Dornfeld K.J. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or PJ69-4 (15James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain CAG325-126 was generated by one-step gene replacement of trp1-101 in SSL204 with an ARS1-TRP1 fragment in which a CAG repeat tract of 126 repeat units was placed into the NheI site. The repeat tract is oriented so that the strand containing CAG is the lagging strand template when replication begins at ARS1. Derivatives of CAG325-126 with shorter tract lengths were generated by taking advantage of the propensity of yeast to contract long CAG repeat tracts. HMO1 was deleted from strain SSL204 and its derivatives by one-step gene replacement using amplified PCR products of the KanMX4 cassette knock-out of HMO1 (Open Biosystems YSC 1021). Strains CAG101 and SSL520 msh2Δ were previously described (16Schweitzer J.K. Livingston D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Maurer D.J. O'Callaghan B.L. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6617-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Strain Y1H was derived from strain PJ69-4 (15James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by substituting the upstream-activating elements of the GAL promoter regions of ADE2 and lacZ with a CAG repeat tract of 130 repeat units by two-step gene replacement. Nuclei Isolation and Fnu4HI Digestion—Yeast nuclei were isolated based on the method described by Almer et al. (18Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Nuclei prepared by this method were washed in Fnu4HI digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-Ac (pH 7.9), 50 mm KOAc, 10 mm MgAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol), centrifuged, and suspended in Fnu4HI digestion buffer (∼5 ml/g cell). Nuclei in 0.2 ml were digested with 5 or 10 units of Fnu4HI at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of the same volume of stop solution (2% SDS, 50 mm EDTA) followed by incubation with 2 mg/ml proteinase K at 65 °C for 2 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was hydrated in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA). Indirect End Labeling—Purified DNA was digested with EcoRI or EcoRV for the repeat tract embedded at ARS1-TRP1, BanI for the repeat tract located within ADE2, and NheI or AvaII for the SPC25 sequence. Fragments were subjected to electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel and transferred to MagnaGraph nylon membrane (Osmonics) by capillary blotting. DNA fragments were hybridized by standard methods with appropriate probes and detected using a PhosphorImager (Fuji). To determine the distance between Fnu4HI digestion sites, we first determined the length of the repeat tract by PCR and electrophoresis of the PCR products through a DNA sequencing gel (supplemental Fig. 1). After Fnu4HI digestion of the chromatin, electrophoresis, and indirect end labeling, the lengths of the observed fragments were calculated using the ImageGage program (Fuji) (supplemental Fig. 2). Yeast One-hybrid Screen—Strain Y1H was transformed with yeast two-hybrid libraries Y2H-C1, Y2H-C2, and Y2H-C3 (15James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using LiAc (19Gietz R. Schiestl R. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SC-Ade plates followed by a filter-lift assay. Plasmids were isolated from yeast colonies using the yeast DNA preparation kit (Gentra Systems) and then transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 blue electrocompetent cells (Stratagene). Finally, plasmids were purified from bacterial cells and sequenced using the primer pGAD-seq 5′-TTCGATGATGAAGATACC-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—HMO1, including 823 bp of sequence upstream of the start codon, was cloned into pRS316 (20Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 191: 302-318Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Three FLAG epitopes were appended to the C terminus as described previously (21Asleson E.N. Livingston D.M. Genetics. 2003; 163: 91-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final plasmid was transformed into CAG325-126 hmo1Δ. ChIP was performed using the methods developed by Strahl-Bolsinger et al. (22Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes. Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) as modified by Ricke and Bielinsky (23Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.-K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) using the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Precipitated DNA prepared by this method was hydrated in 50 μl of TE buffer. Prior to the PCR, template DNA was further diluted to 1:10 for the input DNA and 1:2 for immunoprecipitated samples. The PCR primers were as follows: for amplification of the CAG repeat tract, ChIP-CAG 5′-CTTGCTAGCCCGGGACACAAGGCT-3′ and ChIP-CTG 5′-AAGGCTAGCGGAGCCTGCTGAGGT-3′; for amplification of the ADE2 locus, ADE2-3012L 5′-GCATTGGCGACTCCAGGTTCCTC-3′ and ADE2-3469R 5′-CCTTTTACGGGCACACCGATGAC-3′; for amplification of the SPC25 locus, SPC25-1027L 5′-CCTTGAGCGCCGGATGGACGG-3′ and SPC25-1511R 5′-CCAGCAGCGTGAATCATCGCCG-3′; and for amplification of DNA from the diploid containing a repeat tract and a fragment of ADE2 located adjacent to TRP-ARS1, TRP1-1A 5′-AAGAGAATGTTCACAGGCGCATACG-3′ and TRP1-1D 5′-TTACGAGGATACGGAGAGAGGTATG-3′. The ADE2 sequence between primers ADE2-3012L and ADE23469R was cloned by including an NheI target sequence at the 5′-end of each primer. Long CAG Repeat Tracts Have a Noncanonical Chromatin Organization—To investigate the chromatin organization of long CAG repeat tracts, we first generated strain CAG325-126 by embedding a CAG tract of 126 repeat units (378 bp) adjacent to ARS1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV (Fig. 1A). We performed indirect end labeling (IEL) by digesting nuclei with an endonuclease, purifying the DNA, and cutting with a restriction enzyme that flanks the repeat tract. For our analyses we used two probes labeled RI and RV that flank the repeat tract on either side (Fig. 1A). Although micrococcal nuclease has been used for many nucleosome phasing studies, CAG repeat tracts do not digest well with micrococcal nuclease, and this endonuclease could not be used in our studies (supplemental Fig. 3). Instead, we employed the restriction enzyme Fnu4HI that recognizes the pentanucleotide GCNGC. Fnu4HI efficiently digests the CAG repeat tract in naked DNA and does not appear to cleave preferentially at any site within the tract (Fig. 1, B and C). Digestion of chromatin with Fnu4HI reveals four hypersensitive sites, two at the ends of the repeat tract (Fig. 1, B and C, sites a and d) and two within the repeat tract (Fig. 1, B and C, sites b and c). The hypersensitivity is striking because DNA bound by core histone octamers is refractory to restriction enzyme digestion (24Vicent G.P. Nacht A.S. Smith C.L. Peterson C.L. Dimitrov S. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 439-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Chafin D.R. Vitolo J.M. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5492-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We calculated that these sites are ∼125 bp (±15 bp) apart. The 125-bp separation is distinctly shorter than the 165-bp repeat distance of canonical yeast nucleosomes (26Lowary P.T. Widom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8266-8270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Thomas J. Furber V. FEBS Lett. 1976; 66: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A shorter tract of 78 repeat units (234 bp) in strain CAG325-78 yields a pattern with hypersensitive sites 110 bp (±10 bp) apart, two near the edges of the repeat tract and one inside the tract (Fig. 1D). (The hypersensitive site at the distal end of the repeat tract was confirmed by probing from the opposite direction.) To confirm that this unusual pattern of digestion is not specific to the chromosomal locus, we repeated the analysis with a CAG repeat tract placed at another locus. This was important because the placement of the CAG repeat tract in strain CAG325 is adjacent to ARS1, and this replication origin is known to establish a pattern of phased nucleosomes that might affect the chromatin organization of the adjacent CAG repeat tract (28Lipford J.R. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29Thoma F. Bergman L.W. Simpson R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 715-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consequently, we performed IEL analysis with chromatin isolated from strain CAG101 in which a CAG repeat tract is embedded within ADE2 and placed at ARO2 in chromosome VII (17Maurer D.J. O'Callaghan B.L. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6617-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this strain the CAG repeat tract of 78 repeat units is located greater than 1 kb from a replication origin (30Stotz A. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Digestion of chromatin from this strain with Fnu4HI generates three hypersensitive sites. Two are close to the edges of the repeat tract and the other is ∼110 bp (±10 bp) from the first site (Fig. 1E). The CAG repeat chromatin at the aro2::ADE2 locus has an almost identical pattern of Fnu4HI-hypersensitive sites as the pattern generated by the repeat tract of 78 repeat units adjacent to ARS1 (Fig. 1D). These results show that the Fnu4HI digestion pattern is not locus-specific and that CAG repeat tracts are not likely to be condensed by canonical nucleosomes composed of histone octamer cores. A Yeast One-hybrid Screen Identifies Hmo1 as a CAG Repeat Tract-binding Protein—Based on the noncanonical endonuclease digestion pattern, we speculated that proteins other than (or in addition to) core histones bind, either directly or indirectly, to CAG repeat tracts and contribute to the unusual chromatin organization. To identify specific proteins, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screen (31Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For this study, we modified a standard yeast two-hybrid strain (labeled Y2H) by substituting a CAG repeat tract of 130 repeat units for the upstream-activating elements of the GAL promoter in front of two reporter genes, ADE2 and lacZ (Fig. 2A) (15James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This one-hybrid strain (labeled Y1H) was transformed with yeast genomic libraries Y2H-C1, Y2H-C2, and Y2H-C3 previously prepared for two-hybrid analyses in which yeast genes were fused to the GAL activation domain (AD) (15James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of 2 × 105 transformants, 72 were both Ade2+ and positive for β-galactosidase activity. Upon retesting, the clones that gave the strongest signals contained the entire sequence of HMO1 fused to the GAL activation domain by a bridge of 10 amino acid residues. HMO1 encodes a high mobility group box protein in yeast that binds to single and double strand DNA (32Lu J. Kobayashi R. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33678-33685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Kamau E. Bauerle K.T. Grove A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55234-55240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To confirm that reporter expression results from Hmo1 association with the CAG repeat tract, and not to cryptic promoters near the reporter genes, we transformed the HMO1-AD plasmid into the original yeast two-hybrid strain, containing the GAL promoters in front of the two reporter genes. If reporter expression in Y1H results from the Hmo1-AD fusion protein binding to the CAG repeat tract, neither reporter gene should be expressed in the Y2H strain. Indeed, Y2H transformed with the HMO1-AD plasmid fails to grow, whereas the Y1H strain grows when transformed with the same plasmid (Fig. 2B). The vector containing the GAL AD alone does not support growth of either strain (Fig. 2B). Both Y1H and Y2H transformed with either plasmid grow on leucine-deficient media as expected (Fig. 2C). These results support the conclusion that Hmo1 promotes reporter expression in the Y1H strain by binding directly to the CAG repeat tracts or to proteins that themselves bind directly. CAG Repeat Tracts Can Be Precipitated by Antibodies Directed against Epitope-tagged Hmo1—To confirm the interaction of Hmo1 with CAG repeat tracts, we carried out ChIP (Fig. 3). We tagged Hmo1 with three FLAG epitopes at the C-terminal end of HMO1 (Hmo1-FL) and expressed the tagged protein in an hmo1 deletion strain (CAG325-126 hmo1Δ). Hmo1-FL is functional because its expression rescues the retarded growth phenotype of the hmo1 deletion strain (data not shown (32Lu J. Kobayashi R. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33678-33685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). When we subjected Hmo1-FL-expressing cells that had been treated with formaldehyde to ChIP using a FLAG-specific antibody, CAG repeat DNA was precipitated (Fig. 3B). To show the specificity of the precipitation and the affinity of the interaction, we tested two other genomic sequences. We used a portion of ADE2 that has GC content of 44.5% and a portion of SPC25 that has a 56% GC content. Neither sequence precipitates as efficiently as CAG repeat DNA. These comparisons are justified because we carried out PCRs using two dilutions of template DNA and a limited number of PCR cycles such that the amount of PCR product is proportional to the amount of template precipitated by the antibody. Additionally, when wild-type cells lacking Hmo1-FL were subjected to ChIP, none of the fragments precipitated, showing the necessity and specificity of the antibody precipitation. The affinity of the interaction between Hmo1 and the CAG repeat tract is further evidenced by coprecipitation from cells that had not been treated with the cross-linking agent formaldehyde (Fig. 3B). This non-cross-linked chromatin was prepared in a solution with a moderate salt concentration (140 mm NaCl) and a high detergent concentration (1% Triton X-100) that should disrupt weak interactions. The ability to immunoprecipitate the CAG repeat tract without the need to cross-link the protein to the DNA indicates the high affinity that Hmo1 has for the CAG repeat tract. To investigate further the affinity of the association, we immunoprecipitated Hmo1-FL from a hmo1Δ/hmo1Δ diploid strain in which one copy of chromosome IV bears a CAG repeat tract of 55 repeat units within the NheI site adjacent to ARS1, and the other copy of chromosome IV harbors a 497-bp segment from ADE2 cloned into the same NheI site. A larger percentage of the chromosomal DNA containing the repeat tract is precipitated than the chromosomal DNA containing the ADE2 fragment (Fig. 3C). Another indication of the affinity of Hmo1 is the ability to precipitate repeat tracts at different chromosomal locations and to short repeat tracts. The one-hybrid studies show that it binds either directly or indirectly to long repeat tracts embedded in the GAL2 and GAL7 promoter sequences in front of the ADE2 and lacZ reporters, respectively. In addition, precipitation of Hmo1 from chromatin prepared from a strain with a repeat tract of 78 repeat units located in the ARO2 locus on yeast chromosome VII also brings down the repeat tract (Fig. 3D). This shows that chromosomal context does not affect the affinity of Hmo1 for CAG repeat tracts. To examine the issue of repeat tract length on Hmo1 affinity, we noted that two of our chromatin preparations from CAG325-126 contained a substantial portion of repeat tracts that had contracted during the growth of the culture, in one case to 15 repeat units and in the other to 30 repeat units (Fig. 4A). Neither appears to precipitate as well as the 126-repeat unit tract. Because long tracts are not as good PCR templates as shorter tracts and because antibody precipitation might favor longer tracts that have multiple copies of Hmo1 associated with them, we carried out a more systematic study with repeat tracts of 54, 35, and 26 repeat units (Fig. 4B). All three repeat tracts precipitate, showing that Hmo1 binds to tracts that comprise as few as 78 bp, shorter than the length of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer core. Thus, Hmo1 likely binds to tracts of different lengths and locations. Deletion of HMO1 Alters the Chromatin Structure of CAG Repeat Tracts—Both the yeast one-hybrid screen and the ChIP analysis provide clear evidence that Hmo1 interacts with CAG repeat tracts. To determine whether Hmo1 is responsible for the unusual chromatin organization of long CAG repeat tracts that we detected by Fnu4HI digestion, we performed IEL on the CAG repeat chromatin from the derivative of CAG325-126 in which HMO1 had been deleted (Fig. 5A). The pattern of Fnu4HI-hypersensitive sites in the CAG repeat tract of the chromatin from the hmo1 deletion strain is strikingly different from that of the HMO1 strain (Fig. 5, A and B). Instead of two strong hypersensitive sites within the interior of the repeat tract, only one weak site appears. Furthermore, this interior site in the hmo1Δ chromatin is not positioned at the location of either of the two sites in the HMO1 chromatin. This is best seen when the downstream RI probe is used for IEL (Fig. 1A and Fig. 5A). The distance between the interior site and the sites at the borders is ∼165 bp (±15 bp), which is consistent with the repeat distance of canonical yeast nucleosomes. Whether this altered pattern results from canonical histone octamer cores will require further examination. Whatever the chromatin state in the absence of Hmo1, the change in the Fnu4HI digestion pattern caused by its absence strongly supports its presence in CAG repeat chromatin. To substantiate the specificity of the disruption of the Fnu4HI digestion pattern by deletion of HMO1, we carried out two additional control studies. First, we examined whether deletion of another potential CAG repeat binding protein would produce the same disruption. Human MSH2 has been shown to bind in vitro to a substrate generated by denaturing a CAG repeat tract and permitting it to reanneal (34Pearson C.E. Ewel A. Acharya S. Fishel R.A. Sinden R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated CAG repeat chromatin in a derivative of CAG325-126 in which MSH2 had been deleted. CAG repeat tract chromatin isolated from the msh2 deletion strain was digested with Fnu4HI and analyzed using IEL analysis (Fig. 5C). Deletion of MSH2 does not alter the pattern of Fnu4HI-hypersensitive sites in CAG repeat chromatin. This result suggests that not all potential CAG repeat binding proteins affect the chromatin organization of the repeat tracts in vivo. Second, we investigated whether deletion of HMO1 affects the Fnu4HI sensitivity of chromatin from a GC-rich sequence. The 514-bp segment of SPC25 previously used in the ChIP analyses (Fig. 3, B and C) was used for these analyses. In addition to having a GC content of 56%, it also possesses 11 Fnu4HI recognition sites (Fig. 6A). Digestion of naked SPC25 DNA with Fnu4HI generates a digestion pattern without any strong positional or sequence preference (Fig. 6, B and C). Digestion of the SPC25 chromatin from the HMO1 strain shows that sites a–c are well protected; sites i–k are hypersensitive, and sites d–h have an intermediary sensitivity to Fnu4HI digestion (Fig. 6, B and C). The overall pattern of protection, hypersensitivity, and intermediary sensitivity is preserved in the hmo1Δ mutant. Differences in relative sensitivity of sites in the region containing sites d–h between wild-type and mutant chromatin are apparent. This region is the most GC-rich (62%), and these small differences might reflect a weak interaction of the sequence with Hmo1 that is also evident in the weak signal generated in formaldehyde-treated samples of the ChIP analyses (Fig. 3, A and B). The similarities between wild-type and hmo1Δ mutant SPC25 chromatin (Fig. 6, B and C), in contrast to the gross differences in CAG repeat chromatin (Fig. 5, A and B), argue that Hmo1 does not contribute as substantially to the chromatin organization of the GC-rich SPC25 segment as it does to the CAG repeat tract chromatin. We have shown that an HMG protein binds to a CAG repeat tract embedded in a yeast chromosome. This demonstration is a striking example of the utility of HMG proteins in chromatin organization. Hmo1 is one of 10 HMG proteins in yeast. Although we do not know whether other yeast HMG proteins can bind to the repeat tract in the absence of Hmo1, the nuclease digestion pattern of the repeat tract chromatin in the hmo1Δ strain suggests that in the absence of Hmo1 the repeat tract has canonical histone octamer cores bound to it. Yeasts, as all other eukaryotes, possess the most highly conserved proteins in nature, the core histones, and our studies show that yeast cells have a protein that can bind preferentially to CAG repeat tracts, seemingly displacing some or all of the core histones. The formal possibility exits that Hmo1 does not bind directly to the DNA but is tightly bound to histones or other tightly bound proteins that are bound to the CAG repeat tract. This possibility seems remote for a number of reasons. First, Hmo1 has two DNA binding domains and binds to both single strand and double strand DNA (33Kamau E. Bauerle K.T. Grove A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55234-55240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, Hmo1 has never been found to interact with the core histones. Third, we precipitated the CAG repeat tract using antibody directed against the epitope attached to Hmo1 without benefit of formaldehyde treatment. Fourth, the observation that the CAG repeat chromatin becomes more refractory to Fnu4HI digestion when HMO1 is deleted means that either it binds directly or drastically alters the configuration of the proteins to which it binds (Fig. 5, A and B). Although the question of direct binding is important, it does not diminish the conclusion that Hmo1 strongly associates with CAG repeat chromatin and establishes its sensitivity to Fnu4HI digestion. The widespread presence of HMG box proteins in nature means that our results should have broader implications. Hmo1 has both a B box and an A box and is similar to HMGB1/2 in humans (32Lu J. Kobayashi R. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33678-33685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Kamau E. Bauerle K.T. Grove A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55234-55240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Some HMG proteins exhibit sequence or structure specificity including HMGB1 and -2 that bind to poly(CA) in a four-stranded complex and (GGA/TCC)11 in a triple-stranded complex (35Suda T. Mishima Y. Takayanagi K. Asakura H. Odani S. Kominami R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4733-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Gaillard C. Strauss F. Science. 1994; 264: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More notably, the HMG box protein SRY binds tightly to a CA repeat tract and weakly to a CAG repeat tract (37Vriz S. Griffiths B.L. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 1137-1146PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, HMG box proteins might organize CAG repeat tract chromatin in humans. Although studies using purified core histones have shown that they preferentially reconstitute on CAG repeat tract DNA (8Mulvihill D.J. Edamura K.N. Hagerman K.A. Pearson C.E. Wang Y.-H. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), some studies indicate that the binding may be anomalous. In particular, the studies by Godde and Wolfe (9Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) show that only six repeat units are needed to effect binding and that the affinity of binding does not increase with repeat length, at least for repeat tracts that can accommodate a single octamer core. Our studies have been done in vivo, where core histones must compete with other DNA-binding proteins. Whether Hmo1 substitutes for core histones or augments their binding in the formation CAG repeat chromatin is uncertain. HMG proteins are thought either to bind adjacent to core histone octamers or to the DNA wrapped around the cores (38Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Travers A.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). When HMG proteins bind adjacent to histone octamer cores, they increase the amount of DNA protected from nuclease digestion (40Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41An W. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26289-26291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the case of CAG repeat tract chromatin, the length of DNA protected in the chromatin is shorter than that protected by normal nucleosomes, suggesting that they are unlikely to serve as linkers to octamer cores. We look to the chromatin organization of the ribosomal DNA promoter in yeast as a possible model for the organization of the CAG repeat chromatin. This promoter has H3 and H4 bound to it but appears devoid of H2A and H2B (42Keener J. Dodd J.A. Lalo D. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13458-13462Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further work has shown that Hmo1 is needed for RNA polymerase I transcription of ribosomal DNA suggesting that Hmo1 may have replaced H2A and H2B (43Gadal O. Labarre S. Boschiero C. Thuriaux P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5498-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, we present a model in which Hmo1 replaces histones H2A and H2B in the complex of proteins that condenses the CAG repeat tract (Fig. 7). Possibly, Hmo1 serves as a linker between tetramer cores of histones H3 and H4 that have been shown in reconstitution studies to provide protection of 120 bp of DNA (44Wolffe A.P. Chromatin.3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 30-41Google Scholar). Based on the correlation in the difference in affinity of core histones for pure and interrupted repeat tracts with the difference in their respective genetic stability, the postulate has been made that chromatin organization contributes to CAG repeat tract instability (8Mulvihill D.J. Edamura K.N. Hagerman K.A. Pearson C.E. Wang Y.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4498-4503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We tested whether the alteration in the chromatin organization that we observed in the hmo1Δ strain affects repeat tract stability in our tester strain (17Maurer D.J. O'Callaghan B.L. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6617-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We did not find greater instability in the hmo1Δ strain than in our wild-type strain. 3H. Kim and D. M. Livingston, unpublished observations. The negative result probably reflects the fact that chromatin proteins are displaced from the DNA as the replication fork passes and that the excess DNA synthesis needed to expand repeat tracts is the fault of enzymes involved in the dynamic processes of replication, particularly those that are involved in Okazaki fragment joining (45Schweitzer J.K.

By having shown that CAG repeat tract chromatin is based on the binding of an HMG box protein, we will be curious to learn whether all, or a subset, core histones bind with Hmo1 on long CAG repeat tracts.

https://openalex.org/W2030780771,"We used partially purified Na+/K+-ATPase from pig kidney to study dephosphorylation, occlusion, and ATPase activity in the same enzyme preparation and in media of identical composition containing 10 μm ATP and different concentrations of Rb+, used as a K+ congener. The experiments were performed using a rapid-mixing apparatus with a time resolution of 3.5 ms. The main findings were as follows. (i) At sufficiently low Rb+ concentration the initial rate of dephosphorylation was higher than that of occlusion, (ii) as [Rb+] tended to zero the slope of the time course of occlusion but not that of the time course of dephosphorylation approached zero and, (iii) as Rb+ concentration increased, ATPase activity first increased and, after passing through a maximum, tended to a value that was lower than that observed in media without Rb+. None of these results is compatible with the currently held idea that binding of a single Rb+ to the E2P conformer of the ATPase does not modify the rate of dephosphorylation and strongly suggest that a single Rb+ does promote dephosphorylation through a mechanism that is not stoichiometrically coupled to Rb+ occlusion. If this mechanism is included in the currently accepted scheme for ATP hydrolysis by the Na+/K+-ATPase, a reasonable prediction of the experimental results is obtained.

If this mechanism is included in the currently accepted scheme for ATP hydrolysis by the Na+/K+-ATPase, a reasonable prediction of the experimental results is obtained. During its physiological operation, the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase couples the hydrolysis of ATP to the transport of three intracellular sodium ions in exchange for two extracellular potassium ions. According to the currently accepted scheme of ATP hydrolysis, this takes place in a series of steps that include at least (Fig. 1) (i) the (Na+ + Mg2+)-dependent phosphorylation by ATP of the E1 conformer of the enzyme to form the E1P phosphoenzyme (phosphorylation requires the binding of three Na+ ions that are taken up from the cytosol and trapped in E1P), (ii) the E1P → E2P transition of the phosphoenzyme (this is accompanied by the release of Na+ to the extracellular medium), (iii) the activation by extracellular K+ of the dephosphorylation of E2P (it is generally accepted that this requires the binding of two K+ ions that are taken up from the extracellular medium and trapped in E2), and finally (iv), the return of E2 to E1 with the release K+ into the cytosol. The binding of ATP to a noncatalytic site in E2 whose Km (≈200 μm) is at least 103 times higher than the Km of the active site of the ATPase (≈0.2 μm) leads to a 100-fold increase in the rate of the E2(K2)→E1+ 2K+ reaction. Hence, as the concentration of ATP tends to zero the release of K+ becomes the slowest step of the Na+/K+-ATPase cycle (see Refs. 1Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-281PubMed Google Scholar and 2Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Na+ and K+ taken up by the enzyme in steps (i) and (iii) are in a state in which they exchange slowly with the incubation media. This is usually called “occlusion” and is considered to be the expression of an intermediate step in the movement of Na+ and K+ across the ATPase from one surface of the membrane to the other. No direct structural information with enough resolution is yet available to identify the occlusion domains in the enzyme. Phosphorylation is absolutely dependent on Na+, whereas for activation of dephosphorylation K+ can be replaced with varying degrees of effectiveness by Rb+, Cs+, Li+,NH4+, or Tl+. At least Rb+ (3Beaugé L.A. Glynn I.M. Nature. 1979; 280: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or Tl+ (4Rossi R.C. Nørby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also replaces K+ for occlusion. Dephosphorylation persists in the absence of K+, albeit at a rate that is 100× slower than in the presence of K+. This gives rise to an ATPase activity, called the Na+-ATPase, which requires Na+ and Mg2+ and is coupled to the transport of Na+. Na+-ATPase is switched off as K+ or its congeners drive dephosphorylation toward the pathway that leads to occlusion. The model in Fig. 1 has three branching points at the E2P states that lead to three pathways. The velocity of dephosphorylation in the absence of products (vdephos) will be the sum of the contributions of the three pathways, i.e. vdephos=k40[E2P]+k41[E2PK]+k42[E2PK2] (Eq. 1) The relative abundance of each state of E2P will depend on the concentration of K+. Assuming rapid equilibrium for the addition of K+, this dependence will be [E2P]=E2P01+[K+]KK1+[K+]2KK1KK2 (Eq. 2) [E2PK]=E2P01+KK1[K+]+[K+]KK2 (Eq. 3) [E2PK2]=E2P01+KK1[K+]+KK1KK2[K+]2 (Eq. 4) where KK1 and KK2 are equilibrium dissociation constants and E2P0 = [E2P] + [E2PK] + [E2PK2]. E2P0 will be equal to the concentration of E2P in the absence of K+ when all the enzyme is catalyzing Na+-ATPase activity. Equations 2, 3, 4 illustrate the more general fact that, as [K+] goes from zero to infinity, the following will occur. (i) [E2P] will decrease continuously toward zero (Equation 2), and the same will happen with Na+-ATPase activity. (ii) [E2PK] will start at zero, pass through a maximum, and then tend to zero (Equation 3). If we accept the general view that k40 = k41, then this process, which is usually not explicitly included in the reaction schemes of the Na+/K+-ATPase, will have no expression on vdephos. (iii) [E2PK2] will start at zero and tend to saturation at a value equal to the total amount of E2P along an S-shaped curve with zero initial slope (Equation 4). The existence at non-saturating [K+] of pathways not requiring occlusion means that the rate of occlusion will be lower than the ATPase activity, a difference that will be cancelled at saturating [K+] when all the reaction flow passes through the E2(K2)→E1 + 2K+ step (cf. Equations 1 and 4). We have shown (5Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Schwarzbaum P.J. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20779-20790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that if we assume that k41 = k40, then the pathways not involving occlusion are too slow to explain why deocclusion rate is slower than ATPase activity at nonsaturating [K+]. We also showed that the most economical way to solve this discrepancy is to abandon the restriction that k41 = k40 and to posit that k41 > k40; that is, that the binding of a single K+ to E2P increases the rate of dephosphorylation. Moreover, we proposed that dephosphorylation of E2PK does not involve occlusion of the ion. The experiments in this paper are an attempt to obtain direct evidence for this hypothesis. For this, we looked at the effects of Rb+ as congener of K+ on the initial rates of occlusion and of dephosphorylation and on the ATPase activity in enzymes incubated at the same temperature and in media of identical composition. The experiments were designed to test the following predictions. (i) If occlusion were strictly dependent on the binding of two Rb+ per E2P, then the function relating the rate of occlusion to Rb+ concentration should be a sigmoid curve of zero initial slope (see Equation 4). (ii) If acceleration of dephosphorylation took place after the binding of a single Rb+ to E2P, then dephosphorylation rate should increase with [Rb+] along a function of positive initial slope. (iii) If (i) and (ii) were fulfilled, then at sufficiently low [Rb+] the velocity of dephosphorylation should be higher than that of occlusion. (iv) At micromolar [ATP], ATPase activity versus [Rb+] should first increase above the value of the Na+-ATPase as a consequence of activation by a single Rb+ and, after passing through a maximum, tend to a lower value as [Rb+] reaches saturation. This is so because it is known that under these conditions the E2(K2) → E1+ 2K+ step is slower than any other. We further analyzed the consequences of our hypothesis by simulating the behavior of the model in Fig. 1 to which we added the pathway enclosed within the shaded area. Ex was included in the reaction scheme to evaluate whether the dephosphorylation of E2PK leads to occlusion. To perform this we fitted analytical solutions of the model to the experimental data of the effects of [Rb+] on the steady-state levels of ATPase activity, EP, and occluded Rb+, measured in media of identical composition and temperature as those used to measure the rates of dephosphorylation and occlusion. The values of the kinetic parameters thus obtained were used to predict the effects of Rb+ on the above mentioned rates. Results reported here constitute the first detailed study of the time course of Rb+ occlusion through the physiological route. This allowed us also for the first time to correlate the kinetics of occlusion with that of dephosphorylation. A preliminary report of some of the results presented in this work has been published (6Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase was partially purified from pig kidney outer medulla according to Jensen et al. (7Jensen J. Nørby J.G. Ottolenghi P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 346: 219-241Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by the Department of Biophysics, University of Ärhus, Denmark. All the results shown in this paper were obtained from experiments performed at 25 °C with enzyme suspended in reaction media containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm ATP, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) and the concentrations of Rb+ indicated in the figures. The time courses of dephosphorylation and of occlusion were measured in experiments carried out using a rapid-mixing apparatus, SFM4/Q, developed by Bio-Logic (France). The experiments were started adding the desired concentrations of Rb+ to the incubation medium in which the enzyme (final concentration 40–50 μg protein/ml) performed steady-state Na+-ATPase activity. The time course of dephosphorylation was measured by monitoring the transition of the 32P-labeled phosphoenzyme to a new steady state after the addition of enough of RbCl as to attain the concentrations indicated in the legends to the figures. Reactions were stopped by chemical quenching with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10 g/100 ml) as described by Schwarzbaum et al. (8Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The time course of occlusion was measured using [86]Rb+. Because acid denaturation by chemical quenching releases occluded Rb+, occlusion was measured after stopping the reaction by rapid cooling-and-washing following the procedure developed in our laboratory (9Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This procedure, which preserves the structural integrity of the enzyme, is able to stop deocclusion reactions that proceed with rate constants of up to 25 s–1 without significant loss of Rb+ (9Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The initial rates of Rb+-dependent dephosphorylation and of Rb+ occlusion were calculated from (i) the solution at t = 0 of the first derivative of the functions fitted to the complete time courses (Fig. 2), (ii) the slope of the straight lines fitted to data of occluded Rb+ and of phosphoenzyme concentrations measured at the time of addition of Rb+ (t = 0) and after a 93-ms-long incubation. This alternative (“single-time measurements”), which was particularly convenient to increase the precision of the comparison between the initial rates of occlusion and dephosphorylation, allowed a higher density of data at the lower Rb+ concentrations (Fig. 3, B–E), when the rates were small enough to fulfill initial rate conditions after 93 ms.FIGURE 3The initial rates of dephosphorylation (vdephos,Rb0, ▿, ▾) and of Rb+ occlusion (vocc0, ○, •) as a function of [Rb+]. Values were calculated, after fitting the equations shown in the legend to Fig. 2 asvdephos,Rb0 P (EP0 – EP∞) and asvocc0=kooc1Rbocc1+kocc2Rbocc2, respectively, or obtained from single-time measurements (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Reaction mixtures were incubated for 3.5 s before being injected into the cooling-and-washing chamber. Control experiments using aging times from 3 to 10 s showed no variation in the amounts of occluded rubidium, indicating that 3.5 s was enough to reach steady state. The steady-state concentration of phosphoenzyme was measured by the same procedure as that used for occlusion except that [γ-32P]ATP was used. After 5.6 s, the reaction was quenched by mixing 3 volumes of the reaction mixture with 2 volumes of an ice-cold solution of 25 g/100 ml trichloroacetic acid and 50 mm H3PO3. ATPase activity was determined according to Schwarzbaum et al. (8Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), measuring the amount of [32P]Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction medium was identical as that used for the occlusion and dephosphorylation experiments. Enzyme concentration was 10 μg of protein/ml. Incubation times varied between 5 and 40 s to avoid the hydrolysis of more than 10% of the ATP, thus ensuring initial rate conditions. Blanks were measured in the media where all Na+ was replaced by K+. Theoretical equations were adjusted to the results by weighted nonlinear regression based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm using commercial programs (Excel, Sigma-Plot, and Mathematica for Windows). Weighting factors were calculated as the reciprocal of the variance of experimental data. [γ-32P]ATP was either purchased as such or synthesized using the procedure of Glynn and Chappel (10Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), except that no unlabeled orthophosphate (Pi) was added. Carrier-free [32P]Pi, [86Rb]RbCl, and [γ-32P]ATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ATP, enzymes, and reagents for the synthesis of [γ-32P]ATP were from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Comparison between the Initial Rates of Dephosphorylation and Occlusion—We measured the time courses of dephosphorylation and of Rb+ occlusion in parallel experiments using the same enzyme preparation in media of the same composition and temperature. All time courses were determined after the addition of Rb+ to enzymes that perform steady-state Na+-ATPase activity. Results are shown in Fig. 2, A (dephosphorylation) and B (Rb+ occlusion). We calculated the initial velocities of Rb+-dependent dephosphorylation(vdephos,Rb0) and Rb+ occlusion(vocc0) from the absolute values of the initial slopes of their time courses. These are plotted as a function of Rb+ concentration in Fig. 3. It can be seen that both velocities rose with [Rb+] along parabolic curves (panel A). This strongly suggests that both curves are the initial part of sigmoid functions that do not approach saturation even at 1000 μm [Rb+]. A striking feature of the results in Fig. 3 is that for Rb+ concentrations less than 250 μm, dephosphorylation is faster than occlusion(vdephos,Rb0>vocc0). This difference is cancelled at concentrations higher than 250 μm, from whichvocc0 becomes progressively larger thanvdephos,Rb0. At 1000 μm Rb+,vocc0 is almost twice as fast asvdephos,Rb0. This is to be expected if at sufficiently high [Rb+] dephosphorylation occurs via the E2PRb2 → E2(Rb2) + Pi pathway. In panel B, the initial part ofvdephos,Rb0 andvocc0 as a function of [Rb+] have been zoomed in to plot values between and 35 μm Rb+. It is clear thatvdephos,Rb0 increases with [Rb+] even at the lowest concentrations tested. This indicates that binding of a single Rb+ to E2P is sufficient to promote dephosphorylation. Therefore, these results are compatible with our hypothesis that k41 > k40. The meaning of the shapes ofvdephos,Rb0 andvocc0 at low [Rb+] can be analyzed considering that Vdephos,Rb0=Vdephos0−k40E2P0=k40[E2P]+k41[E2PRb]+k42[E2PRb2]−k40E2P0 (Eq. 5) and Vocc0=αk41[E2PRb]+2k42[E2PRb2] (Eq. 6) where α is a coefficient whose value will be either 1 or 0 depending on whether or not E2PRb leads to the occlusion of a single Rb+. Note that, under the conditions of our experiments, the initial rate of Rb+-dependent dephosphorylation will be the difference between the rates of breakdown and of formation of EP. Because before the addition of Rb+ the enzyme performs Na+-ATPase activity in steady state, the rate of dephosphorylation will be exactly balanced by that of phosphorylation. For this reason the term –k40E2P0 appears in Equation 5. If each state of E2P is expressed as in Equations 2, 3, 4, then at very low [Rb+], Equations 5 and 6 can, respectively, be approximated by vdephos,Rb0≈E2P0[(k41−k40)[Rb+]KRb1+(k42−k40)[Rb+]2KRb1KRb2] (Eq. 7) and vocc0≈E2P0[αk41[Rb+]KRb1+2k42[Rb+]2KRb1KRb2] (Eq. 8) which show that bothvocc0 andvdephos,Rb0 include a linear and a parabolic term in [Rb+]. In the case ofvdephos,Rb0 the initial slope will be positive (as in the results in Fig. 3B) only if k41 > k40; that is, if there is activation by a single Rb+. In the case ofvocc0, a positive initial slope indicates α > 0. If one Rb+ were occluded in Ex, α would be equal to 1, and the initial slope ofvocc0 would be slightly larger than that ofvdephos,Rb0 (cf. linear terms in Equations 7 and 8). This is in stark contrast with our results in which the initial slope ofvocc0 is about one-third that ofvdephos,Rb0, indicating the absence of stoichiometric occlusion. Effects of Rb+ Concentration on ATPase Activity, Phosphoenzyme, and Occluded Rb+ in Steady State—In the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 4, ATPase activity was measured in media containing 10 μm ATP and from zero to 1000 μm Rb+. It can be seen that the response to [Rb+] is biphasic, with an initial activation that shows no signs of sigmoidicity and a maximum at around 40 μm Rb+ (see the inset) followed by a decrease to an asymptotic value that is lower than that observed at zero [Rb+]. We have shown previously (11Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 981: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that inhibition by Rb+ such as that seen in the second phase in Fig. 4 is not caused by displacement of Na+ from the sites from which it activates the ATPase. The results in Fig. 4 are similar to those obtained by other authors (12Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Blostein R. Whittington E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1772-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also agree with the observation by Vilsen (14Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) who found an analogous response to K+ using 3 mm ATP in a mutant of rat kidney Na+/K+-ATPase with very low affinity for ATP. The most likely cause of the activation by Rb+ is that k41 > k40. The lack of sigmoidicity in the activation phase supports the idea that activation reflects the binding of only one Rb+ to the phosphoenzyme. Notice that if k41 = k40, ATPase activity would continuously decrease with [Rb+]. This is so because the only effect of Rb+ would be to shift the rate-limiting step from that governed by k40 (2.4 s–1) to that governed by the E2 to E1 transition, whose value at 10 μm ATP is 1.3 s–1 (5Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Schwarzbaum P.J. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20779-20790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This mechanism would account for the inhibition by Rb+ shown in Fig. 4 and was first proposed by Post et al. (12Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in their pioneering work on occlusion. The steady-state levels of EP and of Rbocc (Figs. 5 and 6, respectively) are sigmoid functions of Rb+ concentration. Comparison of these results with those in Fig. 3 shows that the apparent affinity for Rb+ is much higher for the steady-state results (K0.5 ≈ 100–200 μm) than for the effects of Rb+ on the initial velocities. The reason of this discrepancy is that initial velocity only measures the rate of Rb+ binding, whereas the steady-state measurements include the effect of the formation and breakdown of occluded Rb+. Because the rate of deocclusion is very low at 10 μm ATP, the enzyme accumulates in its occluded state, which acts as a sink.FIGURE 6Steady-state level of occluded Rb+ as a function of [Rb+]. The continuous line is a plot of Equation 9 for the best fitting values of the parameters (Table 2). The short dashed, dotted, and long dashed lines are, respectively, simulations of the scheme in Fig. 1 for the conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) and the values of the rate constants given in Table 3. The inset is the detail of the plots up to 50 μm [Rb+].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 7 we plotted the sum of the concentrations of EP and of occluded enzyme (½ Rbocc) as a function of [Rb+]. It can be seen that the sum reaches a minimum at about 200 μm Rb+. This result is consistent with the idea that at intermediate Rb+ concentrations there is an accumulation of enzyme states that are neither phosphorylated nor occluded. These states might correspond to those, like Ex, that participate in the activation of dephosphorylation by a single Rb+. The experimental data of the steady-state values of ATPase activity (Fig. 4), phosphorylation (Fig. 5), and occlusion (Fig. 6) were fitted to the following equation, Y=Y0K1K2+Y1K2[Rb+]+Y2[Rb+]2K1K2+K2[Rb+]+[Rb+]2 (Eq. 9) where Y0 and Y2 are the values of the steady-state property being measured in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of Rb+, respectively. Y1 is the contribution of Y at intermediate Rb+ concentrations, and K1 and K2 are apparent constants for the dissociation of Rb+ from the enzyme. As can be seen by the continuous lines that fit the experimental points, Equation 9 gave an excellent description of the three steady-state results. Inspection of the best-fitting values of the parameters in Table 1 shows the following. (i) For Rb+ occlusion, Y0 and Y1 tended to values that were not significantly different from zero. This is consistent with the lack of states with only one Rb+ occluded per enzyme. (ii) Y1 > Y0 > Y2 for ATPase activity determines the existence of the maximum, and that the activity at non-limiting Rb+ concentration is less than the Na+-ATPase activity (Fig. 4). (iii) In the case of EP levels, Y0 > Y1 > Y2, which fits with the continuously decreasing curve of EP versus [Rb+]. (iv) Y2 for Rb+ occlusion is twice the value of Y0 for EP, as it is to be expected if all the enzyme went from EP to E2(Rb2) as [Rb+] went from zero to infinity. (v) The ratio Y2/2 for Rbocc is equal to the value of E2(Rb2) at saturating [Rb+]. Under this condition Y2/2 times the apparent rate constant for the E2(Rb2) → E1+ 2Rb+ step at 10 μm ATP (1.3 s–1) approaches closely the value of Y2 for the ATPase activity. This fits the idea that at saturating [Rb+] all the reaction flow takes place through this step. (vi) The values of K1 and K2 for each steady-state property tested are sufficiently close as to make it likely that the three properties obey the same mechanism. In fact, if the average value of K1 and K2 for the three properties are used for fitting Y0, Y1, and Y2, the resulting curves describe very well the experimental data (results not shown).TABLE 1The best fitting values of the parameters of Equation 9 after nonlinear regression of the results in Figs. 4, 5, 6ParameterATPase activityEPRboccY04.06 ± 0.132.309 ± 0.0100Y17.8 ± 1.80.90 ± 0.470Y22.38 ± 0.240.026 ± 0.0264.642 ± 0.098K143 ± 31312 ± 5674 ± 16K285 ± 5544.1 ± 6.1143 ± 16 Open table in a new tab The Value of k41—In contrast with k40 or k42, there is no experimental condition that allows estimating k41 separately from k40 or k42 (cf. Equation 3 with Equations 2 and 4). In view of this we used an indirect method to estimate k41 based on assuming rapid-equilibrium binding of Rb+ to E2P, in which case the initial rate of Rb+-dependent dephosphorylation will be vdephos,Rb0=E2P0(k41−k40)KRb2[Rb+]+(k42−k40)[Rb+]2KRb1KRb2+KRb2[Rb+]+[Rb+]2 (Eq. 10) When [Rb+] ≪ KRb2, Equation 10 will approach vdephos,Rb0≈E2P0(k41−k40)[Rb+]+β[Rb+]2KRb1+[Rb+] (Eq. 11) where β=k42−k40KRb2 (Eq. 12) Equations 11 and 12 show that, knowing the values of E2P0 and of k40, the values of k41, KRb1, and β can be estimated by fitting Equation 11 to the experimental results ofvdephos,Rb0. When this is done using the experiment in Fig. 3, the best-fitting value of k41 is 24 ± 16 s–1 or 18 ± 11 s–1 depending on the value of E2P0 used (see Table 2).

Open table in a new tab Comparison between the Experimental Results and the Simulations of the Scheme in Fig. 1—The experimental results presented insofar are consistent with our hypothesis that the binding of a single Rb+ to E2P activates dephosphorylation without leading to the stoichiometric occlusion of Rb+. To see if the explicit inclusion of our hypothesis into the Post-Albers model (Fig. 1) is able to predict the experimental results in this paper, we fitted the analytical solution of the scheme in Fig. 1 to the data in Figs. 4, 5, 6 considering three alternative conditions, (i) k41 = k40 and no occlusion of Rb+ in Ex takes place (α = 0), (ii) k41 independent of k40, and Ex occluding one Rb+ (α = 1), and (iii) k41 independent of k40, and Ex not occluding Rb+ (α = 0). In all cases the fitting was performed using the whole set of steady-state experimental values in Figs. 4, 5, 6. To reduce the number of independent parameters to be fitted we kept some of them constant as indicated in Table 3. This is justified because there is reliable experimental information on the values of these parameters from both our work and the work of others (see the legend of Table 3). The set of parameters obtained by this procedure were used to plot theoretical values of the initial rates of dephosphorylation and occlusion and to compare them with the experimental results (Fig. 3, C–E). It can be seen that condition (i) is unable to fit the results. A better fit is obtained making k41 independent of k40 but considering that Ex occludes one Rb+ (condition (ii)), and the best fit is achieved assuming no occlusion in Ex and keeping k41 independent of k40 (condition (iii)). Condition (iii) also gives the best description of the steady-state values in Figs. 4, 5, 6. The inability of condition (i) to fit the results of ATPase activity is particularly noticeable (Fig. 4). It must be noted, however, that even condition (iii) does not fully account for the experimental results. This is especially so for the initial rates of occlusion and dephosphorylation in which, although it is the only one that predicts a difference between both rates, condition (iii) underestimates the slope of the rate of occlusion at very low [Rb+]. It could be argued that, for our experimental results, the slope ofvocc0 when [Rb+] → 0 is not zero because one Rb+ is occluded in Ex (α = 1) but that a faction of the occluded Rb+ is washed out during its measurement. If this were so, the rate of deocclusion would be the rate of the Ex → E1 reaction (k6). The best value of this constant (11 s–1, see Table 3) falls far below the values of deocclusion rate that can be stopped by our quenching procedure without significant loss of Rb+ (see “Experimental Procedures” and Rossi et al. (9Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). Therefore, an artifact due to the washing of occluded Rb+ during its measurement does not seem to be the cause of our results. A more likely explanation may be that Rb+ occlusion does take place but in only one of the microscopic states of E2PRb. An example of these states would be species of E2P that bind one Rb+ and one Na+, as has been suggested by Vilsen (14Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is not known if the ATPase activated by a single Rb+ is able to drive active transport. This cannot be discarded in view of the observation by Beaugé et al. (18Beaugé L.A. Glynn I.M. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 295: 88PGoogle Scholar) who showed that a response similar as that observed in Fig. 4 is elicited by extracellular K+. The data presented here were collected in a non-compartmentalized system that does not allow deciding if transport occurs. Even if a compartmentalized system were available, to measure the stoichiometry of net K+ pumping with 10 μm ATP (and, hence, with a very low pump-to-leak ratio) is a very difficult task. For this reason, all the reliable measurements of stoichiometry of transport in the Na+ pump have been performed with optimal concentrations of ATP and Na+ and K+ (19Garrahan P.J. Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1967; 192: 217-235Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In conclusion, results in this paper indicate the presence of an until now unknown mode of behavior of the Na+/K+-ATPase, whose further study may help to understand the mechanism of active transport of Na+ and K+."
