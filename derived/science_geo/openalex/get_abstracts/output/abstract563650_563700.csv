Eukaryotic cells compartmentalize biological processes to achieve spatial and temporal control over biochemical reactions. Compartmentalization has long been studied in the context of membrane-bound organelles, where mechanisms of biogenesis and transport of molecules into and out of the organelle are well understood. Cells also contain numerous membrane-less organelles, collectively referred to as cellular bodies (Mao et al., 2011Mao Y.S. Zhang B. Spector D.L. Biogenesis and function of nuclear bodies.Trends Genet. 2011; 27: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). These structures, which include P granules, P bodies, nucleoli, and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), are micron-sized assemblies of proteins and often RNA found in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells. They appear to be functionally important, as inferred from their conservation among evolutionarily distant species (Handwerger et al., 2005Handwerger K.E. Cordero J.A. Gall J.G.

Ultrastructural analysis of cellular bodies suggests that they are porous structures with densities comparable to those of the nucleo- or cytoplasm (Handwerger et al., 2005Handwerger K.E.

Yet, they are highly dynamic at the molecular level, turning over their contents within seconds to minutes (Dundr et al., 2004Dundr M. Hebert M.D. Karpova T.S. Stanek D. Xu H. Shpargel K.B.

Recent work has demonstrated that bodies exhibit liquid-like properties (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P. Eckmann C.R. Courson D.S. Rybarska A. Hoege C. Gharakhani J. Jülicher F. Hyman A.A.

These and other behaviors suggest that cellular bodies are condensed phases that form through liquid-liquid phase separation of the nucleo- or cytoplasm (Hyman et al., 2014Hyman A.A. Weber C.A.

Indeed, expressing engineered multivalent proteins or ectopically tethering high copy numbers of body components (high local valency) in cells is sufficient to form dynamic, membrane-less puncta that resemble bona fide cellular bodies (Chung et al., 2011Chung, I., Leonhardt, H., and Rippe, K.

Cellular bodies typically contain tens to hundreds of types of molecules (Buchan and Parker, 2009Buchan J.R. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules: the ins and outs of translation.Mol.

Where characterized in detail, only a small number of these components appear to be essential for the structural integrity of the body (Clemson et al., 2009Clemson C.M. Hutchinson J.N. Sara S.A.

In contrast, the remaining majority of components are dispensable for body assembly and often reside in the bodies only under certain conditions (Dellaire et al., 2006Dellaire G. Eskiw C.H. Dehghani H. Ching R.W. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mitotic accumulations of PML protein contribute to the re-establishment of PML nuclear bodies in G1.J.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These molecules, which we refer to here as clients, often contain elements that specifically bind to elements in the scaffolds, often via low valency interacting elements of the same class as those in the scaffolds (e.g., Chalupníková et al., 2008Chalupníková K. Lattmann S. Selak N. Iwamoto F. Fujiki Y. Nagamine Y. Recruitment of the RNA helicase RHAU to stress granules via a unique RNA-binding domain.J. Biol.

For example, P bodies assemble in part via scaffolding interactions between RNA binding proteins and RNA but also recruit several RNA binding proteins that are not important for P body assembly (Buchan and Parker, 2009Buchan J.R. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules: the ins and outs of translation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 932-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Within cellular bodies, clients diffuse much more rapidly than scaffolds (Dundr et al., 2004Dundr M. Hebert M.D. Karpova T.S. Stanek D. Xu H. Shpargel K.B. Meier U.T. Neugebauer K.M. Matera A.G.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2731-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), suggesting that client-scaffold interactions are more transient than the interactions among scaffolds. Compositional regulation is a general property of many cellular bodies and may be crucial to their function. Cellular body compositions change during the phases of the cell cycle or in response to stresses (Dellaire et al., 2006Dellaire G. Eskiw C.H. Dehghani H. Ching R.W. Bazett-Jones D.P.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, the fundamental principles governing cellular body composition have been experimentally difficult to elucidate, owing to the complex nature of both scaffolds and clients and the diversity of species that reside within bodies. However, simplified model systems composed of few types of molecules, each with well-defined interaction elements, can help isolate key molecular parameters and thus have the potential to reveal generalizable concepts. Here, we describe the biochemical and cellular behavior of three different sets of engineered molecules as simplified but representative multivalent scaffolds and low valency clients, which form model cellular bodies. Clients were differentially recruited into the bodies based on the relative stoichiometries of the scaffolds. Changes in client recruitment occurred sharply and on cellular timescales as the scaffold stoichiometries or valencies changed. Client partitioning also depended on client valency. These findings lead to a simple mass action model that predicts many features of the observed client partitioning behavior and suggests how cellular body compositions could be regulated in cells. Behaviors analogous to those of the model systems were observed in PML NBs in mammalian nuclei and P bodies in yeast cytoplasm. Thus, although natural cellular bodies are complex, their compositions may be governed by simple underlying rules and could be altered based on parameters that are easily tunable through cellular and evolutionary mechanisms. We began by studying three independent pairs of interacting multivalent scaffolds in vitro. These systems consisted of (1) a protein with ten repeats of human SUMO3 (polySUMO) and a protein with ten repeats of the SUMO Interaction Motif (SIM) from PIASx (polySIM); (2) a protein with four repeats of the second SH3 domain from Nck (polySH3) and a protein containing four repeats of a Proline-Rich Motif (PRM) from Abl1 (polyPRM) (Li et al., 2012Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L. Llaguno M. Hollingsworth J.V. King D.S. Banani S.F. et al.Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins.Nature. 2012; 483: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar); and (3) the PTB protein (contains four RNA recognition motifs [RRMs]) and an RNA with five repeats of the RRM recognition element UCUCU (polyUCUCU) (Li et al., 2012Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L. Llaguno M. Hollingsworth J.V. King D.S. Banani S.F. et al.Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins.Nature. 2012; 483: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Each of these pairs phase separated when mixed together, but not when individual components were alone in solution (Li et al., 2012Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L. Llaguno M. Hollingsworth J.V. King D.S. Banani S.F. et al.Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins.Nature. 2012; 483: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar; Figure S1A; and data not shown). To model client recruitment into the bodies, we engineered a series of fluorescently labeled, monovalent clients (containing a single element that binds the scaffold) and characterized their partitioning into droplets generated by their cognate scaffolds. We mixed (1) GFP-SUMO and RFP-SIM (or GFP-SIM) with polySUMO/polySIM (Figure 1A); (2) GFP-PRM and RFP-SH3 with polySH3/polyPRM (Figure 1B); and (3) GFP-RRM and UCUCU-AlexaFluor647 (AF647) with PTB/polyUCUCU (Figure 1C). Partition coefficients (PCs) for the clients, defined as the ratio of concentrations in the droplet to the bulk phases, ranged from ∼1 to 10 across the phase diagram (Figures S1B and S1D). Client recruitment in all three systems was qualitatively similar. Clients partitioned asymmetrically about the diagonal of the phase diagram (the line of equal scaffold stoichiometry) or near to it; each client was enriched only on the side where its cognate scaffold was in stoichiometric excess in the solution. For example, when polySIM was in excess (above the diagonal), GFP-SUMO was enriched in the droplets (PC ∼3), but when polySUMO was in excess (below the diagonal), GFP-SUMO concentrated nearly equally in both phases (PC ∼1) (Figure S1B). GFP-SIM showed an opposite pattern of enrichment (PC ∼3 when polySUMO was in excess; PC ∼1 when polySIM was in excess). Recruitment preference transitioned sharply, in switch-like fashion, as the diagonal was crossed. For the polySUMO/polySIM system, neither GFP alone nor clients mutated at their binding sites were enriched in droplets on either side of the diagonal (Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, binding to the scaffold proteins is necessary and sufficient for enrichment into the droplets (PC > 1). Together, these data show that, regardless of the molecular system, low valency clients partition asymmetrically into droplets formed by heterotypic scaffold interactions, with a sharp switch in client recruitment preference across the diagonal. Since the clients of a given cellular body can differ in their valencies, we examined how client valency affected partitioning. We fused to GFP 2 or 3 tandem repeats of SUMO or SIM and measured the PC for these clients across the polySUMO/polySIM phase diagram (Figure 2). Like their monovalent counterparts, the di- and trivalent clients partitioned into the droplets predominantly on one side of the phase diagram, transitioning sharply in their PCs across the diagonal. However, both the di- and trivalent clients had larger magnitudes of maximum partitioning than their monovalent counterparts, a feature that increased with valency: max PC was 19 and 37 for GFP-(SUMO)2 and GFP-(SUMO)3, respectively, and 21 and 61 for GFP-(SIM)2 and GFP-(SIM)3, respectively. In all cases, maximum partitioning occurred just past the diagonal, substantially enhancing the sharpness of the switch between client preferences. The increased partitioning was likely due to higher apparent affinity of the di- and tri-valent clients for the scaffold. Indeed, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments verified that apparent affinity of the clients to cognate sites increases with increasing valency (Figure S2 and Table S1).Figure S2Apparent Affinity of SUMO to SIM Increases as a Function of Valency, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThermograms and integrated heats from a series of ITC experiments with (SUMO)m + (SIM)m, where m = 1, 2, 3, or 5, as indicated.

Integrated heats were fit to a 1:1 heteromeric association model. Residuals are shown in the lowest panels. Kd values obtained from fitting are listed in Table S1. These data demonstrate that, in addition to position on the phase diagram, client valency can strongly influence client partitioning and thus droplet composition. We sought to understand the origin of the switch-like nature of client partitioning. Our data suggest that partitioning depends strictly on SUMO-SIM interactions between clients and scaffolds (Figures S1B and S1C). We reasoned that client partitioning should be governed by the relative concentrations of available scaffold binding sites in droplets versus the bulk. The apparent dissociation constant for polySUMO/polySIM (Kd ≤ 1 nM, based on ITC measurements with (SUMO)5/(SIM)5) is much less than the scaffold concentrations in either phase (Figure 3C), suggesting that most scaffold sites are occupied. Moreover, the apparent client-scaffold dissociation constants (Kd = 70–10,000 nM, estimated from ITC measurements with (SUMO)m + (SIM)m, for m = 1, 2 or 3) (Figure S2 and Table S1) are much weaker than the apparent polySUMO/polySIM affinity. Thus, clients should be poor competitors of scaffold-scaffold interactions. This analysis suggests that, in either phase, only the scaffold that is in stoichiometric excess will have free sites accessible to its cognate client. Conversely, the scaffold that is stoichiometrically deficient will effectively be saturated by scaffold-scaffold interactions and be invisible to its cognate client in either phase. The scaffold composition of the droplet and bulk phases varied in a smooth, graded fashion across the phase diagram, with PCs ranging from ∼30–125 (Figures 3A and 3B). For most of the phase diagram, the PC of the two scaffolds was similar (within an ∼2-fold range), such that the droplets were essentially concentrated counterparts of the bulk solution (Figure 3C). Thus, at each point in the phase diagram, the scaffold in excess has a higher concentration of free sites in the droplet than in the bulk (Figure 3D) and consequently concentrates its cognate client into the droplets. The scaffold that is stoichiometrically deficient has few free sites in either phase, and its cognate client remains uniformly distributed. Since the stoichiometric relationship between the two scaffolds switches abruptly in both phases near the diagonal, the capacity of the droplets to recruit one client over the other also switches abruptly. We modeled client partitioning by mass action (Figure 3E). We allowed clients to equilibrate between two simulated phases while binding to free sites at concentrations computed from our experiments (Figure 3C, Table S1, and Supplemental Information). This simple mass action model suffices to recapitulate the key qualitative features of observed client partitioning (Figure 3F): (1) selective partitioning of clients, restricted to only one side of the diagonal; (2) a sharp change in partitioning as the diagonal is crossed; and (3) the dependence of partitioning on the apparent client-scaffold affinity. As described in the Supplemental Information, the model also predicts less intuitive features of the data, including non-monotonic partitioning, as well as dramatically high partitioning of one client and attenuated partitioning of the other near the diagonal (Figure 3F; Figure 2, trivalent clients; Figures S3 and S4).Figure S4Mass Action Model Qualitatively Recapitulates Partitioning Behavior of Low Valency Clients but Has Quantitative Limitations, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Client partitioning data with the polySUMO/polySIM system (Figure 2) were fit to the free sites mass action model (Figure 3; see Experimental Procedures), and the best-fit client partitioning predictions are shown.

https://openalex.org/W2469223980,"Single-agent immunotherapy has achieved limited clinical benefit to date in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This may be a result of the presence of a uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Critical obstacles to immunotherapy in PDAC tumors include a high number of tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells and a uniquely desmoplastic stroma that functions as a barrier to T cell infiltration. We identified hyperactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity in neoplastic PDAC cells as an important regulator of the fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME. We found that FAK activity was elevated in human PDAC tissues and correlated with high levels of fibrosis and poor CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Single-agent FAK inhibition using the selective FAK inhibitor VS-4718 substantially limited tumor progression, resulting in a doubling of survival in the p48-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D);Trp53(flox/+) (KPC) mouse model of human PDAC. This delay in tumor progression was associated with markedly reduced tumor fibrosis and decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells. We also found that FAK inhibition rendered the previously unresponsive KPC mouse model responsive to T cell immunotherapy and PD-1 antagonists. These data suggest that FAK inhibition increases immune surveillance by overcoming the fibrotic and immunosuppressive PDAC TME and renders tumors responsive to immunotherapy."

ExM works by physically separating fluorescent probes after anchoring them to a swellable gel. The first ExM method did not result in the retention of native proteins in the gel and relied on custom-made reagents that are not widely available. Here we describe protein retention ExM (proExM), a variant of ExM in which proteins are anchored to the swellable gel, allowing the use of conventional fluorescently labeled antibodies and streptavidin, and fluorescent proteins. We validated and demonstrated the utility of proExM for multicolor super-resolution (∼70 nm) imaging of cells and mammalian tissues on conventional microscopes."
https://openalex.org/W2460289322,"Degradation of Gram-positive bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan in macrophage and dendritic cell phagosomes leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a cytosolic complex that regulates processing and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. While many inflammatory responses to peptidoglycan are mediated by detection of its muramyl dipeptide component in the cytosol by NOD2, we report here that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is caused by release of N-acetylglucosamine that is detected in the cytosol by the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase. Inhibition of hexokinase by N-acetylglucosamine causes its dissociation from mitochondria outer membranes, and we found that this is sufficient to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, we observed that glycolytic inhibitors and metabolic conditions affecting hexokinase function and localization induce inflammasome activation. While previous studies have demonstrated that signaling by pattern recognition receptors can regulate metabolic processes, this study shows that a metabolic enzyme can act as a pattern recognition receptor.PaperClip/cms/asset/cd39d97b-85b4-4575-ba91-a642f2d4c30c/mmc3.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.43 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2473447250,"Adipose tissue (AT) has previously been identified as an extra-medullary reservoir for normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and may promote tumor development. Here, we show that a subpopulation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) can utilize gonadal adipose tissue (GAT) as a niche to support their metabolism and evade chemotherapy. In a mouse model of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), adipose-resident LSCs exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype and induce lipolysis in GAT. GAT lipolysis fuels fatty acid oxidation in LSCs, especially within a subpopulation expressing the fatty acid transporter CD36. CD36(+) LSCs have unique metabolic properties, are strikingly enriched in AT, and are protected from chemotherapy by the GAT microenvironment. CD36 also marks a fraction of human blast crisis CML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with similar biological properties. These findings suggest striking interplay between leukemic cells and AT to create a unique microenvironment that supports the metabolic demands and survival of a distinct LSC subpopulation."

https://openalex.org/W2469962830,"The dispersion of charge carriers in a metal is distinctly different from that of free electrons owing to their interactions with the crystal lattice. These interactions may lead to quasiparticles mimicking the massless relativistic dynamics of high-energy particle physics, and they can twist the quantum phase of electrons into topologically non-trivial knots-producing protected surface states with anomalous electromagnetic properties. These effects intertwine in materials known as Weyl semimetals, and in their crystal-symmetry-protected analogues, Dirac semimetals. The latter show a linear electronic dispersion in three dimensions described by two copies of the Weyl equation (a theoretical description of massless relativistic fermions). At the surface of a crystal, the broken translational symmetry creates topological surface states, so-called Fermi arcs, which have no counterparts in high-energy physics or conventional condensed matter systems. Here we present Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in focused-ion-beam-prepared microstructures of Cd3As2 that are consistent with the theoretically predicted 'Weyl orbits', a kind of cyclotron motion that weaves together Fermi-arc and chiral bulk states. In contrast to conventional cyclotron orbits, this motion is driven by the transfer of chirality from one Weyl node to another, rather than momentum transfer of the Lorentz force. Our observations provide evidence for direct access to the topological properties of charge in a transport experiment, a first step towards their potential application."

They find that the individual regulatory elements seem to act independently and in an additive way with respect to hematological phenotype, gene expression, and chromatin structure and conformation. Many genes determining cell identity are regulated by clusters of Mediator-bound enhancer elements collectively referred to as super-enhancers. These super-enhancers have been proposed to manifest higher-order properties important in development and disease. Here we report a comprehensive functional dissection of one of the strongest putative super-enhancers in erythroid cells. By generating a series of mouse models, deleting each of the five regulatory elements of the α-globin super-enhancer individually and in informative combinations, we demonstrate that each constituent enhancer seems to act independently and in an additive fashion with respect to hematological phenotype, gene expression, chromatin structure and chromosome conformation, without clear evidence of synergistic or higher-order effects. Our study highlights the importance of functional genetic analyses for the identification of new concepts in transcriptional regulation."

We isolated pure populations of cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from a genetically engineered mouse model of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to investigate the mechanisms that drive the metastatic spread of this lethal cancer. Genome-wide characterization of chromatin accessibility revealed the opening of large numbers of distal regulatory elements across the genome during metastatic progression. These changes correlate with copy number amplification of the Nfib locus, and differentially accessible sites were highly enriched for Nfib transcription factor binding sites. Nfib is necessary and sufficient to increase chromatin accessibility at a large subset of the intergenic regions. Nfib promotes pro-metastatic neuronal gene expression programs and drives the metastatic ability of SCLC cells. The identification of widespread chromatin changes during SCLC progression reveals an unexpected global reprogramming during metastatic progression."

However, an examination of Internet-based marketing claims revealed widespread promotion of such interventions by businesses based in the United States. Such commercial activity suggests that regulatory agencies must better oversee this marketplace. Direct-to-consumer marketing of unapproved stem cell interventions is a well-known phenomenon in countries with lax medical regulations. However, an examination of Internet-based marketing claims revealed widespread promotion of such interventions by businesses based in the United States. Such commercial activity suggests that regulatory agencies must better oversee this marketplace. Businesses marketing putative stem cell interventions have proliferated across the U.S. This commercial activity generates a host of serious ethical, scientific, legal, regulatory, and policy concerns. Perhaps the most obvious regulatory question is whether businesses advertising nonhomologous autologous, allogeneic, “induced pluripotent,” or xenogeneic “stem cell therapies” are exposing their clients to noncompliant cell-based interventions. Such practices also prompt ethical concerns about the safety and efficacy of marketed interventions, accuracy in advertising, the quality of informed consent, and the exposure of vulnerable individuals to unjustifiable risks. Prior analyses of companies engaged in direct-to-consumer marketing of stem cell interventions have not explicitly focused on attempting to comprehensively locate and examine U.S. businesses (Lau et al., 2008Lau D. Ogbogu U. Taylor B. Stafinski T. Menon D. Caulfield T. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Ogbogu et al., 2013Ogbogu U. Rachul C.

Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2312-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although recent scholarship has identified some U.S. businesses engaged in such activity (Connolly et al., 2014Connolly R. O’Brien T. Flaherty G. Travel Med. Infect. Dis. 2014; 12: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). While such companies have attracted some scrutiny from researchers and journalists, these businesses have not yet been examined in a comprehensive manner (Perrone, 2015Perrone, M. (2015). Stem cell ‘Wild West’ takes root amid lack of US regulation. Salon, May 18, 2015. http://www.salon.com/2015/05/18/stem_cell_wild_west_takes_root_amid_lack_of_us_regulation/.Google Scholar, Turner, 2015aTurner L.G. Mayo Clin. Proc. 2015; 90: 567-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This gap in scholarship has contributed to misunderstandings that need to be corrected. For example, health researchers, policy-makers, patient advocacy groups, and reporters often use the phrase “stem cell tourism” when addressing the subject of unapproved cell-based interventions and even in 2016 assume that U.S. citizens must travel to such destinations as China, India, Mexico, and the Caribbean if they wish to access businesses promoting stem cell procedures for a wide range of clinical indications. While travel from the U.S. to international “stem cell clinics” continues, the rhetoric of “stem cell tourism” often fails to acknowledge the hundreds of U.S. businesses engaged in direct-to-consumer advertising of stem cell interventions. To address the urgent need for better information concerning the U.S. marketplace for such businesses, we used Internet key word searches, text mining, and content analysis of company websites to investigate and analyze this arena. We used key words and phrases such as “stem cell treatment” and “stem cell therapy” to find putative stem cell businesses and then evaluated the text on each given site to refine our analysis. Here we discuss the variety and prevalence of different kinds of stem cell interventions currently advertised and the breadth of marketing claims that U.S. businesses make. Our analysis should be useful to health researchers, policy-makers, regulators, patients and their advocates, and other parties. Using rigorous Internet-based key word searches (see Supplemental Information for details), we found 351 U.S. businesses engaged in direct-to-consumer marketing of stem cell interventions offered at 570 clinics. For each business, we collected the company name, location(s), website address, advertised stem cell types, and diseases, injuries, and other conditions that clinics claim to treat with stem cell interventions. (Table S1 lists and describes all of the businesses we identified). Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of such businesses across the U.S. Many stem cell companies employ multiple physicians and advertise interventions available at numerous clinics. Although such businesses are widely distributed all over the county, we found that clinics tend to cluster in particular states. For example, we found 113 clinics in California, 104 in Florida, 71 in Texas, 37 in Colorado, 36 in Arizona, and 21 in New York. “Hotspot” cities including Beverly Hills (18), New York (14), San Antonio (13), Los Angeles (12), Austin (11), Scottsdale (11), and Phoenix (10) are designated with stars on the map. Some metropolitan areas, including Southern California around Los Angeles and San Diego, the South Florida region surrounding Miami, the greater Denver area, and the Dallas-Fort Worth metro region, have a relatively high number of clinics even if not all such facilities are technically in one city (Figure S1). While our analyses here do not explain why these businesses cluster in particular areas, we plan to investigate this question further. Possible factors include a relationship between number of clinics and population density, regional variations in use of “alternative” medical interventions, aging population demographics, and regulatory orientation of state medical boards and consumer protection agencies. We also analyzed the particular stem cell types that businesses advertise (Figure 2A). Most of the businesses we identified market autologous cell-based interventions, with an estimated one in five advertising allogeneic stem cell interventions sourced from amniotic material (17%), placental tissue (3.4%), and umbilical cords (0.6%). Some clinics market both autologous and allogeneic stem cells. Of the businesses advertising autologous stem cell procedures, 61% market autologous adipose-derived stem cell-based interventions, 48% market what they describe as autologous stem cells obtained from bone marrow, and 4% market stem cells reportedly obtained from peripheral blood. Adipose stem cells were most often referred to using the adjective “adipose,” but some companies used phrases such as “fat stem cells” and other businesses advertised that they use “stromal vascular fraction” or “SVF.” Bone marrow stem cells were also sometimes referred to as “bone marrow aspirate concentrate” or “BMAC.” Combinations of stem cell types were also promoted. We found that a mixture of autologous adipose and bone marrow stem cells is the most commonly advertised “combination stem cell therapy.” Clinics marketing amniotic stem cells, amniotic stem cell allografts, or amniotic stem cell fluid also sometimes used such terms as “placenta” or “placental stem cells.” The relative abundance of U.S. businesses marketing “amniotic” and “placental” stem cells was notable. The precise source of these products is not clear in all cases, particularly for allogeneic products such as amniotic stem cells. One business promotes access to what it claims are induced pluripotent stem cells. This company did not indicate the purported source of induced pluripotent stem cells or address whether they are derived on a patient-by-patient basis for autologous therapy. Another business markets access to what it describes as “embryonic stem cell” interventions. In addition, we identified two clinics that marketed “bovine amniotic cells,” a xenogeneic product, for use in humans. Approximately 3% of businesses marketed stem cell interventions without mentioning a particular type of stem cells. One unanticipated interpretive challenge we encountered is that many businesses advertise both stem cell interventions and platelet rich plasma (PRP) procedures either as the basis for separate treatments or as combination “cell therapies.” Though not an actual stem cell product, PRP is sometimes marketed as an autologous “stem cell treatment” derived from peripheral blood. In such cases, the rhetoric of “stem cells” is presumably used as a marketing hook intended to attract potential customers (Turner, 2015bTurner L.G. Regen. Med. 2015; 10: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the purpose of our analysis, clinics marketing putative stem cell interventions derived from peripheral blood were included within the scope of our inquiry but clinics only marketing PRP interventions were excluded. U.S. businesses promoting stem cell interventions claim to treat a wide range of diseases and injuries, as well as advertising stem cells for cosmetic applications, “anti-aging,” and other purposes (Figure 2B). Some clinics occupy relatively specialized marketplace niches. For example, many cosmetic surgery clinics advertise such procedures as “stem cell facelifts” and “stem cell breast augmentation” as well as sexual enhancement procedures. Orthopedic and sports medicine clinics often promote stem cell interventions for joints and soft tissue injuries. Other clinics take a much broader approach and list stem cell interventions for 30 or more diseases and injuries. Such businesses commonly market treatments for neurological disorders and other degenerative conditions, spinal cord injuries, immunological conditions, cardiac diseases, pulmonary disorders, ophthalmological diseases and injuries, and urological diseases as well as cosmetic indications. Many of these marketing claims raise significant ethical issues given the lack of peer-reviewed evidence that advertised stem cell interventions are safe and efficacious for the treatment of particular diseases. Such promotional claims also generate regulatory concerns due to apparent noncompliance with federal regulations. We also examined the prevalence of stem cell marketing claims targeted at parents or guardians of minors. We found nine clinics each promoting stem cells for autism and for cerebral palsy. We also identified 33 marketing claims for muscular dystrophy (MD), a disease that primarily though not exclusively afflicts children. This kind of advertising reveals another tangled knot of ethical and legal concerns, as the apparent target audience for such marketed interventions is not adults with decision-making capacity but rather the parents or guardians of children. A comparable kind of marketing situation may exist for Alzheimer’s disease (27 promoted claims) and other neurodegenerative illnesses where in at least some cases patients themselves are not necessarily the primary targets of online advertising. Our investigation was in part motivated by ethical, scientific, and regulatory concerns related to the proliferation of U.S. businesses engaged in direct-to-consumer marketing of stem cell interventions. However, it was not our intention to make evaluative statements concerning whether particular companies are marketing stem cell interventions in compliance with federal and state regulations as well as contemporary ethical standards for medical practice. Nor was it our intention to make ethical or legal assertions about specific marketing claims. We also did not address whether contemporary ethical, scientific, and legal standards are being met by individual businesses. However, at a broader level we recognize the importance of these ethical issues and regulatory concerns (Knoepfler, 2015Knoepfler P.S. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2015; 82-83: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given that many of the businesses we identified market autologous interventions that do not appear to fit FDA criteria for homologous use and minimal manipulation of cells and tissues, allogeneic products, combination products, or “xenogeneic stem cells,” there are clear grounds for concern that some of the companies we found are not compliant with federal regulations. There are related ethical concerns about information provided to prospective clients and the veracity of marketing claims, the safety and efficacy of advertised procedures, and the risk of physical, emotional, and financial harm to already ill or injured and vulnerable individuals. Recent draft guides issued by the FDA provide increased clarity concerning how the FDA interprets federal regulations applicable to the use, sale, and distribution of stem cell products. These draft guidance documents suggest to some observers that the FDA is preparing to take increased regulatory action (https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/08/fda-crackdown-stem-cell-clinics/) in response to businesses selling stem cell interventions in a manner that some critics have described as exhibiting a “Cowboy Culture” (http://www.nature.com/news/stem-cells-in-texas-cowboy-culture-1.12404). Some proponents of deregulation argue that current federal regulations governing the advertising, processing, and administration of autologous stem cells are too onerous and have resulted in few approved stem cell therapies reaching the American marketplace (Chirba and Garfield, 2011Chirba M. Garfield S. J. of Health & Biomedical Law. 2011; VII: 233-272Google Scholar, McAllister et al., 2012McAllister T.N. Audley D. L’Heureux N. Regen. Med. 2012; 7: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The REGROW Act is an example of the current push from some political quarters and even from some individual stem cell researchers for lowering safety and efficacy standards for adult stem cell-based interventions. However, we found that hundreds of U.S. businesses are already promoting stem cell interventions for an extraordinary range of clinical indications. Advocates of deregulation will perhaps be pleased by our findings that many putative stem cell interventions are currently available for sale in the U.S. In contrast, proponents of a marketplace in which cell-based therapies have traditionally been tested for safety and efficacy and subject to pre-marketing review by the FDA will likely be concerned by how many U.S. businesses are currently marketing stem cell interventions. We are particularly concerned that we found many advertising claims related to ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and many other conditions for which there is no established scientific consensus that proven safe and efficacious stem cell treatments now exist. Given that we identified 351 businesses actively advertising stem cell products in the U.S., it is fair to ask whether regulatory inaction has emboldened entrepreneurial physicians and other market participants. We place a high value on the imperative to provide patients with safe and efficacious interventions and see a need for more effective regulation of the U.S. marketplace for stem cell interventions. Our analysis should serve as a valuable resource for contemporary debate concerning whether the U.S. marketplace for stem cell interventions is adequately monitored and regulated by the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, state medical boards, and other agencies tasked with promoting patient safety and accurate advertising (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/30/2015-27703/draft-guidances-relating-to-the-regulation-of-human-cells-tissues-or-cellular-or-tissue-based). While examining the U.S. marketplace for direct-to-consumer advertising of stem cell interventions, we gave careful consideration to possible risks associated with identifying and documenting specific businesses engaged in such commercial activity. We acknowledge that a public record containing locations and websites of businesses marketing stem cell interventions could be misappropriated and misused for marketing purposes, be used as a search tool by patients seeking particular procedures, or even be used to claim that, with so many businesses already operating in the U.S., de facto deregulation has occurred and it is too late for the FDA and other agencies to provide more robust regulatory oversight of this marketplace. While we recognize these risks, we argue that the benefits associated with a detailed examination of U.S. businesses marketing stem cell interventions outweigh potential risks. We also want to emphasize that we analyzed businesses that are already readily identifiable and take multiple steps to market their products. Patients have little difficulty finding stem cell clinics and comparable businesses on the Internet. The best way to address ethical, legal, and scientific issues related to such businesses is to acknowledge their existence, examine and evaluate their marketing claims, and conduct public debates and policy discussions in the most evidence-based manner possible.

https://openalex.org/W2465196824,"During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses that are correlated with decisions. However, it remains uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision making, with strong correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry, arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2469912802,"Super-enhancers comprise dense transcription factor platforms highly enriched for active chromatin marks. A paucity of functional data led us to investigate the role of super-enhancers in the mammary gland, an organ characterized by exceptional gene regulatory dynamics during pregnancy. ChIP-seq analysis for the master regulator STAT5A, the glucocorticoid receptor, H3K27ac and MED1 identified 440 mammary-specific super-enhancers, half of which were associated with genes activated during pregnancy. We interrogated the Wap super-enhancer, generating mice carrying mutations in STAT5-binding sites within its constituent enhancers. Individually, the most distal site displayed the greatest enhancer activity. However, combinatorial mutation analysis showed that the 1,000-fold induction in gene expression during pregnancy relied on all enhancers. Disabling the binding sites of STAT5, NFIB and ELF5 in the proximal enhancer incapacitated the entire super-enhancer. Altogether, these data suggest a temporal and functional enhancer hierarchy. The identification of mammary-specific super-enhancers and the mechanistic exploration of the Wap locus provide insights into the regulation of cell-type-specific expression of hormone-sensing genes."
https://openalex.org/W2469938764,"Age-related changes in the niche have long been postulated to impair the function of somatic stem cells. Here we demonstrate that the aged stem cell niche in skeletal muscle contains substantially reduced levels of fibronectin (FN), leading to detrimental consequences for the function and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Deletion of the gene encoding FN from young regenerating muscles replicates the aging phenotype and leads to a loss of MuSC numbers. By using an extracellular matrix (ECM) library screen and pathway profiling, we characterize FN as a preferred adhesion substrate for MuSCs and demonstrate that integrin-mediated signaling through focal adhesion kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is strongly de-regulated in MuSCs from aged mice because of insufficient attachment to the niche. Reconstitution of FN levels in the aged niche remobilizes stem cells and restores youth-like muscle regeneration. Taken together, we identify the loss of stem cell adhesion to FN in the niche ECM as a previously unknown aging mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2474050011,"Summary Brown and beige adipocytes are specialized cells that express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and dissipate chemical energy as heat. These cells likely possess alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms. Here, we identify a secreted enzyme, peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1), that is enriched in UCP1 + versus UCP1 − adipocytes. We demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in vitro, catalyzing both the condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N -acyl amino acids and also the reverse hydrolytic reaction. N -acyl amino acids directly bind mitochondria and function as endogenous uncouplers of UCP1-independent respiration. Mice with increased circulating PM20D1 have augmented respiration and increased N- acyl amino acids in blood. Lastly, administration of N- acyl amino acids to mice improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure. These data identify an enzymatic node and a family of metabolites that regulate energy homeostasis. This pathway might be useful for treating obesity and associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2466333954,"Translation elongation efficiency is largely thought of as the sum of decoding efficiencies for individual codons. Here, we find that adjacent codon pairs modulate translation efficiency. Deploying an approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that scored the expression of over 35,000 GFP variants in which three adjacent codons were randomized, we have identified 17 pairs of adjacent codons associated with reduced expression. For many pairs, codon order is obligatory for inhibition, implying a more complex interaction than a simple additive effect. Inhibition mediated by adjacent codons occurs during translation itself as GFP expression is restored by increased tRNA levels or by non-native tRNAs with exact-matching anticodons. Inhibition operates in endogenous genes, based on analysis of ribosome profiling data. Our findings suggest translation efficiency is modulated by an interplay between tRNAs at adjacent sites in the ribosome and that this concerted effect needs to be considered in predicting the functional consequences of codon choice."
https://openalex.org/W2460847595,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) tend to infiltrate into tumors and form a major component of the tumor microenvironment. Our previous work demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-activated MSCs significantly promoted tumor growth. However, the role of TNFα-treated MSCs in tumor metastasis remains elusive. Employing a lung metastasis model of murine breast cancer, we found that TNFα-activated MSCs strikingly enhanced tumor metastasis compared with normal MSCs. We analyzed the chemokine profiles and found that the expression of CCL5, CCR2 and CXCR2 ligands were enhanced in TNFα-activated MSCs. Using genetic or pharmacological strategies to inhibit CCL5 or CCR2, we demonstrated that CCL5 and CCR2 ligands were indispensable in supporting TNFα-activated MSCs to promote tumor metastasis. Analysis of immune cells revealed that CXCR2 ligands (CXCL1, CXCL 2 and CXCL5) expressed by TNFα-activated MSCs efficiently recruited CXCR2+ neutrophils into tumor. These neutrophils were responsible for the pro-metastatic effect of MSCs since inhibition of this chemotaxis abolished increased neutrophil recruitment and tumor metastasis. The interaction between neutrophils and tumor cells resulted in markedly elevated metastasis-related genes by tumor cells, including CXCR4, CXCR7, MMP12, MMP13, IL-6 and TGFβ. Importantly, in IL8high human breast cancer samples, we also observed similar alterations of gene expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that TNFα-activated MSCs promote tumor metastasis via CXCR2+ neutrophil recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2464410938,"Adult mammals have lost multi-tissue regenerative capacity, except for the distal digit, which is able to regenerate via mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Here, we show that, after adult mouse distal digit removal, nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) dedifferentiate and secrete growth factors that promote expansion of the blastema and digit regeneration. When SCPs were dysregulated or ablated, mesenchymal precursor proliferation in the blastema was decreased and nail and bone regeneration were impaired. Transplantation of exogenous SCPs rescued these regeneration defects. We found that SCPs secrete factors that promote self-renewal of mesenchymal precursors, and we used transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to define candidate factors. Two of these, oncostatin M (OSM) and platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA), are made by SCPs in the regenerating digit and rescued the deficits in regeneration caused by loss of SCPs. As all peripheral tissues contain nerves, these results could have broad implications for mammalian tissue repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2472586142,"Interactions between stem cells and their microenvironment, or niche, are essential for stem cell maintenance and function. Our knowledge of the niche for the skeletal muscle stem cell, i.e., the satellite cell (SC), is incomplete. Here we show that β1-integrin is an essential niche molecule that maintains SC homeostasis, and sustains the expansion and self-renewal of this stem cell pool during regeneration. We further show that β1-integrin cooperates with fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), a potent growth factor for SCs, to synergistically activate their common downstream effectors, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk and protein kinase B (Akt). Notably, SCs in aged mice show altered β1-integrin activity and insensitivity to Fgf2. Augmenting β1-integrin activity with a monoclonal antibody restores Fgf2 sensitivity and improves regeneration after experimentally induced muscle injury. The same treatment also enhances regeneration and function of dystrophic muscles in mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Therefore, β1-integrin senses the SC niche to maintain responsiveness to Fgf2, and this integrin represents a potential therapeutic target for pathological conditions of the muscle in which the stem cell niche is compromised."

https://openalex.org/W2474093999,"A systematic analysis reveals some genetic variation underpinning the heterogeneity in pathogen-induced cytokine production by blood cells from a cohort of healthy individuals. Little is known about the inter-individual variation of cytokine responses to different pathogens in healthy individuals. To systematically describe cytokine responses elicited by distinct pathogens and to determine the effect of genetic variation on cytokine production, we profiled cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 197 individuals of European origin from the 200 Functional Genomics (200FG) cohort in the Human Functional Genomics Project ( http://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org ), obtained over three different years. We compared bacteria- and fungi-induced cytokine profiles and found that most cytokine responses were organized around a physiological response to specific pathogens, rather than around a particular immune pathway or cytokine. We then correlated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes with cytokine abundance and identified six cytokine quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Among them, a cytokine QTL at the NAA35-GOLM1 locus markedly modulated interleukin (IL)-6 production in response to multiple pathogens and was associated with susceptibility to candidemia. Furthermore, the cytokine QTLs that we identified were enriched among SNPs previously associated with infectious diseases and heart diseases. These data reveal and begin to explain the variability in cytokine production by human immune cells in response to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2470213520,"Chronic inflammation has been associated with a variety of human cancers including prostate cancer. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine, which has been demonstrated to promote development of prostate cancer, colon cancer, skin cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and pancreas cancer. IL-17 promotes prostate adenocarcinoma with a concurrent increase of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) expression in mouse prostate. Whether MMP7 mediates IL-17's action and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We generated Mmp7 and Pten double knockout (KO) (Mmp7-/-) mouse model and demonstrated that MMP7 promotes prostate adenocarcinoma through induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Pten-null mice. MMP7 disrupted E-cadherin/β-catenin complex to upregulate EMT transcription factors in mouse prostate tumors. IL-17 receptor C and Pten double KO mice recapitulated the weak EMT characteristics observed in Mmp7-/- mice. IL-17 induced MMP7 and EMT in human prostate cancer LNCaP, C4-2B and PC-3 cell lines, while small interfering RNA knockdown of MMP7 inhibited IL-17-induced EMT. Compound III, a selective MMP7 inhibitor, decreased development of invasive prostate cancer in Pten single KO mice. In human normal prostates and prostate tumors, IL-17 mRNA levels were positively correlated with MMP7 mRNA levels. These findings demonstrate that MMP7 mediates IL-17's function in promoting prostate carcinogenesis through induction of EMT, indicating IL-17-MMP7-EMT axis as a potential target for developing new strategies in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer."

Our approach demonstrates highly efficient production of founder NHP with SCID phenotypes, with promises of multiple pre-clinical and translational applications. Use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as experimental animal models has potential to reveal insights into diseases, physiology, and genetics unique to humans. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a particularly valuable species in this regard, due to its fecundity and ease of handling (Abbott et al., 2003Abbott D.H. Barnett D.K. Colman R.J.

Med. 2003; 53: 383-392PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their small body size, marmosets are also advantageous for assessing the efficacy and safety of small-amount doses of drugs in preclinical development. Genetically modified animals are key tools for elucidating gene function in an in vivo context. In the mouse, established technologies for homologous recombination in embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in combination with germline transmission in chimeric animals typically allow for efficient production of the desired gene-targeted animal. However, genetic modification of the endogenous gene and generation of gene-targeted animals are significantly more challenging in other species, including NHPs. Marmoset embryonic stem cells and induced PSCs have been established, which has enabled their use in preclinical in vitro studies (Okano et al., 2012Okano H. Hikishima K. Iriki A. Sasaki E.

However, chimera formation and germline transmission using PSCs may be a unique capability of the rodent system, and this technology is therefore not currently a viable strategy for achieving gene targeting in other species. Therefore, generation of target gene knockout (KO) NHPs remains an outstanding challenge for the field (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B.

The recent development of innovative genome editing technologies, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), have enabled the generation of targeted gene KO or knockin (KI) animals by directly injecting the developing embryo, bypassing the need to use PSCs and chimera formation (Brown et al., 2013Brown A.J.

Bull. 2014; 30: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to the mosaicism of cells carrying the intact gene and the mutant gene in NHPs. Due to the long NHP lifespan, establishment of highly efficient genetic modifications that lead to clear congenital phenotypes in founder animals would be required for generating robust NHP research models. Hence, improving genetic modification efficiency, as well as reducing mosaicism, is an important goal toward generation of gene-targeted large animals, including NHPs.

SCID mice are widely used in many biomedical research areas, such as immunology, oncology, transplant medicine, and regenerative medicine research. Thus, an SCID NHP model would have wide-ranging applications for studying human biology. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of conditions that provide high-efficiency gene modification and reduced mosaicism in marmoset embryos using ZFN and TALEN technologies. We also report the generation of IL2RG KO marmosets with immunodeficient phenotypes that could grow to adults. Two types of ZFN and TALEN vectors with different double-strand break activities were used in this study. Initially, the original ZFN vector (HiFi-ZFN) was used. In the latter half of the study, a ZFN vector containing an improved FokI nuclease (eHiFi-ZFN) and highly active platinum TALENs were used (Doyon et al., 2011Doyon Y. Vo T.D. Mendel M.C.

In an initial screen to evaluate the most active ZFN pair, 16 pairs of candidate HiFi-ZFN expression vectors were transfected into fibroblast cells, and the genomic DNA was extracted after 3 days of culture (Figures 1A and 1B ). CEL-1 assays were performed to detect the double-stranded DNA mismatches resulting from insertions or deletions (indels) (Figure S1A, available online) (Guschin et al., 2010Guschin D.Y. Waite A.J. Katibah G.E. Miller J.C. Holmes M.C. Rebar E.J. A rapid and general assay for monitoring endogenous gene modification.Methods Mol.

Of the HiFi-ZFNs, a pair of the number 10 HiFi-ZFNs, which were designed to target IL2RG exon 4, exhibited the strongest digested band signal in the CEL-1 assay using ZFN target-specific primers (Figure S1B; Tables S1 and S2). The sequence analysis of the subcloned PCR fragment also indicated that 4.2% (2/48) of the indels resulted in a frameshift within IL2RG (Table S2). Similarly, the cells expressing the number 10 eHiFi-ZFN vector pair contained the digested band, and the sequence analysis indicated that 52.2% (12/23) of the subclones contained indel sequences within IL2RG (Figure 1A; Tables S1 and S2). Thus, HiFi-ZFN and eHiFi-ZFN activities were further evaluated in marmoset embryos (Figure S1B; Table S2). Furthermore, highly active platinum TALEN expression vectors were designed to target IL2RG exons 2 and 4 and were also evaluated in marmoset embryos. To assess ZFN/TALEN activity in marmoset embryos, mRNAs were synthesized from the HiFi-ZFN, eHiFi-ZFN, TALEN-ex2, and TALEN-ex4 expression vectors and introduced into pronuclear stage embryos by cytoplasmic microinjection. After 7–10 days, each cultured blastocyst stage embryo was analyzed using the CEL-1 assay. The HiFi-ZFN-, eHiFi-ZFN-, TALEN-ex2-, and TALEN-ex4-mRNA-injected embryos exhibited 33.3% (1/3), 40.0% (2/5), 100% (5/5), and 50.0% (2/4) genome modification rates, respectively (Figure S1C). When the samples derived from the eHiFi-ZFN-mRNA-injected embryos were tested, digested PCR products were not identified in the CEL-1 assay; similar results were obtained for all TALEN-mRNA-injected embryos, with the exception of one TALEN-ex2-mRNA-injected embryo (Figure S1C). These results suggest that the samples only contained a single type of modified sequence without mosaicism; these samples cannot form the mismatch double-stranded DNA that is detected by the CEL-1 assay. When the wild-type IL2RG gene PCR product was added to the eHiFi-ZFN or TALEN samples, the DNA mixtures formed a mismatched double-stranded DNA fragment, resulting in the production of digested DNA fragments in the CEL-1 assay. The sequence analysis indicated that identical mutagenesis occurred in all subclones of the eHiFi-ZFN-, TALEN-ex2-, and TALEN-ex4-mRNA-injected embryos (Table S2). To assess whether mosaicism had occurred, blastomere splitting tests were performed in the ZFN- and TALEN-mRNA-injected embryos (Figure 1A). The embryos were cultured to the eight-cell stage and split into single blastomeres; the genetic modification rates of each blastomere were subsequently determined using the CEL-1 assay. The CEL-1 assays of the HiFi-ZFN-mRNA-injected blastocysts from single-cell embryos suggested that mosaicism in the mutated IL2RG gene had occurred. The genetic modification rates were estimated from the number of mutant blastomeres and were 37.5% (3/8) for HiFi-ZFN, 100% (8/8) for eHiFi-ZFN, 100% (8/8) for TALEN-ex2, and 100% (8/8) for TALEN-ex4 (Figure 1C). In addition, the sequence analysis indicated that the blastomeres derived from the HiFi-ZFN-mRNA-injected embryos possessed three types of mutations and the wild-type IL2RG gene sequence (Table S3). In contrast, the eHiFi-ZFN-, TALEN-ex2-, and TALEN-ex4-mRNA-injected embryos exhibited complete disruption of IL2RG genes; the intact IL2RG gene was not identified (Table S3). Because the IL2RG gene is encoded on the X chromosome, these results suggest that modifications in the HiFi-ZFN embryo occurred at approximately the four-cell to eight-cell stage, whereas the results of the genomic modifications suggested that the eHiFi-ZFN- and TALEN-derived embryos occurred at the one-cell stage. These results indicate that all evaluated genome editing tools are able to modify the genome at the very early stages of embryonic development, which suggests the potential utility of these ZFNs and TALENs in IL2RG KO marmoset generation. To generate IL2RG KO candidate marmosets, HiFi-ZFN-, eHiFi-ZFN-, TALEN-ex2-, and TALEN-ex4-mRNA were injected into 131, 58, 9, and 52 embryos, respectively. In total, 95 HiFi-ZFN embryos, 42 eHiFi-ZFN embryos, five TALEN-ex4 embryos, and 37 TALEN-ex2 embryos were subsequently transferred to surrogate mothers, which resulted in 21 candidate neonates. Of these candidate neonates, 17 neonates were from ZFN embryos and 4 neonates were from TALEN embryos (Table 1). All neonates were delivered by Caesarean section (C-section) 0–4 days before the due date and were maintained in a clean breeding room to avoid microbial infection. In multiple pregnancies, marmoset fetuses typically share the placenta with littermates born as blood cell chimeras (Ross et al., 2007Ross C.N. French J.A. Ortí G.

In fact, one IL2RG KO neonate (HiFi-A) obtained from a HiFi-ZFN-mRNA-injected embryo was a pair of twins with a wild-type neonate sibling (HiFi-B) (Figure 2A). The KO neonate HiFi-A strongly suggested that these twin neonates were blood chimeras, and the wild-type hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from the wild-type littermate developed into leukocytes in the HiFi-A neonate (Figures S2 and S3; Tables S4 and S5). Therefore, all neonates from eHiFi-ZFN and TALEN embryos were derived as singletons by single-embryo transfer to prevent blood chimerism.Table 1Summary of Microinjection and Obtained NeonatesConstructionInjected OocytesTransferred Embryos (%)RecipientsPregnancies (%)Neonate(s)Mutant Animal(s)HiFi-ZFN13195 (72.5)4610 (21.7)M:12M:1eHiFi-ZFN5842 (72.4)385 (13.2)M:2, F:3M:1, F:3TALEN-ex495 (55.6)51 (20.0)M:1M:1TALEN-ex25237 (71.2)243 (12.5)M:3M:3Total250179 (71.6)11319 (16.8)M:18, F:3M:6, F:3M, male; F, female.

Immediately after birth, the proportions of lymphocytes in the cord blood samples from the neonates derived from the eHiFi-ZFNs and TALENs were analyzed by flow cytometric analyses and CEL-1 assays of tissues accessible by non-invasive measures (i.e., hair roots and umbilical cord blood samples). In candidate marmosets derived from the eHiFi-ZFNs and TALENs, 9 of 21 neonates had mutations in the IL2RG gene (Table 1). Moreover, the CEL-1 assay indicated that seven marmosets (eHiFi-1, eHiFi-B, eHiFi-D, and T1–T4) carried the IL2RG KO gene in whole-body tissues (Figures 2B and S2; Table S4). Furthermore, to confirm the target gene sequences, 12 alleles of six males and three females (nine animals total) were analyzed. The results were as follows: two female marmosets were biallelic, one female animal indicated a heterozygous mutation in the target gene, and six male animals exhibited a hemizygous mutation. All animals exhibited one mutant gene in each allele, except T-2. Although the IL2RG KO marmoset, T-2, harbored two types of mutant IL2RG, intact IL2RG was not observed (Table 2). The results (total of nine alleles from three males, including two types of mutations in one animal, and three females, including heterozygous mutation in one animal) indicated truncated sequences, and three alleles from three males exhibited amino acid residue deletions without frameshifts. The deduced amino acid sequences from the nucleotide sequencing data indicated that frameshift IL2RG mutations result in a null-type deletion of the eHiFi-1, eHiFi-B, eHiFi-D, and T-4 neonates (Table S4; Figure S3). The flow cytometric analysis of the lymphocytes from the cord blood samples demonstrated that the ratio of CD2+ T cells and CD4+ T cells was reduced to 1/10 of the wild-type control. Among the CD2+ T cells, the numbers of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells that expressed NKp46+ cells were greatly reduced in eHiFi-1, eHiFi-B, eHiFi-D, T-1, T-2, T-3, and T-4 compared with a wild-type control sample. In contrast, the numbers of CD20+ B cells were comparatively normal. Two animals, eHiFi-A and eHiFi-C, which contained the normal IL2RG gene, exhibited cell population patterns similar to the control (Figures 2C and S4A). Interestingly, three animals that harbored amino acid residue deletions without a frameshift mutation of IL2RG also indicated similar phenotypes compared with other IL2RG mutant animals that carried truncated IL2RG. The eHiFi-1, T-1, T-2, and T-3 neonates, which harbored CD2+ lymphocyte defects, survived for several days and exhibited pathological evidence of congenital disease (Table 2). A postmortem genetic analysis using several different tissues and organs from these neonates confirmed that the IL2RG gene was mutated in all examined samples (Figure S2). Furthermore, the thymuses of the eHiFi-1, T-1, T-2, and T-3 neonates were not detectable upon autopsy (Figure S4B). The flow cytometric analysis of the spleen sample from eHiFi-1 also indicated an absence of CD2+ T cells, including CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and NKp46+ NK cells, which is consistent with the results from the umbilical cord blood samples of eHiFi-1, while CD20+ B cells were detected (Figure S4C). The postmortem analysis of one KO marmoset, HiFi-A, after 6 days of survival, showed interesting findings: the KO neonate was derived from an HiFi-ZFN-mRNA-injected embryo and was one of a pair of twins (HiFi-A); another of the twins was wild-type (HiFi-B). HiFi-A survived for 6 days, and the wild-type twin survived for 3 days (Table 2). The genomic modifications revealed that HiFi-A exhibited IL2RG gene mutations in all examined tissues (Figure S2). The sequencing analysis indicated the presence of a 21-bp deletion in the IL2RG gene that resulted in a 7-amino-acid deletion (Table S4; Figure S3). The thymus looked to be a macroscopically normal size (Figure S4B). Since marmoset fetuses share the placenta with littermates in multiple pregnancies, they are born as blood cell chimeras (Ross et al., 2007Ross C.N. French J.A. Ortí G.

Curran E. Westmoreland S.V. Mansfield K.G. Vallender E.J. Quantitative molecular assessment of chimerism across tissues in marmosets and tamarins.BMC Genomics. 2012; 13: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CEL-1 assay results from the blood, thymus, and spleen of HiFi-A, all of which contained abundant blood cells, featured more intense digested bands compared with the other tissues (Figure S2), suggesting that wild-type IL2RG genes from littermates were present. The results of the sequencing analysis also support this possibility; the blood and spleen samples possessed the wild-type IL2RG gene, unlike the other somatic tissues (Table S5). Consistent with this result, digested bands were also observed in the blood and spleen samples from the wild-type littermate neonate, indicating that the mutant IL2RG gene was also present in the wild-type neonate; however, these mutations were not observed upon sequence analysis. This is likely due to a low rate of chimerism. These results strongly suggest that these two neonates were blood chimeras, and the wild-type hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from the wild-type littermate developed into leukocytes in the HiFi-A neonate. Therefore, the IL2RG KO marmosets generated with the HiFi-ZFN vectors did not exhibit an immunodeficient phenotype. To study the immunological features of the IL2RG KO marmosets, the peripheral blood of two animals, eHiFi-B and T-4, which survived more than 6 months, was collected; eHiFi-B and T-4 were analyzed between 1.1–1.7 and 0.6–1.2 years old, respectively (Figure 3A). The lymphocytes from the peripheral blood samples of eHiFi-B and T-4 showed that the frequencies of CD2+ T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were increased, but the CD20+ B cells were dramatically decreased in eHiFi-B and T-4 compared with the levels in their neonatal periods (Figure 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2464821864,"Here we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells require the BRD9 subunit of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodeling complex to sustain MYC transcription, rapid cell proliferation and a block in differentiation. Based on these observations, we derived small-molecule inhibitors of the BRD9 bromodomain that selectively suppress the proliferation of mouse and human AML cell lines. To establish these effects as on-target, we engineered a bromodomain-swap allele of BRD9 that retains functionality despite a radically altered bromodomain pocket. Expression of this allele in AML cells confers resistance to the antiproliferative effects of our compound series, thus establishing BRD9 as the relevant cellular target. Furthermore, we used an analogous domain-swap strategy to generate an inhibitor-resistant allele of EZH2. To our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence for a role of BRD9 in cancer and reveals a simple genetic strategy for constructing resistance alleles to demonstrate on-target activity of chemical probes in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2469085018,"Cells benefit from silencing foreign genetic elements but must simultaneously avoid inactivating endogenous genes. Although chromatin modifications and RNAs contribute to maintenance of silenced states, the establishment of silenced regions will inevitably reflect underlying DNA sequence and/or structure. Here, we demonstrate that a pervasive non-coding DNA feature in Caenorhabditis elegans, characterized by 10-base pair periodic An/Tn-clusters (PATCs), can license transgenes for germline expression within repressive chromatin domains. Transgenes containing natural or synthetic PATCs are resistant to position effect variegation and stochastic silencing in the germline. Among endogenous genes, intron length and PATC-character undergo dramatic changes as orthologs move from active to repressive chromatin over evolutionary time, indicating a dynamic character to the An/Tn periodicity. We propose that PATCs form the basis of a cellular immune system, identifying certain endogenous genes in heterochromatic contexts as privileged while foreign DNA can be suppressed with no requirement for a cellular memory of prior exposure."

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) make up as much as 95% of cells within the striatum and send inhibitory projections to surrounding nuclei of the basal ganglia (Gerfen, 2004Gerfen C.R. Basal ganglia.in: Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Third Edition. Academic Press, 2004: 455-508Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Kemp and Powell, 1971Kemp J.M. Powell T.P.

According to the model of basal ganglia circuit function first established by Albin and DeLong (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L. Young A.B. Penney J.B.

Primate models of movement disorders of basal ganglia origin.Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar), MSNs facilitate and suppress motor behavior via the direct and indirect pathways, respectively. The direct pathway promotes motor behavior by actively inhibiting the basal ganglia’s two GABAergic output nuclei—the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)—which in turn project to thalamocortical and brainstem motor circuits. The reduction in inhibitory signals leaving the basal ganglia results in disinhibition of these circuits, allowing them to execute the commands necessary for movement. In contrast, the indirect pathway, which includes additional synapses onto the external globus pallidus (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), increases the activity of the basal ganglia’s output nuclei. This increase in activity results in suppression of thalamocortical circuitry and ultimately inhibits movement. While this feedforward description of the basal ganglia can account for much of its behavior in normal and pathological conditions, the existence of additional connections in the form of collateral branching, reciprocal connectivity, recurrent networks, and feedback loops suggests much greater complexity. These include collaterals from D1 receptor-expressing MSNs to GPe (Cazorla et al., 2014Cazorla M. de Carvalho F.D. Chohan M.O. Shegda M. Chuhma N. Rayport S. Ahmari S.E. Moore H. Kellendonk C.

Thus, while the feedforward view of direct and indirect pathways remains a powerful holistic tool, the exact influence of each pathway remains difficult to predict at the whole-brain scale. Historically, it has been difficult to disentangle the functional properties of striatal MSNs belonging to the direct or indirect pathway because they are highly anatomically intermingled. However, the MSNs that constitute each pathway also share relatively distinct neurochemical identities. MSNs of the direct pathway primarily express the D1 dopamine receptor (D1-MSNs), while those of the indirect pathway primarily express the D2 dopamine receptor (D2-MSNs) (Deng et al., 2006Deng Y.P.

Several studies have exploited this ability in order to selectively excite each population in isolation and measure downstream effects on behavior and neuronal firing rates using in vivo electrophysiology. For example, it has been shown that direct pathway stimulation reduces hypokinetic behavioral deficits, while indirect pathway stimulation exacerbates them (Kravitz et al., 2010Kravitz A.V. Freeze B.S. Parker P.R. Kay K. Thwin M.T. Deisseroth K. Kreitzer A.C. Regulation of parkinsonian motor behaviours by optogenetic control of basal ganglia circuitry.Nature. 2010; 466: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition and excitation of SNr neurons evoked by D1- or D2-MSN stimulations have been shown to correlate with motor facilitation and suppression, respectively (Freeze et al., 2013Freeze B.S. Kravitz A.V. Hammack N. Berke J.D. Kreitzer A.C. Control of basal ganglia output by direct and indirect pathway projection neurons.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 18531-18539Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Finally, activation of direct and indirect pathway MSNs evoked and suppressed activity in motor cortex, respectively, although non-opposing effects were also observed in a subset of neurons (Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015Oldenburg I.A. Sabatini B.L. Antagonistic but not symmetric regulation of primary motor cortex by basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1174-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings support the prevailing view of basal ganglia circuit function that the direct and indirect pathways selectively turn on or off the thalamocortical loop. Yet direct evidence for these two pathways’ differential effect on macroscopic circuit function remains lacking. Here, we combined targeted optogenetic stimulation of the direct and indirect pathways with fMRI to reveal the causal influence of each population on activity across the whole brain, including areas within the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This integration of optogenetic stimulation with fMRI (termed ofMRI) has enabled the causal influence of genetically defined neuronal populations on downstream regions to be measured directly (Abe et al., 2012Abe Y.

A double-floxed inverted recombinant AAV1 virus was injected into dorsomedial striatum to express the excitatory opsin ChR2-EYFP in Cre-positive D1- or D2-MSNs and enable selective optogenetic control of the direct or indirect pathway, respectively. Histological examination confirmed that ChR2-EYFP was localized to MSNs in the striatum, with over 87% of ChR2-EYFP+ cells co-expressing the MSN marker DARPP32 in both D1-Cre (Figures 1A and 1B ) and D2-Cre mice (Figures 1E and 1F). This percentage is consistent with previous reports of AAV1-mediated ChR2 expression in D1 and D2 BAC transgenic lines (Kravitz et al., 2010Kravitz A.V. Freeze B.S. Parker P.R. Kay K. Thwin M.T. Deisseroth K. Kreitzer A.C. Regulation of parkinsonian motor behaviours by optogenetic control of basal ganglia circuitry.Nature. 2010; 466: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). To demonstrate specificity for each pathway, we also quantified neuronal co-expression of the D1 marker prodynorphin and the D2 marker enkephalin. In D1-Cre mice, 89% of ChR2-EYFP+ cells co-expressed prodynorphin (Figures 1A and 1B), while in D2-Cre mice, 83% of ChR2-EYFP+ cells co-expressed enkephalin (Figures 1E and 1F). ChR2 expression was thus well restricted to the targeted populations. In vivo activation was enabled by stereotactic implantation of a fiber-optic cannula at the dorsomedial striatum. Pulse trains were delivered for 20 s (15 ms pulse width at 2.5 mW and 20 Hz frequency) since this temporal paradigm has previously been shown to evoke robust BOLD signals both locally and remotely (Duffy et al., 2015Duffy B.A. Choy M.

Regulation of parkinsonian motor behaviours by optogenetic control of basal ganglia circuitry.Nature. 2010; 466: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Before fMRI experiments, the motor behavior of freely moving animals was monitored during 20 s periods of stimulation. These experiments served to confirm both that light delivery could elicit a behavioral response and that stimulation was sufficiently restricted to MSNs of the direct or indirect pathway. As shown previously (Kravitz et al., 2010Kravitz A.V. Freeze B.S. Parker P.R. Kay K. Thwin M.T. Deisseroth K. Kreitzer A.C. Regulation of parkinsonian motor behaviours by optogenetic control of basal ganglia circuitry.Nature. 2010; 466: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), unilateral stimulation of D1-MSNs elicited a significant increase in contraversive rotations (Figure 1C; p = 0.0003, two-tailed paired t test), while stimulation of D2-MSNs elicited a significant increase in ipsiversive rotations (Figure 1G; p = 0.002). Contraversive rotations also significantly decreased during D2-MSN stimulation (Figure 1G; p = 0.006). These behavioral effects are consistent with the classical model of basal ganglia function, suggesting that stimulation was sufficiently restricted to MSNs of either pathway. Furthermore, they confirm that the whole-brain networks recruited by light delivery and ultimately visualized with ofMRI are of behavioral significance. To investigate how selective drive of the direct or indirect pathway differentially affects the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop, we next coupled optogenetic D1- or D2-MSN stimulation to whole-brain fMRI readouts. Experiments were performed under very light anesthesia (0.3%–0.7% isoflurane) to minimize suppression of neuronal activity. To facilitate imaging under these conditions and reduce motion artifacts, mice were gradually introduced to the fMRI-related environment, including noise and body restriction, over the course of 14 days. Following this habituation process, stable fMRI images could be acquired. For each scan, a 20 s pulse train of 20 Hz stimulation was delivered to the dorsomedial striatum every minute for 6 min. Significantly modulated voxels were identified as those whose time series were synchronized to consecutive periods of light delivery using standard Fourier domain techniques. There was typically more than a 5 dB difference in magnitude between the fundamental frequency of each region’s time series and its higher harmonics, suggesting that this approach yielded few false negatives (Figure S1, available online). Visualization of modulated, or “active,” voxels revealed that both D1- and D2-MSN stimulation resulted in widespread modulation of brain activity (Figures 1D and 1H). Furthermore, the phase of evoked responses dramatically differed across stimulation groups and brain regions, indicating significant heterogeneity of the time series’ temporal dynamics. To quantify the extent of brain-wide activation patterns, we segmented the brain into 30 anatomically defined regions (Figure 2), giving a total of 60 regions of interest (ROIs) across both hemispheres. We next calculated the percentage of each ROI that exhibited significantly modulated fMRI time series (Figure 3). Regions with significant activation included not only those within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop, but also those within the limbic system and midbrain. Cortical activation was especially widespread, covering all segmented regions from frontal cortex (most anterior) to visual and parahippocampal cortex (most posterior). Contralateral activation was also common.Figure 3Whole-Brain Modulation Volumes during D1- and D2-MSN Stimulation Measured with fMRI Show Robust Activity in Many Regions across the BrainShow full captionValues represent the percent of each ROI that is modulated by stimulation, and are shown as mean ± SEM across subjects (n = 12 D1-Cre and 11 D2-Cre mice).

Regions are grouped according to subdivisions of standard developmental anatomical brain characterization (diencephalon, limbic system, cortex, mesencephalon, metencephalon). To explore the effect of stimulation on the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop, we next examined fMRI time series of the various basal ganglia nuclei, thalamus, and motor cortex. Within the anterior caudate putamen, where stimulation was delivered, the BOLD signal was positive during stimulation of either population (Figure 4). At all other regions of the ipsilateral basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop—including GPe, STN, GPi, SN, thalamus, and motor cortex—the evoked response in a given region exhibited qualitatively different temporal profiles between D1- and D2-MSN stimulation (Figure 4). In general, positive responses were evoked during D1-MSN stimulation, while negative responses were evoked during D2-MSN stimulation. To quantify these differences in temporal patterns, we compared the average phase of voxels within each ROI. This value represents the temporal shift of the sinusoid that best fits the modeled data in the least-squares sense (Figure 5A). The average phase of voxels at the anterior caudate putamen was not significantly different between D1- and D2-MSN stimulations (Figures 5B and 5C; p > 0.05, circular Watson-Williams test). In contrast, the evoked responses in GPe, GPi, STN, SN, thalamus, and motor cortex were all significantly different (Figures 5B and 5C; p < 0.001, circular Watson-Williams test). To determine if the difference observed in motor cortex was generalizable across cortical activations, we also computed phases in the eleven other segmented ROIs of cortex. These too were significantly different between D1- and D2-MSN stimulations (Figures 5B and 5C), pointing to the widespread divergent influence of direct and indirect pathways. Time series for each cortical region ipsilateral to stimulation are shown in Figure S2. Importantly, similar differences in temporal dynamics were also observed in the contralateral hemisphere (Figures S3 and S4).Figure 5Stimulations of D1- and D2-MSNs Drive Distinct and Opposing fMRI Responses in the Ipsilateral HemisphereShow full caption(A) Schematic diagram of phase calculation for two fMRI time series.

ΣBOLD was calculated as the summation of each ROI’s average time series. See also Figures S3 and S4. To further characterize the evoked responses, we next calculated the integral of each ROI’s time series (ΣBOLD). With the exception of the anterior caudate putamen, all ipsilateral ROIs exhibited a positive mean ΣBOLD value during D1-MSN stimulation and a negative mean ΣBOLD value during D2-MSN stimulation (Figure 5D). This difference was significant across most tested ROIs, including the basal ganglia’s output nuclei GPi and SN, thalamus, and 10 of 12 segmented cortical regions (p < 0.05; two-tailed t test). ΣBOLD was also generally positive during D1-MSN stimulation and negative during D2-MSN stimulation in the contralateral hemisphere (Figure S3D). This difference was significant across all contralateral regions of the basal ganglia (with the exception of the putamen) and 7 of 12 cortical regions (p < 0.05; two-tailed t test). Given the diversity of BOLD responses evoked by D1- and D2-MSN stimulations, we next sought to verify whether the BOLD responses reflected underlying neuronal activity. Specifically, we sought to confirm that the opposing influences of the direct and indirect pathways measured on the macroscopic scale with ofMRI were also present at the level of single-unit activity. Thus, we performed extracellular recordings in striatum and thalamus (Figures 6A and 6E ), where the differences between D1- and D2-MSN stimulation-evoked responses were least and most significant, respectively (Figure 5C), and where the sign of ΣBOLD was the same and opposite between the two stimulation groups, respective"
https://openalex.org/W2473572100,"Insulin signaling regulates many facets of animal physiology. Its dysregulation causes diabetes and other metabolic disorders. The spindle checkpoint proteins MAD2 and BUBR1 prevent precocious chromosome segregation and suppress aneuploidy. The MAD2 inhibitory protein p31(comet) promotes checkpoint inactivation and timely chromosome segregation. Here, we show that whole-body p31(comet) knockout mice die soon after birth and have reduced hepatic glycogen. Liver-specific ablation of p31(comet) causes insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and hyperglycemia and diminishes the plasma membrane localization of the insulin receptor (IR) in hepatocytes. MAD2 directly binds to IR and facilitates BUBR1-dependent recruitment of the clathrin adaptor AP2 to IR. p31(comet) blocks the MAD2-BUBR1 interaction and prevents spontaneous clathrin-mediated IR endocytosis. BUBR1 deficiency enhances insulin sensitivity in mice. BUBR1 depletion in hepatocytes or the expression of MAD2-binding-deficient IR suppresses the metabolic phenotypes of p31(comet) ablation. Our findings establish a major IR regulatory mechanism and link guardians of chromosome stability to nutrient metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2462649686,"The olfactory system is divided into processing channels (glomeruli), each receiving input from a different type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN). Here we investigated how glomeruli combine to control behavior in freely walking Drosophila. We found that optogenetically activating single ORN types typically produced attraction, although some ORN types produced repulsion. Attraction consisted largely of a behavioral program with the following rules: at fictive odor onset, flies walked upwind, and at fictive odor offset, they reversed. When certain pairs of attractive ORN types were co-activated, the level of the behavioral response resembled the sum of the component responses. However, other pairs of attractive ORN types produced a response resembling the larger component (max pooling). Although activation of different ORN combinations produced different levels of behavior, the rules of the behavioral program were consistent. Our results illustrate a general method for inferring how groups of neurons work together to modulate behavioral programs."

https://openalex.org/W2465284726,"In the mammalian brain, the anatomical structure of neural circuits changes little during adulthood. As a result, adult learning and memory are thought to result from specific changes in synaptic strength. A possible exception is the olfactory bulb (OB), where activity guides interneuron turnover throughout adulthood. These adult-born granule cell (GC) interneurons form new GABAergic synapses that have little synaptic strength plasticity. In the face of persistent neuronal and synaptic turnover, how does the OB balance flexibility, as is required for adapting to changing sensory environments, with perceptual stability? Here we show that high dendritic spine turnover is a universal feature of GCs, regardless of their developmental origin and age. We find matching dynamics among postsynaptic sites on the principal neurons receiving the new synaptic inputs. We further demonstrate in silico that this coordinated structural plasticity is consistent with stable, yet flexible, decorrelated sensory representations. Together, our study reveals that persistent, coordinated synaptic structural plasticity between interneurons and principal neurons is a major mode of functional plasticity in the OB."

https://openalex.org/W2466814596,"The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors have become attractive targets for pharmacological inhibition in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. SREBPs are critical for the production and metabolism of lipids and cholesterol, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and cell proliferation. Fatostatin was recently discovered as a specific inhibitor of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which is required for SREBP activation. Fatostatin possesses antitumor properties including the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and it arrests cancer cells in G2/M phase. Although Fatostatin has been viewed as an antitumor agent due to its inhibition of SREBP and its effect on lipid metabolism, we show that Fatostatin's anticancer properties can also be attributed to its inhibition of cell division. We analyzed the effect of SREBP activity inhibitors including Fatostatin, PF-429242, and Betulin on the cell cycle and determined that only Fatostatin possessed antimitotic properties. Fatostatin inhibited tubulin polymerization, arrested cells in mitosis, activated the spindle assembly checkpoint, and triggered mitotic catastrophe and reduced cell viability. Thus Fatostatin's ability to inhibit SREBP activity and cell division could prove beneficial in treating aggressive types of cancers such as glioblastomas that have elevated lipid metabolism and fast proliferation rates and often develop resistance to current anticancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2462806169,"Prostate cancer is characterized by a dependence upon androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the accepted treatment for progressive prostate cancer. Although ADT is usually initially effective, acquired resistance termed castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) develops. PTEN and TP53 are two of the most commonly deleted or mutated genes in prostate cancer, the compound loss of which is enriched in CRPC. To interrogate the metabolic alterations associated with survival following ADT, we used an orthotopic model of Pten/Tp53 null prostate cancer. Metabolite profiles and associated regulators were compared in tumors from androgen-intact mice and in tumors surviving castration. AR inhibition led to changes in the levels of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathway intermediates. As anticipated for inhibitory reciprocal feedback between AR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, pAKT levels were increased in androgen-deprived tumors. Elevated mitochondrial hexokinase 2 (HK2) levels and enzyme activities also were observed in androgen-deprived tumors, consistent with pAKT-dependent HK2 protein induction and mitochondrial association. Competitive inhibition of HK2-mitochondrial binding in prostate cancer cells led to decreased viability. These data argue for AKT-associated HK2-mediated metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial association in PI3K-driven prostate cancer as one survival mechanism downstream of AR inhibition."

For this IRB-approved study, BPE and fibroglandular tissue FGT were retrospectively assessed by two experienced radiologists according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between BPE, FGT, age and final diagnosis of breast cancer. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis, considering covariate colinearities, was performed, using final diagnosis as the target variable and BPE, FGT and age as covariates.Age showed a moderate negative correlation with FGT (r = -0.43, p<0.001) and a weak negative correlation with BPE (r = -0.28, p<0.001). FGT and BPE correlated moderately (r = 0.35, p<0.001). Final diagnosis of breast cancer displayed very weak negative correlations with FGT (r = -0.09, p = 0.046) and BPE (r = -0.156, p<0.001) and weak positive correlation with age (r = 0.353, p<0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent covariate for prediction of breast cancer was age (OR 1.032, p<0.001).Based on our data, neither BPE nor FGT independently correlate with breast cancer risk in non-high-risk patients at MRI. Our model retained only age as an independent risk factor for breast cancer in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2470672468,"Ewing sarcoma is characterized by chromosomal translocations fusing the EWS gene with various members of the ETS family of transcription factors, most commonly FLI1. EWS-FLI1 is an aberrant transcription factor driving Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis by either transcriptionally inducing or repressing specific target genes. Herein, we showed that Sprouty 1 (SPRY1), which is a physiological negative feedback inhibitor downstream of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors (FGFRs) and other RAS-activating receptors, is an EWS-FLI1 repressed gene. EWS-FLI1 knockdown specifically increased the expression of SPRY1, while other Sprouty family members remained unaffected. Analysis of SPRY1 expression in a panel of Ewing sarcoma cells showed that SPRY1 was not expressed in Ewing sarcoma cell lines, suggesting that it could act as a tumor suppressor gene in these cells. In agreement, induction of SPRY1 in three different Ewing sarcoma cell lines functionally impaired proliferation, clonogenic growth and migration. In addition, SPRY1 expression inhibited extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling induced by serum and basic FGF (bFGF). Moreover, treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells with the potent FGFR inhibitor PD-173074 reduced bFGF-induced proliferation, colony formation and in vivo tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, thus mimicking SPRY1 activity in Ewing sarcoma cells. Although the expression of SPRY1 was low when compared with other tumors, SPRY1 was variably expressed in primary Ewing sarcoma tumors and higher expression levels were significantly associated with improved outcome in a large patient cohort. Taken together, our data indicate that EWS-FLI1-mediated repression of SPRY1 leads to unrestrained bFGF-induced cell proliferation, suggesting that targeting the FGFR/MAPK pathway can constitute a promising therapeutic approach for this devastating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2474231195,"Cancer cell vascular invasion is a crucial step in the malignant progression toward metastasis. Here we used a genome-wide RNA interference screen with E0771 mammary cancer cells to uncover drivers of endothelial monolayer invasion. We identified keratin-associated protein 5-5 (Krtap5-5) as a candidate. Krtap5-5 belongs to a large protein family that is implicated in crosslinking keratin intermediate filaments during hair formation, yet these Krtaps have no reported role in cancer. Depletion of Krtap5-5 from cancer cells led to cell blebbing and a loss of keratins 14 and 18, in addition to the upregulation of vimentin intermediate filaments. This intermediate filament subtype switching induced dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and reduced the expression of hemidesmosomal α6/β4-integrins. We further demonstrate that knockdown of keratin 18 phenocopies the loss of Krtap5-5, suggesting that Krtap5-5 crosstalks with keratin 18 in E0771 cells. Disruption of the keratin cytoskeleton by perturbing Krtap5-5 function broadly altered the expression of cytoskeleton regulators and the localization of cell surface markers. Krtap5-5 depletion did not impact cell viability but reduced cell motility and extracellular matrix invasion, as well as extravasation of cancer cells into tissues in zebrafish and mice. We conclude that Krtap5-5 is a previously unknown regulator of cytoskeletal function in cancer cells that modulates motility and vascular invasion. Thus, in addition to its physiologic function, a Krtap can serve as a switch toward malignant progression."

As the current androgen deprivation therapy with anti-androgens may promote the neuroendocrine PCa (NEPCa) development, and few therapies can effectively suppress NEPCa, understanding the impact of NEPCa on PCa progression may help us to develop better therapies to battle PCa. Here, we found NEPCa cells could increase the docetaxel resistance of their neighboring PCa cells. Mechanism dissection revealed that through secretion of PTHrP, NEPCa cells could alter the p38/MAPK/Hsp27 signals in their neighboring PCa cells that resulted in increased androgen receptor (AR) activity via promoting AR nuclear translocation. The consequences of increased AR function might then increase docetaxel resistance via increasing p21 expression. In vivo xenograft mice experiments also confirmed that NEPCa could increase the docetaxel resistance of neighboring PCa, and targeting this newly identified PTHrP/p38/Hsp27/AR/p21 signaling pathway with either p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or shPTHrP may result in improving/restoring the docetaxel sensitivity to better suppress PCa."

Aims In this regard, we first confirmed the presence of PDGFRβ+ perivascular cells in a human case of end-stage aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and thereafter we focused on the early fibrosis events of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) inhibition in a rat model of AAN. Materials and Methods Neutralizing anti-TGFβ antibody (1D11) and its control isotype (13C4) were administered (5 mg/kg, i.p.) at Days -1, 0, 2 and 4; AA (15 mg/kg, sc) was injected daily. Results At Day 5, 1D11 significantly suppressed p-Smad2/3 signaling pathway improving renal function impairment, reduced the score of acute tubular necrosis, peritubular capillaritis, interstitial inflammation and neoangiogenesis. 1D11 markedly decreased interstitial edema, disruption of tubular basement membrane loss of brush border, cytoplasmic edema and organelle ultrastructure alterations (mitochondrial disruption and endoplasmic reticulum edema) in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Moreover, 1D11 significantly inhibited p-PERK activation and attenuated dysregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial proteostasis in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions The early inhibition of p-Smad2/3 signaling pathway improved acute renal function impairment, partially prevented epithelial-endothelial axis activation by maintaining PTEC proteostasis and reduced early PDGFRβ+ pericytes-derived myofibroblasts accumulation."

Mutagenesis experiments and computer simulations reveal that the alternative conformation of the N-terminal domain is caused by structural instability produced by the high charge density of a calcium binding site. We find that this alternative conformation in the N-terminal domain is diminished in the presence of calcium and can also be partially eliminated with a hitherto unrecognized compensatory mechanism that uses the interaction of the C-terminal domain to neutralize the electronegative site. We find that up to 1% of all identified multidomain calcium-binding proteins contain a similarly highly charged site and therefore may exploit a similar compensatory mechanism to prevent structural instability in the absence of ligand.

Biol. 1998; 276: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggested that the domains are less stable in the absence of calcium, but the mechanistic origin of this instability has remained poorly understood. We confirmed these earlier observations using SMFS on isolated domains and then performed a novel single-molecule study of the complete multidomain Protein S that identifies the origin of the domains' instability and the resulting conformational heterogeneity in the absence of calcium as due to electrical properties of the structure surrounding the calcium binding site. We also identified a new “compensatory” mechanism that, in the absence of the ligand, helps to stabilize the weakened domains through specific interdomain interactions. To understand how the Protein S domains interact in the multidomain protein, we first studied the truncated N-terminal and truncated C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain truncation (NTD-PS) was made, at the DNA level, by cloning the Protein S N-terminal domain containing residues 1–88 of Protein S into a construct such that it would be flanked on either side by three I27 domains from titin (40Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The I27 domains serve as a positive control of full unfolding of the NTD-PS molecule (as long as at least four I27 domains are unfolded in the force-extension profile) and also allow unequivocal detection of single-molecule events (if clear unfolding of I27 is seen, it is probably a single-molecule event and not a multiple-molecule recording). The NTD-PS molecule was stretched along the N-C pulling geometry through tethering from the surface to the cantilever tip (Fig. 2). A representative force-extension profile of the unfolding of NTD-PS is shown in Fig. 2A in red, and the subsequent unfolding of the I27 domains is in blue. It can be seen that NTD-PS unfolding creates a single peak in the force-extension spectrum. The unfolding of I27 can be discerned from the unfolding of Protein S because the unfolding forces and contour length increments do not overlap (Fig. 2B). The crystal structure measurements indicate that the initial length of each domain is 1.0 nm. Given that an extended polypeptide provides 0.365 nm of extension (42Dietz H. Rief M. Protein structure by mechanical triangulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the unfolding of the N-terminal domain should theoretically provide a contour length increment of 0.365 nm/residue × 89 residues − 1.0 nm = 31.5 nm, which agrees with the measured contour length increment of 31.9 ± 3.4 nm (mean ± S.D.), also shown in Fig. 3B.FIGURE 3NTD-PS distributions for force and contour length increment in the absence of Ca2+ (A and B), in the presence of Ca2+ (C and D), and in the absence of Ca2+ at low pH (E and F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The unfolding forces of NTD-PS indicate that it is less stable than I27 (and hence unfolds first) because the peak typically unfolds between 40 and 120 pN, whereas I27 unfolds at 207 ± 28 pN (at 4,500 pN/s). Interestingly, the null hypothesis that the distribution of unfolding forces for the NTD-PS comes from a normal distribution is rejected (p = 0.026, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality). The histogram of rupture forces (n = 236 total recordings) of NTD-PS is bimodal and can be fit by two normal distributions (Fig. 3A) with mean ± S.D. of 49 ± 14 pN (55 ± 6% of recordings) and 93 ± 14 pN (45 ± 6% of recordings). Why is the force distribution of NTD-PS bimodal? It is possible that the two states could come from transitions induced by the pulling experiment itself (43Garai A. Zhang Y. Dudko O.K. Conformational dynamics through an intermediate.J. Chem. Phys. 2014; 140: 135101Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments at a speed that was 15-fold faster than previous experiments under the assumption that the faster speed would decrease any likelihood of conformational changes during the pulling measurements. These experiments show that the bimodality still exists and that the proportions of states are not statistically significant from the proportions at the slower speed (χ2 test, p > 0.05; Fig. 4), indicating that the pulling experiment itself has no effect on the proportions of the recordings with low or high force peaks. Although it is possible that we may need to reach higher pulling extremes to detect the pulling-induced transition, our interpretation is consistent with previous NMR experiments that identified slow exchanging intermediates in NTD-PS in equilibrium (39Bagby S. Go S. Inouye S. Ikura M. Chakrabartty A. Equilibrium folding intermediates of a Greek key β-barrel protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the bimodality is not an artifact of the pulling experiment, we hypothesized that the lower unfolding force distribution comes from the unfolding of an alternative conformation of NTD-PS that contains only a fraction of the contacts. This is supported by the fact that whereas force-distribution is multimodal, the contour length increment distribution is not (Fig. 3B). When the measured contour length increments are filtered based on the force, the mean ± S.D. of the contour length increment of the low force distribution (<71 pN) is 31.6 ± 2.7 nm, and the high force distribution (≥71 pN) is 31.8 ± 2.6 nm, which are not statistically significantly different (p = 0.4) and also not statistically significantly different from what would be expected for the full NTD-PS domain (p = 0.6). Because the contour length increment is unchanged, the structural position of the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the NTD-PS domain must be fixed. The fact that the mechanical stability is decreased in the alternative conformation would imply that contacts are missing in that state compared with the higher force state because contact density highly correlates with unfolding force (44Scholl Z.N.

Characterization of calcium-binding sites in development-specific protein S of Myxococcus xanthus using site-specific mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1199-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the location of the binding sites has not reached a consensus (37Wenk M. Baumgartner R. Holak T.A. Huber R. Jaenicke R. Mayr E.-M. The domains of protein S from Myxococcus xanthus: structure, stability and interactions.J. Mol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1199-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the alternative conformation might be due to charge repulsion, which then could be converted to a single native configuration by the addition of Ca2+ or lowering pH. Interestingly, the addition of Ca2+ produced an unfolding distribution for NTD-PS that was not bimodal, which had a mean ± S.D. of 90 ± 23 pN (Fig. 3C). The effect of Ca2+ on the unfolding modality was also speed-independent (Fig. 4). Similarly, the presence of an acidic environment (pH 3.7–4.4) also has unfolding forces of NTD-PS in a single distribution at 99 ± 23 pN (Fig. 3D). In both of these cases, the contour length increment matches the unfolding of NTD-PS without CaCl2 (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Thus, the presence of Ca2+ or an acidic environment acts to convert the alternative conformation to a single conformation. These observations are also consistent with independent NMR experiments on the NTD-PS, which show that an intermediate is undetectable in conditions with CaCl2 or an acidic pH (39Bagby S. Go S. Inouye S. Ikura M. Chakrabartty A. Equilibrium folding intermediates of a Greek key β-barrel protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Protein S is highly similar to the N-terminal domain with 55% sequence identity and a root mean square deviation between matched Cα atoms of 2.0 Å. Because of the high similarity, we hypothesized that the truncated C-terminal domain would also show bimodal distributions of force rupture events due to the presence of an also similar alternative conformation. An I27-flanked truncated C-terminal domain (CTD-PS) was used for pulling, and a representative force-extension curve of CTD-PS is shown in Fig. 2A. Contrary to our hypothesis, the unfolding of CTD-PS in the absence of Ca2+ shows a force distribution that is unimodal and not bimodal (Fig. 5). The CTD-PS force distribution can be fit with a single normal distribution with mean and S.D. of 96 ± 21 pN. This stability is very similar to the high force conformation of the N-terminal domain of Protein S. The contour length increment is 31.7 ± 2.4, which is similar to the calculated contour length increment of the C-terminal domain of Protein S, indicating that the full protein unfolds. The C-terminal domain of Protein S also binds Ca2+, which could increase stabilization. In the presence of Ca2+, the unfolding force of CTD-PS increased to 115 ± 17 pN. Although the C-terminal domain has very high similarity to the N-terminal domain, it does not show evidence of a stable alternative conformation at equilibrium, with or without Ca2+. Instead, Ca2+ directly stabilizes the native fold of the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, In some proteins, proline isomerization may introduce alternative conformations (47Andreotti A.H. Native state proline isomerization: an intrinsic molecular switch.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9515-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Indeed, Protein S has 12 prolines that could assume isomerization states. However, because both domains have the same number of prolines but only NTD-PS adopts the alternative conformations, we hypothesize that this effect is not the origin of the alternative conformation. This will be further tested in future studies. To study the extent to which the truncated domains of Protein S contribute to the mechanically stability of the full Protein S, we performed similar single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments on the full Protein S (PS) in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Protein S was flanked by I27 domains and unfolded along the N-C coordinate by pulling at constant velocity. As can be seen from the representative force-extension curve shown in Fig. 2A, the unfolding occurs in two steps, which are denoted Peak 1 and Peak 2. The force distribution and contour length distributions for both peaks in the absence of Ca2+ are shown in Fig. 6 (A–D). The contour length increments of Peak 1 and Peak 2 agree with the theoretical extension of the N-terminal or C-terminal domain; however, since the numbers of residues in each domain are nearly the same, the contour length increment cannot be used to accurately assign the unfolding of a particular domain to a peak in the force-extension curve.

https://openalex.org/W2461890690,"The Wnt pathway has essential roles in cell proliferation, cell fate determination and tumorigenesis by regulating the expression of a wide range of target genes. As a core signaling cascade, the canonical Wnt pathway is regulated at different levels by numerous proteins. We have previously shown that carboxypeptidase E (CPE) is a novel regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Here, we show that CPE and the Wnt3a ligand are co-secreted from cells. We show that although the C'-terminal Lys residue of Wnt3a is critical for its activity and is important for the effect of CPE on the Wnt pathway, CPE does not execute its effect by removing this Wnt3a residue. Interestingly, CPE through its N'-terminal sequence, forms aggregates with Wnt3a and possible endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to its loss of function. Together, our current results provide a mechanistic insight into the way CPE regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway."

Mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) fail to differentiate into trunk somites in tbx16 mutants and instead accumulate within the tailbud in an immature state. However, the mechanisms by which Tbx16 controls mesoderm patterning have remained enigmatic. We describe here the use of photoactivatable morpholino oligonucleotides to determine the Tbx16 transcriptome in MPCs. We identified 124 Tbx16-regulated genes that were expressed in zebrafish gastrulae, including several developmental signaling proteins and regulators of gastrulation, myogenesis and somitogenesis. Unexpectedly, we observed that a loss of Tbx16 function precociously activated posterior hox genes in MPCs, and overexpression of a single posterior hox gene was sufficient to disrupt MPC migration. Our studies support a model in which Tbx16 regulates the timing of collinear hox gene activation to coordinate the anterior-posterior fates and positions of paraxial MPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2466143257,"Homoacetogenic bacteria have received attention as a hydrogenotrophic population that offers a significant energetic advantage to the host animal. Reductive acetogenesis is likely an important hydrogen disposal mechanism in the cecum of rabbits. However, molecular ecology information about cecal acetogen candidates has rarely been reported. To better understand the effect of host selection in the rabbit cecal acetogen community with respect to growth, rabbits at four different age stages (30, 60, 120 and 180 days) with the same diet were studied. Although the abundance of potential acetogens and methanogens was high in the cecum of rabbits undergoing growth, many novel potential acetogen populations were observed in the cecum of rabbits across all age groups. Young and adult rabbits had their own distinct acetogen community although they received the same diet, which suggests that as the rabbit ages, acetogens in the cecum undergo developmental changes because of host selection that are independent of diet, and perhaps the different acetogen communities result in different hydrogenotrophic characteristics. The within-group similarity increased with age, indicating that the acetogen community converges to a more homogeneous and stable arrangement with aging."
