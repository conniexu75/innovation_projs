https://openalex.org/W4309495150,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex mental health condition that results in several obstacles including disabilities, loss of productivity, and economic burdens on both patients and society. Etiopathogenesis of MDD involves several factors such as sociodemographic, genetic, and biological determinants. However, any suitable biomarkers for risk assessment of depression have not been established yet. Alterations of cytokine are assumed to be involved in the pathophysiology and severity of the depressive disorder. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate serum adiponectin and interleukin-8 (IL-8) among MDD patients in Bangladesh.We recruited a total of 63 MDD patients and 94 age-sex matched healthy controls (HCs) in the present study. MDD patients were enrolled from a tertiary care teaching hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and HCs from surrounding parts of Dhaka city. A psychiatrist assessed all the study participants following the criteria mentioned in the DSM-5. We applied the Hamilton depression (Ham-D) rating scale to assess the depression severity. Serum adiponectin and IL-8 levels were determined using ELISA kits (BosterBio, USA).The mean serum concentration of adiponectin was decreased (30.67±4.43 μg/mL vs. 53.81±5.37 μg/mL), and the IL-8 level was increased (160.93±14.84 pg/mL vs. 88.68±6.33 pg/mL) in MDD patients compared to HCs. Sex-specific scatters plot graphs showed the distribution of adiponectin and IL-8 levels with Ham-D scores in MDD patients. Also, ROC curve analysis demonstrated good predictive performances of serum adiponectin and IL-8 for MDD with the area under the curve (AUC) as 0.895 and 0.806, respectively.The present study findings suggest that alterations of serum adiponectin and IL-8 levels in MDD patients might be involved in the disease process. Therefore, we can use these changes of cytokines in serum levels as early risk assessment tools for depression. The present study findings should be considered preliminary. We propose further interventional studies to evaluate the exact role of adiponectin and IL-8 in depression."
https://openalex.org/W4309494747,"This qualitative study explores how and why journalists use preprints-unreviewed research papers-in their reporting. Through thematic analysis of interviews conducted with 19 health and science journalists in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it applies a theoretical framework that conceptualizes COVID-19 preprint research as a form of post-normal science, characterized by high scientific uncertainty and societal relevance, urgent need for political decision-making, and value-related policy considerations. Findings suggest that journalists approach the decision to cover preprints as a careful calculation, in which the potential public benefits and the ease of access preprints provided were weighed against risks of spreading misinformation. Journalists described viewing unreviewed studies with extra skepticism and relied on diverse strategies to find, vet, and report on them. Some of these strategies represent standard science journalism, while others, such as labeling unreviewed studies as preprints, mark a departure from the norm. However, journalists also reported barriers to covering preprints, as many felt they lacked the expertise or the time required to fully understand or vet the research. The findings suggest that coverage of preprints is likely to continue post-pandemic, with important implications for scientists, journalists, and the publics who read their work."
https://openalex.org/W4309668646,"Programming T cells to distinguish self from non-self is a vital, multi-step process that occurs in the thymus1-4. Signalling through the pre-T cell receptor (preTCR), a CD3-associated heterodimer comprising an invariant pTα chain and a clone-specific β chain, is a critical early checkpoint in thymocyte development within the αβ T cell lineage5,6. PreTCRs arrayed on CD4-CD8- double-negative thymocytes ligate peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHC) on thymic stroma, similar to αβ T cell receptors that appear on CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes, but via a different molecular docking strategy7-10. Here we show the consequences of these distinct interactions for thymocyte progression using synchronized fetal thymic progenitor cultures that differ in the presence or absence of pMHC on support stroma, and single-cell transcriptomes at key thymocyte developmental transitions. Although major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-negative stroma fosters αβ T cell differentiation, the absence of preTCR-pMHC interactions leads to deviant thymocyte transcriptional programming associated with dedifferentiation. Highly proliferative double-negative and double-positive thymocyte subsets emerge, with antecedent characteristics of T cell lymphoblastic and myeloid malignancies. Compensatory upregulation of diverse MHC class Ib proteins in B2m/H2-Ab1 MHC-knockout mice partially safeguards in vivo thymocyte progression, although disseminated double-positive thymic tumours may develop with ageing. Thus, as well as promoting β chain repertoire broadening for subsequent αβ T cell receptor utilization, preTCR-pMHC interactions limit cellular plasticity to facilitate normal thymocyte differentiation and proliferation that, if absent, introduce developmental vulnerabilities."
https://openalex.org/W4309494745,"Introduction Physical activity (PA) is reduced in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Evidence about the PA pattern of patients with ILD is scarce. If PA of patients with ILD would be comparable to COPD, it is tempting to speculate that existing interventions focusing on enhancing PA could be as effective in ILD as already shown in COPD. Therefore, we aimed to compare PA and the correlates with PA in matched patients with ILD, COPD, and healthy subjects. Materials and methods Patients with ILD (n = 45), COPD (n = 45) and healthy subjects (n = 30) were propensity matched. PA level, pattern, and PA correlations with lung function and physical performance (6-minute walking distance and quadriceps force) were compared between groups. Results Daily number of steps was similar in both patient groups (mean±SE: 5631±459 for ILD, 5544±547 for COPD, p = 0.900), but significantly lower compared to healthy subjects (10031±536, p&lt;0.001 for both). Mean intensity of PA tended to be lower in the ILD group (mean±SE metabolic equivalents of task per day: 1.41±0.04) compared to COPD (1.52±0.05, p = 0.074) and healthy individuals (1.67±0.04, p&lt;0.001). The pattern of PA over one day was found to be similar between the three groups. Lastly, the correlation between PA and 6-minute walking distance was significantly weaker in patients with ILD compared to patients with COPD (respectively r = 0.348 and r = 0.739; p&lt;0.05 for both). Conclusions For a given functional reserve, patients with ILD perform an equal amount of steps but perform PA at lower intensity compared to patients with COPD. Both groups are less active compared to healthy control subjects. Functional exercise capacity was shown to be only moderately related to PA. This can potentially influence the effectiveness of PA interventions that can be expected."
https://openalex.org/W4309495147,"Skin lesion segmentation has become an essential recent direction in machine learning for medical applications. In a deep learning segmentation network, the convolutional neural network (CNN) uses convolution to capture local information for modeling. However, it ignores the relationship between pixels and still can not meet the precise segmentation requirements of some complex low contrast datasets. Transformer performs well in modeling global feature information, but their ability to extract fine-grained local feature patterns is weak. In this work, The dual coding fusion network architecture Transformer and CNN (TC-Net), as an architecture that can more accurately combine local feature information and global feature information, can improve the segmentation performance of skin images. The results of this work demonstrate that the combination of CNN and Transformer brings very significant improvement in global segmentation performance and allows outperformance as compared to the pure single network model. The experimental results and visual analysis of these three datasets quantitatively and qualitatively illustrate the robustness of TC-Net. Compared with Swin UNet, on the ISIC2018 dataset, it has increased by 2.46% in the dice index and about 4% in the JA index. On the ISBI2017 dataset, the dice and JA indices rose by about 4%."
https://openalex.org/W4309370203,"The characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is of high value for understanding protein function. Two strategies are popular for identification of PPIs direct from the cellular environment: affinity capture (pulldown) isolates the protein of interest with an immobilized matrix that specifically captures the target and potential partners, whereas in BioID, genetic fusion of biotin ligase facilitates proximity biotinylation, and labeled proteins are isolated with streptavidin. Whilst both methods provide valuable insights, they can reveal distinct PPIs, but the basis for these differences is less obvious. Here, we compare both methods using four different trypanosome proteins as baits: poly(A)-binding proteins PABP1 and PABP2, mRNA export receptor MEX67, and the nucleoporin NUP158. With BioID, we found that the population of candidate interacting proteins decreases with more confined bait protein localization, but the candidate population is less variable with affinity capture. BioID returned more likely false positives, in particular for proteins with less confined localization, and identified low molecular weight proteins less efficiently. Surprisingly, BioID for MEX67 identified exclusively proteins lining the inner channel of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), consistent with the function of MEX67, whereas the entire NPC was isolated by pulldown. Similarly, for NUP158, BioID returned surprisingly few PPIs within NPC outer rings that were by contrast detected with pulldown but instead returned a larger cohort of nuclear proteins. These rather significant differences highlight a clear issue with reliance on a single method to identify PPIs and suggest that BioID and affinity capture are complementary rather than alternative approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4309370502,"Eukaryotic cells harbor two DNA-binding clamps, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and another clamp commonly referred to as 9-1-1 clamp. In contrast to the essential role of PCNA in DNA replication as a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase (Pol) δ, no such role in DNA synthesis has been identified for the human 9-1-1 clamp or the orthologous yeast 17-3-1 clamp. The only role identified for either the 9-1-1 or 17-3-1 clamp is in the recruitment of signal transduction kinases, which affect the activation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage. However, unlike the loading of PCNA by the replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader onto 3'-recessed DNA junctions for processive DNA synthesis by Polδ, the 17-3-1 clamp or the 9-1-1 clamp is loaded by their respective clamp loader Rad24-RFC or RAD17-RFC onto the 5'-recessed DNA junction of replication protein A-coated DNA for the recruitment of signal transduction kinases. Here, we identify a novel role of 17-3-1 clamp as a sliding clamp for DNA synthesis by Polε. We provide evidence that similar to the loading of PCNA by RFC, the 17-3-1 clamp is loaded by the Rad24-RFC clamp loader at the 3'-recessed DNA junction in an ATP-dependent manner. However, unlike PCNA, the 17-3-1 clamp does not enhance the processivity of DNA synthesis by Polε; instead, it greatly increases the catalytic efficiency of Polε for correct nucleotide incorporation. Furthermore, we show that the same PCNA-interacting peptide domain in the polymerase 2 catalytic subunit mediates Polε interaction with the 17-3-1 clamp and with PCNA."
https://openalex.org/W4309494751,"The optimal growth of domesticated cats has not yet been well defined. This study first aimed to create evidence-based growth standards for healthy pet domestic shorthair (DSH) kittens, and then compare the pattern of growth curves depicted by the standards with growth patterns in other healthy DSH kittens and those with abnormal body condition. Data were derived from the clinical records of the BANFIELD® Pet Hospital (BANFIELD) network in the USA and from a research population in the UK (Waltham Petcare Science Institute, UK). A 'modelling' dataset was first created from the BANFIELD records, comprising bodyweight data from immature client-owned DSH cats that had remained healthy and in ideal body condition within the first 2.5y of life. This was used to construct growth centile curves for male and female kittens, covering the age range 8 to 78 weeks, using Generalised Additive Models for Location, Shape and Scale. Growth patterns depicted by the centile curves were compared with the growth patterns of healthy DSH kittens from both research colonies and kittens attending BANFIELD that were classified as overweight or underweight. Overall, there was a broad agreement to the growth standards with approximately half of the research population (206/507, 49%) staying within 2 centile lines of their starting centile, and upward and downward movements outside this range being roughly equally distributed. Compared with the growth standards, the 122 overweight BANFIELD kittens were heavier on average at the start of monitoring and subsequently grew more quickly with 63 (52%) crossing at least 2 standard centile lines upwards. Only 4 underweight DSH kittens were available in the BANFIELD database; compared with the standards, there was a marked initial dip in growth followed by subsequent catch-up growth and 2/4 kittens crossed 2 or more centile lines downwards at some point. Evidence-based growth standards are developed here for male and female sexually-intact DSH kittens. Crossing centiles in an upwards and downwards direction is associated with cats becoming overweight or underweight by early adulthood, respectively. Further work is required to determine whether the clinical use of these growth standards will improve the health and wellbeing of pet cats."
https://openalex.org/W4309495104,"Glucagon for Injection is a polypeptide hormone medication used to treat patients with severe hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. Only recently, was a generic version of glucagon for injection approved by the FDA. While the generic version was deemed equivalent to its brand-name counterpart, the two glucagon products were produced using different manufacturing processes. The brand-name glucagon is produced via recombinant DNA while the generic glucagon is produced by peptide synthesis. Different manufacturing processes can result in different levels of innate immune response modulating impurities (IIRMIs). This study utilized a cell-based assay method, which allows for detection of a broad spectrum of impurities, to investigate the IIRMI risks of the generic glucagon to make sure it has similar or less immunogenicity risks than the brand-name glucagon product. Three commercial cell lines (RAW-Blue™, HEK-Blue™-hNOD1 and HEK-Blue™-hNOD2) carrying a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter construct were used to quantify the level of innate immune responses after being treated with the glucagon drugs. The study results showed that despite differences in manufacturing process, the innate immunogenicity risk in the synthetic (generic) glucagon was at negligible level and comparable to the recombinant (brand-name) glucagon product."
https://openalex.org/W4309495106,"Needle phobia is an overlooked condition that affects virtually all medical procedures. Our study aimed to identify how commonly needle phobia is experienced, its underlying reasons, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. A global survey was conducted in a general adult population using a questionnaire based on a targeted literature review that identified under-researched areas. The 21-item questionnaire was completed on a secure, web-based survey platform. Statistical analyses and models were utilized to identify relationships between participant characteristics and needle phobia. Of the 2,098 participants enrolled in the study, 63.2% (n = 1,325) reported experiencing needle phobia, and rated the intensity of their fear as 5.7 (±2.6) on average on a scale from 0 (no fear) to 10 (very strong/unreasonable fear or avoidance). According to the logistic regression model, other medical fears (odds coefficient = 2.14) and family history (1.67) were the most important factors associated with needle phobia. General anxiety (96.1%) and pain (95.5%) were the most common reasons for needle fear. Of the participants experiencing needle phobia, 52.2% stated avoiding blood draws, followed by 49.0% for blood donations, and 33.1% for vaccinations. While 24.3% of participants have seen a therapist, most have never sought help. The majority have shared their fear with nurses (61.1%) or physicians (44.4%); however, the provider helpfulness was rated as 4.9 (±3.1) on average on a scale from 0 (unhelpful) to 10 (extremely helpful). Utilizing non-invasive alternatives (94.1%) and smaller needles (91.1%) were most commonly identified as potential device-related solutions to alleviate fear; distractions (92.1%) and relaxation techniques (91.7%) were the top non-device-related approaches. Our findings highlight the prevalent nature of needle phobia and provide insights into its etiology and effects on patient care. Clinician responses were not perceived as helpful, emphasizing the need to address needle phobia, and improve patient experience."

A combination of seated balance training on an unstable surface and real-time visual feedback via a simple mobile inclinometer application may improve trunk control in stroke survivors. Objective This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the effects of home-based exercise utilizing a balance disc with input from a smartphone inclinometer application on sitting balance and activities of daily living in stroke survivors. Methods This trial enrolled 32 stroke survivors aged 30 to 75 years. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: intervention or control. Both groups underwent four weeks of traditional therapy. Additionally, the intervention group received four weeks of multidirectional lean training utilizing a balance disc and a smartphone application with an inclinometer. The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS), the Function in Sitting Test (FIST), and the Barthel Index (BI) were used to assess the results. To compare between group effects, an ANCOVA analysis was performed using a baseline as a covariate. Results The PASS changing posture and BI were considerably greater in the intervention group compared to the control group. Other metrics revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups. Conclusion Home-based training with balance discs and input from a smartphone inclinometer application may improve postural control and daily activity in stroke patients.

https://openalex.org/W4309495122,"Onchocerca lupi is a filarial nematode that causes ocular onchocercosis in canines globally including North America and areas of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Reported incidence of this parasite in canines has continued to steadily escalate since the early 21st century and was more recently documented in humans. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of this parasite can provide insight into gene content, provide novel surveillance targets, and elucidate the origin and range expansion. However, past attempts of whole genome sequencing of other Onchocerca species reported a substantial portion of their data unusable due to the variable over-abundance of host DNA in samples. Here, we have developed a method to determine the host-to-parasite DNA ratio using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach that relies on two standard plasmids each of which contains a single copy gene specific to the parasite genus Onchocerca (major body wall myosin gene, myosin) or a single copy gene specific to the canine host (polycystin-1 precursor, pkd1). These plasmid standards were used to determine the copy number of the myosin and pkd1 genes within a sample to calculate the ratio of parasite and host DNA. Furthermore, whole genome sequence (WGS) data for three O. lupi isolates were consistent with our host-to-parasite DNA ratio results. Our study demonstrates, despite unified DNA extraction methods, variable quantities of host DNA within any one sample which will likely affect downstream WGS applications. Our quantification assay of host-to-parasite genome copy number provides a robust and accurate method of assessing canine host DNA load in an O. lupi specimen that will allow informed sample selection for WGS. This study has also provided the first whole genome draft sequence for this species. This approach is also useful for future focused WGS studies of other parasites."

Studies employing neuroimaging measures to track FRDA have thus far been limited by their small sample sizes and limited follow up. TRACK-FA, a longitudinal, multi-site, and multi-modal neuroimaging natural history study, aims to address these shortcomings by enabling better understanding of underlying pathology and identifying sensitive, clinical trial ready, neuroimaging biomarkers for FRDA.200 individuals with FRDA and 104 control participants will be recruited across seven international study sites. Inclusion criteria for participants with genetically confirmed FRDA involves, age of disease onset ≤ 25 years, Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) functional staging score of ≤ 5, and a total modified FARS (mFARS) score of ≤ 65 upon enrolment. The control cohort is matched to the FRDA cohort for age, sex, handedness, and years of education. Participants will be evaluated at three study visits over two years. Each visit comprises of a harmonized multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) scan of the brain and spinal cord; clinical, cognitive, mood and speech assessments and collection of a blood sample. Primary outcome measures, informed by previous neuroimaging studies, include measures of: spinal cord and brain morphometry, spinal cord and brain microstructure (measured using diffusion MRI), brain iron accumulation (using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping) and spinal cord biochemistry (using MRS). Secondary and exploratory outcome measures include clinical, cognitive assessments and blood biomarkers.Prioritising immediate areas of need, TRACK-FA aims to deliver a set of sensitive, clinical trial-ready neuroimaging biomarkers to accelerate drug discovery efforts and better understand disease trajectory. Once validated, these potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers can be used to measure the efficacy of new therapeutics in forestalling disease progression.ClinicalTrails.gov Identifier: NCT04349514."

The optimized peptide 2D5 inhibited DU145 and A549 tumor growth similarly to STAP-2 knockdown. EGFR signaling and its stability were clearly decreased by 2D5 peptide treatment. These data indicate that our designed peptide may be a novel anticancer drug that inhibits STAP-2–mediated activation of EGFR signaling. Our previous study demonstrated that STAP-2 interacts with EGFR via its PH domain and facilitates EGFR stabilization, implying that STAP-2 PH domain–derived peptides competitively inhibit STAP-2–EGFR interactions and decrease EGFR stability (Fig. 1A) (15Kitai Y. Iwakami M. Saitoh K. Togi S. Isayama S. Sekine Y. et al.STAP-2 protein promotes prostate cancer growth by enhancing epidermal growth factor receptor stabilization.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 19392-19399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We selected six peptide sequences in the human STAP-2 PH domain. Because octa-arginine sequences enhance the cell-penetrating capability of peptides, we conjugated R8 (RRRRRRRRGG) to the N-terminal of the six peptide sequences that are referred as #1 to #6 in Table 1. We investigated whether #1 to #6 peptides inhibited the proliferation of DU145 cells that express both STAP-2 and EGFR. As shown in Figure 1B, #2 and #6, but not #1, #3, or #4 peptides suppressed DU145 and MCF7 cell growth. Since #5 peptide had low water solubility and did not suppress MCF7 cell growth, we focused on #2 and #6 sequences and redesigned two series of peptides by shortening the amino acids sequences derived from #2 (#2A–#2D) and #6 (#6E and #6F) peptides. We synthesized the peptide between 52 and 78 residues, but this peptide has very poor solubility and makes large aggregates in the medium. Thus, we did not focus on 57 to 78 residue region in STAP-2 PH domain. #2-derived 2A, 2C, and 2D peptides suppressed DU145 cell growth dose-dependently (Fig. 1C, left column). Most amino acid sequences of 2A, 2C, and 2D peptides overlapped (Table 1). Because the 2D peptide was common among the three sequences and the shortest, we further redesigned 2D-derived 2D2, 2D3, 2D4, and 2D5 peptides (Table 1). 2D2, 2D3, and 2D5 peptides, but not the 2D4 peptide, significantly suppressed DU145 cell growth (Fig. 1C, right column). As shown in Table 1, 2D2, 2D3, and 2D5 peptide sequences were very similar, and the 2D5 peptide sequence was common among the three sequences and the shortest. Thus, we identify seven amino acids (2D5; GLTIYFY) in the N-terminal of the human STAP-2 PH domain as a possible inhibitory peptide sequence. #6-derived 6E and 6F peptides suppressed DU145 cell growth (Fig. 1D, left column). However, their overlapped sequence, #6E4, as well as #6E2 or #6E3 did not inhibit DU145 cell growth (Fig. 1D, right column).Table 1A list of the STAP-2–derived peptidesPeptideSequence#1(P18-K37)RRRRRRRRGGPSHYYESFLEKKGPCDRDYK#2(D33-N52)RRRRRRRRGGDRDYKKFWAGLQGLTIYFYN#3(T123-E142)RRRRRRRRGGTDLTLLPGHLYMMSEVLAKE#4(G78-K97)RRRRRRRRGGGSSRDPGTHFSLILRDQEIK#5(D93-F112)RRRRRRRRGGDQEIKFKVETLECREMWKGF#6(M108-L127)RRRRRRRRGGMWKGFILTVVELRVPTDLTL2A(F39-Q58)RRRRRRRRGGFWAGLQGLTIYFYNSNRDFQ2B(F50-N64)RRRRRRRRGGFYNSNRDFQHVEKLN2C(Q44-Q58)RRRRRRRRGGQGLTIYFYNSNRDFQ2D(Q44-R55)RRRRRRRRGGQGLTIYFYNSNR6E(V116-M135)RRRRRRRRGGVVELRVPTDLTLLPGHLYMM6F (I113-P122)RRRRRRRRGGILTVVELRVP2D2(Q44-Y51)RRRRRRRRGGQGLTIYFY2D3(G45-N52)RRRRRRRRGGGLTIYFYN2D4(Q44-Y49)RRRRRRRRGGQGLTIY2D5(G45-Y51)RRRRRRRRGGGLTIYFY6E2(V121-G130)RRRRRRRRGGVPTDLTLLPG6E3(V116-G130)RRRRRRRRGGVVELRVPTDLTLLPG6E4(V116-P122)RRRRRRRRGGVVELRVPTAT-2D5GRKKRRQRRRPPQGGLTIYFYHTLV-II-Rex-2D5TRRQRTRRARRNRGGLTIYFYFHV-2D5RRRRNRTRRNRRRVRGGLTIYFYΔR8-2D5GLTIYFY Open table in a new tab We focused on 2D5 peptide to clarify further effects. 2D5 peptide induced cell death in DU145 cells (Fig. 1E). Incorporation of 2D5 peptide into DU145 cells was dependent on the R8 sequence (Fig. 1F). We next designed 2D5-derived peptides by converting the R8 sequence in 2D5 peptide to other cell-penetrating peptides, which were derived from HIV TAT (GRKKRRQRRRPPQGG), HTLV-II Rex (TRRQRTRRARRNRGG), and FHV (RRRRNRTRRNRRRVRGG). These 2D5-derived peptides, but not 2D5 peptide without the R8 sequence, suppressed DU145 cell growth, indicating that the cytotoxic effects of 2D5 peptide required a cell-penetrating capability (Fig. 1G). 2D5 peptide inhibited the growth of various human EGFR-expressing cell lines, but not in human T cell line Jurkat or human keratinocyte-like cell line HaCaT, suggesting that 2D5 peptide was less cytotoxic in MDA-MB-453 cells and SW620 cells, EGFR-negative human cell lines, and noncancer cells like HaCaT cells (Fig. 1H). Additionally, 2D5 peptide did not inhibit the proliferation of murine cancer cell lines such as B16-F10, E0771, and EL4 (Fig. 1H). We assessed the inhibitory effect of 2D5 peptide on DU145 cell growth at various concentrations and its IC50 was calculated to be 19.4 μM from Cell Titer glo assay (Fig. 1I). These data indicated that 2D5 peptide, a human STAP-2 PH domain-derived peptide, with a cell-penetrating capability significantly inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we investigated whether 2D5 peptide inhibited STAP-2–EGFR interactions and suppressed EGFR signaling. ΔR8-2D5 peptide, which lacked the octa-arginine sequence, inhibited the in vitro interaction between STAP-2 and EGFR (Fig. 2A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is important for activation of its downstream signaling. Phosphorylation of Y1068 in EGFR is required for EGFR-mediated STAT3 and ERK activation. Conversely, Y1173 phosphorylation of EGFR suppresses ERK activation through SHP-2. 2D5 peptide decreased EGF-induced Y1068 and total tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and suppressed phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK (Fig. 2, B–F). 2D5 peptide did not decrease the phosphorylation of ERK and STAT3 in EGFR-knockdown DU145 cells and SW620 cells (Fig. 2, G–I). Y1068 and Y1173 phosphorylation of EGFR was not required for its binding to STAP-2, suggesting that 2D5 peptide may inhibit STAP-2–EGFR interactions independent of Y1068 and Y1173 phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 2J). 2D5 peptide decreased the mRNA levels of Ccnd1 and Survivin that are target genes of EGFR signaling (Fig. 2K). Although both 2D5 peptide and gefitinib inhibited DU145 cell growth, additional or synergistic effects were not observed (Fig. 2L). These data indicated that the mechanism of cytotoxicity caused by 2D5 peptide treatment overlapped with gefitinib in EGFR signaling. Cytotoxicity of 2D5 peptide disappeared in STAP-2–knockdown DU145 cells, indicating that 2D5 peptide inhibited cancer cell growth dependently on STAP-2 expression (Fig. 2M). Moreover, 2D5 peptide treatment did not affect MyD88-mediated signaling. 2D5 peptide did not inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activation in THP-1–derived macrophages (Fig. 2N). These data indicated that 2D5 peptide inhibited STAP-2–EGFR interactions and decreased cancer cell growth via downregulation of EGFR signaling. We previously demonstrated that EGFR localization to lysosomes increases in STAP-2–knockdown DU145 cells during EGF stimulation (15Kitai Y. Iwakami M. Saitoh K. Togi S. Isayama S. Sekine Y. et al.STAP-2 protein promotes prostate cancer growth by enhancing epidermal growth factor receptor stabilization.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 19392-19399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data indicate that STAP-2 promotes EGFR stabilization by inhibiting EGFR translocation and degradation in lysosomes. Thus, we investigated whether 2D5 peptide enhanced translocation to lysosomes and EGFR degradation. EGFR proteins translocated from the surface membrane to lysosomes in response to EGF stimulation. As expected, this translocation was enhanced by 2D5 peptide treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, EGFR proteins disappeared more rapidly after 2D5 peptide treatment of EGF-stimulated DU145 cells (Fig. 3C). After EGF stimulation, the half-life of EGFR proteins was approximately 25 min in 2D5-treated DU145 cells, but more than 40 min in control cells (Fig. 3D). These data indicated that 2D5 peptide decreased EGFR stability during EGF stimulation by promoting EGFR translocation to lysosomes. Finally, we investigated whether 2D5 peptide inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. 2D5 peptide injection inhibited tumor formation of DU145 and A549 cells, but a control peptide (6E4), which had shown no cytotoxic effects on cancer cell growth in vitro, did not affect tumor development (Figs. 1D and 4, A–D). Furthermore, 2D5 peptide did not show antitumor effects on SW620 tumor in murine xenograft model (Fig. 4, E and F). Administration of 2D5 peptide did not affect mouse body weight, suggesting that 2D5 peptide has less toxicity in vivo (Fig. 4G). These data indicated that 2D5 peptide had in vivo antitumor effects on EGFR-driven prostate and lung cancer progression. Adaptor proteins correlate to cancer progression by regulating various intracellular signals induced by cytokines, growth factors, and integrins (19Almasabi S. Ahmed A.U. Boyd R. Williams B.R.G.

However, inhibition of adaptor proteins by small compounds is difficult because of the lack of their enzymatic activity. Peptides bind to target proteins with high specificity and interfere with protein–protein interactions, suggesting that well-designed peptides have the potential to be inhibitors of adaptor proteins. Our previous studies have shown that STAP-2 binds to various intracellular signaling molecules including EGFR, Fas, BCR-ABL, and MyD88 (12Sekine Y. Yamamoto C. Kakisaka M. Muromoto R. Kon S.

Yoshimura A. et al.STAP-2 interacts with and modulates BCR-ABL-mediated tumorigenesis.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 4384-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MyD88 interacts with the SH2 domain of STAP-2 and promotes cytokine production by upregulating IKK-mediated NF-κB activation (13Sekine Y. Yumioka T. Yamamoto T. Muromoto R. Imoto S. Sugiyma K. et al.Modulation of TLR4 signaling by a novel adaptor protein signal-transducing adaptor protein-2 in macrophages.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 2D5 peptide treatment did not affect LPS-induced NF-κB activation in THP-1 macrophages, indicating that 2D5 peptide does not inhibit STAP-2–mediated MyD88 regulation (Fig. 2N). Thus, 2D5 peptide selectively inhibits STAP-2 PH, but not SH2, domain functions. This selectivity is likely to be derived from highly specific sequence recognition by the peptide. 2D5 peptide inhibited the proliferation of human, but not murine, cancer cells, suggesting that STAP-2 contributes to EGFR-mediated proliferation of human cancer cells, but not murine cancer cell lines (Fig. 1H). The 2D5 peptide region in STAP-2 has 71% identity (five out of seven amino acids), although the cytosolic domain of EGFR has 96% identity between humans and mice. STAP-2 knockdown decreases the proliferation in B16-F10 cells, but we did not find a STAP-2–EGFR complex in a murine cell line (data not shown). Thus, we speculate that murine STAP-2 enhances EGFR-independent cell proliferation and does not affect EGFR signaling in murine cancer cells. Cytotoxicity in normal cells and tissues is a major problem in the development of antitumor drugs, because it causes unexpected side effects during clinical trials. 2D5 peptide showed antitumor effects against prostate and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo but did not inhibit the proliferation of noncancer cells (Fig. 1H). Furthermore, administration of 2D5 peptide clearly inhibited prostate and lung cancer cell growth but did not decrease body weight of the murine xenograft model (Fig. 4G). Additionally, STAP-2–deficient mice have no obvious phenotypes under a steady-state condition (23Saitoh K. Kashiwakura J.I. Kagohashi K. Sasaki Y. Kawahara S. Sekine Y. et al.STAP-2 is a novel positive regulator of TCR-proximal signals.J. Immunol. 2022; 209: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that 2D5 peptide has less cytotoxic effects on normal cells and tissues than common EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Numerous studies have shown that EGFR and its downstream signals are overactivated in various cancer cell lines, but not in normal cells, suggesting that 2D5 peptide with high sequence specificity is preferentially cytotoxic against EGFR-overactivated cells (7Jorissen R.N.

In support of this idea, several cancer cells overexpress EGFR-stabilizing proteins, such as Sortilin, TRIB3, and USP22, which suppress EGFR degradation, and their knockdown inhibits cancer cell proliferation (24Al-Akhrass H. Naves T. Vincent F. Magnaudeix A. Durand K. Bertin F. et al.Sortilin limits EGFR signaling by promoting its internalization in lung cancer.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Yu J.J. Zhou D.D. Yang X.X. Cui B. Tan F.W.

Meng Q. et al.USP22 promotes resistance to EGFR-TKIs by preventing ubiquitination-mediated EGFR degradation in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.Cancer Lett. 2018; 433: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, these “EGFR stabilizers”, including STAP-2, are good targets for the treatment of EGFR-overactivated cancers such as nonsmall cell lung, prostate, and breast cancers. The IC50 of 2D5 peptide in DU145 cells was 19.4 μM in vitro (Fig. 1I). 2D5 peptide should be improved to inhibit cancer cell growth at lower concentrations because general antitumor drugs are required for antiproliferative effects at the sub-micro molar concentration in vitro. In this regard, 2D5 peptide might be improved by increasing its stability and affinity for EGFR. Recent studies have reported that stapled peptides have higher affinity for target molecules, more resistance against proteases, and a higher cell-penetrating capability (27Lau Y.H. Wu Y. Rossmann M. Tan B.X. de Andrade P. Tan Y.S. et al.Double strain-promoted macrocyclization for the rapid selection of cell-active stapled peptides.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2015; 54: 15410-15413Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). EGFR is degraded in lysosomes after EGF stimulation, implying that 2D5 peptide is also degraded together with EGFR in lysosomes. Thus, a stapled 2D5 peptide may have higher resistance against lysosomal proteases and anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo at lower concentrations similarly to general anticancer drugs. Adaptor proteins have been considered to be undruggable targets for many years but have become druggable targets through the development of new peptide techniques. In this study, we showed that 2D5 peptide acted as an inhibitor of STAP-2–EGFR interactions and suppressed EGFR-mediated cancer cell growth. Thus, 2D5 peptide-inhibitor may be used as a novel antitumor drug in the future. All animals were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions.

Currently, curative treatments for SMS do not exist. Here, we take a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats activation (CRISPRa) approach to increase expression of the remaining intact Rai1 allele. Building upon our previous work that found the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus plays a central role in SMS pathogenesis, we performed paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus-specific rAAV-CRISPRa therapy by increasing endogenous Rai1 expression in SMS (Rai1±) mice. We found that rAAV-CRISPRa therapy rescues excessive repetitive behavior, delays the onset of obesity, and partially reduces hyperphagia in SMS mice. Our work provides evidence that rAAV-CRISPRa therapy during early adolescence can boost the expression of healthy Rai1 allele and modify disease progression in a mouse model of Smith-Magenis syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W4309370547,"Cancer cells, including those of prostate cancer (PCa), often hijack intrinsic cell signaling to reprogram their metabolism. Part of this reprogramming includes the activation of de novo synthesis of fatty acids that not only serve as building blocks for membrane synthesis but also as energy sources for cell proliferation. However, how de novo fatty acid synthesis contributes to PCa progression is still poorly understood. Herein, by mining public datasets, we discovered that the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), which encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), was highly expressed in human PCa. In addition, patients with high ACACA expression had a short disease-free survival time. We also reported that depletion of ACACA reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis and PI3K/AKT signaling in the human castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cell lines DU145 and PC3. Furthermore, depletion of ACACA downregulates mitochondrial beta-oxidation, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, a reduction in ATP production, an imbalanced NADP+/NADPhydrogen(H) ratio, increased reactive oxygen species, and therefore apoptosis. Reduced exogenous fatty acids by depleting lipid or lowering serum supplementation exacerbated both shRNA depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ACACA-induced apoptosis in vitro. Collectively, our results suggest that inhibition of ectopic ACACA, together with suppression of exogenous fatty acid uptake, can be a novel strategy for treating currently incurable CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W4309370745,"MYB, a proto-oncogene, is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and promotes its growth, aggressiveness, and resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy. Here, we examined the effect of androgen signaling on MYB expression and delineated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Paralleling a dichotomous effect on growth, low-dose androgen induced MYB expression at both transcript and protein levels, whereas it was suppressed in high-dose androgen-treated PCa cells. Interestingly, treatment with both low- and high-dose androgen transcriptionally upregulated MYB by increasing the binding of androgen receptor to the MYB promoter. In a time-course assay, androgen induced MYB expression at early time points followed by a sharp decline in high-dose androgen-treated cells due to decreased stability of MYB mRNA. Additionally, profiling of MYB-targeted miRNAs demonstrated significant induction of miR-150 in high-dose androgen-treated PCa cells. We observed a differential binding of androgen receptor on miR-150 promoter with significantly greater occupancy recorded in high-dose androgen-treated cells than those treated with low-dose androgen. Functional inhibition of miR-150 relieved MYB suppression by high-dose androgen, while miR-150 mimic abolished MYB induction by low-dose androgen. Furthermore, MYB-silencing or miR-150 mimic transfection suppressed PCa cell growth induced by low-dose androgen, whereas miR-150 inhibition rescued PCa cells from growth repression by high-dose androgen. Similarly, we observed that MYB silencing suppressed the expression of androgen-responsive, cell cycle-related genes in low-dose androgen-treated cells, while miR-150 inhibition increased their expression in cells treated with high-dose androgen. Overall, these findings reveal novel androgen-mediated mechanisms of MYB regulation that support its biphasic growth control in PCa cells."
https://openalex.org/W4309494803,"Hospital-acquired infections of communicable viral diseases (CVDs) have been posing a tremendous challenge to healthcare workers globally. Healthcare personnel (HCP) is facing a consistent risk of viral infections, and subsequently higher rates of morbidity and mortality.We proposed a domain-knowledge-driven infection risk model to quantify the individual HCP and the population-level risks. For individual-level risk estimation, a time-variant infection risk model is proposed to capture the transmission dynamics of CVDs. At the population-level, the infection risk is estimated using a Bayesian network model constructed from three feature sets, including individual-level factors, engineering control factors, and administrative control factors. For model validation, we investigated the case study of the Coronavirus disease, in which the individual-level and population-level infection risk models were applied. The data were collected from various sources such as COVID-19 transmission databases, health surveys/questionaries from medical centers, U.S. Department of Labor databases, and cross-sectional studies.Regarding the individual-level risk model, the variance-based sensitivity analysis indicated that the uncertainty in the estimated risk was attributed to two variables: the number of close contacts and the viral transmission probability. Next, the disease transmission probability was computed using a multivariate logistic regression applied for a cross-sectional HCP data in the UK, with the 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 78.23%. Combined with the previous result, we further validated the individual infection risk model by considering six occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor O*Net database. The occupation-specific risk evaluation suggested that the registered nurses, medical assistants, and respiratory therapists were the highest-risk occupations. For the population-level risk model validation, the infection risk in Texas and California was estimated, in which the infection risk in Texas was lower than that in California. This can be explained by California's higher patient load for each HCP per day and lower personal protective equipment (PPE) sufficiency level.The accurate estimation of infection risk at both individual level and population levels using our domain-knowledge-driven infection risk model will significantly enhance the PPE allocation, safety plans for HCP, and hospital staffing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4309495109,"Formulations of macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics such as moxidectin are regularly administered to sheep to combat parasites. A disadvantage of these pharmaceuticals are their side effects on non-target organisms when entering the environment. Little is known about anthelmintic effects on plant reproduction and whether the effects depend on environmental factors. For ecological and methodological reasons, we aimed at testing whether temperature affects the efficacy of a common moxidectin-based formulation on seed germination. We carried out a germination experiment including three typical species of temperate European grasslands (Centaurea jacea, Galium mollugo, Plantago lanceolata). We applied three temperature regimes (15/5, 20/10, 30/20°C), and a four-level dilution series (1:100-1:800) of formulated moxidectin (i.e., Cydectin oral drench). These solutions represent seed-anthelmintic contacts in the digestive tract of sheep shortly after deworming. In addition, a control was carried out with purified water only. We regularly counted emerging seedlings and calculated final germination percentage, mean germination time and synchrony of germination. Formulated moxidectin significantly reduced percentage, speed and synchrony of germination. A 1:100 dilution of the formulation reduced germination percentage by a quarter and increased mean germination time by six days compared to the control. Temperature moderated effects of the anthelmintic drug on germination in all response variables and all species, but in different patterns and magnitudes (significant anthelmintic x temperature x species interactions). In all response variables, the two more extreme temperature regimes (15/5, 30/20°C) led to the strongest effects of formulated moxidectin. With respect to germination percentage, G. mollugo was more sensitive to formulated moxidectin at the warmest temperature regime, whereas P. lanceolata showed the highest sensitivity at the coldest regime. This study shows that it is important to consider temperature dependencies of the effects of pharmaceuticals on seed germination when conducting standardised germination experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4309495119,"Isomeric lysosphingolipids, galactosylsphingosine (GalSph) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), are present in only minute levels in healthy cells. Due to defects in their lysosomal hydrolysis, they accumulate at high levels and cause cytotoxicity in patients with Krabbe and Gaucher diseases, respectively. Here, we show that GalSph and GlcSph induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization, a hallmark of lysosome-dependent cell death, in human breast cancer cells (MCF7) and primary fibroblasts. Supporting lysosomal leakage as a causative event in lysosphingolipid-induced cytotoxicity, treatment of MCF7 cells with lysosome-stabilizing cholesterol prevented GalSph- and GlcSph-induced cell death almost completely. In line with this, fibroblasts from a patient with Niemann-Pick type C disease, which is caused by defective lysosomal cholesterol efflux, were significantly less sensitive to lysosphingolipid-induced lysosomal leakage and cell death. Prompted by the data showing that MCF7 cells with acquired resistance to lysosome-destabilizing cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) were partially resistant to the cell death induced by GalSph and GlcSph, we compared these cell death pathways with each other. Like CADs, GalSph and GlcSph activated the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signalling pathway, and cAMP-inducing forskolin sensitized cells to cell death induced by low concentrations of lysosphingolipids. Contrary to CADs, lysosphingolipid-induced cell death was independent of lysosomal Ca2+ efflux through P2X purinerigic receptor 4. These data reveal GalSph and GlcSph as lysosome-destabilizing lipids, whose putative use in cancer therapy should be further investigated. Furthermore, the data supports the development of lysosome stabilizing drugs for the treatment of Krabbe and Gaucher diseases and possibly other sphingolipidoses."
https://openalex.org/W4309495237,"In this study we examined three correlates of personal wealth-financial capability, buying impulsiveness, and attitudes to money in a large UK adult sample (N = 90,184). We were interested in how these psychological variables related to personal wealth controlling for well-established demographic correlates: age, education, gender, and household income. We drew on three personal wealth variables based on savings and investments, property wealth and personal items. Using correlational and regression analysis we tested three specific hypotheses which each received support. Our variables accounted for around half the variance with respect to property value, and two thirds with respect to investments. The hierarchical regression onto the savings and investment factor showed two thirds of the variance was accounted for: the demographic variables accounted for 27% of the variance, money attitudes an additional 14%; financial capability an additional 24% and buying impulsivity no additional variance. Age, income, and planning ahead were the most powerful and consistent predictors of wealth variables, with associating money with security as an important predictor for savings and investments. Implications for helping improve financial literacy and capability are noted. Limitations are acknowledged."
https://openalex.org/W4309370205,"Hsp70s are multifunctional proteins and serve as the central hub of the protein quality control network. Hsp70s are also related to a number of diseases and have been established as drug targets. Human HspA1A (hHsp70) and HspA8 (hHsc70) are the major cytosolic Hsp70s, and they have both overlapping and distinct functions. hHsp70 contains five cysteine residues, and hHsc70 contains four cysteine residues.

Hsp70s are important for life, and they are multifunctional proteins. The most dominant functions of Hsp70s are assisting de novo protein folding, antagonizing stress, and buffering exogenous and endogenous stimulation (3Rosenzweig R. Nillegoda N.B. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. The Hsp70 chaperone network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 665-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Hsp70s are the central hub of the protein quality control network, and they can interact with numerous clients to chaperone and facilitate their proper activity, contributing to proteostasis (4Fernández-Fernández M.R.

Hsp70s are also involved in a number of diseases and are established drug targets, including for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases, due to the participation of Hsp70s in maintaining the high tolerance of cancer cells, preventing and removing aggregates and modulating the immune response (5Shrestha L.

Pharmacological targeting of the Hsp70 chaperone.Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2009; 9: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hsp70s are often conserved in sequence and structure with evolution (7Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M. The heat shock protein 70 family: highly homologous proteins with overlapping and distinct functions.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The canonical Hsp70 structure contains an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) joined by a flexible linker (Fig. 1A). Hsp70 is a typical allosteric protein and its conformation is affected by nucleotide and substrate binding (8Zuiderweg E.R. Bertelsen E.B. Rousaki A. Mayer M.P. Gestwicki J.E. Ahmad A. Allostery in the Hsp70 chaperone proteins.Top Curr. Chem. 2013; 328: 99-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the ATP-bound state, the two domains of Hsp70 tend to dock together, while in the ADP-bound state, the two domains generally remain independent (9Kityk R. Kopp J. Sinning I. Mayer M.P.

A. 2009; 106: 8471-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). When the SBD is docked with the NBD, its α-helical lid subdomain (SBDα) and β-sheet substrate-binding subdomain (SBDβ) come apart and the interaction between the NBD and SBDβ results in low substrate affinity and low ATPase activity (9Kityk R.

Cell. 2012; 48: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, substrate binding to ATP-bound Hsp70 weakens interaction between the NBD and SBDβ, which leads to undocking of the NBD and SBD and promotes ATP hydrolysis, and the resulting ADP-bound Hsp70 has high substrate affinity (11Zhuravleva A. Clerico E.M. Gierasch L.M.

ATP-ADP exchange in the NBD helps Hsp70 to recover to the ATP-bound state, releasing the bound substrate (12Wu S. Hong L. Wang Y. Yu J. Yang J. Yang J. et al.Kinetics of the conformational cycle of Hsp70 reveals the importance of the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of Hsp70 for its function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 7814-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The above processes form the functional cycle of Hsp70, and different cochaperone Hsp40s and nucleotide exchange factors finely tune this cycle by interacting with Hsp70 (3Rosenzweig R.

HspA1A and HspA8 are the best studied human cytosolic Hsp70s. Human HspA1A is stress inducible, and we term it hHsp70 in this article. Human HspA8, also called 71 kDa heat shock cognate (Hsc70), is the housekeeping Hsp70, and we term it hHsc70. Although these two Hsp70s share 86% sequence identity and have overlapping functions, they also have specific functions and some differences in their properties (7Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M. The heat shock protein 70 family: highly homologous proteins with overlapping and distinct functions.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). hHsp70 tends to respond to stress, while hHsc70 contributes to fundamental cellular activities such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and chaperone-mediated autophagy (7Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M. The heat shock protein 70 family: highly homologous proteins with overlapping and distinct functions.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Proteome-wide analysis has shown that under normal growth conditions, clients of hHsp70 and hHsc70 are largely nonoverlapping, although both of these Hsp70s prefer to associate with newly synthesized polypeptides (13Ryu S.W.

Cysteine is unique in its nucleophilicity and can undergo oxidative modifications upon redox and covalent modifications with electrophiles including certain drugs (18Poole L.B. The basics of thiols and cysteines in redox biology and chemistry.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 80: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).

Our previous studies have shown that glutathionylation of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homolog DnaK can link oxidative stress and the heat shock response by reversibly regulating chaperone activity and interaction between DnaK and its cochaperones (25Zhang H. Yang J. Wu S. Gong W. Chen C. Perrett S. Glutathionylation of the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone DnaK provides a link between oxidative stress and the heat shock response.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 6967-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also found that glutathionylation of Cys residues in the SBDα of hHsp70 reversibly blocks its substrate-binding cleft and turns off the chaperone activity, indicating that chaperone activity of hHsp70 can be regulated by redox (21Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. et al.S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol.

Further, Cys residues in the SBDα of hHsp70 can be covalently modified by the electrophile PES (2-phenylethynesulfonamide or pifithrin-μ) to turn off the chaperone activity of hHsp70 by a similar mechanism as glutathionylation (26Yang J.

It is important to explore the cysteine reactivity of a protein to know the propensity of individual cysteine residues to undergo cysteine modification and to evaluate how the protein is affected by redox and electrophiles (27Backus K.M. Applications of reactive cysteine profiling.Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2019; 420: 375-417PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine reactivity is determined by the pKa of the cysteine thiol group as well as the protein microenvironment around the cysteine thiol (i.e., whether it is in a buried/hydrophobic environment, or an exposed/hydrophilic one, or somewhere in between) (28Bhatnagar A. Bandyopadhyay D. Characterization of cysteine thiol modifications based on protein microenvironments and local secondary structures.Proteins. 2018; 86: 192-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the cysteine reactivity of individual cysteine residues in hHsp70 and hHsc70, explored the factors affecting cysteine reactivity, and further compared glutathionylation and intramolecular disulfide bond formation in hHsp70 and hHsc70 to help understand the mechanistic basis of the functional differences between hHsp70 and hHsc70. hHsp70 has five Cys residues (Cys17, Cys267, and Cys306 in the NBD and Cys574 and Cys603 in the SBDα), while hHsc70 has four Cys residues (Cys17, Cys267 in the NBD and Cys574 and Cys603 in the SBDα) (Fig. 1A). Cys306, which exists in hHsp70 but not in hHsc70, was found to distinguish redox sensitivity between hHsp70 and hHsc70 (29Miyata Y. Rauch J.N. Jinwal U.K. Thompson A.D. Srinivasan S. Dickey C.A. et al.Cysteine reactivity distinguishes redox sensing by the heat-inducible and constitutive forms of heat shock protein 70.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 1391-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our previous results indicate that hHsp70 has higher cysteine reactivity than hHsc70 (21Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. et al.S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol.

PES inhibits human-inducible Hsp70 by covalent targeting of cysteine residues in the substrate-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 296100210Google Scholar). The sequence alignment across the cysteine residues shows that the sequence conservation is very high among mammalian cytosolic stress–induced Hsp70 and Hsc70 but is not as high between mammalian Hsp70 and either yeast or E. coli Hsp70 (Fig. 1B). Here, we compared the cysteine reactivity of native hHsp70 and hHsc70 in the apo, ATP-bound, and ADP-bound states and found hHsp70 has obviously higher cysteine reactivity than hHsc70 especially in the apo state (Fig. 1C). However, under denatured conditions (in the presence of 6 M urea), the detected number of free thiols per hHsp70 or hHsc70 molecule in the apo, ATP-bound, or ADP-bound state almost equals the actual number of Cys residues in the Hsp70 molecule (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the cysteine reactivity of each Cys in hHsp70 and hHsc70 is affected by the native conformation. We then carefully explored the cysteine reactivity of each Cys in hHsp70 and hHsc70. Using hHsp70 and hHsc70 mutants containing only Cys17 but not the other Cys residues, we found the single Cys17 has very low cysteine reactivity in reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and could not undergo glutathionylation upon diamide and GSH treatment (Fig. 2, A–C and E). Using hHsp70 and hHsc70 mutants containing one of the other Cys residues, with or without Cys17, we found that each of the other individual Cys residues besides Cys17 showed cysteine reactivity in DTNB assays and/or glutathionylation reaction upon diamide and GSH treatment (Fig. 2). Glutathionylation of Cys306 in hHsp70 was not sensitive to Western blot detection with anti-GSH antibody although reaction of free thiols with Alexa Fluor 350 (AF 350) dye showed there was no free thiol in hHsp70-C306 after diamide and GSH treatment (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we used MALDI-TOF MS to detect glutathionylation of Cys306 in hHsp70 and found glutathionylated hHsp70-C306 and hHsp70-C17/C306 contained a clear additional peak corresponding to the peptide containing glutathionylated Cys306, compared with the untreated hHsp70-C306 and hHsp70-C17/C306 (Fig. 2D). This suggests that the conserved Cys17 present in both hHsp70 and hHsc70 shows no independent cysteine reactivity if the other Cys residues are mutated, while the other Cys residues have independent reactivity. In the DTNB assay, the reaction rate (the slope of the reaction curve) and the detected free thiol number per molecule can reflect cysteine reactivity, and we found that Cys267, Cys574, and Cys603 have much higher cysteine reactivity in hHsp70 than in hHsc70 (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that Cys residues are more readily exposed in hHsp70 than in hHsc70, implying that hHsp70 has a higher degree of flexibility in terms of structural dynamics than hHsc70. Using hHsp70 mutants containing Cys17 and one of the other Cys, we found that after glutathionylation reaction upon diamide and GSH treatment, hHsp70-C17/C306, hHsp70-C17/C574, and hHsp70-Cys17/C603 still contained free thiols which could be labeled by AF 350 fluorescent dye, while hHsp70-Cys17/C267 did not contain any free thiols (Fig. 2C). This indicates that in hHsp70, modification of Cys17 can only occur as a secondary step subsequent to modification of Cys267. Consistent with this, DTNB assay of hHsp70-C17/C267 showed cysteine reactivity equivalent to about two free thiols and hHsp70-C17/C306, hHsp70-C17/C574, and hHsp70-C17/C603 each showed cysteine reactivity equivalent to only around one free thiol (Fig. 2A). In hHsc70, we noticed that in DTNB assays, hHsc70-C17/C267 has higher cysteine reactivity than hHsc70-C267 (Fig. 2B). However, after diamide and GSH treatment, hHsc70-C17/C267 still has free thiols, and WT hHsc70 in the apo state has no free thiols (Fig. 2E). This suggests that modification of Cys17 is facilitated by modification of the other three Cys residues. In contrast, the single conserved Cys15 in E. coli DnaK (equivalent to Cys17 in human Hsp70) has some cysteine reactivity in the absence of nucleotide (25Zhang H. Yang J. Wu S. Gong W. Chen C. Perrett S. Glutathionylation of the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone DnaK provides a link between oxidative stress and the heat shock response.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 6967-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting a change during the course of evolution in the function of the highly conserved N-terminal Cys residue. Glutathionylation of Cys574 and Cys603 in the SBDα causes fully reversible structural and functional changes in hHsp70 (21Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. et al.S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we found that glutathionylation of Cys residues in the NBD of hHsp70 (Cys17, Cys267, and Cys306) causes a decrease in nucleotide-binding ability, ATPase activity, and substrate-binding ability (Figs. S1, S2 and Table S1). For Cys17 and Cys267, the effect of glutathionylation is partially reversible and accompanies aggregation of hHsp70, while for Cys306, the effect is slight and fully reversible without inducing aggregation (Figs. S1, S2 and Table S1). In WT hHsp70, glutathionylation of all five Cys residues causes partially reversible changes (Figs. S1, S2 and Table S1). Similar to hHsp70, glutathionylation of Cys17 and Cys267 caused partially reversible aggregation of hHsc70, and glutathionylation of Cys574 and Cys603 caused reversible structural changes in hHsc70 (Fig. S3). It is interesting to note that glutathionylation at Cys267 caused irreversible aggregation of hHsc70, whereas glutathionylation of all four Cys residues did not cause aggregation of hHsc70 (Fig. S3). Consistent with this, PTMs of Hsp70 have been assumed to play roles in the oligomerization of Hsp70 proteins (30Takakuwa J.E. Nitika Knighton L.E. Truman A.W. Oligomerization of Hsp70: current perspectives on regulation and function.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2019; 6: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PTMs including glutathionylation often alter the structure of Hsp70, possibly resulting in exposure of some hydrophobic sites and further oligomerization. Even without PTMs such as glutathionylation, Hsp70 has a tendency to form oligomers and large aggregates. We found that DTNB assays could not be applied to the large aggregates of hHsp70 and hHsc70 as this interfered with absorbance measurements, whereas the smaller oligomeric and monomeric forms obtained in the last SEC purification step of hHsp70 or hHsc70 showed similar levels of activity in DTNB assays. The cysteine reactivity of hHsp70 is affected by nucleotide and influenced by the presence of the adjacent domains (21Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. et al.S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Yang J. Gong W. Wu S. Zhang H. Perrett S. PES inhibits human-inducible Hsp70 by covalent targeting of cysteine residues in the substrate-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 296100210Google Scholar), so we focused here on the comparison between hHsp70 and hHsc70. We noticed that ADP and ATP have different effects on the cysteine reactivity of hHsc70, while ADP and ATP have the same effect on cysteine reactivity of hHsp70 as detected by Ellman assays (Figs. 1C and 3A). In DTNB assays, the presence of ADP and ATP had no effect on the cysteine reactivity of hHsc70-C17 and decreased the cysteine reactivity of hHsc70-C17/C267 and hHsc70-C267 (Fig. 3, B and C). For hHsc70-C574/C603, hHsc70-C574, and hHsc70-C603, ADP had no effect on the cysteine reactivity and ATP increased the cysteine reactivity (Fig. 3, B and D). When we checked glutathionylation by Western blot and AF 350 dye, we found that in the absence of nucleotide, all of the Cys residues in WT hHsc70 underwent glutathionylation, while in the presence of ADP, only a proportion of Cys residues underwent glutathionylation (Fig. 3E). When we checked glutathionylation by SEC, we found the presence of ADP inhibited the conformational changes and glutathionylation of hHsc70-C267 but not WT hHsc70, hHsc70-C574, and hHsc70-C603 (Fig. S3). Thus, ADP inhibited the cysteine reactivity and glutathionylation of the Cys residues in the NBD but not the SBD of hHsc70, similar to hHsp70. ATP also inhibited cysteine reactivity in the NBD of hHsc70 but promoted cysteine reactivity in the SBD of hHsc70. We constructed a chimera composed of the SBDα of hHsc70 and the NBD and SBDβ of hHsp70, termed hHsp70-hHsc70(α). We found that ADP and ATP also have different effects on cysteine reactivity of hHsp70-hHsc70(α), similar to hHsc70 (Fig. 3A). Hsp70 has two major conformations and the interaction between the SBDα and SBDβ is stronger in the ADP-bound state than in the ATP-bound state (9Kityk R. Kopp J. Sinning I. Mayer M.P.

An interdomain energetic tug-of-war creates the allosterically active state in Hsp70 molecular chaperones.Cell. 2012; 151: 1296-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction between the SBDα and SBDβ has a more obvious inhibition effect on cysteine reactivity of the hHsc70 SBDα than on the hHsp70 SBDα, and the interaction between the SBDα of hHsc70 and the SBDβ from either hHsc70 or hHsp70 can inhibit cysteine reactivity of the hHsc70 SBDα. To further study the effect of domain interaction on cysteine reactivity of hHsp70 and hHsc70, we measured and compared the cysteine reactivity of the SBDα in different constructs containing the SBDα from hHsp70 or hHsc70. SBDα(524-616) consisting of α-helix B, C, and D, and including Cys574 and Cys603, is the major part of the SBDα. For hHsp70, we found that SBDα(524-641) shows similar cysteine reactivity to SBDα(524-616), and adding the SBDβ from hHsp70 or hHsc70 slowed down the reaction rate in the DTNB assay (Fig. 4A). If the NBD from hHsp70 or hHsc70 was further added, and in the presence of ADP, the cysteine reactivity of the NBD was inhibited, and the observed level of cysteine reactivity was similar to the isolated SBD (Fig. 4A). For hHsc70, SBDα(524-641) had a slower reaction rate towards DTNB than SBDα(524-616), and adding the SBDβ from hHsc70 had a stronger inhibition effect on the cysteine reactivity, compared with adding the SBDβ from hHsp70 (Fig. 4B). Similar to the situation for hHsp70, adding the NBD from hHsc70 or hHsp70 did not have any significant effect on cysteine reactivity (Fig. 4B). In summary, it was found that adding adjacent domains to SBDα(524-616) weakened the cysteine reactivity of the SBDα in both hHsp70 and hHsc70, and the inhibition effect from adjacent domains was much more obvious in hHsc70 than in hHsp70 (Fig. 4, A–C). These results are consistent with the different effects of ADP and ATP on the cysteine reactivity of the SBDα from hHsp70 and hHsc70. Therefore, domain interaction has a more significant effect on the cysteine reactivity of the SBDα from hHsc70 than from hHsp70. We noticed that besides the stronger inhibition effect from domain interactions, cysteine reactivity of hHsc70 SBDα(524-616) was still obviously lower than that of hHsp70 SBDα(524-616) (Fig. 4D). We then compared the cysteine reactivity of hHsp70 and hHsc70 SBDα(524-616) mutants containing only Cys574 or Cys603 and found cysteine reactivity of Cys603 was almost the same in the SBDα(524-616) of hHsp70 and hHsc70, while the cysteine reactivity of Cys574 in the SBDα(524-616) was lower for hHsc70 than for hHsp70 (Fig. 4D). Therefore, the different cysteine reactivity of hHsc70 SBDα and hHsp70 SBDα seems to come from different cysteine reactivity of Cys574, but not Cys603. In hHsp70, Cys603 is more reactive than Cys574, and Cys574 has a greater contribution to structural stability of SBDα (21Yang J. Zhang H. Gong W. Liu Z. Wu H. Hu W. et al.S-Glutathionylation of human inducible Hsp70 reveals a regulatory mechanism involving the C-terminal α-helical lid.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 8302-8324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we found this is also the case for hHsc70. To further explore the mechanisms for the different cysteine reactivity of the SBDα of hHsp70 and hHsc70, we measured NMR steady-state dynamics of SBDα(524-616) from hHsp70 and hHsc70, including HN-NOE, R1, and R2 (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W4309370228,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a major role in developmental processes and metabolism. The dysregulation of FGFR1 through genetic aberrations leads to skeletal and metabolic diseases as well as cancer. For this reason, FGFR1 is a promising therapeutic target, yet a very challenging one due to potential on-target toxicity. More puzzling is that both agonistic and antagonistic FGFR1 antibodies are reported to exhibit similar toxicity profiles in vivo, namely weight loss. In this study, we aimed to assess and compare the mechanism of action of these molecules to better understand this apparent contradiction. By systematically comparing the binding of these antibodies and the activation or the inhibition of the major FGFR1 signaling events, we demonstrated that the molecules displayed similar properties and can behave either as an agonist or antagonist depending on the presence or the absence of the endogenous ligand. We further demonstrated that these findings translated in xenografts mice models. In addition, using time-resolved FRET and mass spectrometry analysis, we showed a functionally distinct FGFR1 active conformation in the presence of an antibody that preferentially activates the FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2)-dependent signaling pathway, demonstrating that modulating the geometry of a FGFR1 dimer can effectively change the signaling outputs and ultimately the activity of the molecule in preclinical studies. Altogether, our results highlighted how bivalent antibodies can exhibit both agonistic and antagonistic activities and have implications for targeting other receptor tyrosine kinases with antibodies."

Nevertheless, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) is the only known carrier of vitamin A in plasma. Here, we present new findings that further characterize the visual cycle in the presence of Rbp4 deficiency. In the face of impaired delivery of retinol in Rbp4−/− mice, we determined that 11-cis-retinaldehyde reached levels that were ∼60% of WT at 4 months of age and all-trans-retinyl ester was 18% of normal yet photoreceptor cell loss was apparent by 8 months of age. The lack of Rbp4 appeared to have a greater impact on scotopic rod–mediated responses than on cone function at early ages. Also, despite severely impaired delivery of retinol, bisretinoid lipofuscin that forms as a byproduct of the visual cycle was measurable by HPLC and by quantitative fundus autofluorescence. In mice carrying an Rpe65 amino acid variant that slows visual cycle kinetics, Rbp4 deficiency had a less pronounced effect on 11-cis-retinal levels. Finally, we found that ocular retinoids were not altered in mice expressing elevated adipose-derived total Rbp4 protein (hRBP4+/+AdiCre+/−).

In conclusion, our findings are consistent with a model in which vitamin A can be delivered to the retina by Rbp4-independent pathways. The 11-cis form of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is the light sensitive chromophore of rods and cones. The 11-cis-retinaldehyde chromophore is generated within a multi-step pathway located in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells. Vitamin A is acquired from the diet as all-trans-retinol (retinol) or all-trans-retinyl ester (retinyl ester) and is absorbed and stored primarily in the liver as retinyl ester (1Blaner W.S. Vitamin A signaling and homeostasis in obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders.Pharmacol. Ther. 2019; 197: 153-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is responsible for transporting retinol in plasma and to this end is secreted by liver and fat cells. Lesser amounts of RBP4 may be synthesized by RPE (2Ong D.E.

In the circulation, RBP4 is normally bound to transthyretin (TTR); this complex transports serum retinol in a 1:1 ratio (5Blaner W.S. Retinol-binding protein: The serum transport protein for vitamin A.Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).

Taken together, these measures provide some indication of the retinol levels available to retina. We have also taken note of developmental anomalies in Rbp4−/− mice and we examined an adipocyte tissue–specific human RBP4 knock-in mouse. The 11-cis isomer of vitamin A aldehyde is the chromophore of visual pigment capable of absorbing photons of light. Vitamin A is supplied to the visual cycle by RPE uptake from serum. Rbp4 is the only known transporter of vitamin A (retinol) in blood (5Blaner W.S. Retinol-binding protein: The serum transport protein for vitamin A.Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). At 4 months of age, both 11-cis-retinaldehyde and all-trans-retinyl ester were reduced in the Rbp4−/− versus Rbp4+/+ mice (agouti, Rpe65Leu, standard diet, light-adapted); the 11-cis isomer was reduced by 43% (p < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) while the ester was 82% lower than in Rbp4+/+ mice (p < 0.001, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 1A). When the visual cycle isomerase Rpe65 carries methionine at amino acid 450 instead of leucine, regeneration of 11-cis-retinal is reduced perhaps because of Rpe65 protein stability (24Wenzel A.

We found that in Rbp4−/− mice that were homozygous for the Rpe65-450Met variant, the difference in 11-cis-retinal levels (Rbp4−/− vs Rbp4+/+) was somewhat less pronounced (Fig. 1B). Specifically, the 11-cis isomer was reduced by 38% and the ester was 86% lower than in Rbp4+/+ mice (p < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test). Even when the mice were dark-adapted for 18 h to favor 11-cis-retinal regeneration, levels of the latter retinoid remained 40% lower in the Rbp4-deficient mice (Fig. 1E). In a second analysis of mice at 4 months of age (agouti, light-adapted, Rpe65-Leu450Met heterozygous, 15 IU/gm vitamin A), 11-cis retinaldehyde was decreased by 38% as well (p < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) in the Rbp4−/− mice and all-trans-retinyl ester was reduced by 88% (p < 0.001, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 1C). Serial retinoid levels were also compared in Rbp4−/− mice (agouti, Rpe65-450Met) versus C57BL/6J-Aw-J/J mice at ages 2, 5, and 8 months (Fig. 2). At age 2 months 11-cis-retinal was reduced by 77% (p < 0.01, unpaired two-tailed t test) in the Rbp4−/− mice but by 5 months of age, approached WT levels in C57BL/6J-Aw-J/J mice. The decline in 11-cis-retinal at age 8 months is likely attributable to photoreceptor cell degeneration observed by this age (presented below). All-trans-retinol was significantly lower in the Rbp4−/− mice at all of the ages studied and all-trans-retinyl ester was profoundly reduced.

Exp. 2015; : e52658PubMed Google Scholar) in Rbp4−/− mice, scotopic ERG analysis was conducted at age 1.5 and 10 months. As shown in Figure 3, in agouti C57BL/6J-Aw-J/J WT mice, the amplitude of the a-wave increased with increasing light stimulus from threshold until saturation at 1.0 log cd⋅s/m2. The amplitudes of the a- and b-waves at age 1.5 months were appreciably lower (p < 0.01, unpaired two-tailed t test) in the Rbp4−/− mice relative to the WT control mice (Fig. 3, B and C). Comparison of age 1.5 months versus 10 months old agouti Rbp4−/− (Rpe65-450Met) mice revealed an improvement in a-wave and b-wave amplitudes by age 10 months (p < 0.01 for a-wave, p < 0.05 for b-wave, unpaired two-tailed t test) (Fig. 3, D and E). For instance, at a stimulus intensity of 1.0 log cd⋅s/m2, the increase in b-wave robustness between age 1.5 and 10 months was 46% (p < 0.05, unpaired two-tailed t test) (Fig. 3E). The significantly lower rod-dominated a-wave and b-wave amplitudes were consistent with the reduction in 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 1). A comparison of scotopic versus photopic responses suggested that the effect of Rbp4 deficiency had a greater impact on rods than cones (Fig. 3, C and F). Specifically, at stimulus intensities of 1.0 and 2.0 log cd⋅s/m2, the Rbp4−/− mice presented with percent decreases in photopic b-wave amplitudes of 31% and 39%, while the scotopic b-wave amplitudes were 61% and 46% lower in the Rbp4−/− mice. To evaluate photoreceptor cell viability, we measured outer nuclear layer (ONL) thicknesses (Fig. 4, A and B). To acquire values for statistical analysis, we calculated ONL area as the sum of thickness measurements from 0.2 to 1.0 mm from optic nerve head (ONH) multiplied by the interval of 0.2 to 2.0 mm (Fig. 4, A and B). ONL area in agouti Rbp4−/− mice (Rpe65-450Met) was not reduced in thickness at 4 months of age but at 8 and 12 months of age, ONL was significantly thinner than controls (p < 0.01, unpaired two-tailed t test) (Fig. 4C). This finding is indicative of photoreceptor degeneration in the mutant mice. As a consequence of random nonenzymatic reactions of vitamin A aldehyde, bisretinoid fluorophores accumulate as the lipofuscin of retina (11Sparrow J.R. Gregory-Roberts E. Yamamoto K. Blonska A. Ghosh S.K. Ueda K. et al.The bisretinoids of retinal pigment epithelium.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2012; 31: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Fundus autofluorescence acquired with 488-nm excitation originates primarily in RPE bisretinoid lipofuscin. Using an established approach (23Sparrow J.R. Blonska A. Flynn E. Duncker T. Greenberg J.P. Secondi R. et al.Quantitative fundus autofluorescence in mice: Correlation with HPLC quantitation of RPE lipofuscin and measurement of retina outer nuclear layer thickness.Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we measured fundus AF levels noninvasively as quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF) in agouti Rbp4−/− (Rpe65-450Met) mice ages 4, 8, and 12 months (Fig. 5). The experiments revealed that SW-AF was recordable in the Rbp4−/− mouse; this finding is indicative of a functioning visual cycle. However, qAF was significantly lower in Rbp4−/− mice versus WT C57BL/6J-Aw-J/J mice at ages 4 and 8 months (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, there was a significant increase (17%) in qAF in Rbp4−/− mice from age 4 months to 8 months (p < 0.05, two-tailed t test) and qAF increased by 23.2% between 4 and 12 months of age (Fig. 5B). Near infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) intensities paralleled the lower qAF values observed in Rbp4−/− mice relative to the WT control (Fig. 5C). In eyes obtained from Rbp4−/− mice (Rpe65–450Met; agouti), we measured bisretinoids by integrating HPLC peak areas and normalizing to standard samples of known concentration. At 4 months of age, the bisretinoid A2E was reduced by 76% (p < 0.001, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) in Rbp4−/− relative to C57BL/6J-Aw-J/J WT control mice (Fig. 6A). At this age, the bisretinoid A2-DHP-PE levels were 4.2 pmoles/eye in the WT and nondetectable in the Rbp4−/− mouse (Fig. 6B). In Rbp4−/− mice at 8 months of age, A2E was reduced by 87% (p < 0.001, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) relative to WT control mice (Fig. 6A). Again, the bisretinoids A2-DHP-PE and A2GPE were not detected at 8 months of age in the Rbp4−/− mouse, while the WT levels were 5.7 pmoles/eye and 11.4 pmoles/eye, respectively (Fig. 6, B and C). While Rbp4 is predominantly produced by hepatocytes (28Thompson S.J. Sargsyan A. Lee S.A. Yuen J.J. Cai J. Smalling R. et al.Hepatocytes are the principal source of circulating RBP4 in mice.Diabetes. 2017; 66: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Rbp4 can also be synthesized by adipocytes (1Blaner W.S. Vitamin A signaling and homeostasis in obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders.Pharmacol. Ther. 2019; 197: 153-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, we also studied transgenic mice that express human RBP4 (hRBP4) specifically in adipocytes (hRBP4+/+AdiCre+/−) (29Lee S.A. Yuen J.J. Jiang H. Kahn B.B. Blaner W.S. Adipocyte-specific overexpression of retinol-binding protein 4 causes hepatic steatosis in mice.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When fed a standard chow diet, these mice exhibit an elevation in adipose-derived total Rbp4 protein (mRbp4+ hRBP4) without significant differences in plasma Rbp4 or retinoid levels (retinol, retinyl ester, and all-trans-retinoic acids) nor differences in hepatic or adipose retinoid (29Lee S.A. Yuen J.J. Jiang H. Kahn B.B. Blaner W.S. Adipocyte-specific overexpression of retinol-binding protein 4 causes hepatic steatosis in mice.Hepatology. 2016; 64: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since plasma RBP4 levels are known to be increased in hRBP4+/+AdiCre+/− mice fed a high fat diet, we also employed the latter diet providing 60% of calories as fat. Nevertheless, we did not observe elevations in ocular retinoids (11cisRAL, atROL, atRAL, and atRE) in hRBP4+/+AdiCre+/− as compared to control mice (hRBP4+/+AdiCre−/−, hRBP4+/−AdiCre+/−) in mice fed a high fat diet (p > 0.05, 2-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 1D). The Rbp4−/− mouse colony exhibited impaired breeding with an average of two or three surviving pups per litter as compared to 4 to 8 pups in control litters. About 40% of the mice had small lids openings, optic disc abnormalities and persistent hyaloid arteries often occurred (Fig. 7, A and B). On occasion, a hyaloid artery pulsing with blood was found by in vivo Doppler spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Histological analysis confirmed a hyaloid artery remnant extending from the optic disc to the back of the lens capsule (Fig. 7, C and D). In some cases, the ONH appeared abnormally concave and ectopic pigmentation was a feature. Multiple layers of hypopigmented retinal pigment cells were also observed in histological sections of the eyes (Fig. 7F). As noted earlier, a developmental deficiency in photoreceptor cell numbers was not detected at 4 months of age (Fig. 4, A and B) but photoreceptor cell loss was measured at age 8 months. The Rbp4−/− mouse is phenotypically normal except for the eye (6Vogel S. Piantedosi R. O'Byrne S.M. Kako Y. Quadro L. Gottesman M.E. et al.Retinol-binding protein-deficient mice: Biochemical basis for impaired vision.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15360-15368Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several years ago, investigators reported that mice deficient in retinol-binding protein (subsequently referred to as RBP4) presented with markedly reduced circulating retinol levels and impaired visual function measured as ERG b-wave amplitudes (9Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. et al.Impaired retinal function and vitamin A availability in mice lacking retinol-binding protein.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The latter recordings revealed that the response to maximal stimulus was half of normal at age 1 month. At that age, ocular retinol levels were approximately 30% of WT but retinal histology was normal. However, when supplied with a vitamin A sufficient diet, b-wave amplitudes in the mutant mice progressively increased and reached amplitudes equal to that of WT mice by approximately 3 months of age. The ocular phenotype of Rbp4−/− mice described by others (30Shen J. Shi D. Suzuki T. Xia Z. Zhang H. Araki K. et al.Severe ocular phenotypes in Rbp4-deficient mice in the C57BL/6 genetic background.Lab Invest. 2016; 96: 680-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has been similar although b-wave amplitudes in the Rbp4−/− mice remained at 50% of WT at age 10 months. Measurements of plasma retinol remained low in both studies while retinol levels in liver were higher in the Rbp4−/− mice. The latter increase is explained by the failure of retinol to be released into the circulation due to the absence of Rbp4. Here, we present new findings that further extend our understanding of vitamin A delivery to the retina. We observed that ocular 11-cis-retinal at age 4 months was reduced by 43% under conditions of Rbp4 deficiency; all-trans-retinyl ester, the storage form of retinoid in RPE, was 82% lower than WT. The lower levels of 11-cis-retinal in the mutant mice were accompanied by reduced rod-dominated a-wave and b-wave amplitudes at 1.5 and 10 months of age. Moreover, the effect on rod function appeared to be greater than the effect on photopic cone responses. This may be explained by the fact that while the classical visual cycle operates in the RPE to supply 11-cis-retinal to both rods and cones, an additional visual cycle exists in Müller glial cells for the purpose of delivering additional 11-cis chromophore to cones (31Hood D.C. Cho J. Raza A.S. Dale E.A. Wang M. Reliability of a computer-aided manual procedure for segmenting optical coherence tomography scans.Optom. Vis. Sci. 2011; 88: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since there was no evidence of photoreceptor cell degeneration at 4 months of age, the reduction in scotopic ERG amplitudes was attributable to reduced 11-cis-retinal rather than photoreceptor cell degeneration. Nevertheless, at ages 8 and 12 months, photoreceptor cell death was evidenced by ONL thinning and by a downturn in 11-cis-retinal. These findings are consistent with the progressive retinal degeneration observed in human subjects in association with homozygous splice site mutations in RBP4 (32Cukras C. Gaasterland T. Lee P. Gudiseva H.V. Chavali V.R. Pullakhandam R. et al.Exome analysis identified a novel mutation in the RBP4 gene in a consanguineous pedigree with retinal dystrophy and developmental abnormalities.PLoS One. 2012; 7e50205Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Seeliger M.W. Biesalski H.K. Wissinger B. Gollnick H. Gielen S. Frank J. et al.Phenotype in retinol deficiency due to a hereditary defect in retinol binding protein synthesis.Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar). In the setting of a polymorphism in the visual cycle isomerase Rpe65, replacement of leucine by methionine at amino acid 450 retards the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal probably by reducing Rpe65 protein stability (24Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. The Rpe65 Leu450Met variation increases retinal resistance against light-induced degeneration by slowing rhodopsin regeneration.J.

Retinyl esters are the substrate for isomerohydrolase.Biochem. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consequently, we have observed that 11-cis-retinal levels are appreciably lower (55%) in cyclic light-adapted albino mice expressing the Rpe65-450Met variant as opposed to leucine (26Kim H.J. Zhao J. Sparrow J.R. Vitamin A aldehyde-taurine adduct and the visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 24867-24875Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, in the Rbp4−/− mice, the difference in 11-cis-retinal levels between Rpe65-Leu450 mice versus Rpe65-450Met mice was only 8% due to the impairment caused by the Rbp4 deficiency. Since on the Rbp4−/− background, the visual cycle is not functioning at full capacity, the difference in 11-cis-retinal levels due to the variant was not realized. We observed a significant decrease in the bisretinoids A2E, A2GPE, and A2-DHP-PE in Rbp4−/− as compared to wild-type mice at both 4 and 8 months of age with quantitation by HPLC. An age-related increase from 4 to 8 months in the Rbp4−/− mice was not observed. The decrease is consistent with noninvasive SW-AF measurements performed in this study. The decrease in A2E, A2GPE, and A2-DHP-PE in the setting of Rbp4 absence is not surprising, since it is known that bisretinoid formation is modulated by changes in the kinetics of the visual cycle (17Radu R.A.

https://openalex.org/W4309370503,"Site-specific recombinase Int mediates integration of the bacteriophage λ genome into the Escherichia coli chromosome. Integration occurs once the Int tetramer, assisted by the integration host factor IHF, forms the intasome, a higher order structure, within which Int, a heterobivalent protein, interacts with two nonhomologous DNA sequences: the core recombination sites and the accessory arm sites. The binding to these sites is mediated by the catalytic C-terminal domain (CTD) and the regulatory N-terminal domain (NTD) of Int, respectively. Within Int, the NTD can activate or inhibit the recombination activity of the CTD depending on whether the NTD is bound to the arm sites. The CTD alone cannot mediate recombination, and even when the NTD and the CTD are mixed together as individual polypeptides, the NTD cannot trigger recombination in the CTD. In this work, we set to determine what modifications can unlock the recombination activity in the CTD alone and how the CTD can be modified to respond to recombination-triggering signals from the NTD. For this, we performed a series of genetic analyses, which showed that a single mutation that stabilizes the CTD on DNA, E174K, allows the CTD to recombine the core DNA sequences. When the NTD is paired with the CTD (E174K) that also bears a short polypeptide from the C terminus of the NTD, the resulting binary Int can recombine arm-bearing substrates. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of the regulation of the Int activity and suggest how binary recombinases of the integrase type can be engineered.

Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of the regulation of the Int activity and suggest how binary recombinases of the integrase type can be engineered. Bacteriophage λ integrase, Int, is a founding member of the tyrosine family of site-specific DNA recombinases that houses such popular DNA recombinases as Cre and Flp as well as about 1000 other recombinases that share the chemistry of the DNA exchange reaction and the overall three-dimensional organization (1Grindley N.D. Whiteson K.L. Rice P.A. Mechanisms of site-specific recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 567-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The function of λ Int is to integrate the bacteriophage λ genome into and to excise it from the Escherichia coli chromosome (for recent review on λ Int see Landy, 2015 (2Landy A. The lambda integrase site-specific recombination pathway.Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 (MDNA3-0051-2014)Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). In contrast to simple members of the tyrosine family, such as Cre and Flp, which do not require any accessory proteins to perform recombination, both the integration and excision activities of Int depend on the host protein IHF (integration host factor), while the excision activity also depends on the phage encoded protein Xis. IHF and Xis are the DNA-bending proteins that bind within the phage genome region called attP (the phage attachment site) and bring closer two groups of sequences that have different functional role: the core recombination sites and the accessory arm sites (Fig. 1A). Two sets of the arm sites (P and P′) are located upstream and downstream from the core sites and are separated from them by ∼100 bp and ∼50 bp, respectively. Once DNA within attP is properly folded, a tetramer of Int, a bivalent protein, can bind both the arm sites and the core sites forming a higher order, recombination-competent structure called the intasome (Fig. 1B). Functional analysis of the polypeptides that were obtained by limited proteolytic digestion of Int demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of Int (NTD, residues 1–64, Fig. 1C) mediates binding to the arm sites of attP while the C-terminal domain of Int (CTD, residues 65–356, Fig. 1C) mediates binding to the core sites of attP (3Moitoso de Vargas L. Pargellis C.A. Hasan N.M. Bushman E.W. Landy A. Autonomous DNA binding domains of lambda integrase recognize two different sequence families.Cell. 1988; 54: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The CTD is responsible for the recombination activity of Int but this domain can recombine the core sites only when it is the integral part of Int, that is, covalently connected to the NTD. When expressed as an individual protein, the CTD can bind to the core sites, cleave them, and resolve premade Holliday junction recombination intermediates that contain the core sites but cannot perform the actual recombination reaction (4Sarkar D. Radman-Livaja M. Landy A. The small DNA binding domain of lambda integrase is a context-sensitive modulator of recombinase functions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Sarkar D. Azaro M.A. Aihara H. Papagiannis C.V. Tirumalai R. Nunes-Duby S.E. et al.Differential affinity and cooperativity functions of the amino-terminal 70 residues of lambda integrase.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Within Int, the NTD inhibits all activities of the CTD unless the NTD is bound to the arm sites. The binding to the arm sites changes the regulatory mode of the NTD so it can then stimulate the activity of the CTD. Remarkably, when the NTD and the CTD are combined as individual proteins in vitro, the NTD is able to stimulate the DNA binding and cleavage activities of the CTD even if the NTD is not bound to the arm sites (4Sarkar D. Radman-Livaja M. Landy A. The small DNA binding domain of lambda integrase is a context-sensitive modulator of recombinase functions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cumulative data on the activities of the NTDs and CTDs of Int and their functional interactions suggest that the ability of the CTD to recombine the core sites are weakened to allow the NTD to regulate this activity of CTD once the NTD binds to the arm sites (2Landy A. The lambda integrase site-specific recombination pathway.Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 (MDNA3-0051-2014)Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such dependency on the NTD binding restricts the recombination activity of Int to the settings that support the formation of the intasome. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the regulatory interactions between the NTDs and CTDs is important not only for understanding the molecular mechanism of the functional regulation of Int but also for designing recombination enzymes, activity of which can be similarly controlled. Deciphering the molecular basis of the interactions between the NTD and CTD depends on how the functional boundaries of these domains are defined and whether they overlap. The original definition of the domains—NTD(1–64) and CTD(65–356)—was later adjusted since it was shown that for the NTD to be fully functional (that is, to be able to bind to the arm sites cooperatively), the NTD(1–64) needs six additional residues to become NTD(1–70) (5Sarkar D. Azaro M.A. Aihara H. Papagiannis C.V. Tirumalai R. Nunes-Duby S.E. et al.Differential affinity and cooperativity functions of the amino-terminal 70 residues of lambda integrase.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the length of the CTD(65–356) can be reduced by 10 amino acid residues and the resulting CTD(75–356) polypeptide essentially as active in the binding and cleavage activities as the CTD(65–356) (5Sarkar D. Azaro M.A. Aihara H. Papagiannis C.V. Tirumalai R. Nunes-Duby S.E. et al.Differential affinity and cooperativity functions of the amino-terminal 70 residues of lambda integrase.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, the CTD(75–356) was capable of cocrystallizing with the cleaved DNA substrate (6Aihara H. Kwon H.J. Nunes-Duby S.E. Landy A. Ellenberger T. A conformational switch controls the DNA cleavage activity of lambda integrase.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Int complexed with both the core and the arm sites showed that the NTD and the CTD do not apparently interact directly if the C-terminal of the NTD is considered to end at the residue 70 and the N terminus of the CTD to start at the residue 75 (7Biswas T. Aihara H. Radman-Livaja M. Filman D. Landy A. Ellenberger T. A structural basis for allosteric control of DNA recombination by lambda integrase.Nature. 2005; 435: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was suggested that different domain interfaces might form at different reaction steps (8Warren D. Lee S.Y. Landy A. Mutations in the amino-terminal domain of lambda-integrase have differential effects on integrative and excisive recombination.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the interaction snapshots trapped in the crystal structures may not represent all functional interactions especially because the Int/DNA cocrystal was formed by the arm sites with unexpected dyad symmetry of the arm sites. It is also possible that not all identified interactions are functional since the NTD(1–62) is able to interact with the CTD(75–356) (8Warren D. Lee S.Y. Landy A. Mutations in the amino-terminal domain of lambda-integrase have differential effects on integrative and excisive recombination.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but the molecular basis for these interactions cannot be easily inferred from the Int/DNA cocrystal (7Biswas T. Aihara H. Radman-Livaja M. Filman D. Landy A. Ellenberger T. A structural basis for allosteric control of DNA recombination by lambda integrase.Nature. 2005; 435: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To get insight into the molecular basis of the functional interactions between the NTD and CTD, we wanted to analyze what modifications can trigger the recombination reaction when the two domains communicate. These interactions can be probed by modifying the domains and testing how these modifications affect the efficiency of the recombination reaction. In principle, interactions between the NTDs and CTDs can be tested either when these domains are covalently connected (that is, when they are the integral part of the Int molecule) or when they are combined as separately expressed polypeptides. The latter approach has an obvious advantage since the CTD is recombinationally inactive and therefore if the modification of the domains can trigger even a subtle recombination activity, it can be detected, especially using the in vivo approaches. In this work we asked two main questions (1Grindley N.D. Whiteson K.L. Rice P.A. Mechanisms of site-specific recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 567-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar): what modifications can unlock the recombination activity in the CTD in the absence of the NTD and (2Landy A. The lambda integrase site-specific recombination pathway.Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 (MDNA3-0051-2014)Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) how the CTD can be modified to efficiently respond to recombination triggering signals from the NTD. To answer these questions, we performed a series of genetic analyses that utilized the reporter vectors with different recombination substrate pairs and the vectors that expressed variants of the NTD and the CTD. We found that a single modification that stabilizes the CTD on DNA is sufficient to allow this domain to recombine the core DNA sequences: the int-h mutation, E174K (9Miller H.I.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12724-12732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that when the NTD is paired with the CTD that has the int-h mutation and a short polypeptide from the C terminus of the NTD, the resulting binary Int can recombine several arm site–bearing substrates. The functional performance of binary Int provides insights into the molecular basis of the regulation of the λ integrase activity and suggests how binary recombinases of the integrase type can be engineered. Since the CTD of Int is not capable of performing recombination (4Sarkar D. Radman-Livaja M. Landy A. The small DNA binding domain of lambda integrase is a context-sensitive modulator of recombinase functions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the experiments to determine what modifications are needed to trigger its recombination activity are likely to yield the CTD variants with only marginal activity. Consequently, these variants will be difficult to detect using the in vitro assays and thus the in vivo approaches, which can identify variants with quite low recombination activity, are preferred. To this end, we utilized the bacterial ‘positive’ recombination screening system, which is capable of detecting recombinase variants even if their activity is less than 0.01% of that of the WT recombinase (12Bolusani S. Ma C.H. Paek A. Konieczka J.H. Jayaram M. Voziyanov Y. Evolution of variants of yeast site-specific recombinase Flp that utilize native genomic sequences as recombination target sites.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The positive screening system is composed of the reporter and expression vectors that can coexist in E. coli. The positive reporter vector contains the lacZα expression cassette, which is interrupted by the transcription STOP cassette that is flanked by a recombination substrate pair in the direct orientation (Fig. 2A). Excision of the STOP cassette by the recombination capable variants leads to the expression of the lacZα gene, which is signaled by the appearance of the blue colonies when bacteria are spread on the plates containing chromogenic substrate X-gal (12Bolusani S. Ma C.H. Paek A. Konieczka J.H. Jayaram M. Voziyanov Y. Evolution of variants of yeast site-specific recombinase Flp that utilize native genomic sequences as recombination target sites.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The functionality of the positive reporter system was tested using the attP/attB substrate pair and the following recombinases and domains: Int and Int(E174K) and the CTD variants, CTD(65–356) and CTD(75–356) or C65 and C75 for short. As expected, in the experiments with Int and Int(E174K), which is known to be more active than Int (9Miller H.I. Mozola M.A. Friedman D.I. int-h: an int mutation of phage lambda that enhances site-specific recombination.Cell. 1980; 20: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), essentially all bacterial colonies were blue, while in the experiments with both C65 and C75, no blue colonies were observed (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The deletion of the STOP cassette from the reporter in the blue colonies and the absence of this deletion in the white colonies was confirmed by the PCR analysis (Fig. 2C) and sequencing of the respective diagnostic PCR bands.Table 1Recombination activity of Int and some of its variantsRecombinaseSubstrate (positive reporter)attP/attBCOC’/COC’P-COC’/COC’COC’-P’/COC’Int<99%∼20%∼25%<99%Int(E174K)<99%<95%<95%<99%Int(E174K, E218K)<99%<95%∼100%∼100%C650%0%ntntC65(E174K)0%∼0.2%ntntC65(E174K, E218K)0%∼3%ntntC570%0%ntntC57(E174K)0%∼0.1%ntntC57(E174K, E218K)0%∼0.1%ntnt[C65 + N64]0%0%ntnt[C65(E174K) + N64]0%∼0.2%ntnt[C65(E174K, E218K) + N64]0%∼5%ntnt[C57 + N64]0%0%ntnt[C57(E174K) + N64]∼2%∼0.1%∼0.1%∼10%[C57(E174K, E218K) + N64]∼8%∼0.1%∼0.2%∼25%Substrate (negative reporter)attP/attBCOC’/COC’P-COC’/COC’COC’-P’/COC’Int>99%0%∼0.1%∼99%Int(E174K)∼97%∼50%∼50%∼95%Int(E174K, E218K)∼95%∼90%∼70%∼95%[C57(E174K) + N64]∼40%0%0%∼3%[C57(E174K, E218K) + N64]∼70%0%0%∼10%nt, not tested. Open table in a new tab nt, not tested. Next, we tested whether a mutation that can potentially stabilize the CTD on DNA could help trigger the recombination activity of the CTD. For this, we first tried the int-h mutation, E174K, which was shown to relax the requirement for the integration host factor (IHF) during recombination and to increase the binding affinity of Int (9Miller H.I. Mozola M.A. Friedman D.I. int-h: an int mutation of phage lambda that enhances site-specific recombination.Cell. 1980; 20: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Patsey R.L. Bruist M.F. Characterization of the interaction between the lambda intasome and attB.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Lange-Gustafson B.J. Nash H.A. Purification and properties of int-h, a variant protein involved in site-specific recombination of bacteriophage lambda.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12724-12732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus added the int-h mutation to C65 and C75 and tested these modified CTD variants, C65(E174K) and C75(E174K), respectively, using the positive reporter vector that contained the attP/attB substrate pair. We found that the int-h mutation was not sufficient to allow C65 and C75 to recombine this vector (data not shown and Table 1). We also noted that the addition of the NTD of Int, N64 (4Sarkar D. Radman-Livaja M. Landy A. The small DNA binding domain of lambda integrase is a context-sensitive modulator of recombinase functions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), did not apparently stimulate the recombination activity of either the original or the modified CTD variants on the attP/attB substrate pair (data not shown and Table 1). To increase the likelihood of the recombination reaction by C65(E174K) and C75(E174K), we tested them on the armless COC’/COC’ substrate pair since COC’ is known to be a better substrate for Int than attB and since the CTD variants cannot bind the arm sites of attP so the arm-bearing substrates offer no advantage over the armless ones. We therefore tested C65 and C75, C65(E174K) and C75(E174K), as well as the control recombinases Int and Int(E174K) using the positive reporter vector, in which the STOP cassette is flanked by the COC’/COC’ substrate pair. In these experiments, the ‘control’ recombinases behaved as expected, Figure 2D and Table 1, the activity of Int on the armless COC’/COC’ substrate pair was significantly lower than that on the attP/attB substrate pair while the activity of Int(E174K) was dramatically higher than that of Int (9Miller H.I. Mozola M.A. Friedman D.I. int-h: an int mutation of phage lambda that enhances site-specific recombination.Cell. 1980; 20: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Patsey R.L. Bruist M.F. Characterization of the interaction between the lambda intasome and attB.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, both C65 and C75 remained recombinationally inactive (data not shown and Table 1). To our delight, C65(E174K) was able to recombine COC’/COC’ with low but detectable activity: about 0.2% of the colonies were blue (Fig. 2D and Table 1). On the other hand, under the same conditions C75(E174K) remained recombinationally inactive. We also found that the expression of N64 in addition to C65(E174K) and C75(E174K) did not noticeably affect their activity (Fig. 2D). The results of the PCR analysis of the plasmid DNA isolated from the blue colonies, which were obtained in the COC’/COC’ deletion experiments, were unexpected (Fig. 2E). In contrast to just one band that corresponds to the deletion product that was obtained in the experiments with Int and the attP/attB substrate pair (Fig. 2C), we observed several PCR bands when we analyzed the majority of the blue colonies in the experiments with the COC’/COC’ substrate pair: the bands that correspond to the deletion product and the original vector but also several other bands (Fig. 2E). The only exception was noted in the experiments with Int(E174K): the multiband PCR product was seen in about 20% of the blue colonies that we analyzed (Fig. 2E). We were not able to determine the identity of these extra PCR bands because the high quality sequencing data could not be obtained from these bands and re-PCR of the individual bands did not result in a single band (data not shown). To determine the nature of the recombination product(s) in the experiments with the COC’/COC’ substrate pair, we performed diagnostic digestion of the reporter vectors that were isolated from the blue colonies, which were obtained in the experiments with Int and which generated the unexpected PCR products (Fig. 3). The analysis of the digestion patterns suggests that the main recombination product in these experiments is a dimer of two reporter molecules: one molecule that lacks the reporter cassette (that is, the plasmid with the expected deletion of the STOP cassette) and the other molecule that contains two copies of the STOP cassette. One of the simplest explanations of how two copies of the STOP cassette have appeared in the second reporter molecule is to assume that the deleted STOP cassette integrated into one of the COC’ sites, which flank the original reporter cassette (Fig. 3, D and E). Because we observed unexpected recombination products in the experiments with the positive reporter and the armless substrate, in the subsequent experiments, we analyzed how the vector design and the recombinase activity can influence the potential of fusion between the reporter vector molecules and the reintegration of the deleted reporter cassette. In addition to the E174K mutation, we tested if the E218K mutation, which was suggested to increase the activity of Int and possibly its affinity for the core sites (13Wu Z. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Genetic analysis of second-site revertants of bacteriophage lambda integrase mutants.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), can stimulate the recombination activity in C65 or C75. We found that in contrast to E174K, E218K was not able to stimulate the recombination activity of either of the CTD variants on the COC’/COC’ substrate pair (data not shown). On the other hand, we found that the doubly mutated variant C65(E174K, E218K) was noticeably more active than C65(E174K): about 3% of the colonies were blue, Figure 2D. Still, C75(E174K, E218K) remained inactive (data not shown). Overall, these results and the results shown later are more consistent with the role of the E218K mutation as a general enhancer of the recombination reaction rather than a mutation that can enhance affinity of Int for the core sites. In conclusion, the aforementioned experiments demonstrated that the recombination activity of the CTD of Int can be indeed activated. These experiments also demonstrated that although C75 is a minimal CTD that can bind and cleave DNA and resolve premade Holliday structure intermediates (5Sarkar D. Azaro M.A. Aihara H. Papagiannis C.V. Tirumalai R. Nunes-Duby S.E. et al.Differential affinity and cooperativity functions of the amino-terminal 70 residues of lambda integrase.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), its recombination activity cannot be activated as easily as in C65, which has longer N terminus. Since the NTD of Int was not able to enhance the recombination activity of C65(E174K) on the attP/attB substrate pair, we tested if the variants of the CTD that are extended toward the NTD could respond to the stimulation by the NTD. The rationale for these experiments is based on the analysis of the Int/DNA cocrystal (7Biswas T. Aihara H. Radman-Livaja M. Filman D. Landy A. Ellenberger T. A structural basis for allosteric control of DNA recombination by lambda integrase.Nature. 2005; 435: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) which shows that the polypeptide at the C terminus of the NTD that is located between residues 57 and 64 (Fig. 1C) makes intramonomer and intermonomer contacts with various polypeptides of the NTD, including itself. These interactions seem strategic as their profile differs depending on whether the Int monomers that form a recombination competent tetramer are in the recombination active or recombination inactive configuration. In principle, if the polypeptide 57 to 64 is added to C65, this extended CTD variant might be able to interact with at least some of the NTD polypeptides that are normally contacted by the polypeptide 57 to 64 during Int tetramer assembly. These interactions could help the extended CTD variant to functionally communicate with the NTD and stabilize the tertiary structure of the two-domain complex which, in turn, might trigger the recombination activity of the CTD on the substrates that contain the arm sites. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two sets of the CTD variants, with full or partial 57 to 64 polypeptide and with or without the int-h mutation: C57, C58, and C60 and C57(E174K), C58(E174K), and C60(E174K). C57 (as well as C58 and C60, data not shown) was not able to recombine the attP/attB substrate pair and its recombination activity was not stimulated by the addition of the NTD (Fig. 4A). C57(E174K), as well as C58(E174K) and C60(E174K), data not shown, was also incapable of recombining attP/attB, Figure 4A. However, the recombination was indeed triggered when these CTD variants were supplemented with the NTD: the ratio of the recombination positive blue colonies was about the same for C60(E174K), C58(E174K), and C57(E174K), ∼ 1% to 3% (Fig. 4A and data not shown). When paired with N64, C57(E174K, E218K) was about four times more active than C57(E174K): 7% to 9%, Figure 4A. The deletion recombination in the blue colonies was confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the diagnostic PCR bands, Figure 4B. We next tested whether the recombination activity of the CTD can be further stimulated if, in addition to the 57 to 64 polypeptide, a partial or full alpha helix of the NTD (residues 56 through 41, Fig. 1C) is added to the CTD. For this, we created several CTD(E174K) variants that start at positions 56, 55, 53, 50, 47, 45, and 41, complemented them with N64, and tested the resulting modified Int domain combinations on the attP/attB substrate pair (Fig. 4C). The results showed that C56(E174K) was about as active as C57(E174K) and C58(E174K) while the other variants quickly lost the ability to get activated by the N64, whereas C50(E174K), C47(E174K), C45(E174K), and C41(E174K) appeared recombinationally inactive (Fig. 4C and data not shown). We then analyzed whether the length of the C terminus of N64 affects its ability to stimulate the recombination activity of the extended CTD variant. To this end, we generated several shorter and longer variants of N64 that either lacked the 57 to 64 polypeptide completely (N56) or retained partial polypeptide 57 to 64 (N57, N58, and N60) or in which the 57 to 64 polypeptide was extended toward the CTD (N70 and N74). These NTD variants were paired with C57(E174K) and tested for their ability to recombine the attP/attB substrate pair (Fig. 4D). These experiments showed that N56, which completely lacks the 57 to 64 polypeptide, and the variants with the truncated 57 to 64 polypeptide (N57 and N58) were not able to stimulate the recombination activity of C57(E174K). The NTD variant N60, which also has the truncated 57 to 64 polypeptide, was the only NTD variant that was able to trigger recombination in C57(E174K) to some extent: ∼1%, Figure 4D. On the other hand, the variants with the longer C-terminal polypeptide of the NTD, N70 and N74, lost the ability to stimulate the recombination activity of C57(E174K), data not shown. Our results indicate that the recombination activity of the CTD variant C57(E174K), as well as several others, can be stimulated by the NTD variant N64 when the attP/attB substrate pair, which contains the arm sites, is used, but not the armless COC’/COC’ substrate pair. Since both P and P′ arms of attP contain the N64-binding sequences, both arms, in principle, can partake in stimulating the recombination activity of the CTD when it is pair"

In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to explore the trends of PA among breast cancer survivors over three years and identify factors associated with low PA. Interviews on 133 breast cancer patients were conducted at baseline, one and three years after the diagnosis of breast cancer at University Malaya Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur. Physical activity was measured by using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. PA was categorised as active (≥ 600 MET-min/week) and inactive (&lt;600 MET-min/week). We used the generalised estimating equation method to examine PA levels and factors affecting PA longitudinally. The survivors’ mean age was 56.89 (±10.56) years; half were Chinese (50.4%), and 70.7% were married. At baseline, 48.1% of the patients were active, but the proportion of active patients declined to 39.8% at one year and 35.3% in the third year. The mean total PA decreased significantly from 3503±6838.3 MET-min/week to 1494.0±2679.8 MET-min/week (one year) and 792.5±1364 MET-min/week (three years) (p&lt;0.001). Three years after diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.74, p = 0.021); Malay ethnicity (AOR: 1.86, p = 0.042) and being underweight (AOR: 3.43, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with inactivity. We demonstrated that breast cancer survivors in Malaysia had inadequate PA levels at diagnosis, which decreased over time. Thus, it is vital to communicate about the benefits of PA on cancer outcomes and continue to encourage breast cancer survivors to be physically active throughout the extended survivorship period, especially in the Malay ethnic group and underweight patients."

This study investigated the prospective associations between cardiovascular disease risk factors and non-traumatic spinal pain occurrences in children, and examined the moderating role of sex and health-related physical activity in these relationships. Methods We used prospective data from the Childhood Health, Activity, and Motor Performance School Study Denmark (CHAMPS Study-DK). The exposure variables were a clustered cardiovascular risk score and homeostasis assessment model-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score collected in 2008 and 2010. The spinal pain outcome comprised the number of weeks of non-traumatic spinal pain from 2008–2010 and 2010–2012. Potential confounders included age, sex, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. We constructed age-adjusted mixed negative binominal regression models to investigate the prospective associations of cardiovascular disease risk factors and non-traumatic spinal pain, while considering the potential moderating roles of sex and physical activity in these relationships. Results Girls with low HOMA-IR scores and boys with low clustered cardiovascular disease risk scores, who engaged in higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, reported more weeks of spinal pain, compared to girls with high HOMA-IR scores ( p = 0.001) and boys with high clustered cardiovascular disease risk scores ( p = 0.024). whereas boys with higher clustered cardiovascular disease risk who had less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reported more weeks of spinal pain than boys with low clustered cardiovascular disease risk score ( p = 0.024). Conclusion Our results show that cardiovascular disease risk factors are related to future occurrences of non-traumatic spinal pain. However, these relationships appear complex and dependent on the nature of the interactions with sex and physical activity."

While there have been many studies on the pathogenesis of PDR, its intrinsic molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In recent years, several studies have employed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cellular components associated with PDR. This study adds to this expanding body of work by identifying PDR's target genes and cellular components by conducting an integrated transcriptome bioinformatics analysis. This study integrately examined two public bulk RNA-seq datasets(including 11 PDR patients and 7 controls) and one single-cell RNA-seq datasets(including 5 PDR patients) of Fibro (Vascular) Membranes (FVMs) from PDR patients and control. A total of 176 genes were identified as DEGs between PDR patients and control among both bulk RNA-seq datasets. Based on these DEGs, 14 proteins were identified in the protein overlap within the significant ligand-receptor interactions of retinal FVMs and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, three of which were associated with PDR (CD44, ICAM1, POSTN), and POSTN might act as key ligand.

This study aimed to demonstrate the underlying effects of papain on MPA formation-initiated miRNA-146a expression and subsequent action in monocytes.THP-1 cells were exposed to papain, miRNA-146a mimic and inhibitor, NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082), and platelets. Flow cytometry was used to measure the MPA formation-initiated monocyte activation. Levels of miRNA-146a, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were analyzed in monocytes by RT-PCR, western blot, and ELISA.The NF-κB inhibitor and miRNA-146a mimics upregulated miRNA-146a expression but suppressed subsequent monocyte activation and expression of COX-2 and MCP-1. Following exposure to papain, the enhanced miRNA-146a transcription induced by MPA-formation was found along with significant inhibition of monocyte activation in a dose-dependent manner. However, the inhibitory tendency was significantly reversed by miRNA-146a inhibitors. Expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, as well as MCP-1, was inhibited in monocytes by papain, whereas miRNA-146a inhibitors promoted COX-2 and MCP-1 expression.Our findings suggest that papain can inhibit MPA formation-mediated expression of inflammatory mediators in activated monocytes by upregulating miRNA-146a transcription."

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of blood cells has been instrumental in diagnosis as co-criteria, but the data regarding platelets remains lacking. This study aims to determine if there is a difference in surface antigen levels on platelets by comparing surface antigen levels in MDS patients and healthy control subjects. Concurrently, as flow cytometric gating can reveal the diameter of cells, this study will investigate differences in giant platelet percentage by comparing these percentages in high- and low-risk MDS patients.Twenty newly diagnosed MDS patients were enrolled in this study. Platelet surface antigen levels were determined by measuring the binding capacity of antibodies with flow cytometry.Platelets of MDS patients were shown to have a lower level of CD61 and higher levels of CD31 and CD36 than healthy controls. Judged by forward scatter (FSC), MDS patients' platelets appeared to be larger than those of healthy control subjects, whereas the MFI adjusted by diameter (MFI/FSC ratio) of CD31, CD41a, CD42a, CD42b and CD61 on platelets were lower in MDS patients than in healthy control subjects. There was a significant quantity of giant platelets found in MDS patients, and the high-risk MDS patients tended to have a higher percentage of giant platelets than low-risk patients. Conclusions: All the results indicate that MDS patients exhibit a lower antigen presentation (MFI) adjusted by diameter on platelets than healthy controls and the giant platelets detected by flow cytometry might correlate with the condition of MDS."

Since 2015, the World Health Organisation recommends the use of an algorithm to assess recency of infections which is based on an HIV recency assay and viral load (VL) quantification. We determined the proportion of recent HIV infections among participants of the VIBRA (Village-Based Refill of Antiretroviral therapy) cluster-randomized trial in Lesotho and assessed risk factors for these recent infections. Methods The VIBRA trial recruited individuals living with HIV and not taking antiretroviral therapy during a door-to-door HIV testing campaign in two rural districts (Butha-Buthe and Mokhotlong). Samples were collected from participants newly diagnosed and tested for HIV recency using the Asanté HIV-1 Rapid Recency Assay and VL using the Roche Cobas System. Clinical and socio-demographic data were extracted from the trial database. Univariate analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with recent compared to long-term infection. Results Participants were recruited from August 2018 to May 2019 and 184 patient-samples included in this study. The majority were female (108 [59%]) with a median age of 36 years (interquartile range 30–50 years). We found 13 (7.0%) recent infections, while 171 (93.0%) were classified as long-term HIV infections. No conclusive evidence for risk factors of recent infection was found. Conclusions During door-to-door testing among a general population sample in rural Lesotho, 7% of those who were newly diagnosed had acquired HIV in the preceding 6 months. More efforts and research are needed to curb ongoing transmissions in these rural communities."

HF-based records and characteristics allowing for delivery of quality IPNC were reviewed first to establish the overall HF performance. The review findings were clarified by healthcare staff and managers through in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs).About 70.6% (12/17) of surveyed HFs had at least one NCU/NSU room dedicated for delivery of IPNC but none had a fully established NCUs/NSU, and 74.7% (3,600/4,819) of needy newborns were admitted/transferred in for management. Essential medicines such as tetracycline eye ointment were unavailable in 75% (3/4) of the district hospitals (DHs). A disparity existed between the availability and functioning of equipment including infant radiant warmers (92% vs 73%). Governance, support from implementing patterns (IPs), and access to healthcare commodities were identified from qualitative inquiries as factors influencing the establishment and running of NCUs/NSUs at the HFs in Mtwara region, Tanzania.Despite the positive progress, the establishment and performance of NCUs/NSUs in providing quality IPNC in HFs in Mtwara region is lagging behind the Tanzania neonatal care guideline requirements, particularly after the IPs of newborn health interventions completed their terms in 2016.

Participant experience of the dance class was explored by means of semi-structured interviews and gait changes were measured in a within-subjects design through the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test before and after class, with and without music. We chose the TUG test for its ecological validity, as it is a simple test that resembles movements done in class. We hypothesised that the music and the dance class would have a facilitating effect on the TUG performance. In line with existing research, we found that before class, the gait of 26 participants was significantly improved when accompanied by a soundtrack. However, after class, music did not have a significantly facilitating effect, yet gait without music significantly improved after class compared to before. We suggest that whilst the music acts as an external stimulator for movement before the dance class, after the dance class, participants have an internalised music or rhythm that supports their motor control. Thus, externally played music is of less relevance. The importance of music was further emphasised in the qualitative data alongside social themes. A better understanding of how music and dance affects Parkinson's symptoms and what aspects make individuals 'feel better' will help in the design of future interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4309494926,"Research on the relationship between wins and gambling behavior often focuses on winning considerably large amounts of money. It seems, however, that it is not the amount of the win, but the significance that the player assigns to the win, that exerts a decisive influence on gambling behavior. Therefore, in this study we adopted the concept of significant win: a win perceived by gamblers as important to them. The research aimed to discover what kind of wins are experienced as significant and what factors explain experiencing wins as significant. This study, conducted in Poland (N = 3,143) and France (N = 5,692), also had a comparative goal: discovering intercultural differences in experiencing significant wins. A computer-assisted web survey was administered to gamblers who engaged in pure-chance gambling, where the participant does not influence the outcome of the gamble after the initial bet is placed-selected from representative samples in both countries. We used logistic regression models to examine predictors of significant win experience in both countries and the differences between the countries. The results demonstrated that Polish gamblers more frequently considered a win significant when it was accompanied by strong, often negative emotions and was higher in monetary value normalized in terms of average monthly personal income, than French gamblers. French gamblers more frequently associated a significant win with a positive experience. The common predictors of a significant win experience in both countries were: being in debt, experiencing the win of a close person, gambling in a game of pure chance other than lotteries, more systematic pursuit of gambling, self-enhancement motivation, and coping motivation to gamble. Age at initiation into gambling was a significant predictor only in the French sample, whereas a financial motivation was a significant predictor in the Polish one. The results confirmed that the subjective perception of gambling wins is only partially related to the amounts of wins, which has practical implications for planning prevention strategies."

We aimed to determine whether BMD in well-suppressed HIV-infected men and women aged ≥ 50 years are different from HIV-uninfected controls. In a cross-sectional study, BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and calciotropic hormones were measured. A total of 481 participants were consecutively enrolled (209 HIV+ men, 88 HIV- men, 126 HIV+ women and 58 HIV- women). PWH were on average 2.5 years younger [men: 55.0 vs. 57.5 yr; women: 54.0 vs. 58.0 yr] and had lower body mass index (BMI) [men: 23.2 vs. 25.1 kg/m 2 ; women: 23.1 vs. 24.7 kg/m 2 ] compared to the controls. The median duration since HIV diagnosis was 19 (IQR 15–21) years in men and 18 (IQR 15–21) years in women. Three-quarters of PWH had been treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing antiretroviral therapy for a median time of 7.4 (IQR 4.5–8.9) years in men and 8.2 (IQR 6.1–10) years in women. In an unadjusted model, HIV+men had significantly lower BMD (g/cm 2 ) at the total hip and femoral neck whereas there was a tend toward lower BMD in HIV+women. After adjusting for age, BMI, and other traditional osteoporotic risk factors, BMD of virologically suppressed older PWH did not differ from participants without HIV (P&gt;0.1). PWH had lower serum 25(OH)D levels but this was not correlated with BMD. In conclusion, BMD in well-suppressed PWH is not different from non-HIV people, therefore, effective control of HIV infection and minimization of other traditional osteoporosis risk factors may help maintain good skeletal health and prevent premature bone loss in Asian PWH.

https://openalex.org/W4309495043,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by patients' high level of suffering. Up to 60% of patients with IBS have symptoms of anxiety or depression and only little attention has been paid to their specific requirements. Anthroposophical multimodal therapy (AMT) has been shown to significantly improve health-related quality of life of patients with high symptomatic burden.The aim of this pilot study was to find out whether AMT meets the needs of IBS patients and the interactions of AMT with IBS, depression and anxiety.Patients with diagnosed IBS were included in a feasibility study and received 12 sessions of AMT over 8 weeks (drks.de, DRKS00016890). The primary endpoint was the change of the IBS severity score (IBS-SSS) and changes were calculated by linear mixed effects analyses. The secondary endpoints were changes of self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 for mental comorbidity as well as self-valued effectiveness and satisfaction of AMT.Thirty-six patients, 89% female, were included in the study. AMT was successfully applied to IBS patients (-45 points in the IBS-SSS, p < .05). AMT had a large positive effect (-84 points in IBS-SSS, p < .003) on patients without anxiety or depression. Over time, patients with higher anxiety scores worsened with regard to their IBS compared to patients with depression and without mental comorbidity. The AMT effect was maintained at a 12 month follow up and both mentally affected and unaffected patients, had even lower IBS severity than shortly after AMT. AMT modules were rated by IBS patients as very effective.Our findings suggest that an 8-week program of AMT improves the severity of IBS with an ongoing effect at a 12 month follow-up. Especially for patients without psychological comorbidities, AMT is very successful. Future IBS therapies should incorporate a modified multimodal concept with stronger psychological therapy modules in parallel for patients with depression and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4309495044,"Little is publicly known about the conditions surrounding the emergence of COVID in China. Using two nationally representative datasets, the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we engage in a descriptive analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of lung and other diseases before 2019. In both datasets, the incidence of lung disease in 2018 was elevated in Hubei province relative to other provinces. The incidence of psychiatric and nervous system disease was elevated as well. Overall, the evidence is consistent with many possible explanations. One conjecture is that there was an outbreak of influenza in central China, which implies the conditions that increased the susceptibility to influenza also facilitated the later spread of COVID. Another conjecture, though less likely, is that COVID was circulating at low levels in the population in central China during 2018. This study calls for more investigation to understand the conditions surrounding the emergence of COVID."
https://openalex.org/W4309495045,"The number and popularity of backyard poultry and livestock farming have rapidly increased in California as well as other states in the United States following consumers’ preference for local and organic products in the last few years. This study aimed to investigate current on-farm management and farmers’ understanding of Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) and California Senate Bill (SB) 27 implications for disease prevention, biosecurity procedures, and antimicrobial use in small-scale and backyard farms in California. The survey consisted of 38 questions. The responses of 242 backyard and small-scale livestock owners were investigated in this study. Descriptive statistics summarized survey responses, and multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of antibiotics purchase and use, and the impact of VFD and SB27 on antibiotic use with demographics and on-farm management. Backyard and small-scale farmers in California mostly raised chickens or small ruminants with small herd sizes kept for personal use. Antibiotics were generally used for individual treatment of a sick animal with the guidance of a veterinarian. VFD and SB27 implementation promoted the judicious use of antibiotics, specifically, by enhancing the relationship between backyard and small-scale farmers with veterinarians and treating fewer animals with antibiotics under veterinary oversight. Therefore, better access to veterinary service in backyard and small-scale farms will improve the farmer’s knowledge of good husbandry practices with judicious antimicrobial use in livestock and finally contribute to reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance in California."
https://openalex.org/W4309495048,"In this study, two different feeds were treated to produce hydrocarbons: (1) reagent-grade acetone, and (2) mixed ketones obtained from lignocellulosic biomass via the carboxylate platform. Acetone and mixed ketones underwent catalytic self-condensation over HZSM-5. For acetone, HZSM-5(80) was used, and the experiments were conducted in two sets: (1) vary temperature (305–415°C) at P = 101 kPa (abs) and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 1.3 h –1 ; (2) vary WHSV (1.3–7.9 h –1 ) at T = 350 and 415°C, and P = 101 kPa (abs). For acetone over HZSM-5(280), the experiments were conducted in two sets: (1) vary WHSV (1.3–6.5 h –1 ) at T = 415°C, and P = 101 kPa (abs); and (2) vary WHSV (1.3–11.8 h –1 ) at P = 790 kPa (abs) and T = 415°C. For mixed ketones, HZSM-5(280) was used at WHSV = 1.9 h –1 , T = 430–590°C, and P = 101 kPa (abs). For acetone at higher temperatures, the conversion was 100% and the liquid products were aromatics centered on C8. At low temperatures, conversion was less and the carbon liquid distribution was centered on C9 (mainly mesitylene). For mixed ketones, catalyst deactivation was higher causing product concentrations to change over time, and the highest conversion reached was 40%."
https://openalex.org/W4309495105,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is caused by a single point variation in the β-globin gene (HBB): c.20A> T (p.Glu7Val), in homozygous state. SCA is characterized by sickling of red blood cells in small blood vessels which leads to a range of multiorgan complications, including kidney dysfunction. This case-control study aims at identifying sickle cell nephropathy biomarkers in a group of patients living with SCA from Senegal. A total of 163 patients living with SCA and 177 ethnic matched controls were investigated. Biological phenotyping included evaluation of glycemia, glucosuria, albuminuria, proteinuria, tubular proteinuria, serum creatinine, urine creatinine, urine specific gravity and glomerular filtration rate. Descriptive statistics of biomarkers were performed using the χ2 -test, with the significance level set at p<0.05. Patients living with SCA had a median age of 20 years (range 4 to 57) with a female sex frequency of 53.21%. The median age of the control participants was 29 years (range: 4-77) with a female sex frequency of 66.09%. The following proportions of abnormal biological indices were observed in SCA patients versus (vs.) controls, as follows: hyposthenuria: 35.3%vs.5.2% (p<0.001); glomerular hyperfiltration: 47.66%vs.19.75% (p<0.001), renal insufficiency: 5.47%vs.3.82% (p = 0.182); microalbuminuria: 42.38%vs.5.78% (p<0.001); proteinuria: 39.33%vs.4.62% (p<0.001); tubular proteinuria: 40.97%vs.4.73% (p<0.001) and microglucosuria: 22.5%vs.5.1% (p<0.001). This study shows a relatively high proportion of SCA nephropathy among patients living with SCA in Senegal. Microglucosuria, proteinuria, tubular proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hyposthenuria and glomerular hyperfiltration are the most prevalent biomarkers of nephropathy in this group of Senegalese patients with SCA."
https://openalex.org/W4309495123,"The COVID-19 pandemic becomes a cause of concern for hospital transmission. Caregivers may play an important role as vectors for nosocomial infections; however, infection control for caregivers often is neglected. A nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a 768-bed hospital from March 20, 2020, to April 14, 2020. We conducted a retrospective chart review and epidemiologic investigation on all cases. A total of 54 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 occurred in the community-based hospital. They included 26 (48.1%) patients, 21 (38.9%) caregivers, and 7 (13.0%) healthcare workers. These 21 caregivers cared for 18 patients, and of these, 9 were positive for COVID-19, 6 were negative, and 3 died before testing. Of the 6 negative patients, 3 had no exposure because the caregiver began to show symptoms at least 5 days after their discharge. Of the 9 positive patients, 4 cases of transmission took place from patient to caregiver (one patient transmitted COVID-19 to two caregivers), and 6 cases of transmission occurred from caregiver to patient. Of the 54 hospital-acquired cases, 38 occurred in the 8 th -floor ward and 8 occurred in the 4 th -floor ward. The index case of each ward was a caregiver. Counting the number of cases where transmission occurred only between patients and their own caregivers, 9 patients were suspected of having exposure to COVID-19 from their own caregivers. Six patients (66.7%) were infected by COVID-19-confirmed caregivers, and 3 patients were uninfected. Fewer patients among the infected were able to perform independent activities compared to uninfected patients. Not only patients and healthcare workers but also caregivers groups may be vulnerable to COVID-19 and be transmission sources of nosocomial outbreaks. Therefore, infection control programs for caregivers in addition to patients and healthcare workers can be equally important."
https://openalex.org/W4309495124,"This registered report introduces the largest, and for the first time, reproducible experimental survey on biomedical sentence similarity with the following aims: (1) to elucidate the state of the art of the problem; (2) to solve some reproducibility problems preventing the evaluation of most of current methods; (3) to evaluate several unexplored sentence similarity methods; (4) to evaluate an unexplored benchmark, called Corpus-Transcriptional-Regulation; (5) to carry out a study on the impact of the pre-processing stages and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools on the performance of the sentence similarity methods; and finally, (6) to bridge the lack of reproducibility resources for methods and experiments in this line of research. Our experimental survey is based on a single software platform that is provided with a detailed reproducibility protocol and dataset as supplementary material to allow the exact replication of all our experiments. In addition, we introduce a new aggregated string-based sentence similarity method, called LiBlock, together with eight variants of current ontology-based methods and a new pre-trained word embedding model trained on the full-text articles in the PMC-BioC corpus. Our experiments show that our novel string-based measure sets the new state of the art on the sentence similarity task in the biomedical domain and significantly outperforms all the methods evaluated herein, except one ontology-based method. Likewise, our experiments confirm that the pre-processing stages, and the choice of the NER tool, have a significant impact on the performance of the sentence similarity methods. We also detail some drawbacks and limitations of current methods, and warn on the need of refining the current benchmarks. Finally, a noticeable finding is that our new string-based method significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art Machine Learning models evaluated herein."
https://openalex.org/W4309495145,"By means of the event study approach, we analyse the effect of COVID-19 on listed European renewable and traditional electricity companies, inside and outside the European Union, for the pandemic announcement and lockdowns. We find that the pandemic negatively affected both subsectors of electricity production, but the negative effect was more intense for renewable electricity companies, since they represent a riskier investment. Moreover, this negative effect was larger for European electricity companies than for companies from countries that do not belong to the European Union. Our results show the riskier profile of the clean energy industry together with the importance of a stable and supportive regulatory framework to develop and consolidate renewable energy. Our findings have important implications for policymakers. In addition to the intrinsic risks associated with renewable energy, this type of investment poses policy and regulatory risks, which they should take into account when evaluating future energy policies. Policymakers must be aware of the importance of these specific risks, and seek to respond to investors' expectations about long-term, stable regulations."
https://openalex.org/W4309495148,"Birth at term comprises a period with heterogeneous neonatal outcomes that tend to be worse for infants born earlier. However, few studies have analyzed this period, in which each day can make a difference. Therefore, we aim to assess neonatal mortality (NM) according to gestational age (GA) at birth measured in days in term liveborn infants born in 2012-2017 in São Paulo, the largest city in Latin America. This population-based cohort study assessed term liveborn infants followed until the end of the neonatal period. We analyzed 7 models for NM according to GA in days: crude NM adjusted for maternal and prenatal variables, NM additionally adjusted for type of birth and type of hospital, and adjusted NM stratified by type of birth (cesarean and vaginal) and by type of hospital (public and private). We included 440,119 live infants born at 259-293 days of gestation. The median GA at birth was 274 days. In all models, NM was higher for infants born early term, decreasing in infants born full term and rising again in infants born late term. In the unadjusted model, hazard ratios of NM changed daily, decreasing from 3.34 to 1.00 on day 278 and increasing again thereafter. In the stratified analysis according to type of hospital, being born in a public hospital was associated with a reduced risk of NM for infants born at 278-283 days of pregnancy. There was a decrease in GA related to obstetric interventions, especially cesarean sections, which increased NM. The loss of days of pregnancy was larger in private hospitals. Increasing the granularity of GA to days is feasible and has the potential to drive public policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Brazilian study on GA in days using a national live births database."
https://openalex.org/W4309495149,"Relatively little work has evaluated both the disease of osteoarthritis (OA) and clinically-relevant pain outcome measures across different OA models in rats. The objective of this study was to compare sensitivity, pain, and histological disease severity across chemical and surgical models of OA in the rat. Stifle OA was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats via intraarticular injection of monoiodoacetate (MIA) or surgical transection of anterior cruciate ligament and/or destabilization of medial meniscus (ACL+DMM or DMM alone). Reflexive (e.g., mechanical and thermal stimuli) measures of sensitivity and non-reflexive assays (e.g., lameness, static hindlimb weight-bearing asymmetry, dynamic gait analysis) of pain were measured over time. Joint degeneration was assessed histologically. Six-weeks post OA-induction, the ACL+DMM animals had significantly greater visually observed lameness than MIA animals; however, both ACL+DMM and MIA animals showed equal pain as measured by limb use during ambulation and standing. The MIA animals showed increased thermal, but not mechanical, sensitivity compared to ACL+DMM animals. Joint degeneration was significantly more severe in the MIA model at 6 weeks. Our pilot data suggest both the ACL+DMM and MIA models are equal in terms of clinically relevant pain behaviors, but the MIA model is associated with more severe histological changes over time potentially making it more suitable for screening disease modifying agents. Future work should further characterize each model in terms of complex pain behaviors and biochemical, molecular, and imaging analysis of the sensory system and joint tissues, which will allow for more informed decisions associated with model selection and investigative outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4309495173,"Paucity of data exists on the timing of puberty, particularly the pubarche, in developing countries, which has hitherto limited the knowledge of the timing of pubarche, and assistance offered by physicians to anxious young people in Nigeria. Factors associated with the timings of puberty and pubarche are not well documented in Nigeria. We hypothesized that the timing of pubarche in Nigeria differs by geographical regions and other characteristics. We assessed the timing of pubarche among adolescents and young adults in Nigeria and identified prognostic factors of the timing by obtaining information on youths’ sexual and reproductive developments in a population survey among in-school and out-of-school youths aged 15 to 24 years in Nigeria. A total of 1174 boys and 1004 girls provided valid information on pubarche. Results of time-to-event analysis of the data showed that mean age at pubarche among males aged 15 to 19 years and 20 to 24 years was 13.5 ( SD = 1.63 years) and 14.2 ( SD = 2.18 years) (respectively) compared with 13.0 ( SD = 1.57 years) and 13.5 ( SD = 2.06 years) among females of the same age. Median time to pubarche was 14 (Interquartile range (IQR) = 3) years and 13 (IQR = 3) years among the males and females, respectively. Cumulatively, 37% of the males had attained pubarche by age 13 years versus 53% among females, 57% vs 72% at age 14, and 73% vs 81% at age 15. The likelihood of pubarche among males was delayed by 5% compared with females (Time Ratio (TR) = 1.05: 95% CI = 1.03–1.05). Every additional one-year in the ages of both males and females increases the risk of pubarche by 1%. Similar to the females, males residents in Northeast (aTR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07–1.21), in the Northwest (aTR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13–1.27) and in the Southwest (aTR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11–1.26) had delayed pubarche than males from the South East. Yoruba males had delayed pubarche than Ibo males (aTR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.12). Age at pubarche among adolescents and young adults in Nigeria differed among males and females with earlier onset among females. Pubarche timing varied mainly by ethnicity, region, and location of residence. Our findings will aid medical practitioners in providing appropriate advice and support on pubarche-related issues among adolescents in Nigeria as it could help douse pubarche anxiousness in relation to request for medical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W4309495268,"Documentation of how interactions among members of different stream communities [e.g., microbial communities and aquatic insect taxa exhibiting different feeding strategies (FS)] collectively influence the growth, survival, and recruitment of stream fishes is limited. Considerable spatial overlap exists between early life stages of stream fishes, including species of conservation concern like lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), and aquatic insects and microbial taxa that abundantly occupy substrates on which spawning occurs. Habitat overlap suggests that species interactions across trophic levels may be common, but outcomes of these interactions are poorly understood. We conducted an experiment where lake sturgeon eggs were fertilized and incubated in the presence of individuals from one of four aquatic insect FS taxa including predators, facultative and obligate-scrapers, collector-filterers/facultative predators, and a control (no insects). We quantified and compared the effects of different insect taxa on the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of egg surface bacterial and lower eukaryotic communities, egg size, incubation time to hatch, free embryo body size (total length) at hatch, yolk-sac area, (a measure of resource utilization), and percent survival to hatch. Mean egg size varied significantly among insect treatments. Eggs exposed to predators had a lower mean percent survival to hatch. Eggs exposed to predators had significantly shorter incubation periods. At hatch, free embryos exposed to predators had significantly smaller yolk sacs and total length. Multivariate analyses revealed that egg bacterial and lower eukaryotic surface community composition varied significantly among insect treatments and between time periods (1 vs 4 days post-fertilization). Quantitative PCR documented significant differences in bacterial 16S copy number, and thus abundance on egg surfaces varied across insect treatments. Results indicate that lethal and non-lethal effects associated with interactions between lake sturgeon eggs and free embryos and aquatic insects, particularly predators, contributed to lake sturgeon trait variability that may affect population levels of recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W4309495273,"Face masks, recently adopted to reduce the spread of COVID-19, have had the unintended consequence of increasing the difficulty of face recognition. In security applications, face recognition algorithms are used to identify individuals and present results for human review. This combination of human and algorithm capabilities, known as human-algorithm teaming, is intended to improve total system performance. However, prior work has shown that human judgments of face pair similarity-confidence can be biased by an algorithm’s decision even in the case of an error by that algorithm. This can reduce team effectiveness, particularly for difficult face pairs. We conducted two studies to examine whether face masks, now routinely present in security applications, impact the degree to which this cognitive bias is experienced by humans. We first compared the influence of algorithm’s decisions on human similarity-confidence ratings in the presence and absence of face masks and found that face masks more than doubled the influence of algorithm decisions on human similarity-confidence ratings. We then investigated if this increase in cognitive bias was dependent on perceived algorithm accuracy by also presenting algorithm accuracy rates in the presence of face masks. We found that making humans aware of the potential for algorithm errors mitigated the increase in cognitive bias due to face masks. Our findings suggest that humans reviewing face recognition algorithm decisions should be made aware of the potential for algorithm errors to improve human-algorithm team performance."
https://openalex.org/W4309495326,"The importance of human cell-based in vitro tools to drug development that are robust, accurate, and predictive cannot be understated. There has been significant effort in recent years to develop such platforms, with increased interest in 3D models that can recapitulate key aspects of biology that 2D models might not be able to deliver. We describe the development of a 3D human cell-based in vitro assay for the investigation of nephrotoxicity, using RPTEC-TERT1 cells. These RPTEC-TERT1 proximal tubule organoids ‘tubuloids’ demonstrate marked differences in physiologically relevant morphology compared to 2D monolayer cells, increased sensitivity to nephrotoxins observable via secreted protein, and with a higher degree of similarity to native human kidney tissue. Finally, tubuloids incubated with nephrotoxins demonstrate altered Na+/K+-ATPase signal intensity, a potential avenue for a high-throughput, translatable nephrotoxicity assay."
https://openalex.org/W4309534481,"The increasing traffic demand in urban areas frequently causes traffic congestion, which can be managed only through intelligent traffic signal controls. Although many recent studies have focused on reinforcement learning for traffic signal control (RL-TSC), most have focused on improving performance from an intersection perspective, targeting virtual simulation. The performance indexes from intersection perspectives are averaged by the weighted traffic flow; therefore, if the balance of each movement is not considered, the green time may be overly concentrated on the movements of heavy flow rates. Furthermore, as the ultimate purpose of traffic signal control research is to apply these controls to the real-world intersections, it is necessary to consider the real-world constraints. Hence, this study aims to design RL-TSC considering real-world applicability and confirm the appropriate design of the reward function. The limitations of the detector in the real world and the dual-ring traffic signal system are taken into account in the model design to facilitate real-world application. To design the reward for balancing traffic movements, we define the average delay weighted by traffic volume per lane and entropy of delay in the reward function. Model training is performed at the prototype intersection for ensuring scalability to multiple intersections. The model after prototype pre-training is evaluated by applying it to a network with two intersections without additional training. As a result, the reward function considering the equality of traffic movements shows the best performance. The proposed model reduces the average delay by more than 7.4% and 15.0% compared to the existing real-time adaptive signal control at two intersections, respectively."
