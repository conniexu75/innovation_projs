https://openalex.org/W4286220782,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant of concern comprises several sublineages, with BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 having replaced the previously dominant BA.1 and with BA.4 and BA.5 increasing in prevalence worldwide. We show that the large number of Omicron sublineage spike mutations leads to enhanced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding, reduced fusogenicity, and severe dampening of plasma neutralizing activity elicited by infection or seven clinical vaccines relative to the ancestral virus. Administration of a homologous or heterologous booster based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike sequence markedly increased neutralizing antibody titers and breadth against BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 across all vaccines evaluated. Our data suggest that although Omicron sublineages evade polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses elicited by primary vaccine series, vaccine boosters may provide sufficient protection against Omicron-induced severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W4285041384,"The potential for future coronavirus outbreaks highlights the need to broadly target this group of pathogens. We used an epitope-agnostic approach to identify six monoclonal antibodies that bind to spike proteins from all seven human-infecting coronaviruses. All six antibodies target the conserved fusion peptide region adjacent to the S2' cleavage site. COV44-62 and COV44-79 broadly neutralize alpha- and betacoronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron subvariants BA.2 and BA.4/5, albeit with lower potency than receptor binding domain-specific antibodies. In crystal structures of COV44-62 and COV44-79 antigen-binding fragments with the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide, the fusion peptide epitope adopts a helical structure and includes the arginine residue at the S2' cleavage site. COV44-79 limited disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 in a Syrian hamster model. These findings highlight the fusion peptide as a candidate epitope for next-generation coronavirus vaccine development."

https://openalex.org/W4285808661,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary force shaping prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. HGT-acquired genes have been sporadically reported in insects, a lineage containing >50% of animals. We systematically examined HGT in 218 high-quality genomes of diverse insects and found that they acquired 1,410 genes exhibiting diverse functions, including many not previously reported, via 741 distinct transfers from non-metazoan donors. Lepidopterans had the highest average number of HGT-acquired genes. HGT-acquired genes containing introns exhibited substantially higher expression levels than genes lacking introns, suggesting that intron gains were likely involved in HGT adaptation. Lastly, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to edit the prevalent unreported gene LOC105383139, which was transferred into the last common ancestor of moths and butterflies. In diamondback moths, males lacking LOC105383139 courted females significantly less. We conclude that HGT has been a major contributor to insect adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W4285388094,"Individual cells make decisions that are adapted to their internal state and surroundings, but how cells can reliably do this remains unclear. To study the information processing capacity of human cells, we conducted multiplexed quantification of signaling responses and markers of the cellular state. Signaling nodes in a network displayed adaptive information processing, which led to heterogeneous growth factor responses and enabled nodes to capture partially nonredundant information about the cellular state. Collectively, as a multimodal percept this gives individual cells a large information processing capacity to accurately place growth factor concentration within the context of their cellular state and make cellular state–dependent decisions. Heterogeneity and complexity in signaling networks may have coevolved to enable specific and context-aware cellular decision-making in a multicellular setting."
https://openalex.org/W4285727427,"As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present major challenges for health systems. In this study, we analyzed the effects of better population blood pressure control in the context of a proposed 80-80-80 target: 80% of individuals with hypertension are screened and aware of their diagnosis; 80% of those who are aware are prescribed treatment; and 80% of those on treatment have achieved guideline-specified blood pressure targets. We developed a population CVD model using country-level evidence on CVD rates, blood pressure levels and hypertension intervention coverage. Under realistic implementation conditions, most countries could achieve 80-80-80 targets by 2040, reducing all-cause mortality by 4-7% (76-130 million deaths averted over 2022-2050) and slowing the rise in CVD expected from population growth and aging (110-200 million cases averted). Although populous middle-income countries would account for most of the reduced CVD cases and deaths, low-income countries would experience the largest reductions in disease rates."
https://openalex.org/W4286216714,"Background The use of computers and other Visual Display Terminal (VDT) screens is increasing in Nepal. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the prevalence of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and other occupational health concerns among employees working in front of VDT screens in the Nepalese population. Objectives This study aims to estimate the prevalence of CVS, musculoskeletal and work-related stress among VDT screen users in the office, as well as their understanding and usage of preventive measures. Methods The study was a cross-sectional descriptive study among 319 VDT users in office settings in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Nepal, using a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the associated factors at 95% CI. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The prevalence of CVS was 89.4%. More than eight out of ten study participants reported at least one visual and musculoskeletal symptom. Work-related stress, which was moderate-difficult to handle, was present in 36.7% of the study population. The mean±SD computer usage per day was 7.9±1.9 hours. Tired eye (63.3%), feeling of dry eye (57.8%), headache (56.9%) were the common visual symptoms of CVS reported. Total computer use/day &gt; = 8 hours OR 2.6, improper viewing distance OR 3.2, Not using an anti-glare screen OR 2.6, not using eye-drops, and not wearing protective goggles OR 3.1 were significantly associated with the presence of CVS. There was no statistically significant association between visual symptoms of CVS, musculoskeletal symptoms, and stress with gender. Conclusion CVS was substantially related to not employing preventive measures, working longer hours, and having an incorrect viewing distance. With more hours per day spent in front of a VDT screen, work-related stress and musculoskeletal complaints were also found to be important correlates. Similarly, work-related stress was found more among those who had less than five years of job."

https://openalex.org/W4286218312,"Adhesive pili assembled through the chaperone-usher pathway are hair-like appendages that mediate host tissue colonization and biofilm formation of Gram-negative bacteria1-3. Archaic chaperone-usher pathway pili, the most diverse and widespread chaperone-usher pathway adhesins, are promising vaccine and drug targets owing to their prevalence in the most troublesome multidrug-resistant pathogens1,4,5. However, their architecture and assembly-secretion process remain unknown. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the prototypical archaic Csu pilus that mediates biofilm formation of Acinetobacter baumannii-a notorious multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. In contrast to the thick helical tubes of the classical type 1 and P pili, archaic pili assemble into an ultrathin zigzag architecture secured by an elegant clinch mechanism. The molecular clinch provides the pilus with high mechanical stability as well as superelasticity, a property observed for the first time, to our knowledge, in biomolecules, while enabling a more economical and faster pilus production. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinch formation at the cell surface drives pilus secretion through the outer membrane. These findings suggest that clinch-formation inhibitors might represent a new strategy to fight multidrug-resistant bacterial infections."

https://openalex.org/W4285796365,"Background A number of radiopharmaceuticals are available for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer (rPC), but few comparative imaging trials have been performed comparing them. In particular, there are no prospective head-to-head comparisons of the recently introduced [ 18 F]PSMA-1007 to the existing standard of care [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. The purpose of this trial is to establish the non-inferiority of the new radiopharmaceutical in terms of the rate of PET-positive findings and to obtain an intra-individual comparison of accuracy and radiopharmaceutical kinetics. Methods In this cross-over trial we will randomise 100 individuals to receive either first a standard-of-care PET/CT using [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 followed by an additional [ 18 F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT within 2 weeks, or vice-versa. Inclusion criteria include patients 18 years and older with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy, defined as two consecutive prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels &gt; 0.2 ng/ml. Detection rate at the patient-based level is the primary end-point. Each scan will be interpreted by a panel of six independent and masked readers (three for [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and three for [ 18 F]PSMA-1007) which consensus majority in cases of discrepancy. To confirm the PET-positivity rate at a patient based level, follow up at 6 months following the first scan will be performed to a composite standard of truth. Secondary endpoints shall include an intra-individual comparison of radiopharmaceutical-kinetics, per-region detection rate and positive predictive value. Discussion This is the first randomised prospective comparative imaging trial to compare the established [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 with [ 18 F]PSMA-1007 and will determine whether the new radiopharmaceutical is non-inferior to the established standard-of-care in terms of patient-level detection rate.

However, the issue has not received proper attention from school water sanitation and hygiene programs. And this study was aimed to identify knowledge and practice of menstrual hygiene, and associated factors.Institution based cross-sectional study was employed among 441 school girls in Mekidela city. EpiData Version 4.6 and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 25.0 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with the outcome variables. Variables with a p-value<0.25 in the bivariable analysis were a candidate for multivariable logistic regression and p-value<0.05 in the multivariable analysis was used to declare significant association.Of the respondents, 64.9% reported good knowledge of menstrual hygiene management. In multivariable analysis; grade level (grade 11 & 12) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.23, 95% C.I (1.19-4.16)], age ≥ 19 years [AOR = 3.45, 95% C.I (1.78-6.69)], residence [AOR = 1.90, 95% C.I: (1.12-3.23)], know sanitary pads [AOR = 2.67, 95% CI: (1.19-6.00)] and learned about menstrual hygiene [AOR = 1.71, 95% CI: (1.02-2.87)] found to be associated with knowledge. About 62.4% have good menstrual hygiene practices. Knowledge on menstrual hygiene [AOR = 1.73, 95% C.I (1.07-2.80)], know about reproductive tract/sexually transmitted infections [AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: (1.37-4.43)], having private shower [AOR = 2.04, 95% C.I 2.04(1.24-3.37)] and residence [AOR = 3.76, 95% C.I:(2.18-6.51)] were factors associated with practice.Overall nearly two-third of respondents had good knowledge and good practice of menstrual hygiene management. Factors significantly associated with their knowledge included age, grade level, residence, learning on menstrual hygiene, and knowledge of sanitary pads. Residence, knowledge on menstrual hygiene, know about sexually transmitted infections and having a private shower were found to be associated with practice of menstrual hygiene management. In general, our finding indicates that menstrual hygiene was unsatisfactory among adolescent school girls and more should be done on the factors identified."

https://openalex.org/W4285794103,"Antigen detection in urine using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is more sensitive than fecal examination for diagnosis of opisthorchiasis and for assessment of the effects of drug treatment. It is not known whether day-to-day variation of urine composition, including levels of Opisthorchis viverrini antigen, influences the urine assay. We investigated this topic with the cooperation of participants from two localities in Northeast Thailand. Project participants were screened for parasite infections for three consecutive days using the quantitative formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT) to detect O . viverrini eggs and the urine ELISA for detection of O . viverrini antigen. A subset of participants ( n = 801) with matched fecal and urine samples were analyzed for comparison of inter-day prevalence estimates and the performance of the urine assay compared against FECT for diagnosis of opisthorchiasis. The daily prevalence measured by the urine assay ranged between 29.0%-30.2% while those by FECT ranged between 11.9%-20.2%. The cumulative three-day prevalence estimate determined by the urine antigen assay was 30.3%, which was significantly higher than that by FECT (20.2%, p &lt; 0.05). A significant positive correlation was found between the concentration of antigen in urine and fecal egg counts (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, the urine assay had better diagnostic performance for opisthorchiasis than fecal examination by FECT. The high sensitivity plus negligible daily variation of O . viverrini antigen in urine indicates the utility of the urine assay for diagnosis, as well as population screening, of opisthorchiasis."
https://openalex.org/W4285797422,"Background Osteoporosis treatment usually starts with an antiresorber and switches to an anabolic agent if it fails. It is known that suppressing bone resorption also results in reduced bone formation. In addition, patients with prior treatment with antiresorbers may have reduced response to subsequent anabolic treatment. This study determined the prevalence of low bone formation in untreated osteoporosis patients to identify patients who may not be optimally treated under the current paradigm. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of bone samples stored in the Kentucky Bone Registry. Included samples were from adult patients presenting for workup of osteoporosis. Exclusion criteria were other diseases or treatments affecting bone. Patients underwent iliac crest bone biopsies after tetracycline labeling for identification of bone formation. Results 107 patients met study criteria, 92 White and 5 Black women and 10 White men. Forty percent of patients (43/107) had low bone formation/bone surface (BFR/BS &lt; 0.56 mm 3 /cm 2 /yr). Clinical and serum parameters did not differ between formation groups, except for type II diabetes, which was found exclusively in the low formation group. Conclusions Starting treatment of osteoporotic patients with an antiresorber in all patients appears not optimal for a significant portion."
https://openalex.org/W4286219830,"The identification of ships plays a crucial role in security and managing vessel traffic for ports and onshore facilities. Existing video monitoring systems help visually identify a vessel where other systems are not present or sufficient. Readable vessel plates and hull inscriptions of detected ships in the video stream allow using text location and recognition methods to obtain ships' identification names or numbers. The obtained information can be then matched with available ship registers. The automation of the process has met many challenges related to the often-low quality of available video streams, heterogeneous regulations on the marking of ships, and the specifics of natural scene text recognition, such as quickly alternating imaging conditions or the interference of the background. The main contribution of this research is a method that can identify any type of vessel in an image that has visible inscriptions (name, registration number) placed on the hull and must be registered in a public registry. The proposed method works with low-quality images with inscriptions placed under different angles and different, readable sizes. Our method recognised 91% of vessels from our test dataset. Obtained identification times have not exceeded 1s. The quality and efficiency of the proposed solution indicate that it is suitable for practical implementation in onshore monitoring systems."

Therefore, it is necessary to perform preventive interventions when patients are discharged from the hospital to decrease the aforementioned sequelae. The purpose of this pilot-controlled trial will be to determine the efficacy of a rehabilitation program on functional status and psychosocial factors for post-COVID-19 patients when it is delivered through a tele-care platform versus a booklet-based rehabilitation.The estimated sample size will be of 50 participants who have been discharged after COVID-19 and have a level of fatigue equal or greater than 4 on the Fatigue Severity Scale. The primary outcome will be the severity of fatigue. Participants will be randomly allocated to an ""asynchronous telerehabilitation group"" or to a ""booklet-based rehabilitation group"". Treatment in both groups will be the same and will consist of a combination of therapeutic exercise and an educative program. Treatment outcomes will be evaluated the last day of the intervention and at three- and six-months follow-up.The telerehabilitation intervention appears to be a viable and efficacy option in decreasing severe fatigue and other fitness variables such as strength and aerobic capacity, similar to other traditional rehabilitation formats such as through an explanatory booklet.This trial has been prospectively registered at clinialtrials.gov identifier: NCT04794036."
https://openalex.org/W4285793721,"Several options to treat hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients have been suggested. The study aimed to describe survival in patients treated with convalescent COVID plasma (CCP) and to identify in-hospital mortality predictors. This prospective cohort study examined data from 112 severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the Corona Departments in an acute care hospital who received two units of CCP (at least one of them high-titer). Demographic and medical data was retrieved from the patients’ electronic health records (EHR). Possible predictors for in-hospital mortality were analyzed in a univariate analysis and those found to be clinically significant were further analyzed in a multivariable analysis. Median age was 67 years (IQR 55–74) and 66 (58.9%) of them were males. Of them, 20 (17.9%) died in hospital. On multivariable analysis diabetes mellitus (p = 0.004, OR 91.54), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001, OR 59.07) and lower albumin levels at treatment (p = 0.027, OR 0.74) were significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In our study, in-hospital mortality in patients receiving CCP is similar to that reported for the general population, however certain variables mentioned above were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In the literature, these variables were also associated with a worse outcome in patients with COVID-19 who did not receive CCP. As evidence points toward a benefit from CCP treatment in immunocompromised patients, we believe the above risk factors can further define COVID-19 patients at increased risk for mortality, enabling the selection of candidates for early treatment in an outpatient setting if possible."
https://openalex.org/W4285794357,"The present work aims to find the optimal solution of Nash Equilibrium (NE) in the traditional Game Theory (GT) applied to water resources allocation. Innovatively, this paper introduces Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) into GT to propose a cooperative game model to solve the NE problem. Firstly, the basic theory of the PSO algorithm and cooperative game model is described. Secondly, the PSO-based cooperative game model is explained. Finally, the PSO-based cooperative game model is compared with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to test the performance. Besides taking the countries in Lancang Mekong River Basin as the research object, this paper discusses each country's water consumption and economic benefits under different cooperation patterns. Then, a series of improvement measures and suggestions are put forward accordingly. The results show that the average server occupancy time of the PSO-based cooperative game model is 78.46% lower than that of GA, and the average waiting time is 79.24% lower than that of the GA. Thus, the model reported here has higher computational efficiency and excellent performance than the GA and is more suitable for the current study. In addition, the multi-country cooperation mode can obtain more economic benefits than the independent water resource development mode. This model can quickly find the optimal combination of 16 cooperation modes and has guiding significance for maximizing the benefits of cross-border water Resource Utilization. This research can provide necessary technical support to solve the possible contradictions and conflicts between cross-border river basin countries and build harmonious international relations."

The Qatar national COVID-19 testing database, encompassing a total of 2,688,232 RT-PCR tests conducted between February 5, 2020-January 27, 2021, was analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were implemented to derive the COVID-19 risk score, as a tool to identify those at highest risk of having the infection. Score cut-off was determined using the ROC curve based on maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. The score’s performance diagnostics were assessed. Logistic regression analysis identified age, sex, and nationality as significant predictors of infection and were included in the risk score. The ROC curve was generated and the area under the curve was estimated at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.63–0.63). The score had a sensitivity of 59.4% (95% CI: 59.1%-59.7%), specificity of 61.1% (95% CI: 61.1%-61.2%), a positive predictive value of 10.9% (95% CI: 10.8%-10.9%), and a negative predictive value of 94.9% (94.9%-95.0%).

Blood samples are obtained via a catheter and then transferred back to the laboratory for further analysis. A hand-held glucometer used chute-side can make performing GTT’s and quantifying blood glucose concentration much easier and faster for research purposes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the agreement between a hand-held electronic glucometer (Precision Xtra; Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) for chute-side use in beef cattle compared with a colorimetric assay in the laboratory (Stanbio Glucose LiquiColor; Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX, USA). A GTT was performed on 13 Simmental × Angus steers during the growing phase. Blood samples were obtained via a jugular catheter. Glucometer readings were taken immediately after blood was sampled from the jugular with no preservative, and laboratory measurements were conducted on plasma preserved with sodium fluoride. A paired t-test ( P = 0.40), Pearson’s correlation ( P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.95), Bland-Altman plot, and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC = 0.90) were completed to evaluate the performance of the glucometer relative to the results from the laboratory assay.

https://openalex.org/W4286221740,"Almost half of under-five deaths occur during the neonatal period. Delivery with a skilled attendant, adherence to essential newborn care (ENC) and postnatal care (PNC) standards, and immediate treatment of infections are essential to improve neonatal survival. This article uses Demographic and Health Survey data from 45 low- and middle-income countries to assess 1) levels of ENC and PNC that mothers and newborns receive and how this differs by place of delivery and 2) levels of and sources for care-seeking for neonates sick with fever. For five of the ten ENC and PNC indicators assessed, less than two-thirds of mothers and newborns received care in alignment with global standards. Adherence is higher in private facilities than public facilities for all indicators other than immediate breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact. Except for immediate breastfeeding, adherence is lowest for newborns born at home with a skilled birth attendant (SBA). Socioeconomic disparities exist in access to skilled delivery and adherence to ENC and PNC, with the largest disparities among newborns delivered at home with a SBA. Private provider adherence to ENC and PNC standards was relatively high for newborns from the wealthiest families, indicating that meeting recommended guidelines is achievable. On average across the 45 countries, half of caregivers for neonates with fever sought care outside the home and 45 percent of those sought care from the private sector. There were substantial socioeconomic disparities in care-seeking for fever, but illness prevalence and sources of care seeking were consistent across wealth quintiles. Closing inequities in neonatal care and care seeking and ensuring that all families, including the poorest, can access high quality maternal and newborn care is crucial to ensure equity and accelerate reductions in neonatal and child mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4285794028,"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. Since then, additional novel coronavirus variants have emerged challenging the current healthcare system worldwide. There is an increased need for hospital care, especially intensive care unit (ICU), for the patients severely affected by the disease. Most of the studies analyzed COVID-19 infected patients in the hospitals and established the positive correlation between clinical parameters such as high levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and ferritin to the severity of infection. However, little is known about the course of the ICU admission. The retrospective study carried out at University Hospital Sharjah, UAE presented here reports an integrated analysis of the biochemical and radiological factors among the newly admitted COVID-19 patients to decide on their ICU admission. The descriptive statistical analysis revealed that patients with clinical presentations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p<0.0001) at the time of admission needed intensive care. The ROC plot indicated that radiological factors including high chest CT scores (>CO-RADS 4) in combination with biochemical parameters such as higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (>6.7 mg/dL;66% sensitivity and 75.8% specificity) and ferritin (>290 μg/mL, 71.4% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity) may predict ICU admission with 94.2% accuracy among COVID-19 patients. Collectively, these findings would benefit the hospitals to predict the ICU admission amongst COVID-19 infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W4285794441,"The underlying molecular pathophysiology of feeding disorders, particularly in peripheral organs, is still largely unknown. A range of molecular factors encoded by appetite-regulating genes are already described to control feeding behaviour in the brain. However, the important role of the gastrointestinal tract in the regulation of appetite and feeding in connection to the brain has gained more attention in the recent years. An example of such inter-organ connection can be the signals mediated by leptin, a key regulator of body weight, food intake and metabolism, with conserved anorexigenic effects in vertebrates. Leptin signals functions through its receptor (lepr) in multiple organs, including the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. So far, the regulatory connections between leptin signal and other appetite-regulating genes remain unclear, particularly in the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we used a zebrafish mutant with impaired function of leptin receptor to explore gut expression patterns of appetite-regulating genes, under different feeding conditions (normal feeding, 7-day fasting, 2 and 6-hours refeeding). We provide evidence that most appetite-regulating genes are expressed in the zebrafish gut. On one hand, we did not observed significant differences in the expression of orexigenic genes (except for hcrt) after changes in the feeding condition. On the other hand, we found 8 anorexigenic genes in wild-types (cart2, cart3, dbi, oxt, nmu, nucb2a, pacap and pomc), as well as 4 genes in lepr mutants (cart3, kiss1, kiss1r and nucb2a), to be differentially expressed in the zebrafish gut after changes in feeding conditions. Most of these genes also showed significant differences in their expression between wild-type and lepr mutant. Finally, we observed that impaired leptin signalling influences potential regulatory connections between anorexigenic genes in zebrafish gut. Altogether, these transcriptional changes propose a potential role of leptin signal in the regulation of feeding through changes in expression of certain anorexigenic genes in the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish."

Eighteen male football players (22 years, 179 cm, 70 kg, 10 years of athletic career) randomly performed a 20-m shuttle jog (at an intensity of 70% of heart rate maximum) and a seated rest (sitting on a bench) during halftime in two separate sessions. A 5-min football simulation protocol consisting of football-specific activities (jumping, sprinting, kicking, passing, and dribbling at various intensities and distances) was repeated nine times to mimic the first and second half of a football match. Athletic performance (maximal vertical jump height, 20-m sprint time, and the Arrowhead agility test time) recorded during a 15-min period were averaged to represent each time point (first half: T1 to T3; second half: T4 to T6). Lower-leg skin and muscle (using the insulation disk technique) temperature was recorded before and after the first and second half. There was no condition effect over time in maximal vertical jump: F5,187 = 0.53, p = 0.75, Arrowhead agility test time: F5,187 = 1.25, p = 0.29, and lower-leg temperature (skin: F3,119 = 1.40, p = 0.25; muscle: F3,119 = 1.08, p = 0.36). The 20-m sprint time between conditions during the initial 15-min of the second half was different (condition × time: F5,187 = 2.42, p = 0.04) that subjects who performed the shuttle jog ran 0.09 sec faster (3.08 sec, p = 0.002, ES = 0.68), as compared with those who did the seated rest (3.17 sec). The results of our study confirmed that a decremental effect of the static rest on sprinting performance during the initial period of the second halftime can be attenuated by a halftime warm-up."

https://openalex.org/W4285795504,"Background With the global push towards universal access to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART), patient numbers are increasing, further straining already under-resourced healthcare systems in sub-Saharan Africa. A simple scoring tool could be useful in optimizing differentiated service delivery by identifying individuals likely to have unsuppressed viral load. Methods Using existing data of patients accessing ART at public health facilities that were extracted from the Kenya Electronic Medical Record (KenyaEMR) and standard methods of developing a clinical prediction tool; we created and validated a risk scoring tool to identify persons likely to be virally unsuppressed at 18 months post-ART initiation. Data from the KenyaEMR were cleaned, merged and reviewed for completeness. We utilized multivariate modelling to determine key predictors of viral load suppression that could be measured in clinical settings. Results We assessed clinical reports of 3,968 patients on ART who had been on ART for at least 18 months and had at least one viral load result and were ≥ 18 years old. Of these, the majority (81%) were virally suppressed 18 months post-ART initiation. The final risk score included age, sex, body mass index at HIV diagnosis, number of years of formal education, disclosure status, and duration of time between HIV diagnosis and initiating ART. The maximum risk score was 78; a risk score of ≥22 was associated with unsuppressed viral load (&gt;1000copies/mL). The area under the curve (AUC) for the probability of the risk score to correctly predict unsuppressed viral load was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.56). Internal and external validation showed similar predictive ability. Conclusions Routinely collected variables in a public HIV clinic medical record predicts, with modest accuracy, individuals likely to have unsuppressed HIV viremia 18 months after they initiate ART. The use and application of this tool could improve and complement efficiency in differentiated care models for patients on ART."
https://openalex.org/W4285795760,"Floral adaptations to specific pollinators like corolla shape variation often result in reproductive isolation and thus speciation. But despite their ecological importance, the genetic bases of corolla shape transitions are still poorly understood, especially outside model species. Hence, our goal was to identify candidate genes potentially involved in corolla shape variation between two closely related species of the Rhytidophyllum genus (Gesneriaceae family) from the Antilles with contrasting pollination strategies. Rhytidophyllum rupincola has a tubular corolla and is strictly pollinated by hummingbirds, whereas R. auriculatum has more open flowers and is pollinated by hummingbirds, bats, and insects. We surveyed the literature and used a comparative transcriptome sequence analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions to obtain a list of genes that could explain floral variation between R. auriculatum and R. rupincola. We then tested their association with corolla shape variation using QTL mapping in a F2 hybrid population. Out of 28 genes tested, three were found to be good candidates because of a strong association with corolla shape: RADIALIS, GLOBOSA, and JAGGED. Although the role of these genes in Rhytidophyllum corolla shape variation remains to be confirmed, these findings are a first step towards identifying the genes that have been under selection by pollinators and thus involved in reproductive isolation and speciation in this genus."

https://openalex.org/W4285797559,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a common and growing eye problem worldwide. Chronic DED symptoms can, subsequently, affect the patients' quality of life (QOL). This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to assess the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Thai version of the Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-Life Score (DEQS-Th) questionnaire and to evaluate its accuracy in DED screening. Psychometric validation was conducted on DED participants. All participants completed the DEQS-Th and other measurements including the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L). Internal consistency, concurrent validity, convergent, and discriminant validity were evaluated. The standardized response mean (SRM) was used to evaluate the responsiveness of the DEQS-Th. The optimal cut-off score of DEQS-Th for DED screening was assessed. Among 100 participants with a mean age of 50.9 ± 14.4 years, and 89.0% female, the internal consistency of the DEQS-Th was excellent (Cronbach's alpha: 0.80-0.92). The test-retest intraclass correlation was 0.82-0.92. It showed concurrent validity with the OSDI (r = 0.694, p < .001) and EQ-5D-5L index scores (r = -0.578, p < .001). DED is suspected if the DEQS-Th score ≥ 18.33 (AUC = 0.897, sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 76.7%) or its Short Form score ≥ 3 (AUC 0.857, sensitivity 93.0%, specificity 63.3%). The SRM of the symptom subscale of DEQS-Th was 0.82, indicating relatively large responsiveness, whereas the impact on daily life subscale and the summary score was small. In conclusion, the DEQS-Th is valid and reliable for evaluating the multifaceted effects of DED on a patient's QOL. It can be useful for primary assessment and monitoring of DED in routine clinical practice."

Toll like receptors (TLR) ligand as AIVs adjuvants can activate dendritic cells to improve immune responses in multiple animals, while the studies were absent in duck. Therefore, we investigated TLR ligands pam2CSK4, poly (I:C) and/or imiquimod enhance immune responses to inactivated H9N2 avian influenza antigen (H9N2 IAIV) in peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and duck. In vitro, we observed that transcription factor NF-κB, Th1/Th2 type cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-6) and the ability of catching H9N2 IAIV antigen were significantly up-regulated when H9N2 IAIV along with TLR ligands (pam2CSK4, poly (I:C) and imiquimod, alone or combination) in duck MoDCs. Also, the best enhancement effects were showed in combination of pam2CSK4, poly (I:C) and imiquimod group, whereas IFN-α showed no significant enhancement in all experimental groups. In vivo, the results demonstrated that the percentages of CD4+/ CD8+ T lymphocytes, the levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and H9N2 HI titers were significant enhanced in combination of pam2CSK4, poly (I:C) and imiquimod group. However, pam2CSK4 alone or combining with imiquimod showed no enhancement or additive effects on Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-2), Th2 cytokines (IL-6) and HI titers in Muscovy duck, respectively. Taken together, our results concluded that not all TLR ligands showed enhancement of immune responses to H9N2 IAIV in duck.

As a result, early detection is critical, which can be accomplished by routine mammograms. This paper aims to describe, analyze, compare and evaluate three image descriptors involved in classifying breast cancer images from four databases.Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) prove themselves as being efficient methods for selection and classification problems. This paper aims to study combinations of well-known classification objectives in order to compare the results of their application in solving very specific learning problems. The experimental results undergo empirical analysis which is supported by a statistical approach. The results are illustrated on a collection of medical image databases, but with a focus on the MOEAs' performance in terms of several well-known measures. The databases were chosen specifically to feature reliable human annotations, so as to measure the correlation between the gold standard classifications and the various MOEA classifications.We have seen how different statistical tests rank one algorithm over the others in our set as being better. These findings are unsurprising, revealing that there is no single gold standard for comparing diverse techniques or evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, building meta-classifiers and evaluating them using a single, favorable metric is both extremely unwise and unsatisfactory, as the impact is to skew the results.The best method to address these flaws is to select the right set of objectives and criteria. Using accuracy-related objectives, for example, is directly linked to maximizing the number of true positives. If, on the other hand, accuracy is chosen as the generic metric, the primary classification goal is shifted to increasing the positively categorized data points."
https://openalex.org/W4285793599,"Edge computing is a novel network architecture that is in proximity to the end devices in an Internet of Things (IoT). As the IoT becoming a major factor in our daily life, provisioning a low response time of the services to IoT users through edge computing is an important problem. Caching necessary program data for the task in an edge node effectively reduces the response time of the computation task. However, due to the increase of IoT users and devices, it is noteworthy that limited-resource edge nodes would receive a number of tasks, having a heavy burden of processing the requests. Therefore, the limited resource and caching space at cloudlet need the careful design of the caching algorithm to utilize the space of multiple edge nodes and relieve the burden of computations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative program caching system that makes different edge nodes cooperatively store program data and cache the replicas of the data requested frequently to handle a number of requests from IoT users. In particular, we develop a cooperative caching algorithm that caches the appropriate number of data replicas depending on the number of requests on each cloudlet and the popularity of the data to minimize the response time. The simulation results show that the proposed cooperative caching algorithm can effectively reduce the response time for IoT users compared to other existing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4285793693,"Research has usually considered cyberbullying as a unitary phenomenon. Thus, it has been neglected to explore whether the specific online aggressive behaviours relate differentially to demographic features of the perpetrators of online aggressive actions, their personality characteristics, or to the ways in which they interact with the Internet. To bridge this gap, a study was conducted through a questionnaire administered online to 1228 Italian high-school students (Female: 61.1%; 14-15 yo: 48.%; 16-17 yo: 29.1%; 18-20 yo: 20.4%, 21-25 yo: 1.6%; Northern Italy: 4.1%; Central Italy: 59.2%; Southern Italy: 36.4%). The questionnaire, in addition to items about the use of social media, mechanisms of Moral Disengagement and personality characteristics of the participants in the study, also included a scale for the measurement of cyberbullying through the reference to six aggressive behaviours. The results indicate that cyberbullying can be considered as a non-unitary phenomenon in which the different aggressive behaviours can be related to different individual characteristics such as gender, personality traits and the different ways of interacting with social media. Moreover, the existence of two components of cyberbullying has been highlighted, one related to virtual offensive actions directly aimed at a victim, the other to indirect actions, more likely conducted involving bystanders. These findings open important perspectives for understanding, preventing, and mitigating cyberbullying among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4285794648,"Within the integrated motivational-volitional model of suicidal behavior, entrapment that consecutively leads to hopelessness is considered as a proximal risk factor for suicidal ideation. Entrapment can refer to both external and internal circumstances whereby results of recent studies indicate that internal entrapment plays a more important role than external entrapment in the development of suicidal ideation. It has been considered that to escape internal entrapment might be more complicated than to change external circumstances. However, it remains unclear whether the greater effect of internal entrapment on suicidal ideation is due to greater feelings of hopelessness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to address this research gap and to examine the effects of internal and external entrapment on hopelessness and suicidal ideation.N = 454 participants from a community sample (75% female) aged between 18 and 73 years (M = 29.91, SD = 11.56) conducted a cross-sectional online survey. All participants were assessed for suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and internal as well as external entrapment. Pearson product-moment correlations and two mediation analyses were conducted.All constructs were significantly correlated. For both internal and external entrapment, an effect on suicidal ideation was found. Both effects were partially mediated by hopelessness, this mediation was larger for external entrapment. The completely standardized indirect effect used to compare the mediation models was larger for external entrapment than for internal entrapment.Hopelessness mediated the association between external entrapment as well as internal entrapment and suicidal ideation. This effect was larger for external entrapment."

""Cut-loading"" methods allow simultaneous assessment of cell-coupling between multiple retinal cell-types, but existing analysis methods impede direct comparison with gold standard direct dye injection techniques. In the current study, we both improved an existing method and developed two new approaches to address observed limitations. Each method of analysis was applied to cut-loaded dark-adapted Guinea pig retinae (n = 29) to assess coupling strength in the axonless horizontal cell type ('a-type', aHCs). Method 1 was an improved version of the standard protocol and described the distance of dye-diffusion (space constant). Method 2 adjusted for the geometric path of dye-transfer through cut-loaded cells and extracted the rate of dye-transfer across gap-junctions in terms of the coupling coefficient (kj). Method 3 measured the diffusion coefficient (De) perpendicular to the cut-axis. Dye transfer was measured after one of five diffusion times (1-20 mins), or with a coupling inhibitor, meclofenamic acid (MFA) (50-500μM after 20 mins diffusion). The standard protocol fits an exponential decay function to the fluorescence profile of a specified retina layer but includes non-specific background fluorescence. This was improved by measuring the fluorescence of individual cell soma and excluding from the fit non-horizontal cells located at the cut-edge (p<0.001) (Method 1). The space constant (Method 1) increased with diffusion time (p<0.01), whereas Methods 2 (p = 0.54) and 3 (p = 0.63) produced consistent results across all diffusion times. Adjusting distance by the mean cell-cell spacing within each tissue reduced the incidence of outliers across all three methods. Method 1 was less sensitive to detecting changes induced by MFA than Methods 2 (p<0.01) and 3 (p<0.01). Although the standard protocol was easily improved (Method 1), Methods 2 and 3 proved more sensitive and generalisable; allowing for detailed assessment of the tracer kinetics between different populations of gap-junction linked cell networks and direct comparison to dye-injection techniques."

This study assesses the significance of using two DNA barcoding loci (e.g., psbA-trnH and trnC-petN ) in distinguishing 33 plant samples of the genus Syringa . Results showed that the average genetic distance K2P of psbA-trnH DNA marker was 0.0521, which is much higher than that of trnC-petN , which is 0.0171. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on psbA-trnH and trnC-petN indicated that the identification rate of psbA-trnH and trnC-petN alone were 75% and 62.5%, respectively. The barcode combination of psbA-trnH + trnC-petN could identify 33 samples of the genus Syringa accurately and effectively with an identification rate of 87.5%. The 33 Syringa samples were divided into four groups: Group I is series Syringa represented by Syringa oblata ; Group II is series Villosae represented by Syringa villosa ; Group III is series Pubescentes represented by Syringa meyeri ; and Group IV is section Ligustrina represented by Syringa reticulata subsp. pekinensis .

https://openalex.org/W4285797224,"Background Birth order and having at least one sibling are known to be associated with an increased risk for development of overweight. However, there are no studies assessing pre- and postnatal factors for developing overweight within families. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyse the association of the mother’s weight gain during pregnancy, prepregnancy BMI, mother’s age at birth, breastfeeding, age gap between siblings, and physical activity together with sibling-related characteristics on the development of overweight in children and adolescents. Methods Data were obtained from the longitudinal LIFE Child cohort. The study sample included n = 1932 children, stratified into first-born (n = 578), second-born (n = 608), third-or-later-born single-born siblings (n = 162), only children (n = 526), and twin children (n = 58). Children with chronic or syndromic diseases, born prematurely or from mothers with gestational diabetes were excluded. Data were adjusted for multiple children per family using mixed models. Pregnancy weight gain, prepregnancy BMI and mother’s age were considered prenatal co-variates. Postnatal factors included the duration of breastfeeding and the children’s physical activity level. Results Particularly until the onset of puberty, the BMI-SDS differed between single-born siblings, only children and twins, and increased with birth order. Compared to children with siblings, only children exhibited a strong increase in BMI-SDS starting at age nine. A higher age gap between siblings was associated with a higher BMI-SDS in second- and third-or-later-born children. Single-born siblings had the highest rate and duration of breastfeeding. Physical activity was highest in twins and third-or-later-born children and lowest in only children. In a multivariate model, being an only child showed a highly significant association with BMI-SDS. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that siblings had a lower BMI-SDS than only children did. For single-born siblings, the association between birth order and increased BMI-SDS seemed to persist only up to 11 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W4285798235,"There is little research on how financial incentives and penalties impact national cesarean section rates. In January 2018, Georgia introduced a national cesarean section reduction policy, which imposes a financial penalty on hospitals that do not meet their reduction targets. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of this policy on cesarean section rates, subgroups of women, and selected perinatal outcomes.We included women who gave birth from 2017 to 2019 registered in the Georgian Birth Registry (n = 150 534, nearly 100% of all births in the country during this time). We then divided the time period into pre-policy (January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017) and post-policy (January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019). An interrupted time series analysis was used to compare the cesarean section rates (both overall and stratified by parity), neonatal intensive care unit transfer rates, and perinatal mortality rates in the two time periods. Descriptive statistics were used to assess differences in maternal socio-demographic characteristics.The mean cesarean section rate in Georgia decreased from 44.7% in the pre-policy period to 40.8% in the post-policy period, mainly among primiparous women. The largest decrease in cesarean section births was found among women <25 years of age and those with higher education. There were no significant differences in the neonatal intensive care unit transfer rate or the perinatal mortality rate between vaginal and cesarean section births in the post-policy period.The cesarean section rate in Georgia decreased during the 2-year post-policy period. The reduction mainly took place among primiparous women. The policy had no impact on the neonatal intensive care unit transfer rate or the perinatal mortality rate.

Although Ardern and her Labour party are considered left-leaning, the policies implemented during the pandemic (e.g., police roadblocks) have the hallmarks of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA). RWA is characterized by three attitudinal clusters (authoritarian aggression, submission, and conventionalism). The uniqueness of the clusters, and whether they react to environmental change, has been debated. Here, in the context of the pandemic, we investigate the relationship between political orientation and RWA. Specifically, we measured political orientation, support for New Zealand's major political parties, and RWA among 1,430 adult community members. A multivariate Bayesian model demonstrated that, in the middle of a pandemic, both left-leaning and right-leaning individuals endorsed items tapping authoritarian submission. In contrast to authoritarian submission, and demonstrating the multidimensional nature of RWA, we observed the typical relationships between political orientation and authoritarian aggression and conventionalism was observed."
https://openalex.org/W4286005800,"Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Catalyst Conferences are a series of half-day, virtual conferences aimed to help build communities in emerging areas of biology. Catalyst Conferences take place on Wednesdays, from October through April, and are free to attend. The second FASEB Catalyst Conference on B Cells in Injury and Regeneration took place on March 30, 2022. The meeting was co-chaired by Dr. Ruxandra F. Sîrbulescu (Principal Investigator, Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center [VIC], and Instructor in Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital [MGH], and Harvard Medical School [HMS]) and Dr. Mark C. Poznansky (Director, Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, MGH and Professor in Medicine at HMS, Boston, MA, USA). Together, Sîrbulescu and Poznansky assembled a panel of scientists from multiple institutions across the United States who offered a multifaceted perspective on the diverse functions that B cells can have in the context of tissue injury and regeneration. This edition of the conference focused particularly on central nervous system (CNS) injuries and on aspects of regenerative medicine. The six invited speakers shared recent published and unpublished work from their groups and others' with the stated goal of promoting open collaboration in this emerging field. Dr. Ann M. Stowe (Associate Professor, Departments of Neurology and Neuroscience, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA) presented recent work exploring the connection between Bcell trafficking in the brain after stroke and brain plasticity leading to improved functional outcome. Previous work from Stowe and collaborators found bilateral diapedesis of B cells into areas remote from the site of acute stroke and Bcell-mediated support for neurogenesis and functional recovery in mice.1 Interestingly, unlike other immune cells, B cells showed a lack of distinct homing to the injury site, with a widespread distribution throughout the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. It is unclear, however, what parenchymal stimuli could activate B cells in remote regions ostensibly lacking canonical “pro-inflammatory” cues. Stowe proposed a mechanism by which B cells could have a trophic and neuroprotective effect after stroke through the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Preliminary data show that a subset of B cells responds to glutamate levels via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In stroke, GluN2A subunit-containing NMDA receptors on B cells are activated by glutamate, leading to increased BDNF production. However, at very high glutamate concentrations, similar to levels in the epicenter of the lesion, Bcell NMDA receptor activity is reduced, potentially reducing the neuroprotective activity. Overall, Dr. Stowe hypothesizes that a subset of B cells may play a role in functional recovery after stroke by promoting neuronal survival and neuroplasticity in areas of the brain distant from the injury site through BDNF, but potential activation by physiologic levels of glutamate is concentration dependent. While there is great interest in the potential for B cells as promoters of regeneration, there are also instances where their presence at a site of injury can be detrimental. In his talk, Dr. Kristian Doyle (Associate Professor, Department of Neurology, University of Arizona, AZ, USA) described the dual nature of B cells in the context of stroke, highlighting both their neuroprotective effects and their possible role in chronic “smoldering” inflammation. Using a mouse preclinical model of ischemic stroke, Doyle described the immediate and significant increase in angiogenesis within the stroke site, characterized by the formation of new blood vessels that lack tight junctions, causing prolonged blood–brain barrier (BBB) disfunction. Moreover, due to the highly proteolytic microenvironment at the site of stroke, any newly formed tight junctions would likely be disrupted as soon as they were formed. Further complicating the regenerative response, although astrocytic gliosis creates a scar around the infarcted area, the scar is a permeable barrier that allows neurotoxic molecules in the infarct to leak into the surrounding tissue.2 By week 7 post-stroke, the brain shows a drastic loss of symmetry characterized by both edema and atrophy in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Correlated to the structural disruption, animals develop major long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits as well as memory deficits. Doyle pointed out that the neurodegeneration that occurs in the weeks after stroke correlates with the appearance of B cells at the stroke site. Conversely, Bcell-deficient mice, both from knockout and depletion, were protected from LTP and memory deficits.3 One hypothesis was that due to the permeability of the astrocytic scar, antibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced locally by B cells within the compartmentalized infarcted site leak out into the surrounding tissue. Doyle also noted, however, that the Bcell response in the brain is heterogeneous and that different subsets of B cells could have different effects. For example, B1 cells, which are a type of B cell that are part of the innate immune system and produce low-affinity antibodies independently of T cell help, are one of the major sub-populations of B cell within chronic stroke infarcts.4 He discussed and presented data that supported the view that disrupted lipid metabolism due to stroke is almost certainly a major driver of the chronic inflammatory response to stroke and that these B1 cells may be playing an important role in clearing myelin lipid debris. Shifting the focus toward the role neuroinflammation in spinal cord injury (SCI), Dr. Phillip Popovich (Professor and Chair, Department of Neuroscience, Ohio State University, OH, USA) highlighted the importance of microglia in coordinating repair in the injured CNS. The talk began with a histological overview of SCI and showed how macrophages, derived from infiltrating peripheral monocytes, are the distinctly dominant immune cell population at the site of injury, a phenomenon that is conserved across many species.5-7 Interestingly, systemic depletion of monocytes resulted in reduced axon loss, improved plasticity, and functional recovery after SCI in rodent models.8 By contrast, when microglia are depleted, lesions increase in size and complexity, while spontaneous recovery is greatly impaired. New RNA sequencing data from Popovich's team showed that microglia have a critical and highly complex role in regulating the post-SCI transcriptome. When microglia were depleted using PLX5622, more than half of the genes usually upregulated after SCI failed to change expression levels. In these studies, microglia even appear to dictate the phenotype of other cell populations after SCI, altering the transcriptional fate of monocyte-derived macrophages at the injury site, as well as that of astrocytes. In the overall context of neuroinflammatory response to SCI, Popovich noted that the absence of B cells improved motor recovery after SCI in mice, supporting a potentially detrimental aspect of infiltrating B cells at the injury site.9 Taking a broader perspective on the functional and neurobehavioral aspects of immune activation and neurological function, Dr. Elizabeth Engler-Chiurazzi (Assistant Professor, Department of Neurosurgery, Tulane University, LA, USA) gave an insightful overview of existing knowledge on Bcell contributions to mental health, psychosocial stress, and major depression. She presented highly original research from her laboratory and others showing that the abundance of peripheral B cells is reduced in major depressive disorder as well as in healthy individuals in the context of stress. Interestingly, chronic stress can alter splenic Bcell counts in a subset-dependent matter. In preclinical mouse models, it has been shown that acute or prolonged stress alters the balance of immune cell populations, reducing the abundance of certain B cell subsets while increasing the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells. Engler-Chiurazzi's research has shown that Bcell deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to severe acute stress and that this depressive-like phenotype is age related and sex specific. Moreover, reconstitution of Bcell-deficient mice with purified splenic B cells increased the behavioral resilience of mice to forced swim stress. This work provided a unique view on the functional relevance of B cells served to broaden the definition of CNS “injury” to include psychological stressors and linked this aspect of adaptive immunity to higher cognitive functions across the lifespan. In a talk that focused on the potential for targeted molecular manipulation of B cells, Dr. Christian LeGuern (Associate Professor of Surgery [Immunology], Harvard Medical School, MA, USA) presented work performed in collaboration with the group of Dr. James Markmann (Claude E. Welch Professor of Surgery, HMS, MA, USA) characterizing the therapeutic potential of regulatory B cells (Bregs) in organ transplantation. Their group developed in vitro methods of stimulating B cells to induce a regulatory phenotype.10 LeGuern showed how B cells can be induced toward a regulatory phenotype either by a CD40 ligand stimulation or a via a toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathway, specifically involving both TLR-9 stimulation by CpG dinucleotides and TLR-4 stimulation by lipopolysaccharides. Using murine allogeneic islet and skin transplantation models, the group found that both Breg subsets achieved prolongation of graft survival. Interestingly, CD40-induced Breg cells appear to act mostly through the release of interleukin 10 while TLR-induced Bregs (Breg-TLR) produce a large amount of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). The group further focused on characterizing subsets of Breg-TLR cells through single-cell RNA sequencing, showing that B cells stimulated through the TLR-9 and TLR-4 pathways have a unique expression profile, characterized by high expression of TGFβ. Interestingly, donor-specific Bregs-TLR are more efficient at promoting graft survival, suggesting that local targeting via the Bcell receptor may play a role in specific homing of the regulatory cells to the graft.11 A recent study from the same group further showed that Bregs-TLR can inhibit cognate Bcell activation, proliferation, and development into plasma cells. It was hypothesized that because Bregs-TLR express very high levels of major histocompatibility complex class II, they may induce CD4+ T cell anergy by presenting relevant antigens in a tolerogenic milieu. This work underlined the potential for ex vivo stimulated B cells to improve the success of graft survival in allogeneic transplantation. In the final segment of the conference, Dr. Marion Buckwalter (Professor of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Stanford University, CA, USA) gave a compelling talk on the role of B cells in post-stroke dementia. Buckwalter began by highlighting the serious implications of stroke and post-stroke pathologies, particularly dementia, which has been shown to double in likelihood following stroke. Among the histopathological changes observed after acute ischemic stroke, neuroinflammation and peripheral immune cell infiltration are common hallmarks. Interestingly, findings in post-mortem brain samples indicate that more B cells are found in the lesion core in individuals that have also developed dementia after stroke.3 Stroke can lead to immunodepression including lymphopenia and monocyte suppression, which amplifies the risk of infection. At the same time, the tissue disruption associated with the stroke lesion can lead to the release of brain antigens, potentially triggering autoimmune responses. It was hypothesized that generalized infection may amplify the overall inflammatory response and thus also autoimmunity. Buckwalter's group is actively investigating peripheral immune signatures after stroke that may be associated with future cognitive deterioration. Buckwalter shared the design of an ongoing clinical study at Stanford Hospital which is aimed at linking immunological responses to stroke with long-term post-stroke cognitive trajectories.12 Samples are collected from patients and participants longitudinally, and immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma proteomics are used for analysis. Preliminary data indicate that numerous proteins associated with immunomodulation are significantly altered in the plasma of enrolled patients confirmed to have had an acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, there are significant correlations between these alterations and post-stroke mood. The outcomes from this and other studies with a similar design will represent a significant contribution to our understanding of the temporal dynamics of inflammatory involvement in the development of post-stroke dementia. Overall, the Conference on B Cells in Injury and Regeneration provided fascinating insights into the functions that B cells have in the context of various pathologies of the CNS, as well as evidence of potential therapeutic applications, fostering a highly collaborative discussion between subject area experts from diverse scientific fields.

Although Community Health Workers (CHWs) are increasingly being acknowledged as crucial members of the healthcare workforce in reducing health disparity, evidence is limited on perspective of community health workers. The objective of this protocol is to outline the methodological process of a systematic review that will gather qualitative data to examine determinants of community health workers effectiveness for delivery of maternal and child health in Sub Saharan Africa. Synthesizing the perspectives of community health workers’ perceived experience is crucial to inform decision makers, policy makers, and practitioners to address barriers to and scaleup facilitators of CHWs program to ensure maternal and child health equity and a resilience community health system. Methods The protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020206874). We will systematically conduct a literature search from inception in MEDLINE complete, EMBASE, CINAHL complete and Global Health for relevant studies. Eligible studies will be reports of original research, peer reviewed articles having a qualitative component (i.e., qualitative, mixed, or multi-method studies) on empowerment of CHWs associated with maternal and child health in the sub-Saharan Africa. Eligibility will be restricted to studies published in English. Two reviewers will independently screen all included abstracts and full-text articles. The primary outcome will be CHWs’ perceived barriers to and facilitators of effectiveness of community health workers in maternal and child health in sub-Saharan Africa. Study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using appropriate tools. Narrative analysis will be conducted, and narrative summary of findings will be presented. We will use the ‘best fit’ framework method as a systematic approach to analyzing the qualitative data. Discussion This study will systematically and comprehensively search literature and integrate evidence on perceived barriers to and facilitators of effectiveness of community health workers led maternal and child health program in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings will inform policy and practice on maternal and child health equity and a resilient communities health system. The resulting manuscript will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and at international and national conferences."
https://openalex.org/W4286217260,"Atherosclerotic risk starts at an early stage in adolescents and interventions on adolescents' lifestyles are most important. The pandemic of obesity-related morbidities like atherosclerosis among young adults and atherosclerotic risk factors for middle-aged adolescents in India is known. Yet, there is a lack of cost-effective and integrated intervention programs to treat this important health problem.The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 12-week structured interventional strategy program, containing integrated education and supervised physical activity interventions for middle-aged adolescents.This will be a school-based pre-experimental one-group pre-post time-series research design. The sample size is estimated to include 154 adolescents of 10th to 12th grade; aged 15-17 years will be grouped as a single arm. Data will be collected from July 2021 to January 2022. The intervention duration will be 3 months. The following measures will be evaluated before, during, and after intervention: knowledge, body mass index, level of physical activity, dietary habits, and sedentary activity.We believe that the structured interventional strategy approach which includes education related to atherosclerosis, physical activity, dietary habits, and sedentary activity, and cost-effective physical activity training will be more effective in preventing atherosclerotic-related changes among middle-aged adolescents. Further, this kind of approach may be applied in similar study areas elsewhere in India.Clinical Trials Registry-India (Registered Number: CTRI/2021/03/032271)."
