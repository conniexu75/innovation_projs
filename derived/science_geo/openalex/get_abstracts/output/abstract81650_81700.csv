https://openalex.org/W2062740562,"We have constructed an operational antigenic map of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus A/PR/8/34, which indicates the presence of five immunodominant antigenic regions exhibiting various degrees of operational linkage. These sites have been located by the identification of changed amino acid residues in mutant viruses that are antigenically altered at each site. Comparison of the antigenic features with the three-dimensional structure of the H3 subtype hemagglutinin shows that the antigenic sites correspond to four topographically distinct regions of the surface of the protein. One of the sites is formed when two regions that are widely separated in the hemagglutinin monomer associate in the assembled trimer. The location of the sites relative to those proposed for the H3 subtype hemagglutinin suggests that carbohydrate modulates the antigenicity of specific regions of the hemagglutinin."
https://openalex.org/W2106426729,"A new fractionation procedure separates a whole-cell HeLa extract into three components required for accurate in vitro transcription. One component (Sp1) is a promoter-specific factor required for transcription of the SV40 early and late promoters, but not for transcription of other promoters we have tested. The second component (Sp2) is a general factor required for transcription of the SV40 promoters and a series of others, including the adeno-virus 2 major late promoter, the human beta-globin promoter and the avian sarcoma virus promoter. The third component is a fraction containing the endogenous RNA polymerase II. When SV40 and adenovirus templates were present simultaneously in an in vitro transcription reaction, addition of the Sp1 factor stimulated SV40 early promoter transcription 40-fold, and inhibited adenovirus major late promoter transcription by 40%. This finding suggests that Sp1 is involved in promoter selection, and is not merely a general transcription stimulatory factor."
https://openalex.org/W1997469925,"The cytoskeletal proteins of cultured normal human mesothelial cells were found to consist of six major components, including actin, vimentin, the 40 kd keratin and the 44, 52 and 55 kd proteins, plus a minor 46 kd protein. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping and immunoprecipitation tests showed that the 40-55 kd mesothelial proteins are a family of keratins distinct in size, charge or peptide map from the ""epidermal keratins"" synthesized by cultured keratinocytes. Unique combinations of keratins from the epidermal and mesothelial keratin families were found to be synthesized by cultured bladder, esophageal, conjunctival, mammary, exocervical and ovarian surface epithelial cells. Mesothelial cells were the only epithelial cell type that synthesized vimentin at more than trace levels. We have also found that many carcinoma cell lines express keratins different from those of their cell type of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2069576619,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates the phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine when added to quiescent 3T3 cells, as evidenced by the increase in the amount of phosphotyrosine, relative to phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, in cellular proteins. The increase was detected within 1 min of adding PDGF and was maximal by 5 min. This effect showed the same dependence on PDGF concentration as did association of 125I-PDGF with the cells. In different 3T3 cell lines the magnitude of the increase was approximately proportional to the number of PDGF receptors per cell. A number of proteins phosphorylated at tyrosine in response to PDGF have been detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. They include a pair of related 45 kilodalton phosphoproteins, a pair of related 43 kilodalton phosphoproteins and a 42 kilodalton phosphoprotein. Similar changes were noted when quiescent 3T3 cells were incubated with epidermal growth factor. Possibly, these phosphoproteins are primary substrates of the tyrosine protein kinases activated by the receptors for PDGF and epidermal growth factor, and are involved in physiological effects common to the two growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2167051624,"We have determined the DNA sequence of a cloned cDNA that is complementary to the mRNA for the 50 kilodalton (kd) human epidermal keratin. This provides the first amino acid sequence for a cytoskeletal keratin. Comparison of this sequence with those of other keratins reveals an evolutionary relationship between the cytoskeletal and the microfibrillar keratins, but shows no homology to matrix or feather keratins. The 50 kd keratin shares 28%-30% homology with partial sequences of other intermediate filament proteins, which suggests that keratins may be the most distantly related members of this class of fibrous proteins. Our computer analyses predict that the 50 kd keratin contains two long alpha-helical domains separated by a cluster of helix-inhibitory residues in the middle of the protein. These findings indicate that despite major sequence divergence among intermediate filament proteins, they retain sequences compatible with secondary structural features that appear to be common to all of them."

https://openalex.org/W2038172020,"Splicing of transfer RNA precursors containing intervening sequences proceeds in two distinct stages: endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by ligation. We have physically separated endonuclease and ligase activities from extracts of yeast cells, and we report properties of the partially purified endonuclease preparation. The endonuclease behaves as an integral membrane protein: it is purified from a membrane fraction from which it can be solubilized with nonionic detergents, and the activity of the endonuclease in the membrane fraction is stimulated by nonionic detergents. The endonuclease cleaves precursor tRNAs at two sites to excise the intervening sequence precisely. Both the extent and the accuracy of cleavage are enhanced by the presence of spermidine; the degree of stimulation varies with the pre-tRNA substrate. The cleavage products possess 5′-hydroxyl and 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester termini. The cyclic phosphodiester termini can be opened to 2′-phosphates by a cyclic phosphodiesterase activity in the preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2066088682,"Polynucleotide templates containing C (cytidine) as the major component facilitate the synthesis of oligonucleotides from mixtures of the activated mononucleotide derivatives (as indicated by structure 1 in the text). A nucleotide is incorporated into oligomeric products if and only if its complement is present in the template. The reaction has a high fidelity and produces products with mean chain lengths of six to ten nucleotides. Bases other than guanosine are incorporated within oligomers or at their 3' termini, but rarely at their 5' termini."
https://openalex.org/W2033065494,"The eye lens contains a structural protein (alpha-crystallin), composed of two homologous primary gene products, alpha A2 and alpha B2. In certain rodents, there is another minor alpha-crystallin polypeptide, alpha Ains, which is identical to alpha A2 except for a 22 amino acid insert between residues 63 and 64 of the alpha A2 chain. Here we show that the mouse contains a single alpha A-crystallin gene, which has a 1376 bp intron separating codons 63 and 64 of the alpha A2-crystallin mRNA. A sequence encoding a 23 amino acid insert peptide was found 266 bp into the intron. The nucleotide borders of this sequence deviate from the AGGT consensus sequence. The DNA sequence encoding the insert peptide hybridizes to a cytoplasmic 14S RNA, demonstrating that it is transcribed in the lens. We propose that the murine alpha A2-crystallin gene generates both the alpha A2 and the alpha Ains mRNAs by alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2146975054,"The sigma subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase is encoded by the rpoD gene. Within the sequence upstream from rpoD, we have identified the structural genes rpsU and dnaG, which encode the 30S ribosomal protein S21 and DNA primase, respectively. The three genes are in the order rpsU, dnaG rpoD, and are all encoded by the same DNA strand. Analysis of in vivo transcripts from this region shows that these genes are all within the same operon. By correlating the 5' and 3' ends of in vivo transcripts with our DNA sequence, we have identified several regulatory features of the operon. These features include tandem promoters upstream from rpsU, a terminator between rpsU and dnaG, an RNA processing site separating dnaG and rpoD, and the operon terminator just downstream from rpoD. Immediately upstream of the operon promoters is an active promoter for an unidentified gene. We discuss the regulatory significance of the operon features and the biological significance of an operon encoding proteins essential for translation, replication and transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2070586783,"Contrary to previous predictions, relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. Peptides capable of eliciting protein-reactive serums are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals. As such, synthetic peptide immunogens are valuable for eliciting reagents with predetermined specificity that can be used for basic research. In addition, some synthetic peptides are capable of mimicking regions of virus proteins and eliciting immune responses in animals that are protective against the viral agents. Such peptides may thus serve as the basis for safe, chemically defined synthetic vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W1993970200,"Replication of Escherichia coli plasmid p15A was examined by use of a cell extract or a mixture of three purified E. coli enzymes: RNA polymerase; RNAase H; and DNA polymerase I. In each system, replication initiates at any of three consecutive nucleotides located at a unique site. Primer transcription starts 508 bp upstream of the replication origin. The region between 294 and 524 bp upstream of the origin determines the incompatibility property. This region specifies an RNA (RNA I) of about 105 nucleotides that is involved in regulation of primer formation. We compare the nucleotide sequences around the origins of related plasmids p15A, ColE1, pBR322, RSF1030 and CloDF13, and discuss the significance of possible RNA secondary structures in primer formation."

The induction process is controlled by the cytosolic Ah receptor. The cytosolic and nuclear Ah receptors were studied in the liver from inbred C57BL/6N (Ahb/Ahb) mice, inbred DBA/2N (Ahd/Ahd) mice and heterozygotes (Ahb/Ahd) and homozygotes (Ahd/Ahd) derived from the (C57BL/6N X DBA/2N)F1 X DBA/2N backcross. After [3H-1,6]-2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (3H-TCDD) is given in vivo, the receptor in Ahb/Anb and Ahb/Ahd mice is detectable in the cytoplasm and nucleus; in Ahd/Ahd mice the receptor is not measurable in the cytosol, but is found in the nucleus at levels one fourth to one fifth of those in Ahb/Ahb mice. P1-450 (23S) mRNA content was estimated by Northern hybridization and by Rot analysis with a mouse P1-450 cloned cDNA. An excellent dose-response relationship (r = 0.99) was found between the amount of 3H-TCDD-Ah receptor complex appearing in the nucleus and the quantity of P1-450 mRNA induced in mice with all three possible Ah genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1992603640,"We find that both human and rat U3 snRNA can function as self-priming templates for AMV reverse transcriptase in vitro. The 74 base cDNA is primed by the 3' end of intact U3 snRNA, and spans the characteristically truncated 69 or 70 base U3 sequence found in four different human U3 pseudogenes. The ability of human and rat U3 snRNA to self-prime is consistent with a U3 secondary structure model derived by a comparison between rat U3 snRNA and the homologous D2 snRNA from Dictyostelium discoideum. We propose that U3 pseudogenes are generated in vivo by integration of a self-primed cDNA copy of U3 snRNA at new chromosomal sites. We also consider the possibility that the same cDNA mediates gene conversion at the 5' end of bona fide U3 genes where, over the entire region spanned by the U3 cDNA, the two rat U3 sequence variants U3A and U3B are identical."
https://openalex.org/W2080301359,"The distribution of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles containing U snRNAs (U snRNPs) during oogenesis and early development in Xenopus was analyzed with a lupus antibody (anti-Sm) that reacts with snRNA-binding proteins. Fully grown oocytes and embryos prior to gastrulation were found to be relatively depleted of U snRNPs in their nuclei and to contain an excess of snRNA-binding proteins stored in the cytoplasm. During late blastula-early gastrula, or after microinjection of U snRNAs into the cytoplasm of a mature oocyte, the proteins migrate into the nucleus. Dot hybridization analysis showed that small previtellogenic oocytes already contain a maximal amount of U1 (and U2) snRNAs, which then decreases to about 20% of that value in fully mature oocytes, even though the cell's volume has increased enormously. Thus fully grown oocytes and eggs accumulate snRNA-binding proteins for use during early development, but this is not coupled with the accumulation of U snRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2003772918,"Transplantation of bone marrow can give rise to graft-versus-host desease when donor T lymphocytes; mismatched with the host for major histocompatability (MHC) antigens, become sensitized and attack host tissues. However, graft-versus-host desease can also arise between donor and host with compatible MHC antigens but mismatched for a minor histocompatability antigen1–3. We report here on the occurrence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease in a male patient with acute myeloid leukaemia who had received bone marrow matched for MHC (HLA) antigens from his sister. Strong cytotoxicity of the post-transplantation (that is, donor) lymphocytes against the patient's pretransplantation lymphocytes was found. Thus, the transplanted lymphocytes differed in a non-HLA antigen from the patient. The possible role of this strong cytotoxic minor histocompatability antigen in the development of graft-versus-host disease in man is being evaluated. Furthermore, with the use of cytotoxic T-cell lines, derived from the patient's 6 day effector cells, we are now able to type for it before grafting."

https://openalex.org/W2047288515,"Anti-Ro autoantibodies precipitate several small cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins from mammalian cells. The RNA components of these particles, designated hY1-hY5 in human cells and mY1 and mY2 in mouse cells, are about 100 nucleotides long. We have analyzed a genomic clone that appears to contain true RNA-coding regions for two of the human Ro RNAs, hY1 and hY3. These RNAs exhibit many sequence and secondary structure homologies, both with each other and with the recently sequenced hY5 RNA. The hY2 RNA is a slightly truncated form of hY1; several shorter versions of hY3 are also detected in cell extracts and immunoprecipitates. The human hY1 and hY3 genes cross-hybridize with the mouse Ro RNAs, mY1 and mY2, respectively; we show that the mouse Ro RNAs are exclusively contained in Ro particles. The genes for hY1 and hY3 are transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III. In contrast with all other mammalian class III genes described, they appear to be present as single copies in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1583307424,"The ribonuclease activity of the cytotoxic protein alpha-sarcin has been characterized. When rat liver ribosomes or 60 S ribosomal subunits were the substrates, alpha-sarcin cleaved a single oligonucleotide of about 488 residues, the alpha-fragment, from the 3' end of 28 S rRNA. In contrast, 40 S ribosomal subunits were not affected by alpha-sarcin. The alpha-fragment was cleaved from 28 S rRNA in 80 S ribosomes when the concentration of alpha-sarcin was 3 x 10(-8) M and the toxin retained its specificity even when the concentration was 3 x 10(-5) M. The turnover number (kcat) for the reaction of alpha-sarcin with ribosomes was 55 min-1, establishing that the toxin acts catalytically. When total rRNA or 28 S rRNA was the substrate, alpha-sarcin caused extensive progressive digestion of the nucleic acids; however, no formation of the alpha-fragment occurred. The extent of the digestion of 28 S rRNA was related to the concentration of alpha-sarcin, but the amount of the toxin required was somewhat greater than that needed with ribosomes. Digestion of homopolynucleotides with alpha-sarcin indicated that the protein is specific for purines. When [32P]5 S rRNA was the substrate, alpha-sarcin cleaved on the 3' side of purines in both single- and double-stranded regions of the molecule. The results suggest that the unusual specificity of alpha-sarcin, in that it cleaves only one of more than 7000 phosphodiester bonds in the ribosome, is a property both of the cytotoxin and of the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1986327332,"Abstract Two cloned tRNA genes that contain intervening sequences, yeast tRNA UCG Ser and Xenopus laevis tRNA Tyr , were transcribed in HeLa cell extract. Precursor tRNAs were formed, and were converted to spliced products by a process of excision-ligation. The novel sequences resulting from ligation of tRNA half-molecules were examined by fingerprinting and nearest neighbor analyses. The results indicate that during tRNA splicing in HeLa cell extract, the 3′-terminal phosphate of the 5′ half-molecule is incorporated into a normal 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkage that forms the splice junction. This ligation pathway in HeLa cell extract is distinct from the one described previously in wheat germ extract, which involves formation of 2′-phosphomonoester, 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkage with the 3′,5′-bond derived from a 5′-terminal phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2042103412,"Cultured cell Triton cytoskeletons enriched in intermediate filaments by extraction in high and low salt show, in addition to known intermediate-filament proteins and actin, a few other tenaciously bound polypeptides. An antibody raised against one of these polypeptides (IEF 24) is shown to react specifically with mitochondria of different cell types. With methanol-acetone fixation, required for the antibody reaction, the characteristically long mitochondria of human skin fibroblasts fragment into strings of beads, as identified by antibody staining in the light microscope and whole-mount electron microscopy. From the colinear organization of these beads, their codistribution with the intermediate-filament network and their retention in salt-extracted cytoskeletons, it is suggested that a subpopulation of the intermediate filaments can serve as an anchorage site for mitochondria."

Oral administration of α-difluoromethyl ornithine suppressed B16 melanoma development in mice 85 percent whereas interferon given subcutaneously inhibited tumor growth only 24 percent. Total or near total suppression of tumor growth was observed in mice receiving both treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2094361328,"The effects of skin-tumor-promoting and -nonpromoting agents on the kinetics of terminal differentiation of subpopulations of keratinocytes differing in buoyant density isolated from mice (SENCAR) that are very sensitive to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion were investigated. Topical pretreatment of dorsal skin with complete (TPA), first-stage (calcium ionophore A23187) and second-stage (mezerein) tumor promoters, but not the hyperplastic agent ethylphenylpropiolate, accelerated the rate of terminal differentiation of keratinocytes with densities less than 1.074 g/cm3, but had little effect on cells with a greater density. Within 8.5 hr of TPA treatment, a period preceding mitosis, a large percentage of the most dense basal-cell keratinocytes (greater than or equal to 1.074 g/cm3) were converted to cells with a lower density, with a reduced plating efficiency and with an increased rate of differentiation, suggesting that TPA induces a subpopulation of basal cells to commit to terminal differentiation, and accelerates the rate of differentiation of committed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990743719,"The linear extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA of Tetrahymena is generated from a single integrated copy during macronuclear development. The free ends of this extrachromosomal gene contain 20-70 tandem repeats of the hexanucleotide CCCCAA. We have determined the nucleotide sequence at the same (3') end of the single, integrated micronuclear gene. In contrast to the extrachromosomal gene, only a single CCCCAA sequence was found at this position. The same result was obtained from two independently isolated DNA clones, and was therefore not likely an artifact of cloning. Comparisons of the genomic DNA with the cloned fragment by Southern hybridization also supported this argument. Thus the tandemly repetitive hexanucleotide at the free ends of the extrachromosomal rDNA is not an inherited feature, and must be generated during the development of the macronucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2031011892,"Formation of the RNA primer for CoIE1 DNA replication is inhibited by random substitution of less than one tenth of G residues by I residues during in vitro transcription. Substitution in any one of several regions of the transcript is inhibitory, even in the region more than 400 nucleotides upstream of the origin of DNA replication. The inhibition results from interference with hybrid formation between nascent RNA II (primer transcript) and the template DNA near the replication origin. Association of RNA I with RNA II, which has been known to inhibit primer formation, enhances pausing of transcription of RNA II at a site far downstream of the region where RNA I hybridizes to the transcript. A large deletion in the region which specifies both RNA I and RNA II suppresses primer formation and also enhances pausing of transcription at the same site. These results show that the secondary structure of RNA II during transcription is important for primer formation and that alteration in the structure of the nascent transcript can change transcriptional events far downstream."
https://openalex.org/W2078951223,"We examined the molecular basis of modulation of transfected herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) gene in mouse fibroblasts. We observed that one tk+ cell line is capable of reversion to a tk- phenotype, and rereverts to a tk+ phenotype at high frequencies (5%). The revertants lacked tk enzyme activity and tk-specific transcripts. We detected no differences in the organization of foreign DNA or in the CpG methylation patterns in the revertants and rerevertants. We probed the chromatin structure of the revertants and rerevertants, and found the tk sequences in the rerevertants to be more highly sensitive to digestion with DNAase I than the corresponding revertant cells. We conclude that the high frequency switching of gene expression we observed is mediated by changes in chromatin structure, and that this may reflect the behavior of the host sequences at the site of foreign DNA integration."
https://openalex.org/W2086467423,"Cell lineage tracer dyes rhodamine-D-peptide and fluorescein-D-peptide were used to study the development of segmentation in embryos of the leech Helobdella triserialis. The earliest overt manifestation of segmentation is in the mesodermal cell layer of the germinal bands, where a repeating pattern of nearly isomorphic mesoblast clusters is seen at an early stage of development. With joint use of both lineage tracers, it is shown that each mesoblast cluster is a clone derived from a single primary mesoblast, as well as being the precursor to an adult mesodermal hemisegment. Not all of the primary mesoblasts give rise to hemisegments, however. Cell clones derived from the first primary mesoblasts produced contribute to the nonmetameric prostomial region, whereas the last primary mesoblasts produced appear to be supernumerary."
https://openalex.org/W2024391192,"The distribution of keratin intermediate filaments, previously considered static in organization and imperturbable by conventional drugs used to alter the structure and organization of the cytoskeleton, can be altered significantly by treatment with colchicine and cytochalasin D. The loss of microfilaments and microtubules converts the keratin cytoskeleton from a branching, even distribution to a series of starlike structures whose filaments are maintained by multiple membrane attachment sites. These findings provide a means for manipulating cytokeratin organization to investigate the role of keratins in cytoskeletal structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2144069497,"Synthesis of α2u globulin, previously thought to occur only in the male rat liver, has now been demonstrated in the submaxillary salivary gland. Unlike liver, submaxillary synthesis of α2u globulin mRNA is constitutive—that is, independent of the endocrine state, age and sex. Liver and submaxillary α2u globulin mRNAs are of similar size, and their 5′ ends map to the same region of the gene. Isoelectric focusing of in vitro translation products revealed that submaxillary mRNA encodes a more acidic subset of α2u globulins than does liver. Salivary α2u globulin mRNA manifests 5% nucleotide divergence, encoding 20 amino acid substitutions, which specifies a more acidic polypeptide than its hepatic counterpart. Thus the liver and submaxillary gland synthesize α2u globulin from different sets of genes that are subject to very different developmental and hormonal control."

https://openalex.org/W2154349481,"Immune precipitation assays with antibodies specific for 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (m2,2,7(3)G) have been used to study the accessibility of the 5'-terminal m2,2,7(3)G-containing caps of eucaryotic small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) either as naked RNAs or in intact small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNPs). The antibody selectively precipitates snRNA species U1a, U1b, U2, U4, and U5 from total deproteinized RNA isolated from Ehrlich ascites cells. Binding by the antibody occurs via the m2,2,7(3)G moiety of the snRNAs' caps, since complex formation with the antibody can be completely abolished by excess nucleoside m2,2,7(3)G. The specificity of the antibody is further demonstrated by the complete absence of reaction with deproteinized snRNA species U6, the 5' terminus of which does not contain m2,2,7(3)G. Most importantly, the cap structures of the snRNAs U1a, U1b, U2, U4, and U5 are also accessible for anti-m2,2,7(3)G IgGs when intact snRNPs are reacted with the antibody. In this case, snRNP species U6 is coprecipitated, suggesting that there are intermolecular interactions between this and other snRNPs. Our data demonstrate that the 5'-terminal regions of the above snRNAs are not protected by the snRNP proteins. This finding is of special interest for snRNP species U1, and is discussed in terms of a model which proposes that the 5'-terminal region of U1 participates in the proper alignment of splice junctions in eucaryotic pre-mRNAs (Lerner, M. R., Boyle, J.A., Mount, S.M., Wolin, S.L., and Steitz, J. A. (1980) Nature (Lond.) 283, 220-224)."
https://openalex.org/W2128480231,"Drosophila hydei clones representing transcribed middle-repetitive sequences from four of six major lampbrush loops of the Y chromosome were isolated. Sequences homologous to each clone are clustered in a particular locus on the Y chromosome, but additional euchromatic sites were found for one of the transcribed clones. In situ hybridization to lampbrush-loops RNA permitted the identification of clones homologous with the two ""nooses"" loops on YS and with the ""clubs"" and ""tubular ribbons"" on the YL arm. Loop-specific nuclear RNA molecules range in size from 10S to 60S. Loop RNA is accumulated in the nucleus and remains attached to the loops during the course of primary spermatocyte growth. It disappears, however, along with the loop structures, during the first meiotic prophase. The structure and function of the Y chromosome and its lampbrush loops are briefly considered in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W155814782,"The parotid gland of the aged rat provides an example of an altered alpha 1-adrenergic physiologic response (K+ efflux) resulting from a postreceptor perturbation in signal transduction mechanisms (Ito, H., Baum, B. J., Uchida, T., Hoopes, M. T., Bodner, L. & Roth, G. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9532-9538). This alteration in gland function can be completely circumvented by eliciting K+ efflux via the Ca2+-ionophore, A23187, at several Ca2+ concentrations (ibid.). Since Ca2+ is purported to mediate other secretory events in the rat parotid, we have probed neurotransmitter regulated Ca2+ mobilization and secretory mechanisms in this tissue by employing an aging paradigm. The responses studied were alpha-adrenergic- and muscarinic-cholinergic-mediated K+ efflux, 45Ca2+ release, and amylase secretion. No differences were detected between young (3 months) and old (24 months) cell preparations for any muscarinic-cholinergic agonist-induced response studied. Following alpha-adrenergic stimulation, K+ efflux and 45Ca2+ release from old cell preparations were reduced markedly, while no changes were found for the amylase secretion response. These results suggest that 1) alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic signal transduction mechanisms for K+ efflux and 45Ca2+ release are dissociated in cells of the rat parotid gland, and 2) following alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation, signal transduction likely proceeds by at least two pathways, one which is apparently involved in protein excytosis (intact in cells from old rats) and the other which is apparently involved in K+ efflux and 45Ca2+ release (perturbed in old cells)."

Analysis of these mutants and of others that were isolated earlier indicates that crucial sequences for both translational feedback regulation and efficient translation lie closely intermingled in the central region of the rpIJ mRNA leader 70-195 bases upstream from the translation start of rpIJ. We suggest that our point mutations define a region of the rpIJ leader mRNA to which L10 binds in effecting autogenous translational regulation.

Minor components which are related to Hb F and Hb A are also present and show reciprocal rise and fall. The baboon produces two types of gamma chain presumably from nonallelic genes. These have either an isoleucyl (I gamma) or a valyl (V gamma) residue in position 75. As in the human case with G gamma and A gamma chains, the ratio I gamma to V gamma chains changes during the postnatal switch. Production of Hb F in the baboon may be stimulated by phenylhydrazine or more effectively by 5-azacytidine. With phenylhydrazine, the ratio of I gamma to V gamma chains in the Hb F is the same as in the traces of Hb F in the juvenile or adult baboon. However, with 5-azacytidine, at least some of the Hb F that is produced probably has been synthesized with an I gamma to V gamma ratio that is present prenatally and in the newborn baboon."
