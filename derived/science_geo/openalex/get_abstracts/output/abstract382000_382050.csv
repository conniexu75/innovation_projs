https://openalex.org/W2107705106,"Global sea levels have risen through the 20th century. These rises will almost certainly accelerate through the 21st century and beyond because of global warming, but their magnitude remains uncertain. Key uncertainties include the possible role of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets and the amplitude of regional changes in sea level. In many areas, nonclimatic components of relative sea-level change (mainly subsidence) can also be locally appreciable. Although the impacts of sea-level rise are potentially large, the application and success of adaptation are large uncertainties that require more assessment and consideration."

Unfortunately, this selectivity has evolved for cellular purposes and may not promote the sorts of reactions chemists are seeking to enhance (see the Perspective by Lutz ). Siegel et al. (p. 309 ) now describe the design of enzymes that catalyze the bimolecular Diels-Alder reaction, a carbon-carbon bond formation reaction that is central to organic synthesis but unknown in natural metabolism. The enzymes display high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity, and an x-ray structure of the most active enzyme confirms that the structure matches the design. Savile et al. (p. 305 , published online 17 June) applied a directed evolution approach to modify an existing transaminase enzyme so that it recognized a complex ketone in place of its smaller native substrate, and could tolerate the high temperature and organic cosolvent necessary to dissolve this ketone. This biocatalytic reaction improved the production efficiency of a drug that treats diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2016681947,"Hot on the Trail Solar cells essentially operate by absorbing light, which needs to be above a certain energy threshold. The absorbed light then liberates charges within the solar cell to carry electrical current. Unfortunately, the liberated charges behave the same way whether they are excited right at the threshold (e.g., by visible light) or well above it (by ultraviolet light), which leads to any excess energy being dissipated as waste heat. Tisdale et al. (p. 1543 ) have documented a potential first step toward resolving this inefficiency. Specifically, electrons excited by light absorption in lead selenide nanocrystals were able to migrate to an adjacent titanium dioxide surface without releasing their excess energy to heat. The next step will be to devise a means of harnessing the stored energy in a circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2143757924,"From Superfluid to Mott Insulator One of the most attractive characteristics of cold atomic gases in optical lattices is their ability to simulate condensed-matter systems. The results of these quantum simulations are usually averaged over the atomic ensemble, or course-grained over several lattice sites. Now, Bakr et al. (p. 547 , published online 17 June; see the Perspective by DeMarco ) provide a single lattice site view onto the transition of a Bose gas of Rb-87 from the superfluid to the Mott-insulating state. Characteristic concentric shells of uniform number density were observed deep in the Mott insulator regime, and probing the local quantum dynamics revealed unexpectedly short time scales. The low-defect Mott structures identified may provide a starting point for quantum magnetism experiments."

These cell types form a collective dynamic representation of our position as we move through the environment. How this representation is formed has remained a mystery. Is it acquired, or are we born with the ability to represent external space (see the Perspective by Palmer and Lynch )? Langston et al. (p. 1576 ) and Wills et al. (p. 1573 ) investigated the early development of spatial activity in the hippocampal formation and the entorhinal cortex of rat pups when they first began to explore their environment. Rudiments of place cells, head direction cells, and grid cells already existed when the pups made their first movements out of the nest. A neural representation of external space at this early time points to strong innate components for perception of space. These findings provide experimental support for Kant's 200-year-old concept of space as an a priori faculty of the mind."
https://openalex.org/W2032964111,"Close, But Not Too Close MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in plants are generally highly complementary to their target RNAs, yet, in most animal miRNAs, only the ∼8-nucleotide “seeds” sequence bases pair fully with the target, with few base pairs between the remainder of the miRNA and target. Plant miRNAs are methylated at their 3′ ends, whereas animals' miRNAs are not. Ameres et al. (p. 1534 ; see the Perspective by Pasquinelli ) noticed that, in fruit flies, miRNAs engineered to have high complementarity to target RNAs were present at reduced levels. These miRNAs were trimmed and uridylated at their 3′ ends, features involved in RNA degradation. Fly small interfering RNAs, all of which are methylated at their 3′ ends, were unaffected, unless the methylating enzyme, Hen1, was mutated. Thus, 3′-methylation may prevent complementarity-driven remodeling and degradation of small RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2078003979,"The plasticity of ageing suggests that longevity may be controlled epigenetically by specific alterations in chromatin state. The link between chromatin and ageing has mostly focused on histone deacetylation by the Sir2 family, but less is known about the role of other histone modifications in longevity. Histone methylation has a crucial role in development and in maintaining stem cell pluripotency in mammals. Regulators of histone methylation have been associated with ageing in worms and flies, but characterization of their role and mechanism of action has been limited. Here we identify the ASH-2 trithorax complex, which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), as a regulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans in a directed RNA interference (RNAi) screen in fertile worms. Deficiencies in members of the ASH-2 complex-ASH-2 itself, WDR-5 and the H3K4 methyltransferase SET-2-extend worm lifespan. Conversely, the H3K4 demethylase RBR-2 is required for normal lifespan, consistent with the idea that an excess of H3K4 trimethylation-a mark associated with active chromatin-is detrimental for longevity. Lifespan extension induced by ASH-2 complex deficiency requires the presence of an intact adult germline and the continuous production of mature eggs. ASH-2 and RBR-2 act in the germline, at least in part, to regulate lifespan and to control a set of genes involved in lifespan determination. These results indicate that the longevity of the soma is regulated by an H3K4 methyltransferase/demethylase complex acting in the C. elegans germline."
https://openalex.org/W2055211442,"In animal cells, the primary cilium transduces extracellular signals through signaling receptors localized in the ciliary membrane, but how these ciliary membrane proteins are retained in the cilium is unknown. We found that ciliary membrane proteins were highly mobile, but their diffusion was impeded at the base of the cilium by a diffusion barrier. Septin 2 (SEPT2), a member of the septin family of guanosine triphosphatases that form a diffusion barrier in budding yeast, localized at the base of the ciliary membrane. SEPT2 depletion resulted in loss of ciliary membrane protein localization and Sonic hedgehog signal transduction, and inhibited ciliogenesis. Thus, SEPT2 is part of a diffusion barrier at the base of the ciliary membrane and is essential for retaining receptor-signaling pathways in the primary cilium."
https://openalex.org/W2031176852,"T cells transformed by Herpesvirus saimiri express seven viral U-rich noncoding RNAs of unknown function called HSURs. We noted that conserved sequences in HSURs 1 and 2 constitute potential binding sites for three host-cell microRNAs (miRNAs). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that HSURs 1 and 2 interact with the predicted miRNAs in virally transformed T cells. The abundance of one of these miRNAs, miR-27, is dramatically lowered in transformed cells, with consequent effects on the expression of miR-27 target genes. Transient knockdown and ectopic expression of HSUR 1 demonstrate that it directs degradation of mature miR-27 in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner. This viral strategy illustrates use of a ncRNA to manipulate host-cell gene expression via the miRNA pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2164012871,"Fat's Mixed Messages Certain metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, are more prone to arise in obese individuals, a link that has been attributed, in part, to the detrimental activities of adipokines—proteins secreted by fat cells. Most adipokines disrupt glucose homeostasis by promoting inflammation and insulin resistance. Ouchi et al. (p. 454 , published online 17 June; see the Perspective by Oh and Olefsky ) identify a new adipokine, secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5), which has the opposite effect: It is anti-inflammatory and appears to promote metabolic health. In obese mice, Sfrp5 suppresses the activation of key inflammatory cells (macrophages) residing within adipose tissue by inhibiting the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Further study of this Sfrp5-JNK1 regulatory axis in fat may offer therapeutic opportunities for obesity-linked metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2069277514,"The emergence of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza demonstrated that pandemic viruses could be generated in swine. Subsequent reintroduction of H1N1/2009 to swine has occurred in multiple countries. Through systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in swine from a Hong Kong abattoir, we characterize a reassortant progeny of H1N1/2009 with swine viruses. Swine experimentally infected with this reassortant developed mild illness and transmitted infection to contact animals. Continued reassortment of H1N1/2009 with swine influenza viruses could produce variants with transmissibility and altered virulence for humans. Global systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in swine is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2063603732,"Birth of the Cool Over the past 4 million years or so, tropical sea surface temperatures have experienced a cooling trend (see the Perspective by Philander ). Herbert et al. (p. 1530 ) analyzed sea surface temperature records of the past 3.5 million years from low-latitude sites spanning the world's major ocean basins in order to determine the timing and magnitude of the cooling that has accompanied the intensification of Northern Hemisphere ice ages since the Pliocene. Martínez-Garcia et al. (p. 1550 ) found that the enigmatic eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue, a feature one might not expect to find in such a warm region receiving so much sunlight, first appeared between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago. Its appearance was probably in response to a general shrinking of the tropical warm water pool caused by general climate cooling driven by changes in Earth's orbit."
https://openalex.org/W2036583346,"The control of RNA alternative splicing is critical for generating biological diversity. Despite emerging genome-wide technologies to study RNA complexity, reliable and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks have not been defined. Here, we used Bayesian networks to probabilistically model diverse data sets and predict the target networks of specific regulators. We applied this strategy to identify approximately 700 alternative splicing events directly regulated by the neuron-specific factor Nova in the mouse brain, integrating RNA-binding data, splicing microarray data, Nova-binding motifs, and evolutionary signatures. The resulting integrative network revealed combinatorial regulation by Nova and the neuronal splicing factor Fox, interplay between phosphorylation and splicing, and potential links to neurologic disease. Thus, we have developed a general approach to understanding mammalian RNA regulation at the systems level."
https://openalex.org/W2144254612,"Going Down the Tube Two pillars of modern physics are quantum mechanics and general relativity. So far, both have remained apart with no quantum mechanical description of gravity available. Van Zoest et al. (p. 1540 ; see the Perspective by Nussenzveig and Barata ) present work with a macroscopic quantum mechanical system—a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of rubidium atoms in which the cloud of atoms is cooled into a collective quantum state—in microgravity. By dropping the BEC down a 146-meter-long drop chamber and monitoring the expansion of the quantum gas under these microgravity conditions, the authors provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of a technique that can probe the boundary of quantum mechanics and general relativity and perhaps offer the opportunity to reconcile the two experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2118301585,"For the past several decades, oceanographers have embraced the dominant paradigm that the ocean’s meridional overturning circulation operates like a conveyor belt, transporting cold waters equatorward at depth and warm waters poleward at the surface. Within this paradigm, the conveyor, driven by changes in deepwater production at high latitudes, moves deep waters and their attendant properties continuously along western boundary currents and returns surface waters unimpeded to deepwater formation sites. A number of studies conducted over the past few years have challenged this paradigm by revealing the vital role of the ocean’s eddy and wind fields in establishing the structure and variability of the ocean’s overturning. Here, we review those studies and discuss how they have collectively changed our view of the simple conveyor-belt model."
https://openalex.org/W2109057110,"Niemann-Pick type C1 disease is an autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disorder. Loss of function of the npc1 gene leads to abnormal accumulation of free cholesterol and sphingolipids within the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments resulting in progressive neurodegeneration and dysmyelination. Here, we show that oligodendroglial cells secrete cholesterol by exosomes when challenged with cholesterol or U18666A, which induces late endosomal cholesterol accumulation. Up-regulation of exosomal cholesterol release was also observed after siRNA-mediated knockdown of NPC1 and in fibroblasts derived from NPC1 patients and could be reversed by expression of wild-type NPC1. We provide evidence that exosomal cholesterol secretion depends on the presence of flotillin. Our findings indicate that exosomal release of cholesterol may serve as a cellular mechanism to partially bypass the traffic block that results in the toxic lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C1 disease. Furthermore, we suggest that secretion of cholesterol by exosomes contributes to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

Furthermore, we suggest that secretion of cholesterol by exosomes contributes to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Exosomes are small vesicles of 50–100-nm diameter that are secreted by a variety of cell types. They are generated by inward budding of the late endosomal membrane, which gives rise to intraluminal vesicles within late endosomes. After accumulation of intraluminal vesicles, these compartments are termed multivesicular bodies (MVBs). 2The abbreviations used are: MVBmultivesicular bodyCRACcholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid motifsERendoplasmic reticulummβ-CDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinNPCNiemann-Pick CPLPproteolipid proteinmβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinEGFPenhanced GFPNPC diseaseNiemann-Pick type C diseaseflot-2flotillin-2. MVBs can either be routed to lysosomes for degradation or fuse with the plasma membrane to discharge their intraluminal vesicles as exosomes to the extracellular space. The mechanisms that regulate the sorting of proteins to late endosomes and intraluminal vesicles and the segregation between lysosomal degradation and exocytic release are poorly understood, as are the factors that regulate the rate of exosome secretion (1van Niel G.

Reticulocytes utilize exosomes to dispose plasma membrane and cytosol during their maturation to erythrocytes (8Johnstone R.M. Mathew A. Mason A.B. Teng K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Exosomes are enriched in cholesterol; e.g. B lymphocytes release exosomes with a cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio approximately three times higher compared with the parent cell membrane (9Wubbolts R. Leckie R.S. Veenhuizen P.T. Schwarzmann G. Möbius W. Hoernschemeyer J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10963-10972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether exosomes might contribute to the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis by exosomal egress of cholesterol from the cell. The tight regulation of cellular cholesterol is crucial for the structure, biophysical properties, and function of membranes. Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by a balance between efflux, uptake, and endogenous synthesis of cholesterol (10Vance J.E. Hayashi H. Karten B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sterols derive from mevalonate and are synthesized from isopentyl phosphate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from where they are transported to the plasma membrane by a nonvesicular, energy-dependent mechanism. Exogenous cholesterol is either taken up via receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL particles or by bulk flow endocytosis. LDL-derived sterol esters are hydrolyzed by acid lipase in acidic endosomal compartments, and free cholesterol is transported to late endosomes/lysosomes. From there, cholesterol egresses to various destinations, including the ER, trans-Golgi network, mitochondria, and plasma membrane (10Vance J.E. Hayashi H. Karten B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Ohgami N. Yamauchi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The exit of free cholesterol from late endosomal/lysosomal compartments depends on two proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, that bind and transfer cholesterol (12Infante R.E. Wang M.L. Radhakrishnan A. Kwon H.J.

Acta. 2004; 1685: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutations in Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) result in accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids within the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, preferentially of brain, liver, and spleen (14Chang T.Y.

Clinically, the storage disease is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and extensive dysmyelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) (15Vanier M.T. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C.

However, the exact mechanism of how defects in NPC1 or NPC2 are detrimental to the cell is still unclear. A loss of function defect with diminished cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane and a gain of function effect with toxicity caused by late endosomal cholesterol accumulation have both been discussed (16Sturley S.L. Patterson M.C. Balch W. Liscum L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we show that exosomes can shuttle cholesterol out of the cell and partially bypass the late endosomal trapping of cholesterol observed in NPC disease. The following plasmids were used: GFP-rab4, GFP-rab5, GFP-rab7 (M. Zerial, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany), MLV Gag-GFP (Addgene plasmid 1813, W. Mothes, Yale University School of Medicine), pR4-PLP-myc, Flotillin-1-GFP, Flotillin-2-GFP, and Flotillin-2-RFP (L. Rajendran, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany), EGFP-CD63 (D. Cutler, University College, London, UK), and pEYFP-His6-wtNPC1, pEYFP-His6-NPC1 P692S (M. Scott, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Flotillin-2 CRAC mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce Y124G, Y163G, and the Y124G/Y163G double mutant according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, CA). Primary antibodies were: anti-Myc (monoclonal IgG, Cell Signaling), mouse monoclonal antibodies against flotillin-1 and flotillin-2, monoclonal rat anti-LAMP-1 (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-NPC1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam), mouse anti-tsg 101 (anti-tumor susceptibility gene 101) (Abcam), mouse anti-alix (BD Biosciences). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Dianova, Invitrogen, and GE Healthcare. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed according to a standard protocol. For filipin labeling, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before staining with filipin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. The oligodendroglial precursor cell line Oli-neu was provided by J. Trotter, University of Mainz, Germany, and cultured as described (17Fitzner D. Schneider A. Kippert A. Möbius W. Willig K.I. Hell S.W. Bunt G. Gaus K. Simons M.

Filipin stainings of cultured cells were performed as described and showed a “variant” filipin phenotype in the patient, suggesting moderate cholesterol enrichment (15Vanier M.T.

Molecular genetic analysis of the full coding region of npc1 revealed compound heterozygosity for npc1 mutations p.P1007A (c.3019C>G) in exon 20 and p.R934X (c.2800C>T) in exon 19 of the npc1 gene. Analysis with patient material was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Heidelberg. Both subjects enrolled gave their written informed consent. Fibroblast cultures were cultivated in DMEM, 10% FCS. Wild-type and CT43 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were kindly provided by T. Y. Chang (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) and cultivated in DMEM, 10% FCS. The CT43 line contains a truncation mutation in the NPC1 protein after amino acid 933, which results in a complete loss of NPC1 function (19Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of Oli-neu or CHO cells were performed with FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) or TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA oligonucleotides were delivered into Oli-neu cells by electroporation with a basic neuron kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). Nucleofection was repeated after 48 h, and experiments were performed after an additional 48 h period. The following siRNAs were used: mouse flotillin-2, GUUCAUGGCAGACACCAAdTdT (Qiagen); mouse NPC1:_Mn_NPC1–1 predesigned siRNA (Qiagen). Control siRNA was obtained from Ambion (Austin) (Control siRNA #1). All experiments were carried out in lipoprotein-free serum (LPS)-supplemented medium (Sigma). For acute cholesterol depletion, cells were washed 3 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by a 2-h incubation with 1 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C. For inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, we preincubated cells with medium supplemented with LPS for 24 h. Cells were subsequently treated with 4 μm simvastatin plus 50 μm l-mevalonate to maintain geranylation and farnesylation over a time period of 16 h. Free cholesterol was added to the cells at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml as mβCD complex (Sigma) saturated with 10 μg/ml cholesterol dissolved in ethanol (final concentration of ethanol 0.1%). Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor CP-113.818 was kindly provided by Pfizer and added to the cells at a final concentration of 10 μm. U18666A was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting) to treat cells at a final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml for 16 h in normal growth medium. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica DMRXA microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 63× oil plan-apochromat objective (NA 1.4; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Image processing and analysis were performed using Meta Imaging Series 6.1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Fluorescence intensities were quantified as reported previously by Metamorph Imaging software (20Trajkovic K. Dhaunchak A.S. Goncalves J.T. Wenzel D. Schneider A. Bunt G. Nave K.A. Simons M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy analysis, exosomes were prepared from Oli-neu cells. and the 100,000 × g fraction was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The fraction was adsorbed to glow-discharged Formvar-carbon-coated copper grids by floating the grid for 10 min on 5-μl droplets on Parafilm. The grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate containing 0.7 m oxalate, pH 7.0, and imaged with a LEO EM912 Omega electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen). Digital micrographs were obtained with an on-axis 2048 × 2048 CCD camera (Proscan, Scheuring). To quantify flotillin distribution, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunostained for flotillin. Confocal images were taken with identical acquisition parameters, and fluorescence intensities of cell-membrane versus intracellular vesicular flotillin were measured by Metamorph software as described previously (21Schneider A. Rajendran L. Honsho M. Gralle M. Donnert G. Wouters F. Hell S.W. Simons M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The ratio of cytosolic/total fluorescence intensity was calculated for each cell. Exosomes were prepared as described previously (22Trajkovic K. Hsu C. Chiantia S. Rajendran L. Wenzel D. Wieland F. Schwille P. Brügger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on plastic dishes. The medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution before the addition of serum-free medium for a time period of 4–16 h. Culture media was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g followed by centrifugation twice at 4,000 × g and one 30-min 10,000 × g centrifugation step before a 1-h ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were incubated with the respective primary and secondary antibodies, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The corresponding parent cells were scraped into lysis buffer (1% CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and the postnuclear supernatants were dissolved into sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. The blots were scanned and quantified by ImageJ to calculate the ratio of protein in the exosomal versus the total cellular fraction. Exosomes were purified from culture medium through a sequence of centrifugation steps as described above. For sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, the 100,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (total of 8 fractions, each 400 μl, 0.25–2.5 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After 18 h of centrifugation at 200,000 × g (SW60 rotor; Beckman Instruments), each fraction was diluted 1:6 with PBS, and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pelleted material from each fraction was resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Exosome fractions and the corresponding cell lysates were resuspended in equal amounts of cold Tris-EDTA buffer, and cholesterol was extracted. Briefly, lanosterol was added as an internal standard for quantification, and samples were kept at 4 °C for 30 min with methanol/chloroform under constant shaking. After the addition of chloroform and H2O, the mixture was left on ice for another 15 min before centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C and 13,000 × g. The lower organic phase was transferred to a glass tube, dried under streaming nitrogen, and subjected to gas chromatography. The analysis was performed with an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with a capillary HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.25-μm coating thickness; J&W Scientific, Agilent). Helium was used as carrier gas (1 ml/min). The temperature gradient was 200 °C for 1 min, 200–325 °C at 20 °C/min, and 325 °C for 7.5 min. Identity of cholesterol signal was verified with an authentic standard. Flotillin is a cytosolic, membrane-associated protein involved in scaffolding functions, signaling, and endocytosis (23Bauer M. Pelkmans L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5559-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Langhorst M.F. Reuter A. Stuermer C.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2228-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Its two isoforms, flotillin-1 and flotillin-2, are enriched in exosomes and can be used as protein markers to quantify exosomal release (22Trajkovic K. Hsu C. Chiantia S. Rajendran L. Wenzel D. Wieland F. Schwille P. Brügger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). Flotillin can recruit cholesterol to the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes, where it colocalizes with cholesterol (25Kokubo H. Helms J.B. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Horikoshi Y. Yamaguchi H. Brain Res. 2003; 965: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Roitbak T. Surviladze Z. Tikkanen R. Wandinger-Ness A. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether trafficking and exosomal secretion of flotillin is regulated by cholesterol. In the mouse oligodendroglial cell line Oli-neu, immunofluorescence labeling with an antibody directed against flotillin-2 revealed a predominantly vesicular staining pattern on confocal sections. Only a minor fraction of flotillin-2 was detected at the plasma membrane. Expression of different GFP-tagged rab-GTPases and immunostaining of endogenous flotillin-2 showed colocalization of flotillin-2 with markers of early endosomes (GFP-rab5), recycling endosomes (GFP-rab4), and the late endosome/lysosome system (GFP-rab7, LAMP-1, and lysotracker colocalization) (data not shown). Recently, a flotillin-dependent endocytosis pathway regulated by cholesterol has been identified (27Glebov O.O. Bright N.A. Nichols B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In accordance with these results we found that the distribution of flotillin between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments was cholesterol-dependent. Acute depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol by 2 h of treatment with 1 mm mβCD resulted in a modest accumulation of flotillin-2 at the plasma membrane as shown by confocal microscopy images (8.6% shift from endosomal pools to the plasma membrane, S.E. = 0.02, n = 220 cells, p = 0.002, Student's t test, 2 independent experiments) (supplemental Fig. S1, A and D). A similar distribution was obtained for flotillin-1 (data not shown). Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, which catalyzes the production of l-mevalonate. However, reduction of l-mevalonate also impairs the geranylation and farnesylation of various proteins, which play a crucial role in various cellular functions. To exclude any cholesterol-independent effects, we treated cells with a combination of 4 μm simvastatin and 50 μm l-mevalonate in LPS-supplemented medium for 48 h before fixation (28Fassbender K. Simons M. Bergmann C. Stroick M. Lutjohann D. Keller P. Runz H. Kuhl S. Bertsch T. von Bergmann K. Hennerici M. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5856-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Similar to our results observed after acute cholesterol depletion, we detected a redistribution of flotillin-2 and flotillin-1 from the endosomal pool to the plasma membrane (23.4% decrease of flotillin-2, S.E. = 0.013, n = 175 cells, p < 0.0001, Student's t test, 2 independent experiments) (supplemental Fig. S1, B and D and data not shown). The addition of free cholesterol to the medium of cells that were starved for 4 h in LPS resulted in a shift of flotillin-2 from the plasma membrane to endosomal pools (13.6% increase, S.E. = 0.028, n = 171 cells, p = 0.0003, Student's t test, 2 independent experiments) (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). After treatment with cholesterol, we observed a pronounced vesicular filipin staining of cells in contrast to the homogenous staining of control cells, indicating that the cholesterol loading protocol leads to intracellular cholesterol accumulation in cytoplasmic vesicles (supplemental Fig. S2A). Filipin-positive compartments partially colocalized with endogenous flotillin-2, the late endosomal marker protein GFP-rab7, the lysosomal marker LAMP, and EGFP-CD63, suggesting that cholesterol might traffic on the same endocytic itinerary as flotillin-2 (supplemental Fig. S2, B–E). U18666A inhibits the transport of cholesterol from lysosomes to other cellular sites, resulting in lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol. After U18666A treatment we found an accumulation of flotillin-2 within vesicular compartments, where it might have been trapped together with cholesterol (7.06% increase, S.E. = 0.02, n = 69 cells, p = 0.022, Student's t test, 2 independent experiments) (supplemental Fig. S2F). Similar findings were obtained after inhibition of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the esterification of free cholesterol to fatty acids in the ER. After a 24-h incubation of Oli-neu cells with the acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor CP-113.818, we found an increased ratio of intracellular to plasma membrane flotillin-2 and flotillin-1 (21.8% increase, S.E. = 0.025, n = 213 cells, p < 0.0001, Student's t test, 2 independent experiments) (supplemental Fig. S2G and data not shown). We, therefore, reasoned that free cholesterol transport within the cell might be closely related to flotillin trafficking. Two putative cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid motifs (CRAC; (L/V-(X)(1-5)-Y-(X)(1-5)-R/K)) have been predicted for flotillin-2 which might enable it to bind and sequester cholesterol at the membrane (26Roitbak T. Surviladze Z. Tikkanen R. Wandinger-Ness A. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The functionality of CRAC domains has been previously demonstrated in the translocator protein, also known as peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, a protein that plays a role in cholesterol import into mitochondria (29Li H. Yao Z. Degenhardt B. Teper G. Papadopoulos V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 30Jamin N. Neumann J.M. Ostuni M.A. Vu T.K. Yao Z.X. Murail S. Robert J.C. Giatzakis C. Papadopoulos V. Lacapère J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The mutation of a tyrosine residue in the translocator protein CRAC domain was described to exert a negative impact on cholesterol uptake and translocation into mitochondria (30Jamin N. Neumann J.M. Ostuni M.A. Vu T.K. Yao Z.X. Murail S. Robert J.C. Giatzakis C. Papadopoulos V. Lacapère J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To test the functionality of CRAC domains in flotillin-2, we introduced point mutations into one or both putative CRAC motifs spanning amino acids 120–127 (VEQIYQDR) and amino acids 157–169 (VYDKVDYLSSLGK) of flotillin-2-GFP (flotillin-2-GFP Y124G, flotillin-2-GFP Y163G, and flotillin-2-GFP Y124G/Y163G). Fig. 1 demonstrates the marked accumulation of all CRAC mutants at the plasma membrane of transfected cells, which was the most prominent in the case of flotillin-2-GFP Y124G and the double mutant flotillin-2-GFP Y124G/Y163G (51% reduction, S.E. = 0.05, p < 0.0001, Student's t test, 3 independent experiments). Our findings indicate that translocation of flotillin-2 from the plasma membrane to endocytic compartments depends on at least one of this protein CRAC domains. Flotillin is enriched in exosomes; however, the exact mechanisms regulating exosomal biogenesis and release are not fully understood. Given the cholesterol dependence of flotillin endocytosis and trafficking within the endosomal system, we wondered whether cholesterol might also influence the exosomal release of flotillin. We, therefore, starved Oli-neu cells for 4 h in medium supplemented with lipoprotein-free serum before exchange of medium and the addition of a water-soluble cholesterol-mβCD complex saturated with ethanol-dissolved free cholesterol in serum-free medium. Control cells were treated with ethanol only. No visible cytotoxicity was observed. After 4 h, the medium was collected, and the exosomal fraction was purified by subsequent centrifugation steps to clear the medium from cells and cellular debris before purification of exosomes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g as described before in Oli-neu cells (22Trajkovic K. Hsu C. Chiantia S. Rajendran L. Wenzel D. Wieland F. Schwille P. Brügger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). Pellets from each subsequent centrifugation step were subjected to Western blotting and detected with an antibody against flotillin-2 to show enrichment of flotillin-2 in the 100,000 × g pellet (supplemental Fig. S3A). For further purification and analysis of the 100,000 × g fraction, we subjected the pellet to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Pelleted material from each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. Flotillin-2 immunoreactivity was exclusively recovered from 1.11–1.16 g/ml density fractions, similar to the exosomal marker proteins tsg 101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101) and alix (supplemental Fig. S3A). Size and density of the 100,000 × g pellet material are similar to that described for other exosomal preparations (7Fauré J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Grange J. Schoehn G. Goldberg Y. Boyer V. Kirchhoff F. Raposo G. Garin J. Sadoul R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The electron micrographs obtained from the 100,000 × g pellet preparation further verify the typical vesicular structures of exosomes with a 50–90-nm diameter (supplemental Fig. S3B). Although we found a robust signal for the exosomal marker proteins flotillin-2 and alix in the 100,000 × g pellet (supplemental Fig. S3C), no immunoreactivity was detected with the ER marker protein calnexin or the trans-Golgi network resident protein γ-adaptin, indicating the absence of microsomal contamination of the 100,000 × g pellet (supplemental Fig. S3C). In the following text we refer to this 100,000 × g pellet fraction as the exosomal fraction. Exosome release was measured by calculating the ratio of 100,000 × g pelleted material, i.e. the exosomal fraction, to cellular flotillin-2 levels, determined by image analysis of the respective scanned blots. As shown in Fig. 2A, exosomal release determined by the marker flotillin-2 significantly increased upon cholesterol loading (increase to 320%, S.E. = 110%, n = 8, p = 0.022, Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, 24 h of lipoprotein depletion followed by another 16 h of simvastatin treatment (4 μm plus 50 μm l-mevalonate) to decrease cellular cholesterol resulted in a significant reduction of exosome-associated flotillin-2 release (37.54% decrease, S.E. = 14%, n = 17, p = 0.0019, Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 2A). To rule out that cholesterol treatment induced shedding of flotillin-2-positive apoptotic vesicles that would co-sediment with exosomes, we performed sucrose gradient analysis of the 100,000 × g pellet. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3D, flotillin-2 immunoreactivity was recovered from identical fractions (1.11 and 1.16 g/ml) under both conditions. The increase of flotillin-2 intensity in the 100,000 × g fractions could either be due to a modification of the trafficking of flotillin-2 to exosomes or due to up-regulation of exosomal release per se."

Herbert et al. (p. 1530 ) analyzed sea surface temperature records of the past 3.5 million years from low-latitude sites spanning the world's major ocean basins in order to determine the timing and magnitude of the cooling that has accompanied the intensification of Northern Hemisphere ice ages since the Pliocene. Martínez-Garcia et al. (p. 1550 ) found that the enigmatic eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue, a feature one might not expect to find in such a warm region receiving so much sunlight, first appeared between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago. Its appearance was probably in response to a general shrinking of the tropical warm water pool caused by general climate cooling driven by changes in Earth's orbit."

However, the absolute chronology of this civilization has been uncertain, even though the sequence of rulers is well documented. Bronk Ramsey et al. (p. 1554 ; see the Perspective by Bruins ) now provide a detailed radiocarbon-based record using more than 200 samples that spans much of this time and reduces uncertainties in some cases to less than 20 years. To avoid artifacts, the authors dated only short-lived plant remains from known contexts (i.e., that were associated with specific reigns). They then used the known reign lengths as a further constraint to obtain a final chronology. The final dates agree most closely with the previous older chronology but force some revisions to the timing of events in the Old Kingdom, the period in the third millennium B.C.E. when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization."

Heterozygous loss-of-function germline rare variants and a homozygous defective polymorphic variant of SIAE were identified in 24/923 subjects of European origin with relatively common autoimmune disorders and in 2/648 controls of European origin. All heterozygous loss-of-function SIAE mutations tested were capable of functioning in a dominant negative manner. A homozygous secretion-defective polymorphic variant of SIAE was catalytically active, lacked the ability to function in a dominant negative manner, and was seen in eight autoimmune subjects but in no control subjects. The odds ratio for inheriting defective SIAE alleles was 8.6 in all autoimmune subjects, 8.3 in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, and 7.9 in subjects with type I diabetes. Functionally defective SIAE rare and polymorphic variants represent a strong genetic link to susceptibility in relatively common human autoimmune disorders."

In contrast to TfR mRNA, which binds at high affinity to IRP2, the duodenal divalent metal ion transporter (DMT1) (26Gunshin H. Allerson C.R. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Rofts A. Rogers J.T. Kishi F.

This event may be critical for setting rates of dietary iron uptake (26Gunshin H. Allerson C.R. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Rofts A. Rogers J.T. Kishi F. Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Andrews N.C.

By comparison with the APP IRE in this report, the consensus IRE of all of these iron-associated transcripts, including L- and H-ferritin, is a 26–30-base-long conserved RNA stem loop that forms an RNA helix with a CAGUGN terminal loop (27Piccinelli P. Samuelsson T. RNA. 2007; 13: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies revealed that CG base pairing within the terminal loop generates an AGU triloop and bulge nucleotide (25Goforth J.B. Anderson S.A. Nizzi C.P. Eisenstein R.S. RNA. 2010; 16: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An invariant to the canonical IRE RNA stem loop is the presence a bulge cytosine 6 bases upstream of the terminal loop (25Goforth J.B. Anderson S.A. Nizzi C.P. Eisenstein R.S. RNA. 2010; 16: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IRP1 was shown to interact with the H-ferritin IRE largely via hydrogen bonding between the phosphate bonds of the AGU trinucleotide loop and amino acids in the cleft between domains 2 and 3 of IRP1(28Walden W.E.

The bulge C interacts with 10 amino acids in the domain 4 of IRP1 (28Walden W.E. Selezneva A.I. Dupuy J. Volbeda A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Theil E.C. Volz K.

In this state, IRP1 no longer represses ferritin, Hif-2α, and eALAS mRNA translation and stabilizes DMT-1 (TfR) mRNA stability. By modulating IRP2 stability by two cysteines (Cys-512 and Cys-516) that are predicted to lie in the RNA-binding cleft (30Zumbrennen K.B. Wallander M.L. Romney S.J. Leibold E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 2219-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), iron is a significant regulator of IRE-mediated translation of the L- and H-ferritin chains, and IRP2 stabilizes TfR mRNA stability (31Wang W.

Supporting the clear physiological importance of IRP1, its expression is essential for growth, including a role in resistance to carcinogenesis (32Chen G. Fillebeen C. Wang J. Pantopoulos K.

This report supports a key role for IRP1 acting through the functional IRE that exists in the 5′-UTR of APP mRNA (1Rogers J.T. Randall J.D. Cahill C.M. Eder P.S. Huang X. Gunshin H. Leiter L.

Suppl. 2006; : 237-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the binding selectivity of the IRE in APP mRNA with respect to IRP1 and IRP2 as key RNA-binding proteins. Our biotin-labeled RNA (5′-UTR) pulldown assays ascertained that IRP1, and not IRP2, interacts with the APP IRE using both SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and H4 neuroglioma cells. This selective IRP1 binding was found to functionally drive APP expression. The binding specificity of IRP1 > IRP2 in neural cells was reproduced in human brain and blood samples. In all cases, the pattern of H-ferritin IRE binding to IRP1 and IRP2 was employed as a positive control. Our results showed that the AD-specific APP transcript presents as an extreme example of an IRE-containing mRNA that selectively binds only to IRP1 as a translational repressor of APP expression during intracellular iron depletion with desferrioxamine. Rabbit anti-human IRP1 antibody (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX) and anti-IRP1 (kind gift from Dr. Sharon Cooperman and Dr. Tracey Rouault, National Institutes of Health) each generated the same results in the assays shown; mouse anti-human IRP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) detected the H-ferritin IRE-IRP2 interaction, and a second antibody to IRP2 was also utilized to confirm the selectivity of IRP2 binding as detected with the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody. Anti-β-actin, anti-β-tubulin, rabbit anti-APP C-terminal antibody (A8717), and anti-biotin antibodies were from Sigma; and the APP N terminus-specific anti-22C11 antibody was from Chemicon, Temecula, CA. To generate evolutionary comparisons for an APP 5′-UTR alignment and to generate RNA secondary structure predictions, we downloaded the human, mouse, rhesus monkey APP family sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez data base. Genomic DNA sequences had specific exons and transcription start site (+1) explicitly identified. To ensure completeness, only verifiable 5′-UTR sequences were examined (37Maloney B. Ge Y.W. Greig N. Lahiri D.K. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1288-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using ClustalW2, the central 57-base sequence of 5′-UTRs of the human APP 5′-UTR were aligned with the equivalent sequences in mouse and rhesus monkey APP genes (+47 from the 5′ cap site to −43 from the AUG codon) in addition to the IRE domain of the human L- and H-ferritin transcripts. The 5′-UTR-specific IREs in DMT-1, eALAS, and HIF-2α transcripts were compared at the same stringency settings in ClustalW2. All alignments used the same gap setting and were selected so that the central CAGUGC domain of the H-ferritin IRE was anchored in the center of the homology. Homology of the equivalent CAGAGC box in the APP IRE was sought between species where no less than 80% homology was considered notable only when they shared an aligned position with a 100% similarity in the vicinity of the CAGAGC loop motif. The same 57 APP 5′-UTR motifs used for sequence alignments were chosen to predict their most stably folded RNA secondary structures, as shown in Fig. 2B. Folding predictions were from the RNAshapes program (RNA Studio (38Janssen S. Giegerich R. Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). RNA secondary structure of the biotinylated APP IRE probes from wild type, CAGA-mutated, and APP IRE-like linear input sequences were each correlated for their relative capacity to bind to IRP1.FIGURE 2Sequence and RNA structural specificity of IRP1 binding to the IRE motif in the 5′-untranslated region of the APP transcript. Panel A, primary sequence homology among the human, rhesus monkey, and mouse APP IREs where 100% conservation among the three species is demarked by a dotted line above the alignment. Sequences encoding the canonical IRE RNA stem loops in the 5′-untranslated region of ferritin L- and H-chain are aligned to the APP IRE such that CAGUGC terminal loop of the H-ferritin IRE is bold and underlined. The arrows indicate the C-6 bulge and the start of the apical CAGUGN loop in the ferritin IRE. The homologous CAGAGC motif of the APP IRE (panel B) is bold and underlined as six nucleotides in the 13-base terminal loop predicted for the APP IRE (panel B below). The super-conserved homology among all three APP IREs and both L-ferritin and H-ferritin subunits is shown both in bold and highlighted lettering, whereas the evolutionary conservation is demarked only by bold lettering. The sequences matching the known L- and H-ferritin pseudo-triloops are indicated in brackets and by letter t. Panel B, left, RNA secondary structure of the APP IRE was assessed by the SHAPE technique (93Wilkinson K.A. Merino E.J. Weeks K.M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1610-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This measured the likelihood of whether any given nucleotide is base-paired to participate in a double-stranded RNA helix or is encoded by single-stranded RNA, where it is exposed to chemical modification (147 bases input APP 5′-UTR RNA). The normalized SHAPE reactivity was incorporated into the RNAstructure 4.6 software, which uses both nearest neighbor free energy parameters and SHAPE data as pseudo-energy parameters to develop a secondary structure prediction. Nucleotides are colored black (unreactive, SHAPE reactivity < 0.2), green (0.2 ≤ SHAPE reactivity < 0.4), orange (0.4 ≤ SHAPE reactivity < 0.6), and red (highly reactive, SHAPE reactivity ≥ 0.6), or gray (no data due to RNA degradation) (description of potential base-pairing within the terminal loop is provided in supplemental Fig. 1. Right, human, rhesus monkey, and mouse APP IRE secondary structures were predicted by the RNAshapes program. The human and rhesus monkey APP IREs were predicted to be capable of forming alternative RNA stem loops, either with no internal base pairing to generate a 13-base terminal loop or alternatively with two hydrogen bonds internal to the terminal loop that may generate an AGA triloop. The mouse APP IRE sequences do not permit this alternative base pairing within the terminal loop. Input nucleotide sequences were chosen to include the evolutionary hyper-conserved motifs (panel A, dotted line) including sequences from 35 and 16 bases on each side of the human APP-specific CAGAGC loop and 33 and 16 bases on each side of the rhesus monkey and mouse CAGAGC IRE loops (panel A).

A conserved C nucleotide is present +76 bases from the APP mRNA 5′ cap site; this C is similarly placed upstream of the APP terminal loop-specific CAGAGC motif as the conserved C-bulge that is 6 bases upstream of the H-ferritin CAGUGN terminal loop.

In cancer, their frequency is increased; however, Tr1-mediated suppression mechanisms are not yet defined. Here, we evaluate the simultaneous involvement of ectonucleotidases (CD39/CD73) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in Tr1-mediated suppression. Human Tr1 cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived, sorted CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and incubated with autologous immature dendritic cells, irradiated COX-2(+) or COX-2(-) tumor cells, and IL-2, IL-10, and IL-15 (each at 10-15 IU/ml) for 10 days as described (Bergmann, C., Strauss, L., Zeidler, R., Lang, S., and Whiteside, T. L. (2007) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56, 1429-1442). Tr1 were phenotyped by multicolor flow cytometry, and suppression of proliferating responder cells was assessed in carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based assays. ATP hydrolysis was measured using a luciferase detection assay, and levels of adenosine or prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in cell supernatants were analyzed by mass spectrometry or ELISA, respectively. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The COX-2(+) tumor induced a greater number of Tr1 than COX-2(-) tumor (p < 0.05). Tr1 induced by COX-2(+) tumor were more suppressive, hydrolyzed more exogenous ATP (p < 0.05), and produced higher levels of adenosine and PGE(2) (p < 0.05) than Tr1 induced by COX-2(-) tumor. Inhibitors of ectonucleotidase activity, A(2A) and EP(2) receptor antagonists, or an inhibitor of the PKA type I decreased Tr1-mediated suppression (p < 0.05), whereas rolipram, a PDE(4) inhibitor, increased the intracellular cAMP level in responder cells and their susceptibility to Tr1-mediated suppression. Tr1 present in tumors or the peripheral blood of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients co-expressed COX-2, CD39, and CD73. A concomitant inhibition of PGE(2) and adenosine via the common intracellular cAMP pathway might be a novel approach for improving results of immune therapies for cancer."

Here, we report that butyrate, a natural small fatty acid and histone deacetylase inhibitor, significantly increases the efficiency of mouse iPS cell generation using the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. We show that butyrate not only changes the reprogramming dynamics, but also increases the ratio of iPS cell colonies to total colonies by reducing the frequency of partially reprogrammed cells and transformed cells. Detailed analysis reveals that the effect of butyrate on reprogramming appears to be mediated by c-Myc and occurs during an early stage of reprogramming.

https://openalex.org/W2078965438,"The antiosteoporotic treatment strontium ranelate (SrRan) was shown to increase bone mass and strength by dissociating bone resorption and bone formation. To identify the molecular mechanisms of action of SrRan on osteoblasts, we investigated its effects on calcineurin-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) signaling, an important calcium sensitive pathway controlling bone formation. Using murine MC3T3-E1 and primary murine osteoblasts, we demonstrate that SrRan induces NFATc1 nuclear translocation, as shown by immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses. Molecular analysis showed that SrRan increased NFATc1 transactivation in osteoblasts, an effect that was fully abrogated by the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A or FK506, confirming that SrRan activates NFATc1 signaling in osteoblasts. This has functional implications because calcineurin inhibitors blunted the enhanced osteoblast replication and expression of the osteoblast phenotypic markers Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, and type I collagen induced by SrRan. We further found that SrRan increased the expression of Wnt3a and Wnt5a as well as beta-catenin transcriptional activity in osteoblasts, and these effects were abolished by calcineurin inhibitors. The Wnt inhibitors sFRP1 and DKK1 abolished SrRan-induced osteoblast gene expression. Furthermore, blunting the Wnt5a receptor Ryk or RhoA that acts downstream of Ryk abrogated cell proliferation and osteoblast gene expression induced by SrRan. These results indicate that activation of NFATc1 and downstream canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways mediate SrRan-induced osteoblastic cell replication and differentiation, which provides novel insights into the mechanisms of action of this antiosteoporotic agent in osteoblastogenesis."

The relationship between geography and evolutionary innovation was analyzed in a dominant complex of Caribbean reef corals, in which morphological and genetic data concur on species differences. Based on geometric morphometrics of Pleistocene corals and genetically characterized modern colonies, we found that morphological disparity varies from the center to the edge of the Caribbean, and we show that lineages are static at well-connected central locations but split or fuse in edge zones where gene flow is limited. Thus, conservation efforts in corals should focus not only on the centers of diversity but also on peripheral areas of species ranges and population connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2048280561,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor and downstream product of cytokine and growth factor pathways. Among members of the STAT family, STAT3 has garnered particular interest due to its role in cancer and development. Recently, it was proposed that STAT3 regulates cardiac ATP generation in vivo through protein interaction with the mitochondrial complexes of oxidative phosphorylation, specifically Complexes I/II. For this mechanism to work effectively, the cellular ratio of Complexes I/II and STAT3 must approach one. However, using three different proteomic approaches in cardiac tissue, we determined the ratio of Complexes I/II and STAT3 to be ∼105. This finding suggests that direct protein interaction between Complexes I/II and STAT3 cannot be required for optimal ATP production, nor can it dramatically modulate oxidative phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, STAT3 is likely altering mitochondrial function via transcriptional regulation or indirect signaling pathways that warrant further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2080989865,"The intracellular signaling events by which NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function and atherogenesis are yet to be entirely elucidated. We previously demonstrated that NADPH oxidase deficiency decreased atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-) mice and identified adhesion protein CD44 as an important ROS-sensitive gene expressed in VSMC and atherosclerotic lesions. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase-generated ROS regulate the expression of CD44 and its principal ligand, hyaluronan (HA), and how CD44-HA interaction affects VSMC proliferation and migration and inflammatory gene expression in apoE(-/-) mice aortas. Thrombin-induced CD44 expression is mediated by transcription factor AP-1 in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation enhanced thrombin-induced HA synthesis, and hyaluronan synthase 2 expression in VSMC. Hyaluronidase, which generates low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA), is induced in VSMC in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner and LMW-HA stimulated ROS generation and cell proliferation in wild-type but not p47(phox-/-) VSMC, effects that were enhanced by thrombin pretreatment. Haptotactic VSMC migration toward HA was increased by thrombin in a CD44-dependent manner. HA expression in atherosclerotic lesions and plasma-soluble CD44 and HA levels were higher in apoE(-/-) compared with apoE(-/-)/p47(phox-/-) mice. HA-regulated pro-inflammatory gene expression was higher in apoE(-/-) than apoE(-/-)/p47(phox-/-) mouse aortas. GKT136901, a specific inhibitor of Nox1- and Nox4-containing NADPH oxidase activity, attenuated ROS generation and atherosclerosis and decreased CD44 and HA expression in atherosclerotic lesions. Together, these data suggest that increased CD44 and HA expression and CD44-HA-dependent gene regulation may play a role in atherosclerosis stimulated by NADPH oxidase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2133993778,"An oncogenic form of RHAMM (receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility, mouse, amino acids 163-794 termed RHAMM(Delta163)) is a cell surface hyaluronan receptor and mitotic spindle protein that is highly expressed in aggressive human cancers. Its regulation of mitotic spindle integrity is thought to contribute to tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this function have not previously been defined. Here, we report that intracellular RHAMM(Delta163) modifies the stability of interphase and mitotic spindle microtubules through ERK1/2 activity. RHAMM(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit strongly acetylated interphase microtubules, multi-pole mitotic spindles, aberrant chromosome segregation, and inappropriate cytokinesis during mitosis. These defects are rescued by either expression of RHAMM or mutant active MEK1. Mutational analyses show that RHAMM(Delta163) binds to alpha- and beta-tubulin protein via a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper, but in vitro analyses indicate this interaction does not directly contribute to tubulin polymerization/stability. Co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays reveal complexes of RHAMM(Delta163), ERK1/2-MEK1, and alpha- and beta-tubulin and demonstrate direct binding of RHAMM(Delta163) to ERK1 via a D-site motif. In vitro kinase analyses, expression of mutant RHAMM(Delta163) defective in ERK1 binding in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and blocking MEK1 activity collectively confirm that the effect of RHAMM(Delta163) on interphase and mitotic spindle microtubules is mediated by ERK1/2 activity. Our results suggest a model wherein intracellular RHAMM(Delta163) functions as an adaptor protein to control microtubule polymerization during interphase and mitosis as a result of localizing ERK1/2-MEK1 complexes to their tubulin-associated substrates."

PTH significantly increased osteocalcin and bone formation indices, in the absence or presence of either antiresorptive, although BFR remained lower in presence of Dmab. To further evaluate PTH effects in the complete absence of osteoclasts, high dose PTH was administered to RANK−/− mice. PTH increased osteocalcin similarly in RANK−/− and WT mice. It also increased BMD in RANK−/− mice, although less than in WT.

https://openalex.org/W2020783280,"Cellular supply of dNTPs is essential in the DNA replication and repair processes. Here we investigated the regulation of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in response to DNA damage and found that genotoxic insults in tumor cells cause up-regulation and nuclear localization of TK1. During recovery from DNA damage, TK1 accumulates in p53-null cells due to a lack of mitotic proteolysis as these cells are arrested in the G(2) phase by checkpoint activation. We show that in p53-proficient cells, p21 expression in response to DNA damage prohibits G(1)/S progression, resulting in a smaller G(2) fraction and less TK1 accumulation. Thus, the p53 status of tumor cells affects the level of TK1 after DNA damage through differential cell cycle control. Furthermore, it was shown that in HCT-116 p53(-/-) cells, TK1 is dispensable for cell proliferation but crucial for dTTP supply during recovery from DNA damage, leading to better survival. Depletion of TK1 decreases the efficiency of DNA repair during recovery from DNA damage and generates more cell death. Altogether, our data suggest that more dTTP synthesis via TK1 take place after genotoxic insults in tumor cells, improving DNA repair during G(2) arrest."

Yu S. Wang F. Sacchettini J.C. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and its homologue in BpKatG, S324T (22Deemagarn T. Carpena X. Singh R. Wiseman B. Fita I. Loewen P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have been reported. A covalent modification unique to all KatGs involves the side chains of Met264–Tyr238–Trp111. This adduct, in combination with a nearby mobile Arg426, is essential for catalase activity, but not peroxidase activity. These structures have provided many insights into KatG structure and function and confirmed the considerable similarity in structure between BpKatG and MtKatG consistent with the similarity in enzymatic properties (16Singh R. Wiseman B. Deemagarn T. Jha V. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 471: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, they have not led to an identification of the binding sites for the two substrates, INH and NAD+, which would potentially enhance our understanding of the INH activation process. The work described in this report examines in more detail the role of KatG in IN·NAD synthesis. In particular, the apparent dichotomy between the peroxidase- and superoxide-driven paths is clarified in a confirmation that superoxide and its in situ generation by KatG is essential for IN·NAD synthesis, whereas the peroxidatic path enhances the reaction. In addition, while non-enzymatic aspects of the reaction are found to have a significant role, binding sites for both INH and NAD+ on BpKatG are identified in enzyme·ligand complexes generated by co-crystallization. Standard chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. The oligonucleotides GCCGACGGCGCCGGCGGCGCG (R123A), GGCGCGGGCGCAGGGCAGCAG (E128A), TGGGAGCCCGCGGACGTCTAC (E198A), TATTCGGGCGCCCGCCAGCTC (D222A), GGCAATCCCGCTCCGGTCGCC (D249A), GCCGCGGCGGCCGACATTCGT (R255A), and GACAAGGCGGCACTGCTGACG (Q622A) were purchased from Invitrogen and used to mutate a fragment of pBpKatG (29Colin J.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The mutated sequences were confirmed (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) and used to generate the plasmids pR123A, pE128A, pE198A, pD222A, pD249A, pD255A, and pQ622A. The native and variant proteins were expressed and purified as described (29Colin J. Wiseman B. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Ivancich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8557-8563Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The variants R123A, E128A, E198A, D222A, D249A, R255A, and Q622A were unchanged compared with wild-type BpKatG in both catalase and peroxidase activities. The release of radicals from INH was assayed by the increase in absorbance at 560 nm caused by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction to formazan (∈ = 18,500 m−1 cm−1) in a solution containing 1.0 mm INH, 2 μm MnCl2 and 0.2 mm nitro blue tetrazolium in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C (32Auclair C. Torres M. Hakim J. FEBS Lett. 1978; 89: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The synthesis of IN·NAD was assayed by the increase in absorbance at 326 nm (∈ = 6,900 m−1 cm−1) (33Rawat R. Whitty A. Tonge P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13881-13886Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) of a solution containing 0.4 mm NAD+, 1.0 mm INH, 2 μm MnCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Protein was estimated according to the methods outlined by Layne (34Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments (35Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 36Klein J. Meinecke R. Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5336-5337Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were run at 500 MHz in a Varian INOVA-500 instrument. Saturation was achieved by a train of 50-ms Gaussian-shaped pulses with 5-ms intervals, and a total saturation time of ∼2.5 s. The on-resonance protein irradiation was performed at a chemical shift of −0.4 ppm, and off-resonance at 34.5 ppm, where no protein signals are present. The free induction decays with on-resonance and off-resonance protein irradiation were acquired in an interleaved mode using 16 transient blocs. The protein signal was partially suppressed by the application of a 20-ms spin lock after the observation pulse. The residual water signal was suppressed using an excitation sculpting module null at the water. The STD spectra were acquired with 1000 or 500 transients. The relative STD values were calculated by dividing the intensities of signals in the STD spectrum by the intensities of corresponding signals from the off-resonance control experiment. The protein concentration was 10 μm in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. Ligand concentration was 40 mm. All NMR buffers were prepared in D2O. Samples were analyzed on a MALDI Qq Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer built and maintained in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manitoba (37Loboda A.V. Krutchinsky A.N. Bromirski M. Ens W. Standing K.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). No buffer exchange was done. For each sample, a 0.5-μl aliquot was mixed with an equal volume of saturated 2,5-dinitrobenzoic acid matrix. Tandem mass spectrometry was done on selected ions using collision voltages appropriate for similar sized peptides. Some samples were also analyzed on a Varian 500-MS ion trap mass spectrometer after dilution with an equal volume of 2% formic acid in methanol before electrospray ionization. INH, NAD+, or AMP in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, were added separately to a solution of 20 mg/ml BpKatG also in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 1 mm. This solution was mixed 2:1 (v/v) with the reservoir solution of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 25 mm NaCl, 16–20% PEG 4000, 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Brownish crystals were obtained at 20 °C by the vapor-diffusion, hanging drop method, which belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Data sets were collected using synchrotron beam line CMCF 08ID-1 at the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon from crystals flash-cooled in the reservoir buffer. Diffraction data were processed and scaled using programs MOSFLM and SCALA (38Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab INH activation by conversion to IN·NAD in M. tuberculosis requires MtKatG. BpKatG has catalytic properties almost identical to those of MtKatG and has the advantages of a large number of accessible variants and facile, reproducible crystallization. In addition, the properties of the widely studied Ser to Thr variants (MtKatG S315T, responsible for a majority of INH resistance and its homologue BpKatG S324T) (7Zhao X. Yu H. Yu S. Wang F.

To systematically consider the impact of component changes and supplements on IN·NAD synthesis, a minimal or basal reaction mixture was first defined, and refined by the determination of saturating substrate concentrations. This basal mixture contained INH, NAD+, BpKatG, Mn2+ and O2 dissolved in the buffers (15Singh R. Wiseman B. Deemagarn T. Donald L.J. Duckworth H.W. Carpena X. Fita I. Loewen P.C. J. Biol.

Km values of 25 μm for NAD+ and 550 μm for INH were determined at an optimum pH of 8.25. Replacing NAD+ with NADH reduced the rate of reaction by >80%. Removal of either INH or NAD+ stopped the reaction completely, and the catalytic role of BpKatG is evident in the 7-times increase from the non-enzymatic rate of IN·NAD synthesis upon the addition of enzyme (0.31 nmol/min to 2.21 nmol/min with 0.625 μm BpKatG) (Table 1). All subsequent work utilizes this basal mixture unless modified in a specified way.TABLE 1Rates of IN·NAD synthesis and radical generation assayed with NBTEnzymeAdditionaThe following supplements were included as indicted: SOD (5 μg/ml), EDTA (1 mm), NaCN (5 mm), GOx (3 μg of glucose oxidase + 5 mm glucose), PAA (100 μm), tBHP (0.4 mm), XOx (0.012 units/ml xanthine oxidase + 0.5 mm xanthine).

It is concluded that the hydrophobic NqrB harbors one riboflavin in addition to its covalently attached FMN. The catalytic role of two flavins in subunit NqrB during the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol by the Na+-NQR is discussed. Pathogenic strains of the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae cause the diarrheal disease cholera. By the help of a respiratory Na+ pump, V. cholerae maintains an electrochemical Na+ gradient across the inner membrane to drive central processes like flagellar rotation, nutrient uptake, and detoxification. The respiratory Na+ pump, also called Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR), 2The abbreviations used are: Na+-NQRsodium ion-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductaseDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideQ1ubiquinone-1TMHtransmembrane helixPDBProtein Data Bank. is a membrane-bound enzyme complex composed of six subunits (NqrABCDEF) (1Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Bogachev A.V. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2005; 70: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar). NqrA is a peripheral subunit, NqrC and NqrF are predominantly hydrophilic yet anchored to the membrane, whereas the hydrophobic NqrB, NqrD, and NqrE subunits each comprise several transmembrane helices. The Na+-NQR contains at least five distinct redox centers participating in electron transfer from NADH to substrate quinone: noncovalently bound FAD, a 2Fe-2S cluster, covalently bound FMNs, and noncovalently bound riboflavin (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Juárez O. Morgan J.E. Barquera B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 33162-33167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, ubiquinone-8 (Q8) was co-purified with the Na+-NQR (6Pfenninger-Li X.D. Albracht S.P.J. van Belzen R. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6233-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Binding sites for FAD, 2Fe-2S cluster, and substrate NADH are located on NqrF, which does not directly participate in Na+-transport but represents the electron input module of the complex catalyzing the NADH dehydrogenase reaction (7Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Barquera B. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7318-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Türk K. Puhar A. Neese F. Bill E. Fritz G. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21349-21355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The covalently bound FMN residues are attached via phosphodiester bonds to Thr-236 in subunit NqrB and Thr-225 in subunit NqrC, respectively (9Nakayama Y. Yasui M. Sugahara K. Hayashi M. Unemoto T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Yasui M. Maeda M. Furuishi K. Unemoto T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The subunit(s) responsible for riboflavin and quinone binding have not been identified yet. Riboflavin was detected in a subcomplex composed of NqrA, -B, -C, and -F but was not present in the isolated A and F subunits (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that NqrB participates in the quinone reduction step (11Hayashi M. Shibata N. Nakayama Y. Yoshikawa K. Unemoto T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). sodium ion-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside ubiquinone-1 transmembrane helix Protein Data Bank. By analyzing the flavin cofactors in defined subcomplexes of the Na+-NQR from V. cholerae, we show that riboflavin is localized on subunit NqrB. Analysis of the molar size and subunit composition of the holo-complex reveals that the Na+-NQR contains one copy of each subunit and a total of four flavins, with one FAD on NqrF, one covalently bound FMN on NqrC, and one covalently bound FMN and one noncovalently bound riboflavin on NqrB. Thus, the Na+-NQR represents a unique example for a respiratory complex, which relies on the redox activity of two flavins located in its membrane-embedded NqrB subunit. The possible role of these membrane-bound flavins during the two-electron reduction of quinone to quinol by the Na+-NQR is discussed. Escherichia coli DH5α (12Taylor R.G. Walker D.C. McInnes R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1677-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was used as a host for cloning and propagation of plasmids. V. cholerae O395 N1 Δnqr (13Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Häse C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a streptomycin-resistant strain lacking the entire nqr operon, was used as expression host. The plasmid pNQR1 bearing the entire nqr operon from V. cholerae under the control of an arabinose promoter (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used as expression vector for the Na+-NQR complex and as a cloning template. E. coli was grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. V. cholerae was grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 8.5, 10 mm glucose, and 50 μg ml−1 streptomycin. For plasmid maintenance, ampicillin was added to growth medium at concentrations of 150 μg ml−1 (E. coli) or 200 μg ml−1 (V. cholerae). Production and purification of wild-type and mutant forms of the Na+-NQR from V. cholerae as recombinant proteins containing a His6 tag at the N terminus of subunit NqrA was performed as described elsewhere (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, His6-tagged Na+-NQR was expressed in V. cholerae Δnqr. Membranes were isolated, solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), and Na+-NQR was purified via nickel affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography in gel filtration buffer (10 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) DDM). Na+-NQR from the nickel affinity chromatographic step (4.3–6.5 mg ml−1) was mixed with 0.1 mm riboflavin from a 1 mm riboflavin stock solution in N,N-dimethylformamide. After 10 min at 25 °C, excess riboflavin was removed by gel filtration as described above. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using the reagent from Pierce (14Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18701) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin served as standard. SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 6 m urea (1Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). Aliquots of purified Na+-NQR were solubilized with SDS prior to loading on the gel (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membranes were resuspended in 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 5.8% (w/v) glycerol, and 125 mm β-mercaptoethanol, agitated at room temperature for 1 h, and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 × g prior to loading on the gel. Gel electrophoresis was performed at room temperature at a constant current of 15 mA. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Prior to staining, flavins were detected by in gel fluorography (excitation, 457 nm; emission, 526 nm; Typhoon 9400 scanner, Molecular Dynamics). To detect covalently bound FMN in membrane-bound NQR, the gels were washed for 2 h in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol prior to scanning to remove fluorescent low molecular weight compounds present in the crude membrane fractions. His6-tagged NqrA subunit was detected immunochemically by use of an anti-His6-peroxidase conjugate according to the procedures of the supplier (Roche). The peroxidase was detected using the ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare) with a chemiluminescence reader (Fujifilm, LAS-3000 CCD) equipped with a blue 515 nm emission filter. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of noncovalently bound flavins was performed on plates of silica gel 60 (SIL G-25, Macherey-Nagel) using a developing solution of 2-butanol:glacial acetic acid:water (2:1:1) (16Roughead Z.K. McCormick D.B. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TLC spots were visualized by UV illumination (excitation, 302 nm; emission, 520–620 nm; GeneGenius Bioimaging system, Syngene). Extraction of noncovalently bound flavins from purified Na+-NQR or isolated membranes of V. cholerae with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the identification and quantification of flavins by HPLC was performed as described previously (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Standards for FAD and FMN were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Riboflavin was from Fluka. Sedimentation velocity experiments for Na+-NQR were performed at 4 °C in a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with an An-50 Ti analytical rotor (Beckman) at a speed of 30,000 rpm. All data acquired from these experiments were obtained using the UV/Vis absorbance detection system on the ultracentrifuge at 280 nm using double sector 12 mm charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces. Protein concentration was ∼0.2 mg ml−1 in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, pH 8.0. Analysis of the continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution was performed with the software Sedfit version 11.8 (17Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 18Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) using the Lamm equation. The partial specific volume of Na+-NQR, buffer viscosity, and buffer density were calculated using software UltraScan II (19Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, London, UK2005Google Scholar). Membrane protein and detergent form a complex which has a different density than the protein alone. Therefore, sedimentation behavior is dependent on the nature of the detergent, and amount of detergent bound to protein. In such a case the buoyant mass of the particle is determined. Knowing the ratio of detergent bound per protein, the mass of the protein without micelle is calculated according to Equation 1,(20le Maire M. Arnou B. Olesen C. Georgin D. Ebel C. Møller J.V. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1782-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Fleming K.G. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2008; Unit 7.12: 1-12Google Scholar), where MB is the buoyant mass, θ′ is the buoyant term that is composed of the different components of the analyzed complex, MP is the molecular mass of the protein, νP is the partial specific volume of the protein, νDet is the partial specific volume of the detergent (22Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), δ is the ratio of detergent bound per protein in g g−1, and ρ is the density of the buffer. For size determination by static light scattering, size exclusion chromatography was coupled with continuous laser light scattering, refractive index, and ultraviolet detection of the eluent as described (23Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Na+-NQR was separated on a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) connected to an Agilent 1100 HPLC system at 20 °C, and protein was eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 using gel filtration buffer. Protein elution was followed online by absorption at 280 nm (Agilent), by refractive index at 690 nm using an Optilab rEX detector (Wyatt Technology), and by static light scattering at 690 nm using a miniDAWN instrument (Wyatt Technology). Static light scattering data were analyzed using ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology). A specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) of 0.185 ml g−1 for protein (23Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.143 ml g−1 for DDM (24Slotboom D.J. Duurkens R.H. Olieman K. Erkens G.B. Methods. 2008; 46: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used. The experimentally determined specific absorptions of Na+-NQR and DDM at 280 nm were 1.540 ml mg−1 cm−1 and 2.32 ml g−1 cm−1, respectively. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. The amount of DDM bound to purified Na+-NQR was determined using the phenol-sulfuric acid method (25Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41141) Google Scholar) in combination with anionic exchange chromatography as described previously (26Mokhonov V. Mokhonova E. Yoshihara E. Masui R. Sakai M. Akama H. Nakae T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 40: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Na+-NQR was applied at 4 °C to a HiTrap ANX FF column (GE Healthcare) and washed with start buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM). Na+-NQR was eluted with a 0 to 1 m linear gradient of NaCl in start buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were analyzed for protein and DDM content. Protein-bound DDM was determined by subtracting the DDM concentration of the elution buffer from the DDM concentration of fractions containing Na+-NQR. Standard protocols were used for plasmid preparation and purification, agarose gel electrophoresis, dephosphorylation, and ligation of DNA (27Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) and DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) were used as recommended by the manufacturers. E. coli was transformed chemically (28Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene. 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar), V. cholerae was transformed by electroporation (29Marcus H. Ketley J.M. Kaper J.B. Holmes R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 56: 149-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expected sequences of expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Microsynth). Fig. 1 depicts the plasmids encoding for subcomplexes of the Na+-NQR. Primers are listed in Table 1. Plasmid pNA1 was obtained by replacing the nqr operon in pNQR1 with the nqrA gene. The PCR primers MC044-NqrA-F and MC045-NqrA-R were designed to amplify nqrA from pNQR1 and to introduce an EcoRI site with the reverse primer. The PCR product was finally subcloned into pNQR1 using EcoRI and NdeI.TABLE 1DNA primers used for construction of plasmidsPrimerSequenceaSequences are given from 5′ to 3′.

Restriction sites are underlined, and nucleotides substituted for mutagenesis are designated by lower case letters. Open table in a new tab Plasmid pNmA1 was obtained by deleting the nqrA gene from pNQR1. The PCR primers RD-Nqrb-Vc and Seq-Vc-Nqrc-R were designed to amplify a sequence downstream of the nqrA gene in pNQR1 and to introduce an NdeI site with the forward primer. The PCR product was subcloned into pNQR1 using NdeI and SalI. Plasmid pNmB1 was obtained by deleting the nqrB gene from pNQR1. The PCR primers TH003-deltaNqrB-F and TH004-deltaNqrB-R were designed to amplify the entire pNQR1 plasmid excluding nqrB. Both primers introduced a KpnI site and thereby allowed self-ligation of the PCR product after digestion with KpnI to form plasmid pNmB1*. A fragment containing the newly joined KpnI site was excised from pNmB1* with MluI and SbfI and subcloned into pNQR1. Plasmids pNmC1, pNmD1, and pNmDE1 (Fig. 1) were cloned following the same strategy as for pNmB1. For pNmC1, primers TH001-deltaNqrC-F and TH002-deltaNqrC-R were used to eliminate nqrC and to introduce a KpnI site for circularization of the PCR product under formation of pNmC1*. The KpnI-containing fragment was excised from pNmC1* with SalI and NheI and subcloned into pNQR1, generating plasmid pNmC1. For pNmD1, primers MC048-NqrEF-F and MC050-NqrC-R were used to eliminate nqrD and to introduce an XmaI site for circularization of the PCR product under formation of pNmD1*. The XmaI containing fragment was excised from pNmD1* with MluI and HindIII and subcloned into pNQR1, generating plasmid pNmD1. For pNmDE1, primers MC046-NqrF-F and MC050-NqrC-R were used to eliminate nqrD and nqrE and to introduce an XmaI site for circularization of the PCR product under formation of pNmDE1*. The XmaI-containing fragment was excised from pNmD1* with MluI and HindIII and subcloned into pNQR1, generating plasmid pNmDE1. The plasmid pNQR1 was used as template for mutagenesis. Amino acid substitutions in subunit NqrB were made by overlapping PCR using individual primer pairs and the flanking primers NQR-F and NQR-R (Table 1). The PCR products harboring the mutations were subcloned into pNQR1 using SexAI and SalI, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. An additional EagI restriction site was introduced with the primers by silent nucleotide substitution to facilitate identification of mutated plasmids by restriction enzyme digestion. Expression of Na+-NQR lacking individual subunits and preparation of membranes was performed as described (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and modified as follows. A pre-culture of V. cholerae Δnqr transformed with the chosen expression plasmid was diluted 1:100 with fresh, prewarmed medium and growth was continued at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.8, protein production was induced by the addition of 10 mm l-arabinose. The temperature was decreased to 30 °C and incubation was continued for 20 h. Cells were harvested, washed with buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Approximately 4 g of cells were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm diisopropyl-fluorophosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and traces of DNase I. The cell suspension was passed through a French pressure cell at 7.58 MPa. Unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Soluble proteins were separated from the membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation (183,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The membranes were washed with buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5% (w/v) glycerol), resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Na+-NQR activity was determined in buffer containing 20 mm Tris·H2SO4, pH 7.5, 50 mm Na2SO4, and 50 μg ml−1 bovine serum albumin in the presence of 0.1 mm NADH and 0.1 mm ubiquinone-1 using a diode array spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). Ubiquinone-1, a ubiquinone-side chain homologue with one isoprene unit in the polyprenyl side chain, was used in replacement of the native substrate ubiquinone-8 for reasons of solubility. The reaction was started by the addition of Na+-NQR diluted in buffer. NADH oxidation and quinol formation were followed simultaneously as previously described (30Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). NADH:ubiquinone-1 oxidoreduction activity by alternative NADH dehydrogenases was determined in the presence of 1 μm AgNO3, which specifically inhibited the Na+-NQR (31Steuber J. Krebs W. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Nakayama Y. Hayashi M. Yoshikawa K. Mochida K. Unemoto T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 1064-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was evaluated by using a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. Differences were determined to be significant when p < 0.001. The subunit stoichiometry of Na+-NQR was determined as described (33Burgdorf T. van der Linden E. Bernhard M. Yin Q.Y. Back J.W. Hartog A.F. Muijsers A.O. de Koster C.G. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), using a Procise-cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Twelve cycles of automated Edman degradation of the intact Na+-NQR complex were performed, and uncorrected peak integrals of the separated phenylthiohydantion (PTH) amino acids were used for determination of the relative amount of subunits in the Na+-NQR. Amino acid sequences for NqrB homologues were obtained from UniProtKB (34The UniProt ConsortiumNucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D169-D174Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) with the query string “gene:NqrB”. Redundant entries were removed from the dataset. Of the remaining 73 sequences, a multiple sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW algorithm (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55967) Google Scholar) implemented in the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Version 7.0.9.0, (36Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symposium Series. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar)) with default settings. Entries A9NGU6, Q73PG2, Q1Q257, and A6AT93 were removed from the dataset due to large length deviations at the N- or C termini. Identical residues and similar residues were identified with the BioEdit program using an identity and similarity threshold of 85% and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (37Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). The sequences in the alignment were used to construct an average distance tree using Jalview (38Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5874) Google Scholar). To reduce the number of sequences while maintaining the sequence diversity high, sequences with identity distance scorings below 18 were grouped and all but one sequence was deleted. This allowed minimizing the alignment to the 6 sequences of NqrB from Chlamydia pneumoniae (Q9Z8B6), Protochlamydia amoebophila (Q6MEH4), Shewanella oneidensis (Q8EID9), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Q7MT18), Rhodopirellula baltica (Q7UWS4), and V. cholerae (A6XUU9). The amino acid sequence of V. cholerae NqrB (A6XUU9) was obtained from UniProtKB. Eleven different topology prediction methods were used to obtain putative topologies of NqrB:TMHMM (39Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol.

A histogram from the individual prediction results was constructed giving each residue a score of 1 if predicted to be located in a transmembrane helix (TMH) and a value of 0.5 for residues from a predicted low probability TMH or aliphatic helix. A consensus prediction model was constructed by assigning a TMH to regions where the summed score exceeded 7.33, which is ⅔ of the maximal score. Furthermore, larger regions with a summed score above 3 were considered as hydrophobic stretches. The C terminus of NqrB was assumed to be located in the cytoplasm, as reported by Duffy et al.

In addition to the noncovalently bound FAD and the covalently attached FMN cofactors, riboflavin was reported to be a noncovalently bound cofactor of the Na+-NQR from V. cholerae and the highly conserved enzyme from V. harveyi (52Barquera B.

Protocols for the analysis of noncovalently bound flavins in the Na+-NQR include a precipitation step using TCA, which might result in the cleavage of FMN under formation of riboflavin.

We analyzed the noncovalently bound flavins in purified Na+-NQR from V. cholerae by thin layer chromatography (TLC), which allowed application of the purified protein without any pretreatment. Thereby, the presence of noncovalently bound FAD and riboflavin was confirmed but no noncovalently bound FMN was observed (Fig. 2). These results indicated that riboflavin in purified Na+-NQR is not liberated from FMN but represents an intrinsic component of the Na+-NQR complex. We then quantified the endogenous amount of noncovalently bound flavins by HPLC after their release from Na+-NQR by TCA precipitation (3Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys.

Attempts to design OD-based immunogens in the past have met with little success. We report the design and characterization of an Escherichia coli-expressed OD-based immunogen (ODEC), based on the sequence of the HxBc2 strain. The ODEC-designed immunogen lacks the variable loops V1V2 and V3 and incorporates 11 designed mutations at the interface of the inner and the outer domains of gp120. Biophysical studies showed that ODEC is folded and protease-resistant, whereas ODEC lacking the designed mutations is highly aggregation-prone. In contrast to previously characterized OD constructs, ODEC bound CD4 and the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 but not the non-neutralizing antibodies b6 and F105. Upon immunization in rabbits, ODEC was highly immunogenic, and the sera showed measurable neutralization for four subtype B and one subtype C virus including two b12-resistant viruses. In contrast, sera from rabbits immunized with gp120 did not neutralize any of the viruses. ODEC is the first example of a gp120 fragment-based immunogen that yields significant neutralizing antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2031034195,"In the large intestine organic cation transporter type-2 (OCTN2) is recognized as a transporter of compounds such as carnitine and colony sporulation factor, promoting health of the colon intestinal epithelium. Recent reports suggest that OCTN2 expression in small intestine is under control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha). However, PPARalpha contribution to colonic OCTN2 expression remains controversial. Here we examined the transcriptional regulation of colon OCTN2 gene by PPARgamma. To exclude any additional modulation of other PPAR to OCTN2 expression, we used both in vivo and in vitro PPAR-null models and specific PPAR inhibitors. The PPARgamma agonists thiazolidinediones increased both OCTN2 mRNA and protein expression in colonic epithelial cell lines independently by PPARalpha expression. The induction was blocked only by PPARgamma antagonists or by gammaORF4, a PPARgamma isoform with dominant negative activity, suggesting a PPARgamma-dependent mechanism. A conserved noncanonical PPAR-responsive element was found by computational analysis in the first intron of human OCTN2 gene and validated by EMSA assay. Promoter-reporter assays further confirmed transcriptional functionality of the putative PPAR response element, whereas selective mutation caused complete loss of responsiveness to PPARgamma activation. Finally, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active PPARgamma mutant increased colon OCTN2 expression in PPARalpha(-/-) mice. Interestingly, animals overexpressing colon PPARgamma showed a significant increase in plasma carnitine, thus demonstrating the functional contribution of large intestine to systemic carnitine homeostasis. This study reveals a PPARgamma-dependent absorption machinery in colon that is likely involved in the health of colon epithelium, in the microbiota-host interactions and in the absorption of nutraceuticals and drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2037792151,"Mast cells contribute to allergy through IgE-dependent activation via the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI. The role of the FcεRIβ chain (MS4A2) in mast cell function is not understood fully, although it serves to amplify FcεRI-dependent signaling. We demonstrate the expression of a novel MS4A2 truncation lacking exon 3 in human mast cells termed MS4A2(trunc). MS4A2(trunc) gene expression was regulated negatively by the mast cell growth factor stem cell factor (SCF), and its expression was not detected in the SCF receptor gain-of-function human mast cell line HMC-1. Unlike MS4A2, MS4A2(trunc) did not traffic to the cytoplasmic membrane but instead was associated with the nuclear membrane. Overexpression of MS4A2(trunc) induced human lung mast cell death and profoundly inhibited HMC-1 cell proliferation by inducing G(2)-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus, we have identified a novel splice variant of MS4A2 that might be important in the regulation of human mast cell proliferation and survival. This finding demonstrates that the MS4A2 gene has multiple roles, extending beyond the regulation of acute allergic responses. By understanding the mechanisms regulating its function, it might be possible to induce its expression in mast cells in vivo, which could lead to better treatments for diseases such as mastocytosis and asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1990485709,"Recent reports have shown that Ca(2+)/calmodulin (Ca(2+)/CaM) signaling plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. We previously developed a new Ca(2+)/CaM antagonist, HBC (4-{3,5-bis-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl}benzoic acid), from a curcumin-based synthetic chemical library. Here, we investigated its anti-angiogenic activity and mode of action. HBC potently inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells with no cytotoxicity. Furthermore, HBC blocked in vitro characteristics of angiogenesis such as tube formation and chemoinvasion, as well as neovascularization of the chorioallantoic membrane of growing chick embryos in vivo. Notably, HBC markedly inhibited expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) at the translational level during hypoxia, thereby reducing HIF-1 transcriptional activity and expression of its major target gene, vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, combination treatment with HBC and various HIF-1 inhibitors, including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, rapamycin, and terpestacin, had greater anti-angiogenic activity than treatment with each single agent. Collectively, our findings indicate that HBC is a new anti-angiogenic agent targeting HIF that can be used to explore the biological role of Ca(2+)/CaM in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2080917615,"The oncogenic protein BCL-3 activates or represses gene transcription through binding with the NF-kappaB proteins p50 and p52 and is degraded through a phospho- and GSK3-dependent pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying its degradation remain poorly understood. Yeast two-hybrid analysis led to the identification of the proteasome subunit PSMB1 as a BCL-3-associated protein. The binding of BCL-3 to PSMB1 is required for its degradation through the proteasome. Indeed, PSMB1-depleted cells are defective in degrading polyubiquitinated BCL-3. The N-terminal part of BCL-3 includes lysines 13 and 26 required for the Lys(48)-linked polyubiquitination of BCL-3. Moreover, the E3 ligase FBW7, known to polyubiquitinate a variety of substrates phosphorylated by GSK3, is dispensable for BCL-3 degradation. Thus, our data defined a unique motif of BCL-3 that is needed for its recruitment to the proteasome and identified PSMB1 as a key protein required for the proteasome-mediated degradation of a nuclear and oncogenic IkappaB protein."
https://openalex.org/W1990212010,"The Syk tyrosine kinase family plays an essential role in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signaling. The binding of Syk to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM subunits of immunoreceptors, such as FcepsilonRI on mast cells, results in a conformational change, with an increase of enzymatic activity of Syk. This conformational change exposes the COOH-terminal tail of Syk, which has three conserved Tyr residues (Tyr-623, Tyr-624, and Tyr-625 of rat Syk). To understand the role of these residues in signaling, wild-type and mutant Syk with these three Tyr mutated to Phe was expressed in Syk-deficient mast cells. There was decreased FcepsilonRI-induced degranulation, nuclear factor for T cell activation and NFkappaB activation with the mutated Syk together with reduced phosphorylation of MAP kinases p38 and p42/44 ERK. In non-stimulated cells, the mutated Syk was more tyrosine phosphorylated predominantly as a result of autophosphorylation. In vitro, there was reduced binding of mutated Syk to phosphorylated ITAM due to this increased phosphorylation. This mutated Syk from non-stimulated cells had significantly reduced kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate, whereas its autophosphorylation capacity was not affected. However, the kinase activity and the autophosphorylation capacity of this mutated Syk were dramatically decreased when the protein was dephosphorylated before the in vitro kinase reaction. Furthermore, mutation of these tyrosines in the COOH-terminal region of Syk transforms it to an enzyme, similar to its homolog ZAP-70, which depends on other tyrosine kinases for optimal activation. In testing Syk mutated singly at each one of the tyrosines, Tyr-624 but especially Tyr-625 had the major role in these reactions. Therefore, these results indicate that these tyrosines in the tail region play a critical role in regulating the kinase activity and function of Syk."
https://openalex.org/W2170084714,"HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) is crucial to ketogenesis, and inherited human mutations are potentially lethal. Detailed understanding of the HMGCL reaction mechanism and the molecular basis for correlating human mutations with enzyme deficiency have been limited by the lack of structural information for enzyme liganded to an acyl-CoA substrate or inhibitor. Crystal structures of ternary complexes of WT HMGCL with the competitive inhibitor 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA and of the catalytically deficient HMGCL R41M mutant with substrate HMG-CoA have been determined to 2.4 and 2.2 A, respectively. Comparison of these beta/alpha-barrel structures with those of unliganded HMGCL and R41M reveals substantial differences for Mg(2+) coordination and positioning of the flexible loop containing the conserved HMGCL ""signature"" sequence. In the R41M-Mg(2+)-substrate ternary complex, loop residue Cys(266) (implicated in active-site function by mechanistic and mutagenesis observations) is more closely juxtaposed to the catalytic site than in the case of unliganded enzyme or the WT enzyme-Mg(2+)-3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA inhibitor complex. In both ternary complexes, the S-stereoisomer of substrate or inhibitor is specifically bound, in accord with the observed Mg(2+) liganding of both C3 hydroxyl and C5 carboxyl oxygens. In addition to His(233) and His(235) imidazoles, other Mg(2+) ligands are the Asp(42) carboxyl oxygen and an ordered water molecule. This water, positioned between Asp(42) and the C3 hydroxyl of bound substrate/inhibitor, may function as a proton shuttle. The observed interaction of Arg(41) with the acyl-CoA C1 carbonyl oxygen explains the effects of Arg(41) mutation on reaction product enolization and explains why human Arg(41) mutations cause drastic enzyme deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1990021724,"Although the induction of genome integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has been reported, c-Myc was still required for the efficient generation of these cells. Herein, we report mouse strain-dependent differences in the c-Myc dependence for iPSC generation and the successful generation of genome integration-free iPSCs without c-Myc transduction using C57BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We performed 49 independent experiments and obtained a total of 24 iPSC clones, including 18 genome integration-free iPSC clones. These iPSCs were indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells and from iPSCs generated using other methods. Furthermore, the generation of three-factor iPSCs free of virus vectors revealed the contribution of c-Myc to the genomic integration of external genes. C57BL/6 is an inbred mouse strain with substantial advantages for use in genetic and molecular biological studies due to its use in the whole mouse genome sequencing project. Thus, the present series of C57BL/6 iPSCs generated by various procedures will serve as a valuable resource for future genetic studies of iPSC generation."
https://openalex.org/W2028864907,"Kinesin motor proteins use an ATP hydrolysis cycle to perform various functions in eukaryotic cells. Many questions remain about how the kinesin mechanochemical ATPase cycle is fine-tuned for specific work outputs. In this study, we use isothermal titration calorimetry and stopped-flow fluorometry to determine and analyze the thermodynamics of the human kinesin-5 (Eg5/KSP) ATPase cycle. In the absence of microtubules, the binding interactions of kinesin-5 with both ADP product and ATP substrate involve significant enthalpic gains coupled to smaller entropic penalties. However, when the wild-type enzyme is titrated with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog or the enzyme is mutated such that it is able to bind but not hydrolyze ATP, substrate binding is 10-fold weaker than ADP binding because of a greater entropic penalty due to the structural rearrangements of switch 1, switch 2, and loop L5 on ATP binding. We propose that these rearrangements are reversed upon ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release. In addition, experiments on a truncated kinesin-5 construct reveal that upon nucleotide binding, both the N-terminal cover strand and the neck linker interact to modulate kinesin-5 nucleotide affinity. Moreover, interactions with microtubules significantly weaken the affinity of kinesin-5 for ADP without altering the affinity of the enzyme for ATP in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. Together, these results define the energy landscape of a kinesin ATPase cycle in the absence and presence of microtubules and shed light on the role of molecular motor mechanochemistry in cellular microtubule dynamics."
