https://openalex.org/W2027303539,"Sedimentation field flow fractionation is a powerful, new, high-resolution separation method for a wide variety of colloids, micelles, particulates, and soluble macromolecules of biological interest. Advances in instrumentation allow sedimentation field flow fractionation operation with rotor speeds up to 32,000 revolutions per minute ( approximately 85,000 gravities), which permits separation of materials as small as 5 x 10(5) molecular weight, depending on sample density. Compared to conventional centrifugation techniques, the gentle, mass-separating sedimentation field flow fractionation method is capable of higher resolution in shorter times."

The progress being made is illustrated by specific applications in three areas: laser microchemistry, optical disk data storage, and remote sensing."

https://openalex.org/W2008522895,"THE remote ultra-violet part of the spectrum, first investigated by Victor Schumann and since known as the “Schumann region”, has in recent years become of distinct importance in several directions. A knowledge of the vibrations of short wave-lengths is indispensable in the study of spectral series in relation to theories of emission spectra, and it has further been found that photoelectric, photo-chemical, and photo-abiotic processes become much more pronounced in this region. In the present monograph full accounts of the methods and results of observations are given, in an interesting and convenient form by Prof. Lyman, who was among the first to take up and extend the work of Schumann. The first part of the book, referring to the ordinary ultra-violet spectrum included between wave-lengths 4000 and 2000, is a valuable introduction to the larger second part in which the Schumann region is dealt with."
