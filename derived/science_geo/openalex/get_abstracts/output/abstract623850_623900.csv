Neal et al. present a summary of the eruption sequence along with a variety of geophysical observations collected by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The cyclic inflation, deflation, and eventual collapse of the summit was tied to lava eruption from lower East Rift Zone fissures. A total volume of 0.8 cubic kilometers of magma erupted, roughly the equivalent of 320,000 swimming pools, which matched the change in volume at the summit. Science , this issue p. 367"

Identification of sex-based molecular mechanisms underpinning the female-based prevalence of AD would advance development of therapeutic targets during the prodromal AD phase when prevention or delay in progression is most likely to be effective. This 3-year brain imaging study examines the impact of the menopausal transition on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker changes [brain β-amyloid load via 11C-PiB PET, and neurodegeneration via 18F-FDG PET and structural MRI] and cognitive performance in midlife. Fifty-nine 40-60 year-old cognitively normal participants with clinical, neuropsychological, and brain imaging exams at least 2 years apart were examined. These included 41 women [15 premenopausal controls (PRE), 14 perimenopausal (PERI), and 12 postmenopausal women (MENO)] and 18 men. We used targeted minimum loss-based estimation to evaluate AD biomarker and cognitive changes. Older age was associated with baseline Aβ and neurodegeneration markers, but not with rates of change in these biomarkers. APOE4 status influenced change in Aβ load, but not neurodegenerative changes. Longitudinally, MENO and PERI groups showed declines in estrogen-dependent memory tests as compared to men (p < .04). Adjusting for age, APOE4 status, and vascular risk confounds, the MENO and PERI groups exhibited higher rates of CMRglc decline as compared to males (p ≤ .015). The MENO group exhibited the highest rate of hippocampal volume loss (p's ≤ .001), and higher rates of Aβ deposition than males (p < .01). CMRglc decline exceeded Aβ and atrophy changes in all female groups vs. men. These findings indicate emergence and progression of a female-specific hypometabolic AD-endophenotype during the menopausal transition. These findings suggest that the optimal window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention to prevent or delay progression of AD endophenotype in women is early in the endocrine aging process."

The use of live-attenuated viruses (LAVs) as vaccines during an active outbreak, creates potential ground for coinfection of hosts and emergence of a strain combining genetic fragments of both parental vaccine and field strains. In this study, we analyse the vaccine-like strain LSDV RUSSIA/Saratov/2017 detected in Saratovskaya oblast, a region sharing border with Kazakhstan. To gain insight into possible recombination signals, a full-genome next-generation sequencing of the viral genome was performed using the Illumina platform. The genome contains the backbone of a live-attenuated vaccine with a patchwork of wild-type field virus DNA fragments located throughout. A total of 27 recombination events were identified. The average distance between the recombination sites was 3400 base pairs (bp). The impact of the recombination events on the virulence and transmission capacity of the identified virus remains to be clarified. These findings provide evidence for the first time of genetic exchanges between closely related strains of capripoxviruses in the field and a vaccine strain, and prompt a revisiting of the vaccination issue for a safe and efficacious prevention and control strategy of LSD."
https://openalex.org/W2904375134,"Peroxisomes are essential organelles for the specialized oxidation of a wide variety of fatty acids, but they are also able to degrade fatty acids that are typically handled by mitochondria. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibition and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 genome editing technology to simultaneously manipulate peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in HEK-293 cells, we identified essential players in the metabolic crosstalk between these organelles. Depletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)2 activity through pharmacological inhibition or knockout (KO) uncovered a significant residual peroxisomal oxidation of lauric and palmitic acid, leading to the production of peroxisomal acylcarnitine intermediates. Generation and analysis of additional single- and double-KO cell lines revealed that the D-bifunctional protein (HSD17B4) and the peroxisomal ABC transporter ABCD3 are essential in peroxisomal oxidation of lauric and palmitic acid. Our results indicate that peroxisomes not only accept acyl-CoAs but can also oxidize acylcarnitines in a similar biochemical pathway. By using an Hsd17b4 KO mouse model, we demonstrated that peroxisomes contribute to the plasma acylcarnitine profile after acute inhibition of CPT2, proving in vivo relevance of this pathway. We summarize that peroxisomal FAO is important when mitochondrial FAO is defective or overloaded.—Violante, S., Achetib, N., van Roermund, C. W. T., Hagen, J., Dodatko, T., Vaz, F. M., Waterham, H.

The secretome of the cellulolytic model fungus Trichoderma reesei contains two GH7s, termed TrCel7A and TrCel7B. Despite having high structural and sequence similarities, the two enzymes are functionally quite different. TrCel7A is an exolytic, processive cellobiohydrolase (CBH), with high activity on crystalline cellulose, whereas TrCel7B is an endoglucanase (EG) with a preference for more amorphous cellulose. At the structural level, these functional differences are usually ascribed to the flexible loops that cover the substrate-binding areas. TrCel7A has an extensive tunnel created by eight peripheral loops, and the absence of four of these loops in TrCel7B makes its catalytic domain a more open cleft. To investigate the structure–function relationships of these loops, here we produced and kinetically characterized several variants in which four loops unique to TrCel7A were individually deleted to resemble the arrangement in the TrCel7B structure. Analysis of a range of kinetic parameters consistently indicated that the B2 loop, covering the substrate-binding subsites −3 and −4 in TrCel7A, was a key determinant for the difference in CBH- or EG-like behavior between TrCel7A and TrCel7B. Conversely, the B3 and B4 loops, located closer to the catalytic site in TrCel7A, were less important for these activities. We surmise that these results could be useful both in further mechanistic investigations and for guiding engineering efforts of this industrially important enzyme family.

TrCel7A and TrCel7B are also quite different with respect to their ability to hydrolyze different types of cellulose.

In light of this, it is interesting to consider why structural homologs harbor these functional differences.

TrCel7A has a total of eight such loops that form the tunnel. There are four loops on each side termed A1–A4 and B1–B4, respectively (24Momeni M.H. Payne C.M. Hansson H. Mikkelsen N.E. Svedberg J.

In TrCel7B, four of these loops (A4, B2, B3, and B4) are truncated to an extent where they are essentially absent (23Mertz B. Gu X. Reilly P.J.

This results in a more open and accessible substrate-binding cleft in TrCel7B, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Several earlier studies have suggested that the functional differences between CBHs and EGs can be attributed to loop configuration (25Hobdey S.E. Knott B.C. Haddad Momeni M. Taylor 2nd, L.E.

In the current work, we have investigated the functional role of TrCel7A loops. We focused on the four loops that are absent in TrCel7B and their role in the regulation of CBH- and EG-type activity. Specifically, we conducted comprehensive kinetic studies of the two WTs, TrCel7A and TrCel7B, and a group of TrCel7A variants in which these loops were trimmed individually. Six variants were designed based on pairwise sequence and structural alignments of TrCel7A and TrCel7B. The variants were constructed by systematically deleting individual loops of TrCel7A to mimic the corresponding regions of TrCel7B, as specified in Fig. 1. Three variants with different degree of truncation of the B2 loop were made. One, henceforth termed ΔB2-1, had a 14-amino acid deletion (ΔTrp192–Gly205), whereas the two others had deletions of 13 (ΔGlu193–Gly205) and 6 amino acids (ΔSer196–Thr201), termed ΔB2-2 and ΔB2-3, respectively. Two other variants, termed ΔA4 and ΔB3, had deletions in the A4 loop (ΔAsn384–Ser388) or the B3 loop (ΔGly245–Gly253), respectively. The last variant, named ΔB4, had a deletion of 4 amino acids (ΔGlu335–Phe338). Although this area is not considered part of the B4 loop in the assignment proposed by Momeni et al. (24Momeni M.H.

All variants and their names are listed in Fig. 1, and a more thorough account of the alignment may be found in Fig. S1. We first made a general characterization to assess whether the loop variants were pure, stable, and active. In this work, we used a soluble substrate analog. A more detailed characterization of the activity on real cellulosic substrate will be discussed below. The purified enzymes (WTs and variants) showed a single band in SDS-PAGE, and their monomeric status was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (see Figs. S2 and S3). Next, we measured thermal stability by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the substrate para-nitrophenyl β-d-lactopyranoside (pNPL). Results of this work are listed in Table 1. Stability and kinetic constants for WT TrCel7A were similar to previously reported values (31Olsen J.P. Alasepp K. Kari J. Cruys-Bagger N. Borch K. Westh P. Mechanism of product inhibition for cellobiohydrolase Cel7A during hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose.Biotechnol.

DSC measurements showed that all variants had a small to moderate lowering of the transition temperature, Tm. The most unstable variant was ΔA4, with a loss of Tm of about 10 °C. Functionally, this variant was also severely impaired, and this most likely reflects that the tested truncation of the A4 loop led to major structural changes in the variant. By contrast, the three ΔB2 variants showed moderate decrease in Tm and only small changes in kinetic parameters on pNPL (kcat, Km, and cellobiose inhibition constant Ki; Table 1) compared with WT TrCel7A. The ΔB3 variant had essentially unchanged stability but was different from the WT with respect to kinetic parameters on pNPL. Specifically, kcat, Km, and Ki (cellobiose) were all increased by some 3–5-fold compared with WT TrCel7A. This kinetic behavior for a variant with truncated B3 loop has been reported before (27von Ossowski I. Ståhlberg J. Koivula A. Piens K. Becker D. Boer H. Harle R. Harris M. Divne C. Mahdi S. Zhao Y.

In light of this kinetic resemblance and small changes in Tm, it appears that the ΔB3 variant accommodated the mutation without major structural changes. Finally, the ΔB4 variant showed kinetic parameters on pNPL and an inhibition constant very similar to that of the WT. This also supported the view of a mainly conserved overall fold of the variant, albeit with lowered thermostability (ΔTm = 7.9 °C).Table 1Results from basic characterization of TrCel7A, TrCel7B, and the six loop truncation variantsEnzymeTmkcatKmKi (cellobiose)Type of inhibition°Cs−1mmμmTrCel7A66.90.089 ± 0.0010.78 ± 0.0321 ± 0.8CompetitiveΔA457.7n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.ΔB2-161.90.055 ± 0.0010.89 ± 0.0732 ± 2.3CompetitiveΔB2-262.90.108 ± 0.0020.80 ± 0.0424 ± 1.0CompetitiveΔB2-365.30.079 ± 0.0010.76 ± 0.0322 ± 0.6CompetitiveΔB365.90.283 ± 0.0073.40 ± 0.14133 ± 8MixedaFor mixed inhibition of ΔB3, α, the ratio of the two inhibition constants in the mixed mechanism, was 5.0 ± 2.0.ΔB459.00.080 ± 0.0010.70 ± 0.0346 ± 2CompetitiveTrCel7B65.84.8 ± 0.711.12 ± 2.145300 ± 500Competitivea For mixed inhibition of ΔB3, α, the ratio of the two inhibition constants in the mixed mechanism, was 5.0 ± 2.0. Open table in a new tab In conclusion, the basic characterization suggested that five variants with truncations in either the B2, B3, or B4 loop could accommodate the deletions without major changes in their properties, and we consequently used these variants in the comparative analyses on real insoluble cellulose. The ΔA4 variant, on the other hand, appeared severely changed and hence inapt for further comparisons of loop effects. Microcrystalline cellulose Avicel, which has comparable fractions of crystalline and amorphous cellulose (10Zhang Y.H.P. Lynd L.R. Toward an aggregated understanding of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: noncomplexed cellulase systems.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 88 (15538721): 797-82410.1002/bit.20282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar), was used as substrate for the primary characterization of all enzymes with respect to steady-state kinetics and adsorption. We first used conventional Michaelis–Menten (MM) kinetics, where the initial rate, v0, was estimated in experiments with low enzyme concentration and variable substrate loads. The results (Fig. 2A) were analyzed with respect to the MM equation, v0=Vmax⁡convS0Kmconv+S0(Eq. 1) using nonlinear regression, and the resulting parameters, convVmax/E0 and convKm, are listed in Table 2. The superscript “conv” specifies that these parameters were measured by the conventional approach (i.e. with excess of substrate). Kinetic parameters for TrCel7A on Avicel were in agreement with an earlier study (31Olsen J.P. Alasepp K. Kari J. Cruys-Bagger N. Borch K. Westh P. Mechanism of product inhibition for cellobiohydrolase Cel7A during hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016; 113 (26636743): 1178-118610.1002/bit.25900Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Results for the two WTs in Table 2 showed that the maximal specific rate and the Michaelis constant were an order of magnitude higher for TrCel7B (convVmax/E0 ∼ 2 s−1 and convKm ∼ 44 g/liter) compared with TrCel7A (∼0.2 s−1 and ∼4 g/liter). Interestingly, the specificity constant, convη=Vmax⁡convKmconvE0(Eq. 2) was essentially the same for all enzymes (WTs and variants) (Table 2). This implies that the catalytic efficacy was approximately the same and further supports the view that the variants accommodated the loop truncations without major structural disturbances. Returning to the kinetic parameters of the two WTs, the results were in line with the interpretation that convVmax is limited by slow dissociation from the substrate (5Praestgaard E. Elmerdahl J. Murphy L. Nymand S. McFarland K.C. Borch K. Westh P. A kinetic model for the burst phase of processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2011; 278 (21371261): 1547-156010.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08078.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Jalak J. Väljamäe P.

Bioeng. 2010; 106 (20506147): 871-88310.1002/bit.22779Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and hence that the comparably low maximal rate for TrCel7A is linked to its strong binding to the substrate (34Kari J. Olsen J. Borch K. Cruys-Bagger N. Jensen K. Westh P. Kinetics of cellobiohydrolase (Cel7A) variants with lowered substrate affinity.J. Biol.

This higher affinity of TrCel7A is reflected in a low convKm in Table 2. TrCel7B, on the other hand, binds the substrate less tightly (10-fold higher convKm), and this allows faster dissociation and hence higher convVmax. In the current context, it is interesting to relate this relationship of rate and affinity to loop morphology. Thus, stronger substrate interaction of TrCel7A may rely, at least in part, on the extensive loop coverage of the substrate-binding tunnel, which enables numerous enzyme–ligand contacts that are not found in TrCel7B (29Taylor C.B. Payne C.M. Himmel M.E. Crowley M.F. McCabe C. Beckham G.T. Binding site dynamics and aromatic–carbohydrate interactions in processive and non-processive family 7 glycoside hydrolases.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2013; 117 (23534900): 4924-493310.1021/jp401410hCrossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The additional interactions in TrCel7A manifest themselves in the kinetic data, as argued above, and in the following, we will use this relationship to assess functional roles of the loops from the kinetic properties of the variants. First, we note that deletions in the B3 or B4 loops only brought about marginal changes in convVmax/E0 and convKm. This means that these variants maintained the high substrate affinity and low turnover number that is characteristic for TrCel7A and hence that the B3 and B4 loops were not critical for ligand interaction. By contrast, any of the three tested deletions in the B2 loop significantly increased both convVmax/E0 and convKm (Table 2), suggesting that the B2 loop plays a key role in substrate binding.

The receptor activator of NF-κB (RANKL) was recently identified as a novel progesterone/PR-responsive gene that plays an important role in promoting LM growth. Here, we used RANKL as a representative gene to investigate how steroid hormone, genetic, and epigenetic signals are integrated to regulate LM stem cell (LSC) function. We demonstrated that RANKL specifically upregulates LSC proliferation through activation of Cyclin D1. RANKL gene transcription was robustly induced by the progesterone agonist R5020, leading to a dramatically higher RANKL expression in LM compared to adjacent myometrial (MM) tissue. MethylCap-Seq revealed a differentially methylated region (DMR) adjacent to the distal PR-binding site (PRBS) 87 kb upstream of the RANKL transcription start site. Hypermethylation of the DMR inhibited recruitment of PR to the adjacent PRBS. Luciferase assays indicated that the DMR and distal PRBS constitute a novel RANKL distal regulatory element that actively regulates RANKL expression. Furthermore, MED12 physically interacts with PR in LM tissue. The interaction between MED12 and PR, binding of PR and MED12 to PRBS, and RANKL gene expression are significantly higher in LM containing a distinct MED12 mutation (G44D) than in LM with wild-type MED12. In summary, our findings suggest that DNA methylation and MED12 mutation together constitute a complex regulatory network that affects progesterone/PR-mediated RANKL gene expression, with an important role in activating stem cell proliferation and fibroid tumor development."

PCSeg has a robust pipeline consisting of a pre-processing step, the proposed modified multiphase level set method followed by post-processing steps including the watershed and circular Hough transform to segment clusters of cells of interest and to remove unwanted cells. Our modified level set method utilizes prior information about the probability densities of regions of interest (ROIs) in the color spaces and provides a solution to the minimal-partition problem to segment ROIs in one of the level sets of a two-phase level set formulation. PCSeg tool is tested on a number of microscopic images and provides good segmentation results on single cells as well as efficient segmentation of plasma cell clusters."

The objective of this study was to evaluate point-of-care lung ultrasound as a novel tool to determine the prevalence and early signs of ARDS in a resource-limited setting among patients with severe malaria or sepsis.Serial point-of-care lung ultrasound studies were performed on four consecutive days in a planned sub study of an observational cohort of patients with malaria or sepsis in Bangladesh. We quantified aeration patterns across 12 lung regions. ARDS was defined according to the Kigali Modification of the Berlin Definition.Of 102 patients enrolled, 71 had sepsis and 31 had malaria. Normal lung ultrasound findings were observed in 44 patients on enrolment and associated with 7% case fatality. ARDS was detected in 10 patients on enrolment and associated with 90% case fatality. All patients with ARDS had sepsis, 4 had underlying pneumonia. Two patients developing ARDS during hospitalisation already had reduced aeration patterns on enrolment. The SpO2/FiO2 ratio combined with the number of regions with reduced aeration was a strong prognosticator for mortality in patients with sepsis (AUROC 91.5% (95% Confidence Interval: 84.6%-98.4%)).This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of point-of-care lung ultrasound to detect lung abnormalities in patients with malaria or sepsis in a resource-constrained hospital setting. LUS was highly feasible and allowed to accurately identify patients at risk of death in a resource limited setting."

We have completed a new analysis of land use to reassess the conservation value of lands in two locations in the Mojave Desert where renewable energy development has been most intense: Ivanpah Valley, and the Western Mojave. We found that 99 of our 2.59-km2 planning units were impacted by development such that they would now be categorized as having lower conservation value, and most of these downgrades in conservation value were due to solar and wind development. Solar development alone was responsible for a direct development footprint 86.79 km2: 25.81 km2 of this was primarily high conservation value Bureau of Land Management lands in the Ivanpah Valley, and 60.99 km2 was privately owned lands, mostly of lower conservation value, in the Western Mojave. Our analyses allow us to understand patterns in renewable energy development in the mostly rapidly changing regions of the Mojave Desert. Our analyses also provide a baseline that will allow us to assess the effectiveness of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan in preventing development on lands of high conservation value over the coming decades."

We hypothesized that a narrowly defined PDP (focused on fresh produce) would be easier for shoppers to remember than a broadly defined PDP (focused on any healthy items), resulting in a higher proportion of healthy items purchased. PDPs were placed at the entrance to a supermarket in Mission, South Dakota, United States of America, on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation for alternating time periods, July 9–10, 2017. Sales records from 653 transactions were retrieved from the supermarket, comprising periods in which PDPs were in place and control periods. We examined the proportion of selected items and proportion of total expenditures that were a) any healthy foods and b) fresh fruits and vegetables. Data were analyzed in 2018. The narrowly defined prompt consistently resulted in a higher proportion of items and expenditures on healthy foods than either the broad prompt or the control condition. Shoppers in the narrow prompt condition purchased and spent significantly more on any healthy foods and fresh produce than shoppers in the control condition. While shoppers in the narrow prompt condition purchased more healthy foods and fresh produce than shoppers in the broad prompt condition, the differences were not statistically significant. Shoppers exposed to the narrow PDP consistently purchased more healthy foods than shoppers in a control group, while shoppers in the broad PDP did not, highlighting the importance of considering cognitive processes when designing health promotion messages."

Microneme protein 2 (MIC2), a member of the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family, is a secreted protein important for T. gondii motility, host cell attachment, invasion, and egress. MIC2 contains six thrombospondin type I repeats (TSRs) that are modified by C-mannose and O-fucose in Plasmodium spp. and mammals. Here, using MS analysis, we found that the four TSRs in T. gondii MIC2 with protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) acceptor sites are modified by a dHexHex disaccharide, whereas Trp residues within three TSRs are also modified with C-mannose. Disruption of genes encoding either POFUT2 or the putative GDP–fucose transporter (NST2) resulted in loss of MIC2 O-fucosylation, as detected by an antibody against the GlcFuc disaccharide, and in markedly reduced cellular levels of MIC2. Furthermore, in 10–15% of the Δpofut2 or Δnst2 vacuoles, MIC2 accumulated earlier in the secretory pathway rather than localizing to micronemes. Dissemination of tachyzoites in human foreskin fibroblasts was reduced for these knockouts, which both exhibited defects in attachment to and invasion of host cells comparable with the Δmic2 phenotype. These results, indicating that O-fucosylation of TSRs is required for efficient processing of MIC2 and for normal parasite invasion, are consistent with the recent demonstration that Plasmodium falciparum Δpofut2 strain has decreased virulence and also support a conserved role for this glycosylation pathway in quality control of TSR-containing proteins in eukaryotes.

Activation of the non-canonical inflammasome, mediated by caspase-11, serves as a regulatory pathway for the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and has a key role in pyroptotic cell death. We have previously demonstrated a protective role for caspase-11 during dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, however the importance of caspase-11 during colorectal tumour development remains unclear. Here, we show that Casp11-/- mice are highly susceptible to the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC), compared to their wild type (WT) littermates. We show that deficient IL-18 production occurs at initial inflammation stages of disease, and that IL-1β production is more significantly impaired in Casp11-/- colons during established CAC. We identify defective STAT1 activation in Casp11-/- colons during disease progression, and show that IL-1β signalling induces caspase-11 expression and STAT1 activation in primary murine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells. These findings uncover an anti-tumour role for the caspase-11 and the non-canonical inflammasome during CAC, and suggest a critical role for caspase-11, linking IL-1β and STAT1 signalling pathways."

However, interestingly, the physiological substrates in humans are unknown and thus the primary functions of mammalian SCoR remain to be discovered. We recently demonstrated that SNO-CoA is in fact the likely preferred physiological substrate of SCoRs across phylogeny and that mammalian SCoR thereby regulates S-nitrosylation of proteins (9Anand P. Hausladen A. Wang Y.J. Zhang G.F. Stomberski C. Brunengraber H. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Identification of S-nitroso-CoA reductases that regulate protein S-nitrosylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Metabolic reprogramming by the S-nitroso-CoA reductase system protects against kidney injury.Nature. 2018; (30487609)10.1038/s41586-018-0749-z10.1038/s41586-018-0749-zGoogle Scholar). Thus, the SNO-CoA/SCoR system may play a newly discovered role in cellular metabolism. The emerging paradigm wherein specificity in S-nitrosylation signaling derives, at least in part, from differential reactivities of LMW-SNOs, predicts a molecular basis for SNO recognition by LMW-SNO denitrosylases. However, structure-function relationships for LMW-SNO denitrosylases remain largely unexplored. Thus, there is a general lack of understanding of how denitrosylases recognize their substrates within the cellular milieu. In particular, it remains unclear if these interactions depend on the R groups in RSNOs (e.g. GSH or CoA) and/or whether proteins may recognize the SNO moiety. Here we use molecular modeling and mutagenic analyses to determine the molecular mechanisms by which SCoRs bind and metabolize SNO-CoA. We then utilize mutant SCoR that is unable to bind SNO-CoA to identify novel targets of SNO-CoA–mediated S-nitrosylation in cellular systems, and to assess the role of SCoR in mitochondrial metabolism. To understand how SCoR recognizes SNO-CoA, we performed molecular modeling of SNO-CoA and the SCoR (AKR1A1) active-site to identify amino acids potentially mediating the SCoR–SNO-CoA interaction. Docking of SNO-CoA to the SCoR active-site produced two possible binding modes (Fig. 1, A and B) with the SNO group oriented toward NADPH and the catalytic Tyr-50 (14Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Grimshaw C.E. Bohren K.M. Mechanism of human aldehyde reductase: characterization of the active site pocket.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7669785): 11264-1127510.1021/bi00035a036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Multiple charged or aromatic residues surrounding the SCoR active-site (Fig. 1, A and B, labeled in red) were predicted to either hydrogen bond with SNO-CoA or facilitate interaction of SCoR with SNO-CoA via van der Waals forces. Active-site binding modes for dl-glyceraldehyde and glucuronate were also obtained by docking calculations (Fig. 1, C and D). In accordance with previous work demonstrating a marked increase in Km for glucuronate reduction upon mutation of Arg-312 (15Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. The C-terminal loop of aldehyde reductase determines the substrate and inhibitor specificity.Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (8916913): 14276-1428010.1021/bi9619740Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), our model of glucuronate binding the SCoR active-site shows a strong interaction between the glucuronate carboxylic acid group and Arg-312, providing a level of confidence in our modeling results. To test the role of the putative SNO-CoA–binding residues (Fig. 1, red amino acids) in mediating the SCoR–SNO-CoA interaction, we generated and purified recombinant (see “Experimental procedures”) WT (SCoRWT) and mutant SCoRs (Fig. S1) involving multiple putative substrate-interacting residues, and assessed the impact of these mutations on in vitro reduction of SNO-CoA and dl-glyceraldehyde. Mutations varyingly altered the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of SCoR for both SNO-CoA and dl-glyceraldehyde (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Notably, SCoRK127A resulted in an ∼90% reduction in SCoR catalytic efficiency for SNO-CoA with no effect on that of dl-glyceraldehyde (Fig. 2A). This selective reduction in catalytic efficiency was mediated primarily by an ∼7-fold increase in Km (with only a modest reduction in Kcat) (Fig. 2C and Table 1). SCoRK127A did not alter Km or Kcat for dl-glyceraldehyde (Fig. 2B and Table 1) and only modestly reduced Kcat for glucuronate (Fig. 2D and Table 1). Diminished SNO-CoA turnover with unaltered dl-glyceraldehyde reduction by SCoRK127A was confirmed by following NADPH consumption over 10 min (Fig. S2). Importantly, mutation of the active-site Tyr-50 abolished SCoR SNO-CoA reductase activity (Fig. S2), consistent with the previously identified role of Tyr-50 in the catalytic mechanism of SCoR (14Barski O.A.

Open table in a new tab Based on the crystal structure of SCoR, Lys-127 lies distant from the active-site (compared with other tested residues) and modeling does not predict an interaction of Lys-127 with either dl-glyceraldehyde or glucuronate (Fig. 1). Furthermore, mutation of Lys-97 (not shown in Fig. 1), which resides on the same surface as the SCoR active-site (although further away than Lys-127), does not alter SNO-CoA or dl-glyceraldehyde reduction by SCoR (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Importantly, Lys-127 is highly conserved among mammalian SCoRs (Fig. 2E), suggesting a key role for SCoR-regulated SNO-CoA signaling in mammals. These results demonstrate that among the tested substrates (including many previously studied substrates (14Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Grimshaw C.E. Bohren K.M. Mechanism of human aldehyde reductase: characterization of the active site pocket.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7669785): 11264-1127510.1021/bi00035a036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Branlant G.

We next sought to determine how Lys-127 interacts with SNO-CoA to facilitate reduction by SCoR. One binding mode of SNO-CoA (Fig. 1A) predicted a hydrogen bond between Lys-127 and the 3′-phosphate of the 3′-phospho-ADP component of CoA; a second binding mode had the diphosphate linker of SNO-CoA interacting with Lys-127 (Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that if binding mode 1 is correct, SCoRWT would not effectively metabolize dephospho-SNO-CoA (SNO-CoA lacking the 3′-phosphate). However, reaction of dephospho-SNO-CoA with SCoRWT produced no change in Km and only a modest reduction in Kcat (Fig. 3A and Table 1), indicating that this predicted hydrogen bond is not a primary driver of the interaction between SCoR and SNO-CoA (although it may affect turnover rate). Thus, it is more likely that Lys-127 interacts with the diphosphate linker in the CoA moiety of SNO-CoA, as predicted from binding mode 2 in Fig. 1B, where Lys-127 is ∼3.0 Å from the CoA diphosphate and makes many favorable interactions with the CoA backbone. The structure of the AKR superfamily is defined by a TIM barrel with interspersing loops, and variations in these loop regions provide specificity to the enzymes (12Barski O.A. Tipparaju S.M. Bhatnagar A. The aldo-keto reductase superfamily and its role in drug metabolism and detoxification.Drug Metab. Rev. 2008; 40 (18949601): 553-62410.1080/03602530802431439Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. The C-terminal loop of aldehyde reductase determines the substrate and inhibitor specificity.Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (8916913): 14276-1428010.1021/bi9619740Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lys-127 resides on a large loop between β-sheet 4 and α-helix 4 (of the TIM barrel), and provides a solvent-exposed positive charge (lost upon mutation to Ala) that could promote interaction of SNO-CoA with SCoR (Fig. S3, A and B). To test the requirement of a positively charged residue at this position, we substituted Lys-127 with Arg (Fig. S3C) and assessed the ability of SCoRK127R to metabolize SNO-CoA. Reaction of SNO-CoA with SCoRK127R produced no change in Km and only a modest decrease in Kcat (Fig. 3B and Table 1). We further explored the requirement of a positive charge at residue 127 to facilitate the SNO-CoA–SCoR interaction by assessing the ability of SCoRWT, SCoRK127A, and SCoRK127R to bind bead-bound CoA and SNO-CoA. Both SCoRWT and SCoRK127R, but not SCoRK127A, efficiently bound CoA and SNO-CoA beads (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these results demonstrate that a positively charged residue at position 127 is sufficient to drive the majority of the SCoR–SNO-CoA interaction, and that this interaction is mediated through the CoA moiety in SNO-CoA (likely through interaction with the diphosphate of the 3′-phospho-ADP component of CoA, as seen in Fig. 1B). Similar to the reaction of SCoRWT with dephospho-SNO-CoA, reaction of SCoRK127R with SNO-CoA modestly lowered Kcat (Table 1). Thus, the role of Lys-127 in SNO-CoA metabolism is likely 2-fold: (i) direct substrate recognition via the CoA diphosphate moiety and (ii) specific interaction between Lys-127 (as opposed to other positively charged residues) and the 3′-phosphate of CoA to facilitate optimal substrate turnover. By contrast, two mutations (SCoRK23A and SCoRW220A) increased SCoR catalytic efficiency for SNO-CoA by increasing Kcat without altering Km (Fig. 2A and Table S1). These mutant enzymes also bound SNO-CoA beads as effectively as SCoRWT (Fig. S4, A and B), consistent with unaltered Km values. Notably, we also observed that SCoRWT bound SNO-CoA more effectively than CoA (Fig. 3, C and E), implying that SCoR interacts with the SNO moiety. Because the SNO group in SNO-CoA is part of cysteamine (Fig. 3F, top), we reasoned that SCoR might also metabolize SNO-cysteamine. Indeed, SCoR reduces SNO-cysteamine (Fig. 3F, bottom, and Table 1), albeit with a higher Km and lower Kcat compared with SNO-CoA. Interestingly, the Km of SCoRWT for SNO-cysteamine is similar to that of SCoRK127A for SNO-CoA (Table 1). These data point to the importance of the CoA moiety for effective SNO binding and turnover by SCoR. As a further test of SCoR substrate recognition, we explored competitive inhibition of SNO-CoA reductase activity by CoA and acetyl-CoA (an alternative CoA derivative), finding both to be weak inhibitors (Fig. 3G). Using 100 μm SNO-CoA, CoA and acetyl-CoA exhibited IC50 values of 1.85 and 10.4 mm, respectively (Fig. 3G). Taken together, our results indicate that SCoR interacts with both the CoA and SNO moieties in SNO-CoA. Thus, SCoR preferentially acts on SNO-CoA and is unlikely to be inhibited by CoA or its derivatives at cytosolic concentrations, allowing SCoR to serve its physiological function as a SNO-CoA reductase.

AKR1A1 constitutes ∼90–95% of NADPH-dependent SNO-CoA reductase activity in murine kidney lysate (Fig. 4A), and addition of recombinant WT SCoR rescued NADPH-dependent SNO-CoA reductase activity in SCoR-null kidney lysate to a greater degree than recombinant SCoRK127A (Fig. 4A). Utilizing the difference between SCoRWT and SCoRK127A activity, we sought to identify targets of SNO-CoA–mediated S-nitrosylation. SNO-CoA treatment of kidney lysate greatly enhanced whole cell protein S-nitrosylation, as visualized by Imperial staining following SNO-RAC (19Forrester M.T. Thompson J.W. Foster M.W. Nogueira L. Moseley M.A. Stamler J.S. Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylation and denitrosylation by resin-assisted capture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 (19483679): 557-55910.1038/nbt.1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4), and this increase was abrogated by the co-addition of NADPH to WT, and to a lesser degree SCoR-null, lysate (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 5). Addition of recombinant SCoRWT, but not recombinant SCoRK127A, to SCoR-deficient kidney lysate greatly reduced SNO-CoA-induced S-nitrosylation (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7). SNO-proteins regulated by SCoR-dependent metabolism of SNO-CoA (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7) were trypsin-digested and identified by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-coupled LC-coupled tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) (Dataset S1), providing a genetically-validated list of mammalian targets of SNO-CoA–mediated S-nitrosylation. To identify endogenous targets of SCoR-dependent denitrosylation we developed a tractable cellular model in HEK293 cells. We deleted endogenous SCoR utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system and stably overexpressed SCoRWT, SCoRY50A (catalytically dead), or SCoRK127A in SCoR-deficient cells (Fig. 5A; Fig. S5). Both SCoRWT and SCoRK127A (but not SCoRY50A) rescued SCoR-mediated dl-glyceraldehyde reduction (Fig. 5B, top); by contrast, only SCoRWT rescued SCoR–mediated SNO-CoA reduction (Fig. 5B, bottom). Following transient overexpression of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), SNO-proteins were enriched by SNO-RAC and identified by iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS, and the nitrosoproteomes from SCoRWT and SCoRK127A stable cells were compared (Dataset S2). Notably, 50 of the 123 SNO-proteins (∼40%) identified as substrates of SCoR in HEK293 cells were also identified as targets of SNO-CoA in mouse kidney lysates (Dataset S3). Dataset S3 revealed overrepresentation of proteins involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, protein folding, and other cellular metabolic processes (Dataset S3). We validated a top subset of putative targets of SCoR-dependent denitrosylation, including ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 (Ube1a/b), α-enolase (ENO1), lactate dehydrogenase A chain (LDHA), and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Analysis by SNO-RAC coupled to Western blotting demonstrated that SCoRWT, but not SCoRK127A or SCoRY50A, lowered the levels of endogenous, iNOS-derived SNO-Ube1a/b, SNO-FASN, SNO-ENO1, and SNO-LDHA (Fig. 5C), identifying these proteins as targets of SNO-CoA–mediated (and SCoR-regulated) S-nitrosylation. We also assessed whether reduced SNO-CoA binding by SCoRK127A would manifest in changes in S-nitrosylation by endogenous nitric oxide or with low concentrations of NO derived from the long half-life nitric oxide donor DETA-NONOate. Cells expressing SCoRK127A displayed enhanced basal S-nitrosylation of two CoA-dependent enzymes, SNO-FASN and SNO-ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and SNO-FASN and SNO-ACLY levels increased upon treatment with DETA-NONOate in SCoRK127A, but not SCoRWT, expressing cells (Fig. 5D). Additionally, SNO-Ube1a/b and SNO-pyruvate kinase M2 (a known SCoR target (27Zhou H. Zhang R. Anand P. Stomberski C.T. Qian Z. Hausladen A. Wang L. Rhee E.P. Parikh S.M. Karumanchi S.A. Stamler J.S.

Furthermore, we evaluated SCoR activating mutations (K23A and W220A) to determine whether SCoR function is limited by enzyme turnover. Overexpression of SCoRK23A and SCoRW220A increased SNO-CoA reductase activity in cell lysates (Fig. S6, A and B), consistent with in vitro enzyme kinetics (Fig. 2A and Table 1). However, neither SCoRK23A nor SCoRW220A had added effect on SNO-FASN, SNO-ACLY, or SNO-GAPDH levels under basal conditions or in cells treated with DETA-NONOate (Fig. S6C), indicating that SCoR-mediated denitrosylation at baseline and under conditions of nitrosative stress is likely not limited by enzyme turnover. Taken together, our results suggest that SNO-CoA exists in equilibrium with myriad SNO-proteins across cellular processes to regulate protein S-nitrosylation, with SCoR controlling these equilibria via reduction of SNO-CoA. We were interested to know if SCoR-mediated denitrosylation of proteins (Dataset S3) alters mitochondrial metabolism. Utilizing the Seahorse analyzer platform, we measured oxygen consumption rate (OCR, a measure of mitochondrial respiration) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, largely a measure of cellular glycolysis) in SCoR-KO cells stably expressing SCoRWT or SCoRK127A. Cells expressing SCoRK127A displayed enhanced basal OCR (Fig. 6, A and C). Treatment with DETA-NONOate reduced OCR in both SCoRK127A and SCoRWT cells, potentially due to SCoR-independent inhibitory S-nitrosylation of respiratory chain components (20Brown G.C. Cooper C.E.

We evaluated the relationship between statin therapy, mortality, and subclinical atherosclerosis.In the CONFIRM study, patients with normal or non-obstructive plaque (<50% diameter stenosis) for whom data on baseline statin use was available were included. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) was quantified using the Agatston score. The extent of non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis was quantified using the segment involvement score (SIS). 8,016 patients were followed for a median of 2.5 years with analysis of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, target vessel revascularization, and coronary artery disease-related hospitalization.1.2% of patients experienced all-cause mortality. Patients not on baseline statin therapy had a stepwise increased risk of all-cause mortality by CAC (relative to CAC = 0; CAC 1-99: hazard ratio [HR] 1.65, CAC 100-299: HR 2.19, and CAC≥300: HR 2.98) or SIS (relative to SIS = 0; SIS 1: HR 1.62, SIS 2-3: 2.48 and SIS≥4: 2.95). Conversely, in patients on baseline statin therapy, there was no significant increase in mortality risk with increasing CAC (p value for interaction = 0.049) or SIS (p value for interaction = 0.007). The incidence of MACE was 2.1%. Similar to the all-cause mortality, the risk of MACE was increased with CAC or SIS strata in patient not on baseline statin therapy. However, this relation was not observed in patient on baseline statin therapy.In individuals with non-obstructive coronary artery disease, increased risk of adverse events occurs with increasing CAC or SIS who are not on baseline statin therapy. Statin therapy is associated with a mitigation of risk of cardiac events in the presence of increasing atherosclerosis, with no particular threshold of disease burden."

We report that ubiquitin-specific protease 20 (USP20) deubiquitinates and attenuates lysosomal trafficking of the β1AR. β1AR-induced phosphorylation of USP20 Ser-333 by protein kinase A-α (PKAα) was required for optimal USP20-mediated regulation of β1AR lysosomal trafficking. Both phosphomimetic (S333D) and phosphorylation-impaired (S333A) USP20 possess intrinsic deubiquitinase activity equivalent to WT activity. However, unlike USP20 WT and S333D, the S333A mutant associated poorly with the β1AR and failed to deubiquitinate the β1AR. USP20–KO mice showed normal baseline systolic function but impaired β1AR-induced contractility and relaxation. Dobutamine stimulation did not increase cAMP in USP20–KO left ventricles (LVs), whereas NKH477-induced adenylyl cyclase activity was equivalent to WT. The USP20 homolog USP33, which shares redundant roles with USP20, had no effect on β1AR ubiquitination, but USP33 was up-regulated in USP20–KO hearts suggesting compensatory regulation. Myocardial β1AR expression in USP20–KO was drastically reduced, whereas β2AR expression was maintained as determined by radioligand binding in LV sarcolemmal membranes. Phospho-USP20 was significantly increased in LVs of wildtype (WT) mice after a 1-week catecholamine infusion and a 2-week chronic pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Phospho-USP20 was undetectable in β1AR KO mice subjected to TAC, suggesting a role for USP20 phosphorylation in cardiac response to pressure overload. We conclude that USP20 regulates β1AR signaling in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2904701544,"Background Anisakiasis is a fish-borne zoonosis caused by the ingestion of marine food infected with Anisakis third-stage larvae, widespread marine parasitic nematodes. Gastrointestinal and/or allergic clinical signs and symptoms are not specific. While frequently reported in countries with large raw fish consumption as Japan, the global prevalence of anisakiasis may be severely underestimated due to limitations of available diagnostic tools and to diverse clinical manifestations. Recently, infective larvae were found in the same localization with gastrointestinal tumors. The occurrence of allergic exacerbation upon secondary exposure and the possible occupational exposure, highlight the need to increase scientific evidences on anisakiasis. Methods We performed a retrospective descriptive study using analysis of Hospital Discharge Records (HDRs) from 2005 to 2015 in Italy, with particular attention to allergic manifestations. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses were performed using backward step-wise logistic regression models to assess spatial distribution and temporal trend as well as the variables independently associated with the allergic clinical signs and symptoms in Italian cases of anisakiasis. Results HDRs reporting the ICD-9 code for anisakiasis were retrieved (370), with a higher number of cases reported from central and southern regions, with particular regard to populations inhabiting the coastal territories. Around 40% of patients presented allergic manifestations and half of them showed serious allergic reactions. The multivariate analyses showed an independent association between allergic manifestations and features as living in southern regions and female gender, while anaphylactic episodes was independently associated only with female gender. Conclusion The present study is the first attempt to a better understanding of the epidemiological picture of anisakiasis in Italy, mining official data. A common strategy on data collection, monitoring and reporting would favor a more accurate epidemiological scenario in Italy, since the report of the diseases is not mandatory."

This study aimed to explore how antibiotics were used in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Shaanxi Province, western China from 2013 to 2015.A retrospective study was conducted with a sample of 16 hospitals in Shaanxi Province (2 tertiary and 14 secondary hospitals; 8 public and 8 private hospitals) using a stratified random sampling method. All of the macro data from these hospitals from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed. All collected data were double-entered and analyzed using Excel 2007.The percentage of injectable antibiotic prescriptions was 26.6% of all of the antibiotic prescriptions in the secondary hospitals and 14.2% in the tertiary hospitals. Injectable antibiotic prescriptions in private tertiary hospitals (enter %) were more than two times that of public tertiary hospitals (enter %). In both tertiary and secondary hospitals, the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions for outpatients, emergency patients and inpatients were within the scope of the national standards, while the intensity of antibiotic use was higher than the national standard of 40 DDD/100 bed-days. The prophylactic antibiotic use rate in clean surgery was 40.4% in tertiary hospitals and 60.7% in secondary hospitals, which were both higher than the national standard of 30%. The preventive use rate of antibiotics in private tertiary hospitals (55.00%) was more than two times that of public tertiary hospitals (25.90%), and the rate was also higher in private secondary hospitals (61.50%) than in public secondary hospitals (59.70%).Substantial antibiotic abuse occurred in the sample Chinese hospitals, especially in secondary hospitals. The government should continue to strengthen the administration of antimicrobial use in hospitals. At the same time, medical professional training and interventions for physicians should be conducted to fundamentally reduce the irrational use of antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W2904164534,"The tension in doctor-patient relationships is becoming progressively greater due to the high expectations of patients and the physicians' work pressure. Recent studies have addressed factors which affect the tension of doctor-patient relationships, and our study continues this trend by looking at the influence of resiliency and physician trust in the patient (PTP), that is, how much the doctor trusts the patient.Based on a survey of 329 physicians, a descriptive analysis of measured data was done using SPSS 19.0. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the correlation between PTP and resilience and the demographic variables. KMO and Bartlett methods were used to examine the correlation between PTPS and resilience. The method of factor analysis was used for multicollinearity tests, and multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the demographic factors correlated with PTP and resilience.Our results indicate that the level of PTP is influenced by the age, education, and income of the doctors. Physician age and income are significantly and positively correlated with PTP, but education is significantly and negatively related. Age, education, and income also affect the level of psychological resilience of physicians. Resilience is positively correlated with age and education but is negatively related to income. Resilience positively influences PTP.The direct factors of PTP include resilience, age, education, and income, while gender, title, and hospital department were found to be indirect influencing factors. To meet goals expressed in Chinese government policy related to these issues, we suggest improving the level of education of the doctors, providing reasonable annual salary increases for doctors, easing the tensions involved in medical treatment, reducing the physicians' work pressure, improving the physicians' work environment, and enhancing the physicians' professional sympathy. Through such measures, the level of PTP will be enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W2904600554,"During whole body vibrations, the total contact force in knee and hip joints consists of a static component plus the vibration-induced dynamic component. In two different cohorts, these forces were measured with instrumented joint implants at different vibration frequencies and amplitudes. For three standing positions on two platforms, the dynamic forces were compared to the static forces, and the total forces were related to the peak forces during walking. A biomechanical model served for estimating muscle force increases from contact force increases. The median static forces were 122% to 168% (knee), resp. 93% to 141% (hip), of the body weight. The same accelerations produced higher dynamic forces for alternating than for parallel foot movements. The dynamic forces individually differed much between 5.3% to 27.5% of the static forces in the same positions. On the Powerplate, they were even close to zero in some subjects. The total forces were always below 79% of the forces during walking. The dynamic forces did not rise proportionally to platform accelerations. During stance (Galileo, 25 Hz, 2 mm), the damping of dynamic forces was only 8% between foot and knee but 54% between knee and hip. The estimated rises in muscle forces due to the vibrations were in the same ranges as the contact force increases. These rises were much smaller than the vibration-induced EMG increases, reported for the same platform accelerations. These small muscle force increases, along with the observation that the peak contact and muscle forces during vibrations remained far below those during walking, indicate that dynamic muscle force amplitudes cannot be the reason for positive effects of whole body vibrations on muscles, bone remodelling or arthritic joints. Positive effects of vibrations must be caused by factors other than raised forces amplitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2905368910,"Killer whales have a cosmopolitan distribution and as a species are generalists, feeding on a variety of prey. However, local populations tend to specialise on specific prey types. In Icelandic waters, killer whales are generally associated with herring and, thus, have been presumed to be herring specialists. However, recent studies suggest a more complex foraging ecology, possibly including a mosaic of strategies. With increased observational effort in recent years due to research and whale-watching activities, there have been several reports of interactions with different prey, including confirmed predation events. In this study we aimed to summarise the range of potential prey of killer whales observed in Icelandic waters. We report on 12 previously unpublished accounts and review 15 accounts published in the scientific literature or local newspapers, making a total of 27 events where killer whales were observed interacting with actual or potential prey. Thirteen different species, including birds (n = 1), cephalopods (n = 1), fish (n = 5) and marine mammals (n = 6), are reported, although herring is by far the species that killer whales are most often observed interacting with. This study provides the first summary of actual and suspected killer whale prey in Icelandic waters, and contributes towards our understanding of this population’s prey preferences. However, describing the diet of individuals/groups was not possible and this study points to a need for continued monitoring to understand the intricacies of killer whale foraging behaviour in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2904533531,"Seasonal and human physiological changes are important factors in the development of many diseases. But, the study of genuine seasonal impact on these diseases is difficult to measure due to many other environment and lifestyle factors which directly affect these diseases. However, several clinical studies have been conducted in different parts of the world, and it has clearly indicated that certain groups of population are highly subjected to seasonal changes, and their maladaptation can possibly lead to several disorders/diseases. Thus, it is crucial to study the significant seasonal sensitive diseases spread across the human population. To narrow down these disorders/diseases, the study hypothesized that high altitude (HA) associated diseases and disorders are of the strong variants of seasonal physiologic changes. It is because, HA is the only geographical condition for which humans can develop very efficient physiological adaptation mechanism called acclimatization. To study this hypothesis, PubMed was used to collect the HA associated symptoms and disorders. Disease Ontology based semantic similarity network (DSN) and disease-drug networks were constructed to narrow down the benchmark diseases and disorders of HA. The DSN which was further subjected to different community structure analysis uncovered the highly associated or possible comorbid diseases of HA. The predicted 12 lifestyle diseases were assumed to be “seasonal (sensitive) comorbid lifestyle diseases (SCLD)”. A time series analyses on Google Search data of the world from 2004–2016 was conducted to investigate whether the 12 lifestyle diseases have seasonal patterns. Because, the trends were sensitive to the term used as benchmark; the temporal relationships among the 12 disease search volumes and their temporal sequences similarity by dynamic time warping analyses was used to predict the comorbid diseases. Among the 12 lifestyle diseases, the study provides an indirect evidence in the existence of severe seasonal comorbidity among hypertension, obesity, asthma and fibrosis diseases, which is widespread in the world population. Thus, the present study has successfully addressed this issue by predicting the SCLD, and indirectly verified them among the world population using Google Search Trend. Furthermore, based on the SCLD seasonal trend, the study also classified them as severe, moderate, and mild. Interestingly, seasonal trends of the severe seasonal comorbid diseases displayed an inverse pattern between USA (Northern hemisphere) and New Zealand (Southern hemisphere). Further, knowledge in the so called “seasonal sensitive populations” physiological response to seasonal triggers such as winter, summer, spring, and autumn become crucial to modulate disease incidence, disease course, or clinical prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2904420766,"Mindfulness practices are increasingly being utilized as a method for cultivating well-being. The term mindfulness is often used as an umbrella for a variety of different practices and many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) contain multiple styles of practice. Despite the diversity of practices within MBIs, few studies have investigated whether constituent practices produce specific effects. We randomized 156 undergraduates to one of four brief practices: breath awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude, or to an attention control condition. We assessed practice effects on affect following brief training, and effects on affect and behavior after provocation with a stressor (i.e., Cold pressor test). Results indicate that gratitude training significantly improved positive affect compared to breath awareness (d = 0.58) and loving-kindness led to significantly greater reductions in implicit negative affect compared to the control condition (d = 0.59) immediately after brief practice. In spite of gains in positive affect, the gratitude group demonstrated increased reactivity to the stressor, reporting the CPT as significantly more aversive than the control condition (d = 0.46) and showing significantly greater increases in negative affect compared to the breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, respectively). Greater gains in implicit positive affect following gratitude training predicted decreased post-stressor likability ratings of novel neutral faces compared to breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = - 0.39, -0.40, -0.33, respectively) as well. Moreover, the gratitude group was significantly less likely to donate time than the loving-kindness group in an ecologically valid opportunity to provide unrewarded support. These data suggest that different styles of contemplative practice may produce different effects in the context of brief, introductory practice and these differences may be heightened by stress. Implications for the study of contemplative practices are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2904713072,"The success of Staphylococcus aureus as a pathogen is due in part to its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions using signal transduction pathways, such as metabolite- responsive regulators and two-component systems. S. aureus has a two-component system encoded by the gene pair sav0224 (hptS) and sav0223 (hptR) that regulate the hexose phosphate transport (uhpT) system in response to extracellular glucose-6-phosphate. Glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate are important carbon sources that also modulate the activity of the global metabolite-responsive transcriptional regulator CcpA. Because uhpT has a putative CcpA binding site in its promoter and it is regulated by HptR, it was hypothesized the regulons of CcpA and HptR might intersect. To determine if the regulatory domains of CcpA and HptRS overlap, ccpA was deleted in strains SA564 and SA564-ΔhptRS and growth, metabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional differences were assessed. As expected, CcpA represses hptS and hptR in a glucose dependent manner; however, upon CcpA derepression, the HptRS system functions as a transcriptional activator of metabolic genes within the CcpA regulon. Importantly, inactivation of ccpA and hptRS altered sensitivity to fosfomycin and ampicillin in the absence of exogenous glucose-6-phosphate, indicating that both CcpA and HptRS modulate antibiotic susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2904983706,"Active search for prey is energetically costly, so understanding how foragers optimize search has been central to foraging theory. Some theoretical work has suggested that foragers of randomly distributed prey should search using Lévy flights, while work on area-restricted and intermittent search strategies has demonstrated that foragers can use the information provided by prey encounters to more effectively adapt search direction and velocity. Previous empirical comparisons of these search modes have tended to rely on distribution-level analyses, due to the difficulty of collecting event-level data on encounters linked to the GPS tracks of foragers. Here we use a preliminary event-level data-set (18.7 hours of encounter-annotated focal follows over 6 trips) to show that two Colombian blowgun hunters use adaptive encounter-conditional heuristics, not non-conditional Lévy flights, when searching for prey. Using a theoretically derived Bayesian model, we estimate changes in turning-angle and search velocity as a function of encounters with prey at lagged time-steps, and find that: 1) hunters increase average turning-angle in response to encounters, producing a more tortuous search of patches of higher prey density, but adopt more efficient uni-directional, inter-patch movement after failing to encounter prey over a sufficient period of time; and, 2) hunters reduce search velocity in response to encounters, causing them to spend more of their search time in patches with demonstrably higher prey density. These results illustrate the importance of using event-level data to contrast encounter-conditional, area-restricted search and Lévy flights in explaining the search behavior of humans and other organisms."

Nuclear accumulation of mutant huntingtin is a hallmark of HD, resulting in elevated mutant huntingtin levels in cell nuclei. Huntingtin is normally retained at the endoplasmic reticulum via its N17 amphipathic α-helix domain but is released by oxidation of Met-8 during reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Huntingtin enters the nucleus via an importin β1– and 2–dependent proline–tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS), which has a unique intervening sequence in huntingtin. Here, we have identified the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein as an interactor of the intervening sequence within the PY-NLS. Nuclear levels of HMGB1 positively correlated with varying levels of nuclear huntingtin in both HD and normal human fibroblasts. We also found that HMGB1 interacts with the huntingtin N17 region and that this interaction is enhanced by the presence of ROS and phosphorylation of critical serine residues in the N17 region. We conclude that HMGB1 is a huntingtin N17/PY-NLS ROS-dependent interactor, and this protein bridging is essential for relaying ROS sensing by huntingtin to its nuclear entry during ROS stress.

https://openalex.org/W2903749275,"Malaria cases sometimes go undetected using RDTs due to their inaccurate use, poor storage conditions and failure to detect low parasitaemia (<50parasites/μL). This could result in continuous transmission of malaria and sustenance of parasite reservoirs. Molecular diagnostic tools are more sensitive and specific than RDTs in the detection of plasmodium parasites. However, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is not routinely used because equipment and reagents are expensive and requires highly skilled personnel. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a relatively new molecular diagnostic tool for malaria with all the advantages of PCR (sensitive and specific) without the mentioned disadvantages. However, it has not been evaluated extensively as a point of care diagnostic in the field. One hundred and fifteen used RDTs were collected from health facilities in Northern Namibia in a blind study and PCR and LAMP were used to determine the presence of Plasmodium DNA. The sensitivities and PPV were 40.91% and 90% respectively for RDTs, 72.73% and 100% respectively for PCR with LAMP as the golden standard. In low malaria transmission settings, LAMP can be also be considered for use as a surveillance tool to detect all sources of malaria and determine proportion of low parasitaemia infections in order to eliminate them."

Because the mechanisms that contribute to the sympatry of these three species of crab have not been identified, this study investigated the three most likely explanations: niche differences, competition, and predation. The results showed that the three species displayed niche differences in terms of seasonal activity, habitat, utilization of shells, and food preference, suggesting that competition for resources is avoided. The habitat of terrestrial hermit crabs in Taiwan is closely associated with that of humans.

https://openalex.org/W2904045480,"SRC-family kinases (SFKs) have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their mode of action was scarcely understood. Here, we show that LYN plays an essential role in amyloid β (Aβ)-triggered neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation by phosphorylating Fcγ receptor IIb2 (FcγRIIb2). We found that enzyme activity of LYN was increased in the brain of AD patients and was promoted in neuronal cells exposed to Aβ 1–42 (Aβ1–42). Knockdown of LYN expression inhibited Aβ1–42-induced neuronal cell death. Of note, LYN interacted with FcγRIIb2 upon exposure to Aβ1–42 and phosphorylated FcγRIIb2 at Tyr273 within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in neuronal cells. With the use of the structure-based drug design, we isolated KICG2576, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of LYN. Determination of cocrystal structure illustrated that KICG2576 bound to the cleft in the LYN kinase domain and inhibited LYN with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of 0.15 µM. KICG2576 inhibited Aβ- or FcγRIIb2-induced cell death, and this effect was better than pyrazolopyrimidine 1, a widely used inhibitor of SFK. Upon exposure to Aβ, KICG2576 blocked the phosphorylation of FcγRIIb2 and translocation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 2, a binding protein to the phosphorylated FcγRIIb2, to the plasma membrane, resulting in the inhibition of tau hyperphosphorylation, the downstream event of Aβ1–42-FcγRIIb2 binding. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of KICG2576 into mice ameliorated Aβ-induced memory impairment. These results suggest that LYN plays a crucial role in Aβ1–42-mediated neurotoxicity and tau pathology, providing a therapeutic potential of LYN in AD.—Gwon, Y., Kim, S.-H., Kim, H.

The first experiment was designed to demonstrate the effect of second language proficiency on proactive inhibitory cost and adjustments in control by evaluating previous trial effects. This was achieved by introducing uncertainty about the upcoming event (go or no-go stimulus). High- and low- proficiency Hindi-English bilingual adults participated in the study. Saccadic latencies and errors were taken as the measures of performance. The results demonstrate a significantly lower proactive inhibitory cost and better up-regulation of proactive control under uncertainty among high- proficiency bilinguals. An analysis based on previous trial effects suggests that high- proficiency bilinguals were found to be better at releasing inhibition and adjustments in control, in an ongoing response activity in the case of uncertainty. To further understand the dynamics of proactive inhibitory control as a function of proficiency, the second experiment was designed to test the default versus temporary state hypothesis of proactive inhibitory control. Certain manipulations were introduced in the cued go-no-go task in order to make the upcoming go or no-go trial difficult to predict, which increased the demands on the implementation and maintenance of proactive control. High- proficiency bilinguals were found to rely on a default state of proactive inhibitory control whereas low- proficiency bilinguals were found to rely on temporary/transient proactive inhibition. Language proficiency, as one of the measures of bilingualism, was found to influence proactive inhibitory control and appears to modulate the dynamics of proactive inhibitory control."
https://openalex.org/W2905194354,"The adhesion molecule and co-receptor of receptor tyrosine kinases, CD44, is expressed in all cells of the immune system, but also in numerous non-immune cells. CD44 plays roles in the cellular response to different pathogens. The molecular actions of CD44 during these processes are by and large still unknown. The CD44 molecule undergoes a sequential proteolytic cleavage which leads to the release of a soluble intracellular domain (CD44-ICD). Previous reports had shown that the CD44-ICD is taken up into the nucleus where it enhances transcription of specific target genes. By RNA profiling we identified a CD44-dependent transcriptional increase of interferon-responsive genes, among them IFI16. IFI16 is important in the innate immune response. It senses and binds pathogenic DNA and, together with cGAS, activates the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and induces the expression of genes relevant for the response, e.g. IFN-β. Our results show that the enhancement of IFI16 expression depended on CD44 cleavage. A CD44-negative tumor cell line, embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages from cd44-/- mice were reduced in their response to IFN-γ, to viral DNA fragments and to Listeria monocytogenes infection. We could rescue the deficiency of CD44 negative RPM-MC cells and cd44-/- MEFs by expressing only the soluble CD44-ICD in the absence of any other CD44 domain. Expression of the CD44-ICD carrying a mutation that prevented the uptake into the nucleus, could not rescue the absence of CD44. This molecular aspect of regulation by CD44 may explain part of the immune phenotypes of mice with cd44 gene disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2903796631,"Interest in the individual differences underlying end user computer security behavior has led to the development of a multidisciplinary field of research known as behavioral information security. An important gap in knowledge and the motivation for this research is the development of ways to measure secure and insecure cyber behavior for research and eventually practice. Here we report a study designed to develop a technique for assessing secure and insecure cyber behavior for broad research use. The Susceptibility and Resilience to Cyber Threat (SRCT) is an immersive scenario decision program. The SRCT measures susceptibility to cyber threat and malicious behavior as well protective resilience actions via participant responses/decisions to emails, interactions with security dialogs, and computer actions in a real-world simulation. Data were collected from a sample of 190 adults (76.3% female), between the ages of 18–61 (mean age = 26.12). Personality, behavioral tendencies, and cognitive preferences were measured with standard previously validated protocols and self-report measures. Factor analysis suggested a 5 item secure actions scale and a 9 item insecure actions scale as viable to extract from the SRCT responses. Statistically analyzable distributions of secure and insecure cyber behaviors were obtained, and these subscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency as hypothesized. Associations between SRCT scales and other indices of cyber behavior, as well as self-reported personality, were lower than predicted, suggesting that past research reporting links between self-reports of personality and self-reported cyber-behavior may be overestimating the links for actual cyber actions. However, our exploratory analyses suggest discrepancies between self-report and actions in the SRCT may be an interesting avenue to explore. Overall, results were consistent with theorizing and suggest the technique is viable as a construct measure in future research or as an outcome variable in experimental intervention designs."
https://openalex.org/W2904860800,"Social primates can influence others through the control of resources. For instance, dominant male chimpanzees might allow subordinates access to mate with females in exchange for social support. However, little is known about how chimpanzees strategically use a position of leverage to maximize their own benefits. We address this question by presenting dyads of captive chimpanzee (N = 6) with a task resulting in an unequal reward distribution. To gain the higher reward each individual should wait for their partner to act. In addition, one participant had leverage: access to an alternative secure reward. By varying the presence and value of the leverage we tested whether individuals used it strategically (e.g. by waiting longer for partners to act when they had leverage in the form of alternatives). Additionally, non-social controls served to show if chimpanzees understood the social dilemma. We measured the likelihood to choose the leverage and their latencies to act. The final decision made by the chimpanzees did not differ as a function of condition (test versus non-social control) or the value of the leverage, but they did wait longer to act when the leverage was smaller—particularly in test (versus non-social control) trials suggesting that they understood the conflict of interest involved. The chimpanzees thus recognized the existence of social leverage, but did not use it strategically to maximize their rewards."
https://openalex.org/W2904484292,"Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most frequently used parameter in the assessment of heart failure (HF). Cardiac index (CI) is considered a potential alternative to LVEF despite limited evidence. We aimed to assess and compare the predictive accuracy of LVEF and echocardiographically-assessed CI in HF patients.A single-centre, retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients hospitalized for acute HF from 2010-2016. Cox proportional hazard models including either LVEF or CI were created to predict all cause death, cardiovascular (CV) death, or first HF-readmission. Of 334 patients included in the analysis, 58.7% exhibited HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF). Left ventricular ejection fraction did not show correlation with any endpoint, while CI was predictive of HF-readmission in the entire cohort. Both the LVEF-based and CI-based models demonstrated moderate discriminative accuracy when predicting all-cause death, CV death, or HF-readmission. Left ventricular ejection fraction proved to be an independent predictor of CV mortality in HFrEF-patients, while CI was predictive of HF-readmission in the non-HFrEF group.Left ventricular ejection fraction seemed to be associated more closely with disease severity in HFrEF, and CI in the non-HFrEF group, in this real-life cohort of elderly HF patients. The LVEF-based and CI-based predictive models have clinically similar predictive accuracy for mortality and HF-readmission, thus CI may be a potential alternative to LVEF in the assessment of left ventricular function. Cardiac index may be an important new tool in the assessment of HF patients with midrange or preserved LVEF."
https://openalex.org/W2904151728,"Spiroergometric measurements of persons who require oxygen insufflation due to illness can be performed under conditions of increased inspiratory oxygen concentration (FIO2). This increase in FIO2, however, often leads to errors in the calculation of oxygen consumption (). These inconsistencies are due to the application of the Haldane Transformation (HT), an otherwise indispensable correction factor in the calculation of that becomes inaccurate at higher FIO2 concentrations. A possible solution to this problem could be the use of the ‘Eschenbacher transformation’ (ET) as an alternative correction factor. This study examines the concentration of FIO2 at which the HT and the ET are valid, providing plausible data of oxygen consumption corresponding to the wattage achieved during cycle ergometry. Ten healthy volunteers underwent spiroergometric testing under standard conditions (FIO2 = 20.9%), as well as at FIO2 = 40% and 80%. When compared with the predicted values of , as calculated according to Wasserman et al. (2012), the data obtained show that both the HT and ET are valid under normal conditions and at an increased FIO2 of 40%. At FIO2 concentrations of 80%, however, the values provided by the HT begin to lose plausibility, whereas the ET continues to provide credible results. We conclude that the use of the ET in place of the HT in spiroergometric measurements with increased FIO2 allows a reliable evaluation of stress tests in patients requiring high doses of supplemental oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2904450757,"Herbivorous mammals and insect pre-dispersal seed predators are two types of herbivores that, despite their functional and morphological differences, tend to severely impact many plant species, highly decreasing their seed production and even imperiling the performance of their offspring through transgenerational effects. However, how they influence offspring resistance to herbivory remains largely unknown. In this study we experimentally examined the effects of ungulates and pre-dispersal seed predators on seed quality as well as on the emergence, survival and resistance to herbivory of the seedlings of a semiarid herb. We found that ungulates reduced seedling recruitment but increased seedling resistance to leaf miners. These effects were probably a consequence of insufficient carbon provisioning in seeds that reduced seed viability and provoked carbon limitation in seedlings. Pre-dispersal seed predators did not influence seedling recruitment, but seedlings from mothers damaged by ungulates and by pre-dispersal seed predators suffered less herbivory by grasshoppers. Remarkably, intra-individual differences in damage by pre-dispersal seed predators affected the rate of damage underwent by seedlings. That is, seedlings derived from fruits attacked by seed predators were more resistant to herbivores than siblings derived from un-attacked fruits in plant populations exposed to ungulates. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting variation in transgenerational-induced resistance of seedlings from the same maternal plant. This study is a valuable contribution to the understanding of transgenerational effects of multiple herbivores and their implications for a deeper comprehension of the natural systems in which they co-occur."
https://openalex.org/W2905373752,"In the past few years, miniature light-level geolocators have been developed for tracking wild bird species that were previously too small to track during their full annual cycle. Geolocators offer an exciting opportunity to study the full annual cycle for many species. However, the potential detrimental effects of carrying geolocators are still poorly understood, especially for small-bodied birds. Here, we deployed light-level geolocators on common yellowthroat warblers (Geothlypis trichas). Over two years, we monitored return rates and neighborhood demography for 40 warblers carrying a geolocator and 20 reference birds that did not carry a geolocator. We compared the two groups with long-term data from 108 unmanipulated birds breeding at the same location in previous and subsequent years. Overall, we found that individuals carrying a geolocator were less likely to return to the study site in the following year (21% to 33% returned, depending on inclusion criteria) than either contemporaneous controls (55%) or long-term controls (55%). Among birds marked with geolocators, we also detected viability selection for greater wing length, whereas this pattern was not present in control birds. Finally, in each year after geolocator deployment, inexperienced breeders colonized vacant territories and this demographic effect persisted for two years after deployment. Sexual selection and ornamentation are strongly age-dependent in this system, and behavioral data collected after geolocator deployment is likely to differ systematically from natural conditions. Clearly geolocators will continue to be useful tools, but we suggest that future studies should carefully consider the potential for biased returns and the ecological validity of behavioral data collected from geolocator marked populations."

https://openalex.org/W2903933165,"Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) is a basic helix-loop-helix 9 (bHLH) transcription factor acting downstream of Notch and is required for the differentiation of sensory hair cells in the inner ear and the specification of secretory cells during the intestinal crypt cell regeneration. Motivated by the observations that the upregulation of Atoh1 gene expression, through genetic manipulation or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling (e.g. γ-secretase inhibitors, GSIs), induces ectopic hair cell growth in the cochlea of the inner ear and partially restores hearing after injuries in experimental models, we decided to identify small molecule modulators of the Notch-Atoh1 pathway, which could potentially regenerate hair cells. However, the lack of cellular models of the inner ear has precluded the screening and characterization of such modulators. Here we report using a colon cancer cell line LS-174T, which displays Notch inhibition-dependent Atoh1 expression as a surrogate cellular model to screen for inducers of Atoh1 expression. We designed an Atoh1 promoter-driven luciferase assay to screen a target-annotated library of ~6000 compounds. We further developed a medium throughput, real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay measuring the endogenous Atoh1 gene expression to confirm the hits and eliminate false positives from the reporter-based screen. This strategy allowed us to successfully recover GSIs of known chemotypes. This LS-174T cell-based assay directly measures Atoh1 gene expression induced through Notch-Hes1 inhibition, and therefore offers an opportunity to identify novel cellular modulators along the Notch-Atoh1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2905106275,"Certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) is a crucial cryptosystem. It can not only compress multiple signatures into a short signature, but also ensure the validity of each signature participating in the aggregation by verifying the validity of an resulting aggregate signature. Therefore, a secure and efficient CLAS scheme is very useful for resource-constrained environments because it greatly reduces the overall length of the signature and the verifier's computational overhead. Cheng et al. presented an efficient CLAS scheme and proved its security in the random oracle model. However, we find that their scheme has security flaws. In this paper, we demonstrate that Cheng et al.'s CLAS scheme is vulnerable to coalition attacks from internal signers. To overcome these attacks, we present an improved CLAS scheme and prove that it is existentially unforgeable under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, our CLAS scheme can not only resist coalition attacks but also generate a very short aggregate signature. The performance analysis results show that our improved CLAS scheme is lower than the related CLAS schemes in terms of communication overhead and computation cost."
https://openalex.org/W2905533850,"The US Institute of Medicine defined serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) cut point values of 30 nmol/L and 40 nmol/L were used to assess the vitamin D status of South Asian and European Canadians of self-identified ancestry living in the National Capital Region of Canada. Serum 25OHD values were measured in the spring and fall of 2012 to represent status during the winter and summer months, respectively. A total of 1238 measurements were obtained from 669 participants (49% South Asian ancestry): some participants were measured only once (spring or fall). Median 25OHD values were significantly higher in participants of European ancestry: 70.8 nmol/L (68.1, 73.5; 95% CI) versus South Asian ancestry: 42.7 nmol/L (40.5, 45.0; P<0.001). Spring vs. fall differences were small for each ethnic group and significant only for those of European ancestry (2.9, CI: 1.0–4.9 nmol/L; P = 0.01). Among participants of South Asian ancestry, 27.3% (fall) and 29.1% (spring) of females had values <40 nmol/L while the percentages for males were considerably higher (36.5% and 44.2%, respectively). The corresponding values for participants of European ancestry were ≤10%, showing that the South Asian participants were less likely to achieve the 25OHD concentrations established by the IOM for optimum bone health. Investigation of the factors related to serum 25OHD levels showed that supplement intake and ethnic background were associated with the biggest differences. Skin color was not a major factor, suggesting that genetic factors are responsible for the observed differences between participants of different ethnic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2904005668,"The principle of three-dimensional protein structure formation is a long-standing conundrum in structural biology. A globular domain of a soluble protein is formed by a network of atomic contacts among amino acid residues, but regions without intramolecular non-local contacts are often observed in the protein structure, especially in loop, linker, and peripheral segments with secondary structures. Although these regions can play key roles for protein function as interfaces for intermolecular interactions, their nature remains unclear. Here, we termed protein segments without non-local contacts as floating segments and sought them in tens of thousands of entries in the Protein Data Bank. As a result, we found that 0.72% of residues are in floating segments. Regarding secondary structural elements, coil structures are enriched in floating segments, especially for long segments. Interactions with polypeptides and polynucleotides, but not chemical compounds, are enriched in floating segments. The amino acid preferences of floating segments are similar to those of surface residues, with exceptions; the small side chain amino acids, Gly and Ala, are preferred, and some charged side chains, Arg and His, are disfavored for floating segments compared to surface residues. Our comprehensive characterization of floating segments may provide insights into understanding protein sequence-structure-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2949853925,"Multistage tumorigenesis is a dynamic process characterized by the accumulation of mutations. Thus, a tumor mass is composed of genetically divergent cell subclones. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS), mathematical models have been recently developed to decompose tumor subclonal architecture from a collective genome sequencing data. Most of the methods focused on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). However, somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) also play critical roles in carcinogenesis. Therefore, further modeling subclonal CNAs composition would hold the promise to improve the analysis of tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution. To address this issue, we developed a two-way mixture Poisson model, named CloneDeMix for the deconvolution of read-depth information. It can infer the subclonal copy number, mutational cellular prevalence (MCP), subclone composition, and the order in which mutations occurred in the evolutionary hierarchy. The performance of CloneDeMix was systematically assessed in simulations. As a result, the accuracy of CNA inference was nearly 93% and the MCP was also accurately restored. Furthermore, we also demonstrated its applicability using head and neck cancer samples from TCGA. Our results inform about the extent of subclonal CNA diversity, and a group of candidate genes that probably initiate lymph node metastasis during tumor evolution was also discovered. Most importantly, these driver genes are located at 11q13.3 which is highly susceptible to copy number change in head and neck cancer genomes. This study successfully estimates subclonal CNAs and exhibit the evolutionary relationships of mutation events. By doing so, we can track tumor heterogeneity and identify crucial mutations during evolution process. Hence, it facilitates not only understanding the cancer development but finding potential therapeutic targets. Briefly, this framework has implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of inclusion of subclonal CNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2903636494,"Unintentional exposure to medications is a noted problem in pediatric populations despite the prevalent use of child-resistant (CR) packaging and educational campaigns informing consumers about appropriate storage.Conduct a proof-of concept study that evaluates how package designs that engage the attention of children in meaningless ways affect opening time and number of openings.Non-CR vials with or without distracters were provided to 108 children (24-51 months) in pairs. Each participant was handed a vial and instructed to ""do whatever you want to with it."" Successful opening and time to opening were recorded. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models.Older children were approximately four times more likely than younger children to successfully open a vial with a visual distracter (P = 0.049); when distracters were not present, no evidence for differences was apparent between age groups (P = 0.64). For successful openings of either age group, distracter presence significantly prolonged time to opening (P = 0.0375); vials containing distracters took nearly three times longer to open than those without.Existing CR designs almost exclusively rely on late stages of information processing (e.g. difficult to understand or open). Our results suggest that packaging designs that target early stage processing (i.e. perception) represent a potential paradigm for creating effective CR designs. It should be acknowledged that visual distracters, by their very nature, have the potential to act as ""attractive nuisances"" (i.e. if it were to be so effective that it drew children to the hazard). Further studies designed to specifically investigate this possibility are advised."
