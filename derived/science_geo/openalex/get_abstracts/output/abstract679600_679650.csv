https://openalex.org/W3195862194,"While vaccines ensure individual protection against COVID-19 infection, delay in receipt or refusal of vaccines will have both individual and community impacts. The behavioral factors of vaccine hesitancy or refusal are a crucial dimension that need to be understood in order to design appropriate interventions. The aim of this study was to explore the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh.We employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model [HBM] and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors) and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines.The behavioral determinants associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Dhaka included perceived social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy, perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the HBM, beliefs about the disease itself were highly predictive of vaccine acceptance, and some of the strongest statistically-significant (p<0.001) predictors of vaccine acceptance in this population are beliefs around both injunctive and descriptive social norms. Specifically, Acceptors were 3.2 times more likely to say they would be very likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine if a doctor or nurse recommended it, twice as likely to say that most people they know will get a vaccine, and 1.3 times more likely to say that most close family and friends will get a vaccine. The perceived safety of vaccines was found to be important since Non-acceptors were 1.8 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are ""not safe at all"". Beliefs about one's risk of getting COVID-19 disease and the severity of it were predictive of being a vaccine acceptor: Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say that it was very likely that someone in their household would get COVID-19, 1.3 times more likely to say that they were very concerned about getting COVID-19, and 1.3 times more likely to say that it would be very serious if someone in their household contracted COVID-19. Other responses of Acceptors on what makes immunization easier may be helpful in programming to boost acceptance, such as providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols.An effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study. National plans for promoting COVID-19 vaccination should address the barriers, enablers, and behavioral determinants found in this study in order to maximize the impact on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W3194395674,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian pacemaker in mammals and is entrained by environmental light. However, the molecular basis of the response of the SCN to light is not fully understood. We used RNA/chromatin immunoprecipitation/single-nucleus sequencing with circadian behavioral assays to identify mouse SCN cell types and explore their responses to light. We identified three peptidergic cell types that responded to light in the SCN: arginine vasopressin (AVP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and cholecystokinin (CCK). In each cell type, light-responsive subgroups were enriched for expression of neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 4 (NPAS4) target genes. Further, mice lacking Npas4 had a longer circadian period under constant conditions, a damped phase response curve to light, and reduced light-induced gene expression in the SCN. Our data indicate that NPAS4 is necessary for normal transcriptional responses to light in the SCN and critical for photic phase-shifting of circadian behavior."

These findings define a conserved epitope recognized by weakly neutralizing yet protective antibodies that could be targeted for pan-alphavirus immunotherapy and vaccine design. Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that can cause explosive epidemics worldwide. These mosquito-transmitted viruses are grouped by their genetic relatedness and clinical syndromes. Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ross River virus (RRV), O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV), cause acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. Encephalitic alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV), and Western equine encephalitis (WEEV), infect the central nervous system of humans, horses, and other vertebrate animals, often with severe neurological consequences. The alphavirus RNA genome encodes four nonstructural proteins and five structural proteins. The structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic RNA as a single polypeptide that contains the capsid (C) and p62(E3-E2)-6K-E1 proteins. The precursor p62 protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease in the trans-Golgi network into the E3 and E2 proteins prior to display on the plasma membrane surface. The mature alphavirus virion is comprised of 240 heterodimers of E2 and E1 envelope glycoproteins arranged as 80 trimeric spikes (Li et al., 2010Li L. Jose J. Xiang Y. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G.

After virus engagement of host entry factors and endocytosis, the E2-E1 heterodimer undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes resulting in dissociation of the E2 protein. The hydrophobic fusion loop, located in domain II of the E1 protein, inserts into the host cell membrane to initiate viral fusion. Genetic screens have identified MXRA8 as a cell-surface host receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses, including CHIKV, MAYV, ONNV, and RRV (Kim et al., 2020Kim A.S. Zimmerman O. Fox J.M.

Many studies have demonstrated that antibodies against viral structural proteins can protect against arthritogenic and encephalitic alphavirus infection in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Jin and Simmons, 2019Jin J. Simmons G. Antiviral Functions of Monoclonal Antibodies against Chikungunya Virus.Viruses. 2019; 11: 305Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We previously identified a conserved epitope in domain B of the E2 protein of multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses that is recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies that protect against CHIKV, MAYV, RRV, and ONNV infection and disease (Fox et al., 2015Fox J.M. Long F. Edeling M.A. Lin H. van Duijl-Richter M.K.S. Fong R.H. Kahle K.M. Smit J.M. Jin J.

Although some cross-protective antibodies between VEEV and WEEV have been reported (Rico et al., 2016Rico A.B. Phillips A.T. Schountz T. Jarvis D.L. Tjalkens R.B. Powers A.M. Olson K.E. Venezuelan and western equine encephalitis virus E1 liposome antigen nucleic acid complexes protect mice from lethal challenge with multiple alphaviruses.Virology. 2016; 499: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), broadly inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against all encephalitic alphaviruses have not been described, much less against both families of arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses. The identification of such antibodies is desirable, as it can facilitate the development of pan-alphavirus antibody-based therapeutics and immunogens. Here, we identify two pan-reactive alphavirus mAbs, DC2.112 and DC2.315, that bind to recombinant E1 proteins and the surface of cells infected with arthritogenic or encephalitic alphaviruses. Alanine-scanning and charge substitution mutagenesis and hydrogen-deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analyses mapped their epitopes proximal to and within the conserved fusion loop in domain II of E1. Despite having poor neutralizing activity, passive transfer of DC2.112 or DC2.315 protected mice from CHIKV- or MAYV-induced musculoskeletal disease and lethal VEEV, EEEV, or WEEV neurological infection and disease. These results define a conserved epitope in the E1 protein that is recognized by weakly neutralizing yet pan-protective anti-alphavirus antibodies and holds promise as a target for therapeutic and vaccine design. There is greater amino acid sequence identity and similarity between the E1 (∼53 and 69%) than E2 (∼35 and 54%) proteins of arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses (Figures S1A–S1C). As such, we hypothesized that highly cross-reactive mAbs against the E1 protein might be elicited in some individuals. We previously isolated a panel of human mAbs, many of which were E1 specific, from two CHIKV-seropositive individuals (Quiroz et al., 2019Quiroz J.A. Malonis R.J. Thackray L.B. Cohen C.A. Pallesen J. Jangra R.K. Brown R.S. Hofmann D. Holtsberg F.W. Shulenin S. et al.Human monoclonal antibodies against chikungunya virus target multiple distinct epitopes in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15: e1008061Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We screened several of the E1-specific mAbs for binding to Vero cells infected with CHIKV or VEEV to identify those reacting with both arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses (Figure S2; Table S1). As VEEV is a BSL-3 select agent and technically challenging to study, we used a SINV-VEEV chimeric virus that contains the nonstructural proteins (nsP1–nsP4) of SINV and the structural proteins (E3-E2-6K-E1) of VEEV (Ma et al., 2020Ma H. Kim A.S. Kafai N.M. Earnest J.T. Shah A.P. Case J.B. Basore K. Gilliland T.C. Sun C. Nelson C.A. et al.LDLRAD3 is a receptor for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.Nature. 2020; 588: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Antibodies that bound to infected cells in this screen were tested against several additional alphaviruses. We identified four mAbs (DC1.7, DC1.56, DC2.112, and DC2.315) that cross-reacted with multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses (CHIKV, MAYV, and RRV) and four mAbs (DC1.56, DC2.112, DC2.315, and DC2.82) that recognized the structural proteins of both arthritogenic (CHIKV, MAYV, RRV, and SINV) and encephalitic (EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV) alphaviruses (Figures 1A and S2). Although DC2.82 showed cross-reactivity with CHIKV and VEEV proteins, we did not characterize this mAb further due to its poor expression levels. We prioritized experiments with mAbs DC2.112 and DC2.315, as these two mAbs exhibited the highest reactivity to cells infected with arthritogenic or encephalitic alphaviruses (Figure 1A). We expanded our virus panel to include additional related alphaviruses (ONNV, Bebaru virus [BEBV], Una virus [UNAV], Getah virus [GETV], Babanki virus [BABV], Ockelbo virus [OCKV], and Buggy Creek virus [BCV]) and a flavivirus, West Nile virus (WNV), as a negative control (Figure 1B). DC2.112 exhibited greater cross-reactivity than DC2.315, as DC2.315 exhibited little to no binding to the surface of cells infected with ONNV, GETV, BABV, SINV, or OCKV (Figure 1C). Consistent with a previous study (Fox et al., 2015Fox J.M. Long F. Edeling M.A. Lin H. van Duijl-Richter M.K.S. Fong R.H. Kahle K.M. Smit J.M. Jin J.

Quantitative analysis of EEEV E1 protein binding to mAbs DC2.112 or DC2.315 by biolayer interferometry (BLI) revealed nanomolar affinities with KD values of 0.9 or 5.4 nM, respectively, with prolonged off rates (Figure 2B). To define the epitopes of DC2.112 and DC2.315, we first performed competition-binding experiments using previously identified murine anti-CHIKV E1 mAbs (CHK-166, CHK-180, and CHK-269) (Pal et al., 2013Pal P. Dowd K.A. Brien J.D. Edeling M.A. Gorlatov S. Johnson S. Lee I. Akahata W. Nabel G.J. Richter M.K. et al.Development of a highly protective combination monoclonal antibody therapy against Chikungunya virus.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003312Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis with CHK-166, CHK-180, and CHK-269 showed reduced binding when E1 residues 52, 64, and 67 were mutated (Table S2), and neutralization escape selection with CHK-166 defined E1 residues 61 and 64 as important for antibody function (Pal et al., 2013Pal P. Dowd K.A. Brien J.D. Edeling M.A. Gorlatov S. Johnson S. Lee I. Akahata W. Nabel G.J. Richter M.K. et al.Development of a highly protective combination monoclonal antibody therapy against Chikungunya virus.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003312Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These residues are located in domain II of E1 adjacent to the highly conserved fusion loop (residues 84–99) (Voss et al., 2010Voss J.E. Vaney M.C. Duquerroy S. Vonrhein C. Girard-Blanc C. Crublet E. Thompson A. Bricogne G. Rey F.A. Glycoprotein organization of Chikungunya virus particles revealed by X-ray crystallography.Nature. 2010; 468: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether DC2.112 and DC2.315 compete with the murine anti-E1 mAbs, recombinant CHIKV E1 protein was immobilized on a biosensor pin followed by sequential addition of either human or mouse CHIKV E1 mAbs. The addition of murine E1 mAbs CHK-166, CHK-180, and CHK-269 blocked binding of DC2.112 and DC2.315 to CHIKV E1 (Figure 2C), suggesting that DC2.112 and DC2.315 also recognize an epitope proximal to the fusion loop. We next assessed whether mAbs DC2.112 and DC2.315 recognize E1 on an intact virion. CHIKV virus-like particles (VLPs) (Akahata et al., 2010Akahata W. Yang Z.Y. Andersen H. Sun S. Holdaway H.A.

CHK-265, which binds to domain B of the E2 protein, bound to VLPs at both neutral and acidic pH conditions. Binding by DC2.112 and DC2.315 was not observed at neutral pH but occurred when CHIKV VLPs were incubated in an acidic (pH 5.5) buffer (Figure 2D). These results suggest that DC2.112 and DC2.315 recognize a site in the E1 protein that is exposed on the surface of alphavirus-infected cells but inaccessible on the virion unless low-pH-triggered conformational changes occur. To define key peptide components of the DC2.112 and DC2.315 epitopes, we performed HDX-MS with recombinant EEEV E1 protein. As both mAbs belong to the same competition group, we selected one (DC2.112), incubated it with EEEV E1 protein, and evaluated for changes in deuterium exchange relative to the unliganded EEEV E1 protein (Figures S3A–S3C). DC2.112 protected peptide epitopes in domain II of the E1 protein at residues 50–61 and 80–95 (Figures 2E and S3A–S3C). We observed the largest differences in deuterium exchange and increased protection for residues 86–93. Residues 50–61, which are adjacent to residues 86–93, were protected by DC2.112 but to a lesser degree (Figure S3C). Kinetic plots for residues 86–95 showed relatively large and constant deuteration over the HDX timescale, whereas residues 50–61 showed relatively low initial deuteration that gradually increased with time of exchange (Figure S3C). This comparison suggests residues 86–95 are more exposed than residues 50–61 on the EEEV E1 protein. To pinpoint residues required for DC2.112 and DC2.315 binding, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Davidson and Doranz, 2014Davidson E. Doranz B.J. A high-throughput shotgun mutagenesis approach to mapping B-cell antibody epitopes.Immunology. 2014; 143: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and monitored antibody binding by flow cytometry. As DC2.112 and DC2.315 competed for binding to the E1 protein with the murine anti-CHIKV E1 mAbs CHK-166, CHK-180, and CHK-269, we focused on domain II, which contains residues critical for binding of the murine mAbs. We defined key binding residues as those when mutated to alanine (or alanine residues mutated to serine) resulted in <20% relative binding to DC2.112 or DC2.315. To control for mutated residues that globally alter E1 conformation, we excluded cysteine residues and amino acids that showed loss of binding to an anti-CHIKV oligoclonal mAb control. Alanine substitution of residues in domain II (Y85, F95, and N100) resulted in a loss of binding of DC2.315, whereas DC2.112 binding was not impacted (Figure 2F; Table S3). As alanine mutations sometimes have only moderate disruptive effects on mAb binding, we also substituted charged residues (Kim et al., 2019Kim A.S. Austin S.K. Gardner C.L. Zuiani A. Reed D.S. Trobaugh D.W. Sun C. Basore K. Williamson L.E. Crowe Jr., J.E. et al.Protective antibodies against Eastern equine encephalitis virus bind to epitopes in domains A and B of the E2 glycoprotein.Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Arginine substitution of residues Y85, F95, and N100 resulted in loss of binding of mAb DC2.315, which supports the alanine mutagenesis data. We identified four additional residues (G83, V84, M88, and Y93) in domain II that, when mutated to arginine, resulted in loss of DC2.315 binding (Figures 2G and 2H; Table S4). Replacement of residues in domain II (W89, G91, and N100) with arginine also resulted in a loss of binding of mAb DC2.112, corroborating the HDX-MS analysis (Figures 2G, 2H, and S3; Table S4). As DC2.112 protected residues 50–61 in the HDX-MS analysis, albeit to a lesser extent, we also substituted these residues with charged amino acids. Mutation of these residues reduced but did not abrogate DC2.112 binding. In comparison, we observed greater loss-of-binding of DC2.315 when residues K52, V54, I55, and K61 were substituted (Figures 2G and 2H). The K61 residue also was identified as important for CHK-166 binding through neutralization escape selection (Pal et al., 2013Pal P. Dowd K.A. Brien J.D. Edeling M.A. Gorlatov S. Johnson S. Lee I.

Richter M.K. et al.Development of a highly protective combination monoclonal antibody therapy against Chikungunya virus.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003312Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Table S2), which likely explains why CHK-166 and DC2.315 reciprocally compete for binding to E1 (Figure 2C). As we previously identified anti-CHIKV human mAbs (IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, IM-CKV066, and IM-CKV067) that mapped to residues in the fusion loop (Fong et al., 2014Fong R.H. Banik S.S. Mattia K. Barnes T. Tucker D. Liss N. Lu K. Selvarajah S. Srinivasan S.

Virol. 2014; 88: 14364-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we assessed whether these mAbs also broadly react with encephalitic alphaviruses. Notably, four mAbs that mapped to residues W89 and N100 (IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067) bound to recombinant EEEV E1 protein by ELISA (Figure S4A). Our prior assessment showed weak neutralizing activity of DC2.112 and DC2.315 against CHIKV in Vero cells (Quiroz et al., 2019Quiroz J.A. Malonis R.J. Thackray L.B. Cohen C.A. Pallesen J. Jangra R.K.

Shulenin S. et al.Human monoclonal antibodies against chikungunya virus target multiple distinct epitopes in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15: e1008061Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Evaluation of these mAbs against other arthritogenic alphaviruses (MAYV, ONNV, or RRV) or chimeric encephalitic alphaviruses expressing the non-structural genes of SINV and structural genes of VEEV (Trinidad donkey [TrD] subtype IAB strain), EEEV (FL93-939 strain), or WEEV (CBA87 strain) (SINV-VEEV, SINV-EEEV, or SINV-WEEV) similarly showed little to no neutralizing activity in Vero cells (Figure 3A). As some anti-CHIKV mAbs show cell-type-dependent neutralization (Pal et al., 2013Pal P. Dowd K.A. Brien J.D. Edeling M.A. Gorlatov S. Johnson S. Lee I. Akahata W. Nabel G.J. Richter M.K. et al.Deve"
https://openalex.org/W3193372782,"The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein is a key player in tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was recently found to be inactivated by tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25)-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, the deubiquitinase (Dub) coordinate TRIM25 in PTEN ubiquitination is still elusive. In the present study, we found that this K63-linked polyubiquitination could be ablated by the ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) in a screen against a panel of Dubs. We found using coimmununoprecipitation/immunoblotting that USP10 interacted with PTEN and reduced the K63-linked polyubiquitination of PTEN mediated by TRIM25 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, USP10, but not its inactive C424A deubiquitinating mutant or other Dubs, abolished PTEN from K63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by TRIM25. In contrast to TRIM25, USP10 restored PTEN phosphatase activity and reduced the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, thereby inhibiting AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin progrowth signaling transduction in NSCLC cells. Moreover, USP10 was downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and primary tissues, whereas TRIM25 was upregulated. Consistent with its molecular activity, re-expression of USP10 suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockout of USP10 promoted NSCLC cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that USP10 coordinates TRIM25 to modulate PTEN activity. Specifically, USP10 activates PTEN by preventing its K63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by TRIM25 and suppresses the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting NSCLC proliferation, indicating that it may be a potential drug target for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3195544197,"Resistance training (RT) dynamically alters the skeletal muscle nuclear DNA methylome. However, no study has examined if RT affects the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylome. Herein, ten older, Caucasian untrained males (65 ± 7 y.o.) performed six weeks of full-body RT (twice weekly). Body composition and knee extensor torque were assessed prior to and 72 h following the last RT session. Vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies were also obtained. VL DNA was subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing providing excellent coverage across the ~16-kilobase mtDNA methylome (254 CpG sites). Biochemical assays were also performed, and older male data were compared to younger trained males (22 ± 2 y.o., n = 7, n = 6 Caucasian & n = 1 African American). RT increased whole-body lean tissue mass (p = .017), VL thickness (p = .012), and knee extensor torque (p = .029) in older males. RT also affected the mtDNA methylome, as 63% (159/254) of the CpG sites demonstrated reduced methylation (p < .05). Several mtDNA sites presented a more “youthful” signature in older males after RT in comparison to younger males. The 1.12 kilobase mtDNA D-loop/control region, which regulates replication and transcription, possessed enriched hypomethylation in older males following RT. Enhanced expression of mitochondrial H- and L-strand genes and complex III/IV protein levels were also observed (p < .05). While limited to a shorter-term intervention, this is the first evidence showing that RT alters the mtDNA methylome in skeletal muscle. Observed methylome alterations may enhance mitochondrial transcription, and RT evokes mitochondrial methylome profiles to mimic younger men. The significance of these findings relative to broader RT-induced epigenetic changes needs to be elucidated."

Here, we outline the molecular basis for human antibody interaction with the alphavirus E1 glycoprotein through isolation and characterization of naturally occurring human E1-specific mAbs from survivors of EEEV infection. From this collection, we identified mAbs specific to EEEV and cross-reactive mAbs to EEEV, VEEV, WEEV, CHIKV, and/or MAYV. We determined the antigenic sites recognized by these mAbs on the EEEV E1 glycoprotein, some of which become more exposed under acidic pH conditions or treatment with detergent. In addition, we found that mAb binding to EEEV-infected cells inhibited virus egress, which corresponded with therapeutic efficacy in vivo. We isolated human mAbs from B cells of individuals who had been naturally infected with EEEV. A total of 20 mAbs were selected based on reactivity in ELISA to EEEV E1 glycoprotein, EEEV virus-like particles (VLPs), or SINV/EEEV virions (Kim et al., 2019Kim A.S. Austin S.K. Gardner C.L.

Microbiol. 2019; 4: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We assessed binding to EEEV, VEEV, or WEEV VLPs, recombinant E1 glycoproteins (EEEV, CHIKV, or MAYV), and recombinant EEEV E2 glycoprotein in ELISA in the presence of the nonionic detergent Tween 20 (Figure 1). As the E1 glycoprotein on the virion surface is relatively obscured by the overlying E2 glycoprotein, exposure of epitopes for E1-specific mAbs can require pre-treatment conditions. Tween 20 was included in buffers during the incubation and wash steps to enhance exposure of epitopes that might otherwise be obstructed in the native virus structure. We also assessed binding breadth to the structural proteins of a diverse panel of alphavirus subtypes (EEEV, Madariaga virus [MADV], VEEV, WEEV, and CHIKV) using a cell surface antigen display method, in which we transfected Expi293F cells with a plasmid encoding the structural proteins (capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1) (Figures 2 and S1).Figure 2Binding breadth of human E1-specific mAbs to diverse alphavirus subtype structural proteins displayed on the surface of cellsShow full captionHeatmap of fold-change for mAb binding to alphavirus subtypes (labeled with virus, subtype, and strain; grouped by antigenic complex for either EEEV [green], VEEV [blue], WEEV [orange], or Semliki Forest virus [magenta]).

https://openalex.org/W3195740361,"Proximity labeling provides a powerful in vivo tool to characterize the proteome of subcellular structures and the interactome of specific proteins. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most intensely studied organisms in biology, offering many advantages for biochemistry. Using the highly active biotin ligase TurboID, we optimize here a proximity labeling protocol for C. elegans. An advantage of TurboID is that biotin's high affinity for streptavidin means biotin-labeled proteins can be affinity-purified under harsh denaturing conditions. By combining extensive sonication with aggressive denaturation using SDS and urea, we achieved near-complete solubilization of worm proteins. We then used this protocol to characterize the proteomes of the worm gut, muscle, skin, and nervous system. Neurons are among the smallest C. elegans cells. To probe the method's sensitivity, we expressed TurboID exclusively in the two AFD neurons and showed that the protocol could identify known and previously unknown proteins expressed selectively in AFD. The active zones of synapses are composed of a protein matrix that is difficult to solubilize and purify. To test if our protocol could solubilize active zone proteins, we knocked TurboID into the endogenous elks-1 gene, which encodes a presynaptic active zone protein. We identified many known ELKS-1-interacting active zone proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized synaptic proteins. Versatile vectors and the inherent advantages of using C. elegans, including fast growth and the ability to rapidly make and functionally test knock-ins, make proximity labeling a valuable addition to the armory of this model organism.

Characterizing the interactomes of specific proteins, and the proteome profiles of subcellular structures, cells, and tissues, provides a powerful entry point to probe molecular function. Several methods designed to highlight protein–protein interactions (PPIs) have proven useful, including yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H), affinity purification, and phage display (1Qin W. Cho K.F.

However, each method has limitations that can include high false-positive rates, poor detection of transient or weak interactors, a low signal-to-noise ratio when detecting PPIs in specific cell types or subcellular compartments, artifacts created during tissue homogenization, and competing requirements for solubilizing proteins while keeping complexes intact (1Qin W.

BioID functions poorly at temperatures below 37 °C (22May D.G. Scott K.L. Campos A.R. Roux K.J. Comparative application of BioID and TurboID for protein-proximity biotinylation.Cells. 2020; 9: 1070Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), making it suboptimal for use in the nematode. To date, there is no report applying BioID in C. elegans. However, BirA expressed in specific C. elegans tissues can biotinylate coexpressed proteins fused to an Avi tag, a 15-residue peptide substrate of BirA (23Schäffer U. Schlosser A. Müller K.M. Schäfer A. Katava N. Baumeister R. Schulze E. SnAvi - a new tandem tag for high-affinity protein-complex purification.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The biotinylated Avi-tag fusion protein can then be affinity purified (AP) and coimmunoprecipitating proteins identified by MS (24Waaijers S. Muñoz J. Berends C. Ramalho J.J. Goerdayal S.S. Low T.Y.

APEX has not, however, been used to study PPIs in worms. The APEX peroxidase is promiscuous, labeling proteins far from the APEX-tagged protein and leading to specificity problems (25Lobingier B.T.

Two other studies characterized tissue proteomes in C. elegans by expressing mutant phenylalanyl (Phe) tRNA synthetase (MuPheRS) (26Yuet K.P. Doma M.K. Ngo J.T. Sweredoski M.J. Graham R.L.J. Moradian A. Hess S. Schuman E.M. Sternberg P.W. Tirrell D.A. Cell-specific proteomic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuronal subclass-selective proteomic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). MuPheRS can charge Phe tRNAs with azido-phenylalanine, so that this noncanonical amino acid can be incorporated into proteins during translation. Click chemistry permits the azido group to be derivatized and labeled proteins affinity purified for mass spectrometry. These studies highlighted the proteome of various tissues, including neurons. MuPheRS cannot, however, be used to study PPIs. Variants of BioID that are more catalytically active, called TurboID and miniTurbo, have recently been developed using directed evolution (28Branon T.C. Bosch J.A. Sanchez A.D. Udeshi N.D. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Feldman J.L. Perrimon N. Ting A.Y. Efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms with TurboID.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 880-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Expressing either variant in C. elegans results in robust biotinylation signals in the intestine, with the strongest signals generated by TurboID (28Branon T.C. Bosch J.A. Sanchez A.D. Udeshi N.D. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Feldman J.L. Perrimon N. Ting A.Y. Efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms with TurboID.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 880-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the authors did not publish interactome or proteomic data for C. elegans. A recent study used TurboID to characterize the interactome of the microtubule-binding protein patronin, but ectopically overexpressed this fusion protein in the largest tissue of the animal, the gut, and did not seek to optimize the protocol (29Sanchez A.D. Branon T.C. Cote L.E. Papagiannakis A. Liang X. Pickett M.A. Shen K. Jacobs-Wagner C. Ting A.Y. Feldman J.L. Proximity labeling at non-centrosomal organizing centers reveals VAB-10B and WDR-62 as distinct microtubule regulators.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.29.272369Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here, we optimize a protocol for TurboID-based proximity-labeling in C. elegans. We express TurboID in different C. elegans tissues and in the pair of AFD thermosensory neurons. We also knock TurboID into elks-1, which encodes a presynaptic active zone protein. We characterize tissue proteomes and highlight tissue-specific proteins. Targeting TurboID to AFD neurons highlights the AFD-specific proteins GCY-8, TTX-1, and GCY-18, and previously uncharacterized proteins that we show are selectively expressed in AFD. The ELKS-1-TurboID samples are enriched in the synaptic proteins UNC-10/RIM, SYD-1/SYDE1, SYD-2/liprin-alpha, SAD-1/BRSK1, CLA-1/CLArinet, C16E9.2/Sentryn, RIM-binding protein RIMB-1, and previously uncharacterized proteins, which we show localize at synapses. Our results indicate that TurboID-mediated proximity labeling can effectively identify the proteome of a pair of neurons and bona fide interactors of a synaptic protein in C. elegans in vivo. To examine the extent to which TurboID biotinylates proteins in C. elegans (Fig. 1A), we generated transgenic animals expressing a TurboID-mNeongreen-3xFLAG (TbID-mNG) fusion protein in various tissues (Fig. 1B). We compared protein biotinylation levels in age-synchronized young adults expressing the neuronal rab-3p::TbID-mNG transgene with wild-type controls. In the absence of exogenously added biotin, transgenic animals showed only a slight increase in biotinylated proteins compared with controls. Adding exogenous biotin increased protein biotinylation specifically in animals expressing the rab-3p::TbID-mNG transgene (Fig. 1C). To optimize biotin availability to worm tissues, we treated animals with exogenous biotin for different time intervals, using biotinylation in neurons as a readout. A 2-h incubation was sufficient to achieve robust protein labeling (Fig. 1D). To identify an optimum biotin concentration for protein labeling, we treated animals with varying concentrations of biotin for 2 h. We observed a substantial increase in biotinylation in worms treated with 1 mM biotin but higher biotin concentrations did not appear to further increase biotinylation (Fig. 1E). We also used the E. coli biotin auxotrophic strain MG1655 as a food source for worms instead of standard OP50 (30Ortega-Cuellar D. Hernandez-Mendoza A. Moreno-Arriola E. Carvajal-Aguilera K. Perez-Vazquez V. Gonzalez-Alvarez R. Velazquez-Arellano A. Biotin starvation with adequate glucose provision causes paradoxical changes in fuel metabolism gene expression in rat (Rattus norvegicus), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).J. Nutrigenet. Nutrigenomics. 2010; 3: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), to minimize the free biotin available prior to addition of exogenous biotin, allowing for tighter control of the time window during which promiscuous biotinylation occurs. Like pan-neuronal expression, intestinal, hypodermal, and muscle-specific expression of TurboID-mNG conferred robust biotinylation activity (Fig. 2A), indicating that TurboID is functional in all major C. elegans tissues. We next optimized a protocol to extract and affinity purify biotinylated proteins from C. elegans (Fig. S1, A–C). A significant advantage of PL compared with IP is that extracts can be collected under strong denaturing conditions (1% SDS, 2M urea), since the biotin tag is covalently attached. This allowed us to achieve >95 % solubilization of proteins (Fig. S1, A–C, Experimental procedures). We achieved efficient protein extraction using a cryomill and processed from 5 g to <500 mg of worms. Using 500 mg of worms was typically sufficient to obtain enough material for MS. Age-synchronized young adult worms were incubated with 1 mM of biotin for 2 h at room temperature and immediately frozen after three washes with M9 buffer. Total protein lysate was extracted from powdered worm samples and passed through desalting columns to eliminate free biotin. Removing free biotin was key for successful affinity purification. The flow through was incubated with streptavidin Dynabeads to affinity purify biotinylated proteins (see Experimental procedures). Western blot analysis showed capture of the majority of biotinylated proteins from the whole lysate using our affinity purification protocol (Fig. S2A). After extensive washing and elution, we fractionated the affinity-purified biotinylated proteins by SDS-PAGE, visualized the proteins by Coomassie staining, and analyzed gel slices by LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. S2B). Using a threshold of at least two unique peptides, we cumulatively identified >4000 proteins expressed in one or more tissues (Fig. 2, B and C, Table S1). Using tissue enrichment analysis (31Angeles-Albores D. Raymond R.Y. Chan J. Sternberg P.W. Tissue enrichment analysis for C. elegans genomics.BMC Bioinformatics. 2016; 17: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we looked for overrepresented annotations in the lists of proteins we identified as unique to each tissue. As expected, terms associated with the targeted tissue were overrepresented in each case, confirming the validity of the method for large tissues (Fig. S3A). In addition, we observed a strong correlation between the two replicates at the level of spectral counts (Fig. S3B). Consistent with previous findings, we identified most proteins in the intestine, followed by the hypodermis and muscle cells (Fig. 2B), (12Reinke A.W. Mak R. Troemel E.R. Ben E.J. In vivo mapping of tissue- and subcellular-specific proteomes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3: 1-12Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Over 2000 proteins were enriched at least 2-fold in one tissue over other tissues (Figs. 2B), and 1274 proteins were detected in only one tissue (Fig. 2C). Proteins identified by MS/MS when TurboID was targeted to neurons included broadly expressed neuronal proteins, such as CLA-1, UNC-31, and proteins expressed in subsets of neurons, such as the glutamate decarboxylase UNC-25, which is known to be expressed in 26 neurons, and OSM-10, which is expressed in four pairs of neurons (Fig. 2D). Muscle-specific samples were enriched in CPNA-1, CPNA-2, PQN-22, and F21C10.7 (Fig. 2D); intestine-specific samples were enriched in ACOX-2, CGR-1, C49A9.9, and C49A9.3 (Fig. 2D), and hypodermis-specific samples included F17A9.5, PAH-1, R05H10.1, and CPN-2 (Fig. 2D). In addition, we identified tissue-specific enrichment for many proteins whose expression was previously uncharacterized (Table S1, Fig. 2E). For some of these proteins we validated the tissue-selective expression highlighted by our MS/MS data by making transgenic reporters. The reporters confirmed the expression profile predicted by MS/MS, validating the method's specificity (Fig. 2F). The C. elegans nervous system includes 118 classes of neurons, with most classes consisting of a single pair of neurons that form left/right homologs (16White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We asked whether our protocol had sufficient sensitivity to characterize proteins expressed in a single pair of neurons. To test this, we transgenically expressed free TurboID-mNeongreen specifically in the AFD pair of ciliated sensory neurons, using the gcy-8 promoter (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of extracts from these animals revealed a biotinylation signal significantly higher than that in extracts from wild-type controls (Fig. 3B). Correlation plots of mass spectrometry data obtained for affinity-purified extracts made from animals expressing the gcy-8p::TbID-mNG transgene showed reproducible results between replicates (Fig. S4A). As expected, these samples were enriched for proteins specifically or selectively expressed in AFD neurons when compared with similarly processed extracts from nontransgenic controls, or from animals expressing a rab-3p::TbID-mNG transgene (Figs. 3C and S4B). Enriched proteins included the transmembrane guanylate cyclases GCY-8 and GCY-18 and the homeobox transcription factor TTX-1 (Figs. 3D and S4B). Our MS data also identified other proteins enriched in the AFD-specific TurboID samples compared with the pan-neuronal TurboID controls (Table S1, Figs. 3E and S4C). To examine if these proteins were selectively expressed in AFD neurons, we generated transgenic reporter lines (Fig. 3F). nex-4 and F37A4.6 were expressed specifically in AFD, albeit F37A4.6 at low levels; T06G6.3 was expressed in a small subset of neurons that included AFD (Fig. 3F). Our list of AFD-enriched proteins, identified by mass spectrometry, was consistent with AFD-specific gene expression identified by RNA Seq (32Lockhead D. Schwarz E.M. O’hagan R. Bellotti S. Krieg M. Barr M.M. Dunn A.R. Sternberg P.W. Goodman M.B. The tubulin repertoire of Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons and its context-dependent role in process outgrowth.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 3717-3728Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TurboID is a reliable tool to map the proteome of specific neurons in C. elegans. We next asked if TurboID can highlight the interactome of a specific C. elegans protein expressed at endogenous levels. We focused on the synaptic protein ELKS-1, an ortholog of human ERC2 (ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 2). ELKS-1 is expressed throughout the nervous system and localizes to the presynaptic active zone, in proximity to other presynaptic proteins such as α-liprin and RIM (33Südhof T.C. The presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2012; 75: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To have endogenous levels of expression, we knocked TurboID::mNeongreen into the elks-1 locus using Crispr/Cas9-mediated genome editing. As expected, ELKS-1:: TbID-mNG localized to the nerve ring and other regions rich in synapses (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis of extracts from ELKS-1::TbID animals did not show an increased biotinylation signal compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 4B). However, mass spectrometry analysis of streptavidin-purified proteins from this knock-in strain revealed enrichment of known synaptic proteins including UNC-10/RIM, SYD-1/SYDE1, SYD-2/α-liprin, SAD-1/BRSK1, CLA-1/CLArinet, C16E9.2/Sentryn, and the RIM-binding protein RIMB-1 (Fig. 4D). We measured enrichment by comparing mass spectrometry data obtained for control extracts processed in parallel from wild-type and from transgenic animals expressing free TurboID-mNG throughout the nervous system, rab-3p::TbID-mNG (Fig. 4C and S4E) or both nervous system and other tissues (Fig. S4G). Between-replicate correlation plots revealed reproducible results between experimental repeats (Fig. S4D). We also identified several previously uncharacterized proteins as enriched in ELKS-1::TbID-mNG samples (Table S1, Fig. 4E and S4, F and G). We expressed mNeongreen translational fusion transgenes for several of these proteins exclusively in the AFD neuron pair and showed that they colocalized with ELKS-1::mScarlet at presynaptic active zones where AFD is known to synapse with AIY interneurons (16White J.G.

Together, our findings show that TurboID-mediated proximity labeling is an effective method to reveal protein interactors in C. elegans at endogenous levels with specificity and sensitivity. We optimize the recently developed TurboID-based proximity-dependent protein labeling approach for C. elegans, and show that it permits single neuron proteomics and characterization of the interactome of a synaptic protein expressed at endogenous levels. We create reagents that allow TurboID to be applied to different C. elegans tissues and identify >4000 proteins expressed in at least one tissue. We were able to identify proteins expressed exclusively in the AFD neurons and previously uncharacterized proteins that are synaptically localized in the vicinity of ELKS-1. Proximity labeling methods such as TurboID label interactors throughout the life of the fusion protein. In C. elegans, many transgenic experiments use multicopy arrays that typically overexpress the protein of interest. This can lead to inappropriate protein localization, expanding the list of int"
https://openalex.org/W3195910491,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the prototypic progressive fibrotic lung disease with a median survival of 2 to 4 years. Injury to and/or dysfunction of the alveolar epithelium is strongly implicated in IPF disease initiation, but the factors that determine whether fibrosis progresses rather than normal tissue repair occurs remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1–mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition in human alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells augments transforming growth factor-β–induced profibrogenic responses in underlying lung fibroblasts via paracrine signaling. Here, we investigated bidirectional epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk and its potential to drive fibrosis progression. RNA-Seq of lung fibroblasts exposed to conditioned media from ATII cells undergoing RAS-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition identified many differentially expressed genes including those involved in cell migration and extracellular matrix regulation. We confirmed that paracrine signaling between RAS-activated ATII cells and fibroblasts augmented fibroblast recruitment and demonstrated that this involved a zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1–tissue plasminogen activator axis. In a reciprocal fashion, paracrine signaling from transforming growth factor-β–activated lung fibroblasts or IPF fibroblasts induced RAS activation in ATII cells, at least partially through the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, which may signal via the epithelial growth factor receptor via epithelial growth factor–like repeats. Together, these data identify that aberrant bidirectional epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk in IPF drives a chronic feedback loop that maintains a wound-healing phenotype and provides self-sustaining profibrotic signals.

Together, these data identify that aberrant bidirectional epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk in IPF drives a chronic feedback loop that maintains a wound-healing phenotype and provides self-sustaining profibrotic signals. Fibrotic diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and their prevalence is increasing with an ageing population (1Richeldi L. Collard H.R. Jones M.G. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1941-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Development of effective treatments for progressive fibrosis is considered one of the most challenging tasks in modern medicine. Our studies focus within the lung upon fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, a diverse group of conditions that affect the space between the alveolar epithelium and the capillary endothelium to cause varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Once considered rare, epidemiologic investigations have found them to be more common than previously recognized, with interstitial lung abnormalities detected in 7% of the general population (aged older than 50 years) resulting in an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 2.7) (2Putman R.K. Hatabu H. Araki T. Gudmundsson G. Gao W. Nishino M. Okajima Y. Dupuis J. Latourelle J.C. Cho M.H. El-Chemaly S. Coxson H.O. Celli B.R. Fernandez I.E. Zazueta O.E. et al.Association between interstitial lung abnormalities and all-cause mortality.JAMA. 2016; 315: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the prototypic chronic progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease, affecting five million people worldwide (3Meltzer E.B. Noble P.W. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Orphanet J. rare Dis. 2008; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Like many fibrotic disorders, IPF is characterized by enhanced deposition and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This leads to decreased lung compliance, disrupted gas exchange, and ultimately respiratory failure and death. Median survival from diagnosis is 2 to 4 years, and approved therapies only slow disease progression, so there is a significant unmet need. An overexuberant wound healing response is regarded as a canonical cause of organ fibrosis (4Wynn T.A. Integrating mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1339-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Abnormal wound healing may occur as a consequence of multiple stimuli, including infections, chemical exposures, and physical injuries (1Richeldi L. Collard H.R. Jones M.G. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1941-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 5Wynn T.A. Common and unique mechanisms regulate fibrosis in various fibroproliferative diseases.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Whilst injury to and/or dysfunction of the alveolar epithelium is strongly implicated in IPF disease initiation, the factors that determine whether fibrosis progresses rather than normal tissue repair occurs remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify that aberrant bidirectional epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk provides self-sustaining activation signals driving disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis. Building on our previous report (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we provide evidence that alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells undergoing RAS-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) utilize a zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)–tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) axis to provide paracrine signals that augment fibroblast recruitment and activation. In reciprocal paracrine signaling, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–activated fibroblasts or IPF fibroblasts (IPFFs) induce RAS activation in ATII cells, which is at least partially driven by secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). These findings support the concept that aberrant bidirectional epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk contributes to the development of a profibrogenic microenvironment in which a chronic wound healing response leads to interstitial lung fibrosis. We previously reported that RAS-induced EMT in the human ATII cell line, ATIIER:KRASV12 (in which RAS activation can be induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen [4-OHT]) resulted in production of paracrine factors that augmented TGF-β-induced profibrogenic responses in lung fibroblasts (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine if, and how, fibroblasts responded to epithelial signals in the absence of profibrogenic TGF-β signaling, we characterized the global transcriptomic changes in MRC5 lung fibroblasts exposed to conditioned media (CM) from control or RAS-induced ATII cells by performing RNA-Seq. Genes with a false discovery rate (FDR)–adjusted p value less than 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 966 DEGs were identified, including 491 upregulated (Table S1) and 475 downregulated (Table S2) genes. We then performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the identified DEGs using PANTHER (http://pantherdb.org/) (7Mi H. Muruganujan A. Huang X. Ebert D. Mills C. Guo X. Thomas P.D. Protocol Update for large-scale genome and gene function analysis with the PANTHER classification system (v. 14.0).Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14: 703-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The results were grouped into molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Interestingly, several IPF-related pathological terms were identified, including ECM and collagen, cell migration, and response to cytokine growth factor inflammatory stimulus, which included TGF-β receptor signaling (FDR <0.05; Figs. 1A and S1; Tables S3 and S4). Of these, cell migration and collagen containing ECM were among the top ten ranked GO terms from the biological process category (Fig. 1B). These results extend our previous report (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that CM from RAS-activated ATII cells regulates the expression of many genes that augment fibroblast activation and migration independent of exogenous TGF-β. Of note, under these conditions, we did not see changes in expression of ACTA2, encoding α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (adjusted p value equals 0.289), suggesting that the fibroblasts did not adopt a myofibroblast phenotype under the conditions tested. The effect of CM from RAS-induced ATII cells on genes controlling cell migration was further demonstrated using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) with a gene list from GO:0010763 (positive regulation of fibroblast migration); the GSVA score calculated based on this gene list was higher in MRC5 cells incubated with CM from 4-OHT-treated versus control ATIIER:KRASV12 cells (p < 0.05; Fig. 2A). To validate this finding on cell migration, scratch wound assays were performed using MRC5 or IPFFs treated with CM from control or 4-OHT-activated ATIIER:KRASV12 cells. Twenty-four hours after the scratch wound, IPFFs treated with CM from 4-OHT-activated ATII cells almost filled all the gaps, whereas the wound in the control cells was still open (p < 0.01; Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained using MRC5 lung fibroblasts (Fig. S2A). Under the same conditions, CM from RAS-activated ATII cells did not affect the cell viability in MRC5 (Fig. S2B). In addition, in a transwell migration assay, a 3.5-fold increase in migration was detected using MRC5 lung fibroblasts treated with CM from 4-OHT-activated ATIIER:KRASV12 cells compared with those treated with CM from control cells over a 24-h period (p < 0.001; Fig. 2C). Together, these results demonstrate that RAS-activated ATII cells augment fibroblast migration via paracrine signaling. As we previously demonstrated that ZEB1 and its transcriptional target, tPA (encoded by PLAT gene) are key regulators of epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these two proteins may also control the ability of RAS-activated ATII cells to promote migration and recruit fibroblasts by paracrine signaling. First, we depleted ZEB1 in ATIIER:KRASV12 cells via RNAi (Fig. S3A). We found that this completely abolished the promigratory effects of CM from RAS-activated ATII cells on lung fibroblasts in both wound healing assay (p > 0.05; Figs. 3A and S3B) and transwell migration assay (p > 0.05; Fig. 3B). Next, we determined whether tPA was a key paracrine regulator of fibroblast migration. Recombinant tPA treatment significantly enhanced fibroblast migration (p < 0.0001; Fig. S3C). Similar to ZEB1, CM was collected from control or PLAT-depleted ATIIER:KRASV12 cells treated without or with 4-OHT (Fig. S3, D and E). As expected, RAS-activated ATII cells augmented fibroblast migration in both wound healing assay (p < 0.0001; Figs. 3A and S3F) and transwell migration assay (p < 0.0001; Fig. 3B), whereas under the same conditions, depletion of PLAT in ATIIER:KRASV12 cells completely abolished the promigratory effects of CM from RAS-activated ATII cells on lung fibroblasts (p > 0.05; Figs. 3, A and B and S3F). Taken together, these data highlight the importance of ZEB1 and tPA as key regulators of epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk to promote fibroblast recruitment, as well as fibroblast activation, as demonstrated previously (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Our current and previous (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) findings suggest that a ZEB1–tPA axis is involved in the paracrine signaling between RAS-activated ATII cells and fibroblasts to augment not only their recruitment but also their activation in the presence of TGF-β. To explore whether this epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk was bidirectional, we investigated the effect of the activated fibroblasts on the alveolar epithelium. First, MRC5 lung fibroblasts were left untreated or treated with TGF-β (Fig. S4A) to induce myofibroblast differentiation, as measured using the myofibroblast marker, α-SMA. An overall increase in α-SMA protein expression manifested after 24 h of TGF-β treatment, with maximal induction being observed by Western blot at 48 h post-TGF-β treatment (Fig. S4B). To eliminate the direct effect of exogenous TGF-β in CM collected from fibroblasts on ATII cells, fibroblast cultures were placed in fresh medium without TGF-β for another 24 h before CM was harvested (Fig. S4A; group “48 h+, 24 h−”). As shown in Figure S4B, fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts was maintained under these conditions, evidenced by a comparable level of α-SMA protein level. We then treated ATII cells with CM from control or TGF-β-activated MRC5 cells (Fig. S4C). Western blot analysis suggested that RAS signaling was activated upon treatment with CM from TGF-β-activated fibroblasts, reflected by significant increases in phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) (Fig. S4D). Of note, TGF-β-activated fibroblast CM also increased ZEB1 expression in ATII cells (Fig. S4D). Since it has been reported that IPFFs have a higher level of autocrine TGF-β activation (8Ghatak S. Bogatkevich G.S. Atnelishvili I. Akter T. Feghali-Bostwick C. Hoffman S. Fresco V.M. Fuchs J.C. Visconti R.P. Markwald R.R. Padhye S.B. Silver R.M. Hascall V.C. Misra S. Overexpression of c-Met and CD44v6 receptors contributes to autocrine TGF-beta1 signaling in interstitial lung disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7856-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we next compared the effects of CM from normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) or IPFFs on ATII cells. We found that RAS–ZEB1 signaling was significantly higher upon treatment with CM from IPFFs, reflected by significantly higher increases in phosphorylation of AKT and ERK levels (p < 0.05; Fig. 4, A and B) as well as ZEB1 (p < 0.01; Fig. 4C) and PLAT (tPA) expressions (p < 0.01; Fig. 4D). Together, these results suggest that signaling occurs between fibroblasts and ATII cells leading to RAS activation and induction of ZEB1, and that this effect is augmented by CM from fibroblasts that have been differentiated into myofibroblasts by TGF-β or by CM from IPFFs independently of exogenous TGF-β. As CM derived from TGF-β-activated fibroblasts or IPFFs induced RAS signaling in ATII cells, we next investigated which secreted factors from activated fibroblasts were responsible for this effect. By performing quantitative proteomic analysis of the CM from control or TGF-β-treated MRC5 cells, we identified 15 secreted proteins whose levels were upregulated upon TGF-β treatment (Table 1; Tables S5 and S6). Of these, SPARC was among the top candidates (Fig. 5A; Table 1), suggesting a potential regulatory role of SPARC in mesenchymal–epithelial crosstalk driven by TGF-β. This was further validated in a publicly available dataset (GSE139963) (9Senavirathna L.K. Huang C. Pushparaj S. Xu D. Liu L. Hypoxia and transforming growth factor β1 regulation of long non-coding RNA transcriptomes in human pulmonary fibroblasts.Physiol. Rep. 2020; 8: e14343Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), in which RNA-Seq was performed in human lung fibroblasts treated with or without TGF-β. Potential TGF-β-induced secreted proteins were identified by overlapping the upregulated genes with a list of secreted proteins (predicted) from Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/secretome). We identified 116 predicted secreted proteins that were significantly elevated (FDR-adjusted p value <0.05 and Log2[fold change] (Log2[fold change]) >1) in TGF-β-treated lung fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. S5; Table S7), and the expression of SPARC was increased by over 3-fold (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5B; Table 1; Fig. S5B; Table S7). The importance of SPARC in IPF pathogenesis was further confirmed in other datasets. In dataset GSE92592 (10Schafer M.J. White T.A. Iijima K. Haak A.J. Ligresti G. Atkinson E.J. Oberg A.L. Birch J. Salmonowicz H. Zhu Y. Cellular senescence mediates fibrotic pulmonary disease.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), SPARC levels are increased in IPF tissues compared with control lungs (p < 0.01; Fig. 5C; Table 1), consistent with our recent report (11Conforti F. Ridley R. Brereton C. Alzetani A. Johnson B. Marshall B.G. Fletcher S.V. Ottensmeier C.H. Richeldi L. Skipp P. Paracrine SPARC signaling dysregulates alveolar epithelial barrier integrity and function in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Discov. 2020; 6: 1-11Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Further analysis of GSE99621 (12Luzina I.G. Salcedo M.V. Rojas-Peña M.L. Wyman A.E. Galvin J.R. Sachdeva A. Clerman A. Kim J. Franks T.J. Britt E.J. Transcriptomic evidence of immune activation in macroscopically normal-appearing and scarred lung tissues in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Cell Immunol. 2018; 325: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that SPARC expression is increased not only in scarred but also in those macroscopically unaffected (normal-appearing) regions of IPF lung (p < 0.05; Fig. 5D; Table 1). In addition, we confirmed a significantly enhanced secretion of SPARC in CM from IPFFs versus NHLFs by Western blotting (p < 0.001; Fig. 5E). Therefore, these data suggested that SPARC is induced as an early response to fibroblast activation and that it may be associated with IPF disease progression.Table 1List of secreted proteins in the CM that are upregulated upon TGF-β treatment in MRC5 cells identified by quantitative proteomic analysis and their expressions in GSE139963, GSE92592, and GSE99621ProteinSecretomeGSE139963GSE92592GSE99621TGF-β versus controlTGF-β versus controlIPF versus controlIPF—normal versus controlIPF—scarred versus controlpLog2FCFDRLog2FCFDRLog2FCFDRLog2FCFDRLog2FCA2M1.08E − 025.440.00E + 00−3.741.76E − 081.012.45E − 030.802.16E − 010.41IGFBP33.94E − 044.701.22E − 896.141.21E − 041.016.50E − 010.207.33E − 010.17SERPINE21.84E − 034.110.00E + 003.851.26E − 152.376.26E − 051.532.59E − 041.49PXDN1.29E − 043.515.92E − 2351.638.00E − 050.771.24E − 010.401.26E − 030.77PGS11.29E − 032.068.44E − 04−0.324.85E − 01−0.087.74E − 02−0.422.16E − 02−0.55THBS12.69E − 021.980.00E + 002.024.37E − 021.018.57E − 01−0.128.95E − 01−0.10SPARC4.75E − 021.800.00E + 001.761.37E − 040.874.58E − 030.892.86E − 041.15APOA1-AS2.43E − 021.792.02E − 01−0.379.27E − 08−1.545.36E − 07−2.511.70E − 05−2.31COL4A22.06E − 021.470.00E + 002.981.25E − 040.918.00E − 010.142.54E − 010.49TGFBI1.20E − 031.411.17E − 2211.765.91E − 070.904.28E − 030.902.50E − 030.99MMP23.99E − 021.119.86E − 1081.169.10E − 182.041.84E − 131.323.05E − 131.38FN11.14E − 031.000.00E + 001.765.86E − 020.522.56E − 071.043.33E − 091.23IGFBP79.63E − 040.663.29E − 991.747.19E − 090.926.31E − 161.428.76E − 201.66COL12A14.19E − 020.516.97E − 01−0.041.57E − 020.512.63E − 010.373.94E − 010.32CYCS1.77E − 030.406.29E − 100.522.62E − 010.158.97E − 010.058.84E − 010.06Abbreviation: FC, fold change.Numbers in bold mean p values less than 0.05 and are statistically significant.

We recently reported that paracrine SPARC signaling from IPFFs dysregulates alveolar epithelial barrier integrity (11Conforti F. Ridley R. Brereton C. Alzetani A. Johnson B. Marshall B.G. Fletcher S.V. Ottensmeier C.H. Richeldi L. Skipp P. Paracrine SPARC signaling dysregulates alveolar epithelial barrier integrity and function in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Discov. 2020; 6: 1-11Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that SPARC might also mediate RAS activation in ATII cells during fibroblast–epithelial crosstalk. To test this hypothesis, ATII cells were exposed to CM harvested from control or SPARC-depleted NHLFs treated without or with TGF-β (Fig. S6A). As expected, we detected enhanced expression (Fig. S6B) and secretion (Fig. S6C) of SPARC from TGF-β-activated NHLFs compared with controls, and this was abolished using RNAi. When the CM was applied to ATII cells, CM from TGF-β-activated fibroblasts induced RAS activation, as evidenced by increases of phosphorylation in both AKT and ERK, whereas depletion of SPARC completely abolished the effects of CM from TGF-β-activated fibroblasts on ATII cells (Fig. S6C). We then compared CM from IPFFs: consistent with our previous results, an increased SPARC secretion was detected in CM from IPFFs versus NHLFs (Fig. S6D). Furthermore, while RAS signaling in ATII cells was activated by treatment with CM from IPFFs, these effects were completely abolished upon SPARC depletion in IPFFs (Fig. 6A; Fig. S6D), as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK levels (Fig. 6B; Fig. S6D). Furthermore, human recombinant SPARC treatment alone was sufficient to induce epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation in ATII cells, demonstrated by increased phosphorylation levels of EGFR and its downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels (Fig. 6C). EGFR activation was accompanied by a significant increase in mRNA expression of ZEB1 (Fig. 6C) and a reduction in CDH1 (E-cadherin) (Fig. S6E). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that SPARC is a critical paracrine regulator from activated lung fibroblasts that induces RAS activation in ATII cells (Fig. 6D). IPF is a chronic progressive lung disease with limited therapeutic options (1Richeldi L. Collard H.R. Jones M.G. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1941-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 13Nici L. Donner C. Wouters E. Zuwallack R. Ambrosino N. Bourbeau J.

Care Med. 2006; 173: 1390-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Abnormal wound healing responses appear to make major contributions to the scarring process, but the underlying pathological mechanisms are unclear. Similar to studies in kidney fibrosis (14Prunotto M. Budd D.C. Gabbiani G. Meier M. Formentini I. Hartmann G. Pomposiello S. Moll S. Epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk alteration in kidney fibrosis.J. Pathol. 2012; 228: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), our findings support the concept that aberrant epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk contributes to the development of interstitial lung fibrosis. Our studies are consistent with the establishment of a bidirectional profibrogenic positive feedback loop, which maintains a chronic wound environment involving activated epithelial cells and fibroblasts that drive fibrosis progression rather than wound resolution (Fig. 7). Epithelial cells undergo EMT in response to injury, allowing them to adopt a repair phenotype, which involves signaling to other cell types including inflammatory cells and resident mesenchymal cells. We previously reported that ATII cells undergoing RAS-induced EMT secrete tPA to augment TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and that ZEB1 is a key regulator of this paracrine signaling (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate further whether fibroblasts can respond to epithelial-derived signals in the absence of TGF-β, we used RNA-Seq to study the global transcriptomic changes in lung fibroblasts exposed to CM from ATII cells undergoing RAS-induced EMT. Using this unbiased approach, several potential mechanisms of relevance to IPF pathology were identified, including ECM and collagen, cell migration, cytokine binding, and inflammatory response, which included changes in expression of genes associated with TGF-β receptor signaling pathways. While we observed upregulation of ECM and collagen genes including COL3A1, COL4A6, COL14A1, and COL18A1 in the transcriptomic dataset, we did not observe changes in expression of either COL1A1, the major interstitial collagen produced in response to TGF-β stimulation, or ACTA2, which encodes alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation (Table S1; GSE163908). This suggests that the magnitude of TGF-β receptor signaling caused by the epithelial-derived CM was insufficient to drive differentiation of the fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings are consistent with our previous studies (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) where exogenous TGF-β was required to drive myofibroblast differentiation. However, our observation of upregulation of genes associated with TGF-β receptor signaling and increased expression of many profibrotic genes in fibroblasts following exposure to CM from epithelial cells undergoing RAS-induced EMT may help explain why the CM augmented the effects of exogenous TGF-β that we observed previously (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J. Paracrine signalling during ZEB1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition augments local myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Building on the strong gene expression signature for cell migration, we confirmed induction of a migratory phenotype in fibroblasts exposed to epithelial CM and demonstrated that this involved a ZEB1–tPA signaling axis, similar to that required for augmentation of TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation (6Yao L. Conforti F. Hill C. Bell J. Drawater L. Li J. Liu D. Xiong H. Alzetani A. Chee S.J.

Metformin (MET) and leucine (LEU) individually have shown positive effects in skeletal muscle during atrophy conditions but have not been evaluated in combination nor tested as a remedy to enhance muscle recovery following disuse atrophy in aging. The purpose of this study was to determine if a dual treatment of metformin and leucine (MET + LEU) would prevent disuse-induced atrophy and/or promote muscle recovery in aged mice and if these muscle responses correspond to changes in satellite cells and collagen remodeling. Aged mice (22-24 months) underwent 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) followed by 7 or 14 days of reloading (7 or 14 days RL). MET, LEU, or MET + LEU was administered via drinking water and were compared to Vehicle (standard drinking water) and ambulatory baseline. We observed that during HU, MET + LEU resolved whole body grip strength and soleus muscle specific force decrements caused by HU. Gastrocnemius satellite cell abundance was increased with MET + LEU treatment but did not alter muscle size during disuse or recovery conditions. Moreover, MET + LEU treatment alleviated gastrocnemius collagen accumulation caused by HU and increased collagen turnover during 7 and 14 days RL driven by a decrease in collagen IV content. Transcriptional pathway analysis revealed that MET + LEU altered muscle hallmark pathways related to inflammation and myogenesis during HU. Together, the dual treatment of MET and LEU was able to increase muscle function, satellite cell content, and reduce collagen accumulation, thus improving muscle quality during disuse and recovery in aging."
https://openalex.org/W3194885244,"There is still no agreement on the gold standard technique for diagnosing of H. Pylori in Iraq, as well as a paucity of data on the validity of different diagnostic techniques. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of this bacterium with different methods and compare them to the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as a golden standard technique among Iraqi patients. In total, 115 Iraqi patients strongly suspected of H. pylori infection were enrolled in the current study. Invasive techniques including rapid urease testing (RUT) and gastric tissue culture in addition to non-invasive techniques including 14C-Urea breath test (14C-UBT), stool antigen test (SAT), CagA-IgG serology, and qPCR were performed to confirm the H. pylori infection. The qPCR was used as the gold standard to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the studied diagnostic tests. Overall, the prevalence rate of H. pylori in Iraqi patients was ranged from 47.8 to 70.4% using different methods. The positive results for each test were as follows: qPCR 81, (70.4%) UBT 79 (68.7%), SAT 77 (67%), RUT 76 (66.1%), Cag-IgG 61 (53%), and culture 55 (47.8%). The 14C-UBT showed the highest overall performance with 97.5% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and total accuracy of 97.3% followed by SAT, RUT, Cag-IgG, and culture method. Based on the accuracy of the studied methods for H. pylori detection, they can be arranged in order as follows: qPCR > UBT > SAT > RUT> CagA IgG > culture. Since a universal gold standard assay for the diagnosis of H. pylori has not yet been established in Iraq, the UBT may be recommended as first choice due to its higher performance compared to other methods."

Recently, it was reported that intraperitoneal injections of ketone bodies partially ameliorated muscular dystrophy by increasing satellite cell (SC) proliferation. Here, we evaluated whether a ketogenic diet (KD) with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-KD) could alter genetically mutated DMD in model rats. We found that the MCT-KD significantly increased muscle strength and fiber diameter in these rats. The MCT-KD significantly suppressed the key features of DMD, namely, muscle necrosis, inflammation, and subsequent fibrosis. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the MCT-KD promoted the proliferation of muscle SCs, suggesting enhanced muscle regeneration. The muscle strength of DMD model rats fed with MCT-KD was significantly improved even at the age of 9 months. Our findings suggested that the MCT-KD ameliorates muscular dystrophy by inhibiting myonecrosis and promoting the proliferation of muscle SCs. As far as we can ascertain, this is the first study to apply a functional diet as therapy for DMD in experimental animals. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the MCT-KD-induced improvement of DMD."
https://openalex.org/W3194001075,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling controls cell metabolism, promotes cell survival, and contributes to tumorigenesis, yet its upstream regulation remains poorly defined. Although considerable evidence supports the prevailing view that amino acids activate mTOR complex 1 but not mTORC2, several studies reported paradoxical activation of mTORC2 signaling by amino acids. We noted that after amino acid starvation of cells in culture, addition of an amino acid solution increased mTORC2 signaling. Interestingly, we found the pH of the amino acid solution to be alkaline, ∼pH 10. These observations led us to discover and demonstrate here that alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) represents a previously unknown activator of mTORC2. Using a fluorescent pH-sensitive dye (cSNARF1-AM) coupled with live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that culturing cells in media at an alkaline pH induces a rapid rise in the pHi, which increases mTORC2 catalytic activity and downstream signaling to the pro-growth and pro-survival kinase Akt. Alkaline pHi also activates AMPK, a canonical sensor of energetic stress. Functionally, alkaline pHi activates AMPK-mTOR signaling, which attenuates apoptosis caused by growth factor withdrawal. Collectively, these findings reveal that alkaline pHi increases mTORC2- and AMPK-mediated signaling to promote cell survival during conditions of growth factor limitation, analogous to the demonstrated ability of energetic stress to activate AMPK-mTORC2 and promote cell survival. As an elevated pHi represents an underappreciated hallmark of cancer cells, we propose that the alkaline pHi stress sensing by AMPK-mTORC2 may contribute to tumorigenesis by enabling cancer cells at the core of a growing tumor to evade apoptosis and survive."

Native CNG channels are heterotetramers composed of homologous A and B subunits. Biallelic mutations in CNGA1 or CNGB1 genes result in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). To investigate the pathogenic mechanism of CNG channel-associated retinal degeneration, we developed a mouse model of CNGA1 knock-out using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We observed progressive retinal thinning and a concomitant functional deficit in vivo as typical phenotypes for RP. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining showed progressive degeneration in rods and cones. Moreover, microglial activation and oxidative stress damage occurred in parallel. RNA-sequencing analysis of the retinae suggested down-regulated synaptic transmission and phototransduction as early as 9 days postnatal, possibly inducing later photoreceptor degeneration. In addition, the down-regulated PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway indicated upregulation of autophagic process, and chaperone-mediated autophagy was further shown to coincide with the time course of photoreceptor death. Taken together, our studies add to a growing body of research exploring the mechanisms of photoreceptor death during RP progression and provide a novel CNGA1 knockout mouse model for potential development of therapies."

However, the molecular mechanism by which miR-23a-3p attenuates inflammatory pain is yet to be fully understood. Hence, the current study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which miR-23a-3p influences inflammatory pain. Bioinformatics was initially performed to predict the inflammatory pain related downstream targets of miR-23a-3p in macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). An animal inflammatory pain model was established using Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). The miR-23a-3p expression was downregulated in the microglia of CFA-induced mice, after which the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. FISH and immunofluorescence were performed to analyze the co-localization of miR-23a-3p and microglia. Interestingly, miR-23a-3p was transported to the microglia via M2 macrophage-EVs, which elevated the mechanical allodynia and the thermal hyperalgesia thresholds in mice model. The miR-23a-3p downstream target, USP5, was found to stabilize HDAC2 via deubiquitination to promote its expression while inhibiting the expression of NRF2. Taken together, the key findings of the current study demonstrate that macrophage-derived EVs containing miR-23a-3p regulates the HDAC2/NRF2 axis by decreasing USP5 expression to alleviate inflammatory pain, which may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of inflammatory pain."

We also show that mFICD-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts are depleted of AMPylated proteins. mFICD deletion alters protein synthesis and secretion in splenocytes, including that of IgM, an antibody secreted early during infections, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, without affecting the unfolded protein response.

https://openalex.org/W3195983885,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), an immunoregulatory cytokine plays an important role in inflammation and the immune response, and has been described as having a potential role in immune evasion by parasites. Thelazia callipaeda, a vector-borne zoonotic eye worm with a broad host range, has been documented as an agent of ocular infection of thelaziosis. The ability of T. callipaeda to persist in an immunologically competent host has led to the suggestion that it has evolved specific measures to counter immune defenses. To date, whether the immune evasion of T. callipaeda is related to MIF and the possible related signaling pathway and molecular mechanism have remained unclear. In the present study, we examined the effect of T. callipaeda MIF (T. cp-MIF) on macrophages. We analyzed the antigenic epitopes of the candidate T. cp-MIF and found that it exhibited an ideal antigenic index. Morphology, Flow cytometry, and cytokine analysis showed that T. cp-MIF induced the dynamic polarization of THP-1 macrophages from the M1-like phenotype to the M2-like phenotype. The chemotaxis assay revealed an inhibitory effect of T. cp-MIF on THP-1 macrophages. Western blotting suggested that, compared to the control, THP-1 macrophages exposed to T. cp-MIF had higher TLR4 protein expression and the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway activation. In conclusion, T. cp-MIF induces M2-like macrophage polarization through TLR4-mediated activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which might provide a basis for future research on how it affects the immune system of the host."
https://openalex.org/W3195572726,"Gastrointestinal infectious diseases remain an important issue for human and animal health. Investigations on gastrointestinal infectious diseases are classically performed in laboratory animals leading to the problem that species-specific models are scarcely available, especially when it comes to farm animals. The 3R principles of Russel and Burch were achieved using intestinal organoids of porcine jejunum. These organoids seem to be a promising tool to generate species-specific in vitro models of intestinal epithelium. 3D Organoids were grown in an extracellular matrix and characterized by qPCR. Organoids were also seeded on permeable filter supports in order to generate 2D epithelial monolayers. The organoid-based 2D monolayers were characterized morphologically and were investigated regarding their potential to study physiological transport properties and pathophysiological processes. They showed a monolayer structure containing different cell types. Moreover, their functional activity was demonstrated by their increasing transepithelial electrical resistance over 18 days and by an active glucose transport and chloride secretion. Furthermore, the organoid-based 2D monolayers were also confronted with cholera toxin derived from Vibrio cholerae as a proof of concept. Incubation with cholera toxin led to an increase of short-circuit current indicating an enhanced epithelial chloride secretion, which is a typical characteristic of cholera infections. Taken this together, our model allows the investigation of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms focusing on the small intestine of pigs. This is in line with the 3R principle and allows the reduction of classical animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3194187478,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) plays context-specific roles in multiple receptor-mediated signaling pathways in different cell types. Mice lacking TRAF3 in T cells display defective T-cell-mediated immune responses to immunization and infection and demonstrate defective early signaling via the TCR complex. However, the role of TRAF3 in the function of GITR/TNFRSF18, an important costimulatory member of the TNFR superfamily, is unclear. Here we investigated the impact of T cell TRAF3 status on both GITR expression and activation of specific kinases in the GITR signaling pathway in T cells. Our results indicate that TRAF3 negatively regulates GITR functions in several ways. First, expression of GITR protein was elevated in TRAF3-deficient T cells, resulting from both transcriptional and posttranslational regulation that led to greater GITR transcript levels, as well as enhanced GITR protein stability. TRAF3 associated with T cell GITR in a manner dependent upon GITR ligation. TRAF3 also inhibited several events of the GITR mediated early signaling cascade, in a manner independent of recruitment of phosphatases, a mechanism by which TRAF3 inhibits signaling through several other cytokine receptors. These results add new information to our understanding of GITR signaling and function in T cells, which is relevant to the potential use of GITR to enhance immune therapies."

A cross-sectional study was carried out among 11219 adolescents 12 to 18 years of age examined in the 2001-2018 National health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We examined the association between SUA and CVD risk factors. The overall mean SUA level was 5.00±1.24mg/dl. Restricted cubic spline analysis results revealed SUA was inversely associated with HDL-C and SPISE and positively associated with TC, TG, LDL-C, nonHDL-C, insulin, SBP and DBP after full adjustment. Multiple logistic analyses showed SUA level was independently associated with high TC, high TG, high nonHDL-C and low HDL-C (all p<0.05). Furthermore, females in the highest quartile of SUA had significantly higher odds for elevated BP (OR = 2.38, 95%CI:1.02-5.54, P<0.05) and high TC (OR = 2.22, 95%CI: 1.49-3.30, P<0.001), which not observed in males.

https://openalex.org/W3195452533,"CD27 is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, which stimulates lymphocytes and promotes their differentiation upon activation by TNF ligand CD70. Activation of the CD27 receptor provides a costimulatory signal to promote T cell, B cell, and NK cell activity to facilitate antitumor and anti-infection immunity. Aberrant increased and focused expression of CD70 on many tumor cells renders CD70 an attractive therapeutic target for direct tumor killing. However, despite their use as drug targets to treat cancers, the molecular basis and atomic details of CD27 and CD70 interaction remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of human CD27 in complex with human CD70. Analysis of our structure shows that CD70 adopts a classical TNF ligand homotrimeric assembly to engage CD27 receptors in a 3:3 stoichiometry. By combining structural and rational mutagenesis data with reported disease-correlated mutations, we identified the key amino acid residues of CD27 and CD70 that control this interaction. We also report increased potency for plate-bound CD70 constructs compared with solution-phase ligand in a functional activity to stimulate T-cells in vitro. These findings offer new mechanistic insight into this critical costimulatory interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3195606798,"Familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia are neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in the gene integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2b) encoding BRI2, which tunes excitatory synaptic transmission at both presynaptic and postsynaptic termini. In addition, BRI2 interacts with and modulates proteolytic processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), whose mutations cause familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (familial AD). To study the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by the Danish mutation, we generated rats carrying the Danish mutation in the rat Itm2b gene (Itm2bD rats). Given the BRI2/APP interaction and the widely accepted relevance of human amyloid β (Aβ), a proteolytic product of APP, to AD, Itm2bD rats were engineered to express two humanized App alleles and produce human Aβ. Here, we studied young Itm2bD rats to investigate early pathogenic changes in these diseases. We found that periadolescent Itm2bD rats not only present subtle changes in human Aβ levels along with decreased spontaneous glutamate release and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor–mediated responses but also had increased short-term synaptic facilitation in the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. These alterations in excitatory interneuronal communication can impair learning and memory processes and were akin to those observed in adult mice producing rodent Aβ and carrying either the Danish or British mutations in the mouse Itm2b gene. Collectively, the data show that the pathogenic Danish mutation alters the physiological function of BRI2 at glutamatergic synapses across species and early in life. Future studies will determine whether this phenomenon represents an early pathogenic event in human dementia.

Future studies will determine whether this phenomenon represents an early pathogenic event in human dementia. Model organisms that reproduce the pathogenesis of human diseases are useful to dissect disease mechanisms, identify therapeutic targets, and test therapeutic strategies. Because genetic manipulation has been easier in mice, mice have overtaken rats as the major rodent-based model organism in neurodegeneration research. Thus, to study familial Danish dementia (FDD) and familial British dementia (FBD), 15 years ago, we generated mice carrying the pathogenic Danish and British dementia mutations (integral membrane protein 2B [ITM2b]; Itm2bD and Itm2bB mice) into the Itm2b mouse gene (1Tamayev R.

Generation and initial characterization of FDD knock in mice.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We choose a knock-in (KI) approach rather than the more common transgenic overexpression approach for several reasons. KIs mimic the genetic of FDD and FBD and make no assumption about pathogenic mechanisms (except the unbiased genetic one), whereas the transgenic approach aims to reproduce pathology (plaques, neurofibrillary tangles [NFTs], etc.), under the assumption that this “pathology” is pathogenic. In KI models, expression of mutant genes is controlled by endogenous regulatory elements, avoiding issues related to overexpression of disease proteins in a nonphysiological quantitative–spatial–temporal manner. Finally, potential confounding “insertion” effects of transgenes are avoided. Because rats are better suited to study neurodegenerative diseases, we took advantage of recent developments in gene-editing technologies and introduced the familial Danish mutation into the genomic Itm2b rat locus (Itm2bD rats). The rat was the organism of choice for most behavioral, memory, and cognitive research, which is critical when studying neurodegenerative diseases—because physiological processes are similar in rats and humans and the rat is an intelligent and quick learner (4Deacon R.M.

Several procedures that are important in dementia research are more easily performed in rats as compared with mice because of the larger size of the rat brain. Cannulas—to administer drugs, biologics, viruses, and others—and microdialysis probes—for sampling extracellular brain levels of neurotransmitters, amyloid β (Aβ), soluble tau, and others—can be accurately directed to individual brain regions, causing less damage and increasing specificity.

Aggregated forms of Aβ, a product of APP processing, are by and large considered the main pathogenic molecule in AD. Rat and human APP differ by three amino acids in the Aβ region: given that human Aβs are believed to have higher propensity to form toxic Aβ species as compared with rodent Aβs, we produced rats carrying the humanized Aβ sequence (Apph rats) (37Tambini M.D. Yao W. D'Adamio L.

D'Adamio L. Opposite changes in APP processing and human Aβ levels in rats carrying either a protective or a pathogenic APP mutation.Elife. 2020; 9e52612Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, to study possible interactions between the Danish mutation and human Aβ, Itm2bD rats were backcrossed to Apph rats. Hence, all rats used in this study produce human and not rodent Aβ species. Here, we studied periadolescent Itm2bD rats, with the purpose of investigating early dysfunctions that may underlie initial pathogenic mechanisms leading to dementia later in life. The KI founder F0-Itm2bD rat, which is carrying FDD mutation on Itm2b rat gene, was generated by CRISPR/Cas–mediated genome engineering as described in the Experimental procedures section and Supporting information. The F0-Itm2bD rat, which is a chimera for the Itm2b gene, was crossed to WT (Itm2bw/w) Long–Evans rats to generate F1-Itm2bD/w rats. F1-Itm2bD/w rats were crossed to WT Long–Evans to generate F2-Itm2bD/w rats. These crossings were repeated three more times to obtain F5-Itm2bD/w rats. The probability that F5 rats carry unidentified off-target mutations (except those, if present, on chromosome 15) is ∼1.5625%. Male and female F5-Itm2bD/w rats were crossed to obtain Itm2bD/w, Itm2bD/D, and Itm2bw/w rats. The FDD mutation consists of a ten nucleotides duplication one codon before the normal stop codon (39Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Møller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. A decamer duplication in the 3' region of the BRI gene originates an amyloid peptide that is associated with dementia in a Danish kindred.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This produces a frameshift in the BRI2 sequence generating a precursor protein 11 amino acids larger than normal (Fig. 1A). To verify that the Danish mutation was correctly inserted into Itm2b exon 6, we amplified by PCR the Itm2b gene exon 6 Itm2bD/w, Itm2bD/D, and Itm2bw/w rats. Sequencing of the PCR products shows that the Danish mutation was correctly inserted in the Itm2b gene exon 6 (Fig. 1B) and encoded for the COOH terminus of the Danish BRI2 mutant. When we generated FDD KI mice, we humanized the mouse COOH-terminal region of BRI2 by introducing an alanine (A) substituted for threonine (T) at codon 250 (3Giliberto L. Matsuda S. Vidal R. D'Adamio L. Generation and initial characterization of FDD knock in mice.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since that humanization did not result into deposition of ADan peptides in amyloid plaques in KI mice (3Giliberto L. Matsuda S. Vidal R. D'Adamio L. Generation and initial characterization of FDD knock in mice.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), that modification was not repeated in rats. To generate Itm2bD/w, Itm2bD/D, and Itm2bw/w rats on a background in which rat App has a humanized Aβ region, Itm2bD/w and Apph/h rats were crossed to generate Itm2bD/w;Apph/w rats. The Appw allele was removed in subsequent crosses. Henceforth, Itm2bD/D, Itm2bD/w, and Itm2bw/w rats used in this study have an Apph/h background and produce human and not rodent Aβ species. To determine whether Itm2b expression is disrupted by the introduced mutations, we examined Itm2b mRNA levels in p21 Itm2bD/D and Itm2bw/w rats by standard RNA-Seq analysis on total brain RNA. The mRNA expression of Itm2b shows no significant difference between Itm2bD/D and Itm2bw/w rats (Fig. 1C). BRI2 is type II membrane protein that is synthesized as an immature precursor (imBRI2). imBRI2 is cleaved at the COOH terminus by proprotein convertase to produce the NH2-terminal mature BRI2 (mBRI2) and the 23 amino acid–long COOH-terminal peptide called Bri23 (40Choi S.I. Vidal R. Frangione B. Levy E. Axonal transport of British and Danish amyloid peptides via secretory vesicles.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As noted previously, in the Danish patients, a frameshift caused by a ten nucleotides duplication 5′ to the stop codon leads to the synthesis of a BRI2 precursor protein 11 amino acids larger than normal (39Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Møller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. A decamer duplication in the 3' region of the BRI gene originates an amyloid peptide that is associated with dementia in a Danish kindred.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Convertase-mediated cleavage of Danish imBRI2 generates a WT-like mBRI2 and a 34 amino acid–long peptide called ADan, which codeposits with Aβ species in amyloid fibrils in patients. For clarity, we will refer to the WT imBri2 as Bri2–Bri23 and to the Danish mutant imBri2 as Bri2-ADan. To determine whether the Itm2bD allele codes for Bri2-ADan, we examined Bri2 expression in total neuronal lysates isolated from male and female 2-month-old Itm2bD/w, Itm2bD/D, and Itm2bw/w rats. However, the Bri2 antibody tested identified many nonspecific bands (Fig. S1), making a rigorous assessment of Bri2 expression in rat brains challenging. Analysis of mouse Itm2bw/w and Itm2bD/D primary neurons showed that the mBri2/Bri2–Bri23 ratio in Itm2bw/w primary neurons was significantly higher than the mBri2/Bri2-ADan ratio in Itm2bD/D primary neurons (41Yin T.

In addition, lysosomal inhibition caused accumulation of mBri2 but not Bri2–Bri23 in Itm2bw/w primary neurons; in contrast, both mBri2 and Bri2-ADan accumulated in Itm2bD/D primary neurons (41Yin T.

Chem. 2021; 296: 100054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that the Danish mutation reduced maturation of the mutant precursor Bri2 in mouse neurons. Based on these observations, we probed whether primary neurons could be used to assess mBri2, Bri2–Bri23, and Bri2-ADan expression in KI rats. Primary neurons are a simpler system compared with total brain; this, per se, may reduce the number of nonspecific bands identified by anti-Bri2 antibodies. Moreover, inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation of Bri2 species in primary neurons may help identify specific Bri2 molecules. Thus, primary neurons derived from Itm2bw/w and Itm2bD/D rats were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine and analyzed by Western blot. The anti-Bri2 antibody identified a band of ∼34 kDa in all samples, which was increased by chloroquine (Fig. 2, A and C). These observations are consistent with the ∼34 kDa corresponding to mBri2. A second band of ∼36 kDa was detected in Itm2bw/w primary neurons (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a slightly larger second band (∼37 kDa) that was increased by chloroquine treatment was detected in Itm2bD/D primary neurons (Fig. 2, A and C). These observations are consistent with the ∼36 and ∼37 kDa bands corresponding to Bri2–Bri23 and Bri2-ADan, respectively.Table 1Results of the statistical analysis of data shown in Figure 2Ordinary two-way ANOVA analysis of Figure 2imBri2Source of variationF (DFn, DFd)pInteractionF (1, 20) = 272.2<0.0001TreatmentF (1, 20) = 354.3<0.0001GenotypeF (1, 20) = 1966<0.0001Sidak's multiple comparisons testSummaryAdjusted pItm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Veh)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Itm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bw/w (Chlo)NS0.5229Itm2bD/D (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Itm2bw/w (Chlo) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001mBri2Source of variationF (DFn, DFd)pInteractionF (1, 20) = 207.4<0.0001TreatmentF (1, 20) = 186.9<0.0001GenotypeF (1, 20) = 228.5<0.0001Sidak's multiple comparisons testSummaryAdjusted pItm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Veh)NS0.9969Itm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bw/w (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Itm2bD/D (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)NS0.9966Itm2bw/w (Chlo) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001imBri2/mBri2Source of variationF (DFn, DFd)pInteractionF (1, 20) = 108.3<0.0001TreatmentF (1, 20) = 104.2<0.0001GenotypeF (1, 20) = 627.1<0.0001Sidak's multiple comparisons testSummaryAdjusted pItm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Veh)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Itm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bw/w (Chlo)NS>0.9999Itm2bD/D (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Itm2bw/w (Chlo) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001LC3AI/IISource of variationF (DFn, DFd)pInteractionF (1, 20) = 37.36<0.0001TreatmentF (1, 20) = 353.5<0.0001GenotypeF (1, 20) = 36.16<0.0001Sidak's multiple comparisons testSummaryAdjusted pItm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bw/w (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Itm2bD/D (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001LC3B I/IISource of variationF (DFn, DFd)pInteractionF (1, 20) = 8.1110.0099TreatmentF (1, 20) = 26.75<0.0001GenotypeF (1, 20) = 8.2830.0093Sidak's multiple comparisons testSummaryAdjusted pItm2bw/w (Veh) versus Itm2bw/w (Chlo)NS0.2185Itm2bD/D (Veh) versus Itm2bD/D (Chlo)∗∗∗∗<0.0001Abbreviation: NS, not significant.∗∗∗∗ indicates P < 0.0001.

Without treatment, the levels of Bri2-ADan in Itm2bD/D primary neurons were significantly higher than the levels of Bri2–Bri23 in Itm2bw/w primary neurons (Fig. 2, A and C), and the mBri2/Bri2–Bri23 ratio in Itm2bw/w primary neurons was significantly higher than the mBri2/Bri2-ADan ratio in Itm2bD/D primary neurons (Fig. 2, A and C). LC3A and LC3B are autophagosome membrane proteins: the LC3A I/LC3A II and LC3B I/LC3B II ratios for each provides an independent measure of the impact of chloroquine on lysosomal degradation. Chloroquine significantly reduced the LC3A I/LC3A II and LC3B I/LC3B II ratios (Fig. 2, B and C), confirming inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation.

https://openalex.org/W3195618198,"Hypertension (HTN) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common problem that increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, and lowers the quality of life. Despite the disproportionately high burden of HTN in DM patients, determinants for the comorbidity have not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the determinants of HTN among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on follow-up at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital.We conducted a hospital-based unmatched case-control study at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital on 386 randomly selected patients with type 2 diabetes on follow-up (200 cases and 186 controls). We collected data by using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and data extraction form. To identify determinants of hypertension, a multivariable binary logistic regression was fitted, and the findings are presented using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).The mean reported age (±SD) of the cases and the controls was 60.3 (±9.9) and 55.3 (±11.3) years, respectively. The eight identified independent determinants of hypertension with AOR [95% CI] were obesity: 2.82 [1.43, 5.57], sedentary activity of ≥4hrs/day: 1.75 [1.10, 2.79], higher stress score: 1.05 [1.01, 1.10], serum creatinine above 1.1 mg/dl: 2.35 [1.13, 4.91], age: 1.05 [1.02, 1.08], being government employee as compared to private workers: 2.18 [1.06, 4.50] and family history of hypertension: 2.11 [1.26, 3.54]. Further, interaction of diabetes duration with insulin use: 1.03 [1.01, 1.07] was also a significant predictor of HTN among DM patients.The finding calls for interventions for mitigating these determinants. Further research is needed to examine the interaction between diabetes duration and insulin use."
https://openalex.org/W3195689905,"The melibiose permease of Salmonella typhimurium (MelBSt) catalyzes the stoichiometric symport of galactopyranoside with a cation (H+, Li+, or Na+) and is a prototype for Na+-coupled major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters presenting from bacteria to mammals. X-ray crystal structures of MelBSt have revealed the molecular recognition mechanism for sugar binding; however, understanding of the cation site and symport mechanism is still vague. To further investigate the transport mechanism and conformational dynamics of MelBSt, we generated a complete single-Cys library containing 476 unique mutants by placing a Cys at each position on a functional Cys-less background. Surprisingly, 105 mutants (22%) exhibit poor transport activities (<15% of Cys-less transport), although the expression levels of most mutants were comparable to that of the control. The affected positions are distributed throughout the protein. Helices I and X and transmembrane residues Asp and Tyr are most affected by cysteine replacement, while helix IX, the cytoplasmic middle-loop, and C-terminal tail are least affected. Single-Cys replacements at the major sugar-binding positions (K18, D19, D124, W128, R149, and W342) or at positions important for cation binding (D55, N58, D59, and T121) abolished the Na+-coupled active transport, as expected. We mapped 50 loss-of-function mutants outside of these substrate-binding sites that suffered from defects in protein expression/stability or conformational dynamics. This complete Cys-scanning mutagenesis study indicates that MelBSt is highly susceptible to single-Cys mutations, and this library will be a useful tool for further structural and functional studies to gain insights into the cation-coupled symport mechanism for Na+-coupled MFS transporters."
https://openalex.org/W3194253461,"Some research has suggested that miRNA-10a (miR-10a-5p) had an inhibitory function in proliferation and invasion of cancers. Whereas the role of miR-10a-5p in melanoma has not been fully explored. This study aims to confirm LIN28B as the targeted gene of miR-10a-5p which was explored in melanoma cells. In addition, upstream regulatory molecule of miR-10a-5p was also investigated in melanoma cells.Real-time Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was adopted to analyze miR-10a-5p expression level in melanoma and the normal human epidermal melanocyte cells. Several biological assays were performed to evaluate miR-10a-5p influences on cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability in A375 and B16-F10 cells. Gene prediction of miRNA targeting and a dual luciferase assay were applied to assess miR-10a-5p-targeted LIN28B. Western blot assessed the impacts of miR-10a-5p on the protein expression of LIN28B. Western blot analyzed the TCF21 effects on the expression of LIN28B and RT-qPCR assessed the influence of TCF21 on the expression level of miRNA-10a. In addition, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay and JASPAR databases were employed to explore the regulatory relationship between TCF21 and miR-10a-5p.We discovered that miR-10a-5p expression was lower in melanoma cells and high expression of miR-10a-5p suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of melanoma cells. We also discovered that miR-10a-5p targeted the LIN28B mRNA 3'UTR area and diminished LIN28B protein expression. We found that LIN28B expression was strongly decreased by TCF21 upregulation in the two melanoma cells. The qRT-PCR assay showed that miR-10a-5p expression level was obviously boosted by increased TCF21 expression. The results also demonstrated that TCF21 directly regulated miR-10a-5p at transcript levels.TCF21 induced miRNA-10a targeting LIN28B could affect the progression and growth of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3194445479,"The retinol dehydrogenase Rdh10 catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction that converts retinol into retinoic acid (RA), an autacoid that regulates energy balance and reduces adiposity. Skeletal muscle contributes to preventing adiposity, by consuming nearly half the energy of a typical human. We report sexually dimorphic differences in energy metabolism and muscle function in Rdh10+/- mice. Relative to wild-type (WT) controls, Rdh10+/- males fed a high-fat diet decrease reliance on fatty-acid oxidation and experience glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Running endurance decreases 40%. Rdh10+/- females fed this diet increase fatty acid oxidation and experience neither glucose intolerance nor insulin resistance. Running endurance increases 220%. We therefore assessed RA function in the mixed-fiber type gastrocnemius muscles (GM), which contribute to running, rather than standing, and are similar to human GM. RA levels in Rdh10+/- male GM decrease 38% relative to WT. Rdh10+/- male GM increase expression of Myog and reduce Eif6 mRNAs, which reduce and enhance running endurance, respectively. Cox5A, complex IV activity, and ATP decrease. Increased centralized nuclei reveal existence of muscle malady and/or repair in GM fibers. Comparatively, RA in Rdh10+/- female GM decreases by less than half the male decrease, from a more modest decrease in Rdh10 and an increase in the estrogen-induced retinol dehydrogenase Dhrs9. Myog mRNA decreases. Cox5A, complex IV activity, and ATP increase. Centralized GM nuclei do not increase. We conclude that Rdh10/RA affects whole body energy use and insulin resistance partially through sexual dimorphic effects on skeletal muscle gene expression, structure, and mitochondria activity."
https://openalex.org/W3194453413,"Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) is predicted to be present in mitochondria of several invertebrate taxa including tardigrades. Independently of the reason concerning the enzyme occurrence in animal mitochondria, expression of AOX in human mitochondria is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy. Till now, relevant data were obtained due to heterologous AOX expression in cells and animals without natively expressed AOX. Application of animals natively expressing AOX could importantly contribute to the research. Thus, we decided to investigate AOX activity in intact specimens of the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris . We observed that H . exemplaris specimens’ tolerance to the blockage of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) cytochrome pathway was diminished in the presence of AOX inhibitor and the inhibitor-sensitive respiration enabled the tardigrade respiration under condition of the blockage. Importantly, these observations correlated with relevant changes of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (Δψ) detected in intact animals. Moreover, detection of AOX at protein level required the MRC cytochrome pathway blockage. Overall, we demonstrated that AOX activity in tardigrades can be monitored by the animals’ behavior observation as well as by measurement of intact specimens’ whole-body respiration and Δψ. Furthermore, it is also possible to check the impact of the MRC cytochrome pathway blockage on AOX level as well as AOX inhibition in the absence of the blockage on animal functioning. Thus, H . exemplaris could be consider as a whole-animal model suitable to study AOX."

We thus developed and assessed the digitized arithmetic task (DAT), which combines inner language and executive functions in approximately 4 minutes.We assessed the psychometric properties of DAT in three languages, across four European sites, in 77 early-stage HD patients (age: 52 ± 11 years; 27 females), and 57 controls (age: 50 ± 10, 31 females). Forty-eight HD patients and 34 controls were followed up to one year with 96 participants who underwent MRI brain imaging (HD patients = 46) at baseline and 50 participants (HD patients = 22) at one year. Linear mixed models and Pearson correlations were used to assess associations with clinical assessment.At baseline, HD patients were less accurate (p = 0.0002) with increased response time (p<0.0001) when compared to DAT in controls. Test-retest reliability in HD patients ranged from good to excellent for response time (range: 0.63-0.79) and from questionable to acceptable for accuracy (range: r = 0.52-0.69). Only DAT, the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Total Functional Capacity scores were able to detect a decline within a one-year follow-up in HD patients (all p< 0.05). In contrast with all the other cognitive tasks, DAT correlated with striatal atrophy over time (p = 0.037) but not with motor impairment.DAT is fast, reliable, motor-free, applicable in several languages, and able to unmask cognitive decline correlated with striatal atrophy in small cohorts of HD patients. This likely makes it a useful endpoint in future trials for HD and other neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3193836223,"Pain in the elbow, shoulder, knee, lower back, and various other joints is relieved by adhesion of pyramidal thorn patches. To elucidate the pain relief mechanism induced by the patches, we established a quantitative method for estimating the pain reduction and investigated the brain regions that change in association with pain relief. We first attempted to quantify the pain relief using transcutaneous electric stimulation (TCES) and a visual analog scale (VAS), and then applied near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to the prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We also examined the salivary oxytocin levels, which are thought to reflect oxytocin secretion levels from the posterior pituitary in the brain. Application of pyramidal thorn patches to pain regions decreased the pain degree estimated using TCES and VAS. Oxyhemoglobin levels were likely to be decreased in the left DLPFC on the basis of NIRS measurements during patch treatment, suggesting that the left DLPFC is involved in pain relief. On the other hand, the salivary oxytocin levels varied widely. A potential reason for the varying salivary oxytocin levels is its utilization in the pain region as an analgesic agent. Our results suggest that the left DLPFC will become a target brain region for pain therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3194445030,"The cytosolic enzyme ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (ECHDC1) decarboxylates ethyl- or methyl-malonyl-CoA, two side products of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These CoA derivatives can be used to synthesize a subset of branched-chain fatty acids (FAs). We previously found that ECHDC1 limits the synthesis of these abnormal FAs in cell lines, but its effects in vivo are unknown. To further evaluate the effects of ECHDC1 deficiency, we generated knockout mice. These mice were viable, fertile, showed normal postnatal growth, and lacked obvious macroscopic and histologic changes. Surprisingly, tissues from wild-type mice already contained methyl-branched FAs due to methylmalonyl-CoA incorporation, but these FAs were only increased in the intraorbital glands of ECHDC1 knockout mice. In contrast, ECHDC1 knockout mice accumulated 16-20-carbon FAs carrying ethyl-branches in all tissues, which were undetectable in wild-type mice. Ethyl-branched FAs were incorporated into different lipids, including acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, plasmanylcholines, and triglycerides. Interestingly, we found a variety of unusual glycine-conjugates in the urine of knockout mice, which included adducts of ethyl-branched compounds in different stages of oxidation. This suggests that the excretion of potentially toxic intermediates of branched-chain FA metabolism might prevent a more dramatic phenotype in these mice. Curiously, ECHDC1 knockout mice also accumulated 2,2-dimethylmalonyl-CoA. This indicates that the broad specificity of ECHDC1 might help eliminate a variety of potentially dangerous branched-chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs. We conclude that ECHDC1 prevents the formation of ethyl-branched FAs and that urinary excretion of glycine-conjugates allows mice to eliminate potentially deleterious intermediates of branched-chain FA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3196223658,"Since the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019, there has been a global hunt for the origin of the ongoing pandemic. Zhou et al. provide further evidence of coronavirus diversity, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, in bat species in Yunnan province, China. Since the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019, there has been a global hunt for the origin of the ongoing pandemic. Zhou et al. provide further evidence of coronavirus diversity, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, in bat species in Yunnan province, China. In the 1800s, English and German chemists discovered that mixing tartaric acid, bicarbonate of soda, and a large amount of sugar made an appealing effervescent drink. They named this fizzy concoction “sherbet.” In 1854, several individuals indulged in sherbet at small cafes in London and, subsequently, became violently ill and died. Their deaths, along with hundreds of others, led an astute doctor to make a map, find and remove a simple water pump handle, stop an outbreak, and redefine the search for origins of disease. The pathogen, of course, was Cholera vibrio, and the man, Dr. John Snow. Since the first cluster of unknown pneumonia cases at a seafood market, there has been a global race to determine the “water pump” equivalent for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). What have we learned so far? The origins of SARS-CoV-2 are more complicated than a pump handle. Evolution, environment, and humanity are critical factors in disease emergence. Ultimately, the cholera outbreak in London was not caused by the pump handle but rather by water sources contaminated with a macroscopic pathogen via industrialization and urbanization—an answer that took decades to be established and accepted. The origins of SARS-CoV-2 are likely just as complicated. In this issue of Cell, Zhou et al. provide additional pieces to the puzzle (Zhou et al., 2021Zhou H. Ji J. Chen X. Bi Y. Li J. Wang Q. Hu T. Song H. Zhao R. Chen Y. et al.Identification of novel bat coronaviruses sheds light on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.Cell. 2021; 184: 4380-4391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Their work highlights the importance of accessible and affordable metagenomics in discovery of unknown pathogens and of using functional assays to determine zoonotic risk. Recent studies have identified viruses belonging to the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage in rhinolophids in China, Cambodia, Japan, and Thailand (Hul et al., 2021Hul V. Delaune D. Karlsson E.A. Hassanin A. Tey P.O. Baidaliuk A. Gámbaro F. Tu V.T. Keatts L.

Commun. 2021; 12: 972Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). None perfectly match SARS-CoV-2. Zhou et al. add more depth and diversity to the understanding of the viral origins of SARS-CoV-2 beyond these studies, sequencing 411 bat samples from a small region in Yunnan collected between 2019 and 2020, leading to 24 full-length coronavirus (CoV) genomes, including three SARS-CoV and four novel SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Rhinolophus bats. These four new possible “cousins” of SARS-CoV-2 cluster into two different groups: (1) RpYN06 is the second-closest known virus to SARS-CoV-2 (94.5% sequence identity by whole genome) and (2) RmYN04, RmYN05, and RmYN08 cluster closely to viruses detected in pangolins. In addition, they find 17 other novel alpha-CoV in Rhinolophus and other species. CoVs are continually evolving and recombining. Their ability to jump the species barrier is uncanny. In the 20 years before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), beta-CoVs caused two deadly outbreaks and emerged as a seasonally circulating virus (Frutos et al., 2021Frutos R. Serra-Cobo J. Pinault L. Lopez Roig M. Devaux C.A. Emergence of Bat-Related Betacoronaviruses: Hazard and Risks.Front. Microbiol. 2021; 12: 591535Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The origins of these viruses took years to uncover and remain unclear. Similarly, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 evolved within and escaped from its bat ancestors may be years away. One critical concern is the ability to jump from bats to humans. The beta-CoV detected by Zhou et al. present complex recombination patterns and variability in the spike gene, the key protein necessary for infecting human cells. Molecular characterization confirms this variability. On a functional level, while RpYN06 is closest to SARS-CoV-2 on a whole genome level, its spike could not bind to human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. By contrast, although RmYN04 clusters more closely to viruses detected in pangolins, it has a spike that can bind to hACE2 to some degree. Overall, clear patterns in spike genetics are yet to emerge for accurate prediction of binding ability of bat viruses to the human receptor. Humans have an obsession with origin. The world is desperate for answers about the origin of SARS-CoV-2. While Zhou and colleagues provide a greater understanding of CoV in bat species, including SARS-CoV-2, numerous questions still remain: Possibly, but it likely won’t be where we think. Most zoonotic pathogens go through primary spillover into bridge/amplifier species before jumping into humans. To date, the closest SARS-CoV-2-related viruses detected in animals other than bats are from pangolins (Lam et al., 2020Lam T.T.-Y. Jia N. Zhang Y.-W. Shum M.H.-H. Jiang J.-F. Zhu H.-C. Tong Y.-G.

Liao Y.-S. et al.Identifying SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins.Nature. 2020; 583: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar); however, pangolin CoV possibly arose through convergent evolution. All other human CoVs have a putative secondary host (Shereen et al., 2020Shereen M.A. Khan S. Kazmi A. Bashir N. Siddique R. COVID-19 infection: Origin, transmission, and characteristics of human coronaviruses.J. Adv. Res. 2020; 24: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 required an intermediate host(s) prior to spillover to humans. Based on everything we know: bats. Specifically, likely Horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sp) somewhere in Southeast Asia. Due to their unique physiology, bats naturally harbor CoV. In addition, bats live together in large groups, often sharing viruses across species (Irving et al., 2021Irving A.T. Ahn M. Goh G. Anderson D.E. Wang L.-F. Lessons from the host defences of bats, a unique viral reservoir.Nature. 2021; 589: 363-370Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date, all SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats are detected in Rhinolophus sp, the majority in Southeast Asia. SARS-CoV-2-related positive Rhinolophid species are diverse; however, their ranges and behaviors intertwine, promoting viral transmission, spread, and recombination (Hassanin et al., 2021Hassanin A. Tu V.T. Curaudeau M. Csorba G. Inferring the ecological niche of bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 using phylogeographic analyses of Rhinolophus species.Sci. Rep. 2021; 11: 14276Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This viral diversity and prevalence, coupled with high population density and a richness of other potential bridge species, makes Southeast Asia a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases. Likely not. The bat itself probably was not even sick. Continual evolution, plasticity, and recombination of CoV make it harder and harder to determine origin. Viruses themselves do not exist in isolation. They exist as clouds of mutations called quasispecies. SARS-CoV-2 is no exception (Armero et al., 2021Armero A. Berthet N. Avarre J.C. Intra-Host Diversity of SARS-Cov-2 Should Not Be Neglected: Case of the State of Victoria, Australia.Viruses. 2021; 13: 133Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A specific combination of genetics was advantageous for an individual virus at the right place at the right time. Apart from the original bat virus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in humans, adapting and mutating, long before the first cases in the seafood market (Pekar et al., 2021Pekar J. Worobey M. Moshiri N. Scheffler K. Wertheim J.O. Timing the SARS-CoV-2 index case in Hubei province.Science. 2021; 372: 412-417Crossref Google Scholar). Yes, indubitably. Three out of every four human diseases have an animal origin. Despite substantial impacts of zoonotic disease on global public health and economy, we still poorly understand them. The risks of new diseases emerging are accelerated by urbanization and environmental degradation through climate change. Unfortunately, there may never be a COVID-19 pump handle, and we barely have an indication of the location of the well. We still know next to nothing. However, like Dr. Snow, we will continue the systematic search for answers. Zhou and colleagues add to our SARS-CoV-2 map. The global research community needs to keep searching for and mechanistically assessing potentially pandemic zoonotic pathogens, as well as mitigate risk of the next emergence through increases in biosafety, biosecurity, conservation, and reduction in environmental impact.

https://openalex.org/W3193423124,"Success of adoptive cell therapy mainly depends on the ability of immune cells to persist and function optimally in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although present at the cancer site, immune cells become exhausted and/or inhibited, due to the presence of inhibitory receptors such as PD-L1 on malignant cells. Novel genetic strategies to manipulate the PD1/PD-L1 axis comprise (i) PD-1 reversion where the receptor intracellular domain is replaced with an activating unit, (ii) the use of anti-PD-L1 CAR or (iii) the disruption of the PD-1 gene. We here present an alternative strategy to equip therapeutic cells with a truncated PD-1 (tPD-1) to abrogate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. We show that engagement of tPD-1 with PD-L1-positive tumor unleashes NK-92 activity in vitro. Furthermore, this binding was sufficiently strong to induce killing of targets otherwise not recognized by NK-92, thus increasing the range of targets. In vivo treatment with NK-92 tPD-1 cells led to reduced tumor growth and improved survival. Importantly, tPD-1 did not interfere with tumor recognition in PD-L1 negative conditions. Thus, tPD-1 represents a straightforward method for improving antitumor immunity and revealing new targets through PD-L1 positivity."
https://openalex.org/W3193622075,"We highlight the ability of the tuberculosis (TB) causing bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), to induce key characteristics that are associated with established IARC classified Group 1 and Group 2A carcinogenic agents. There is sufficient evidence from epidemiological case-control, cohort and meta-analysis studies of increased lung cancer (LC) risk in pre-existing/active/old TB cases. Similar to carcinogens and other pathogenic infectious agents, exposure to aerosol-containing Mtb sprays in mice produce malignant transformation of cells that result in squamous cell carcinoma. Convincing, mechanistic data show several characteristics shared between TB and LC which include chronic inflammation, genomic instability and replicative immortality, just to name a few cancer hallmarks. These hallmarks of cancer may serve as precursors to malignant transformation. Together, these findings form the basis of our postulate that Mtb is a complete human pulmonary carcinogen. We also discuss how Mtb may act as both an initiating agent and promoter of tumor growth. Forthcoming experimental studies will not only serve as proof-of-concept but will also pivot our understanding of how to manage/treat TB cases as well as offer solutions to clinical conundrums of TB lesions masquerading as tumors. Clinical validation of our concept may also help pave the way for next generation personalized medicine for the management of pulmonary TB/cancer particularly for cases that are not responding well to conventional chemotherapy or TB drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3194109510,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remains one of the major causes of blindness in children worldwide. While current ROP treatments are mostly disruptive to reduce proliferative neovascularization by targeting the hypoxic phase, protection against early hyperoxia-induced retinal vascular loss represents an effective therapeutic window, but no such therapeutic strategy is available. Built upon our recent demonstration that the protection against oxygen-induced retinopathy by adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonists is most effective when administered at the hyperoxia (not hypoxic) phase, we here uncovered the cellular mechanism underlying the A2AR-mediated protection against early hyperoxia-induced retinal vascular loss by reversing the inhibition of cellular proliferation via possibly multiple signaling pathways. Specifically, we revealed two distinct stages of the hyperoxia phase with greater cellular proliferation and apoptosis activities and upregulation of adenosine signaling at postnatal 9 day (P9) but reduced cellular activities and adenosine-A2AR signaling at P12. Importantly, the A2AR-mediated protection at P9 was associated with the reversal of hyperoxia-induced inhibition of progenitor cells at the peripheral retina at P9 and of retinal endothelial proliferation at P9 and P12. The critical role of cellular proliferation in the hyperoxia-induced retinal vascular loss was validated by the increased avascular areas by siRNA knockdown of the multiple signaling molecules involved in modulation of cellular proliferation, including activin receptor-like kinase 1, DNA-binding protein inhibitor 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A."

In this study, we aimed to compare the growth trajectory rate and evaluate growth trajectory characteristics among children, who are HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) and HIV unexposed uninfected (HUU), under two years in Zambia.Our study used data from the ROVAS II study (PACTR201804003096919), an open-label randomized control trial of two verses three doses of live, attenuated, oral RotarixTM administered 6 &10 weeks or at 6 &10 weeks plus an additional dose at 9 months of age, conducted at George clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. Anthropometric measurements (height and weight) were collected on all scheduled and unscheduled visits. We defined linear growth velocity as the rate of change in height and estimated linear growth velocity as the first derivative of the mixed effect model with fractional polynomial transformations and, thereafter, used the second derivative test to determine the peak height and age at peak heigh.We included 212 infants in this study with median age 6 (IQR: 6-6) weeks of age. Of these 97 (45.3%) were female, 35 (16.4%) were stunted, and 59 (27.6%) were exposed to HIV at baseline. Growth velocity was consistently below the 3rd percentile of the WHO linear growth standard for HEU and HUU children. The peak height and age at peak height among HEU children were 74.7 cm (95% CI = 73.9-75.5) and 15.5 months (95% CI = 14.7-16.3) respectively and those for HUU were 73 cm (95% CI = 72.1-74.0) and 15.6 months (95% CI = 14.5-16.6) respectively.We found no difference in growth trajectories between infants who are HEU and HUU. However, the data suggests that poor linear growth is universal and profound in this cohort and may have already occurred in utero."
https://openalex.org/W3108972977,"Currently, the population dynamics of preclonal cancer cells before clonal expansion of tumors has not been sufficiently addressed thus far. By focusing on preclonal cancer cell population as a Darwinian evolutionary system, we formulated and analyzed the observed mutation frequency among tumors (MFaT) as a proxy for the hypothesized sequence read frequency and beneficial fitness effect of a cancer driver mutation. Analogous to intestinal crypts, we assumed that sample donor patients are separate culture tanks where proliferating cells follow certain population dynamics described by extreme value theory (EVT). To validate this, we analyzed three large-scale cancer genome datasets, each harboring &gt; 10000 tumor samples and in total involving &gt; 177898 observed mutation sites. We clarified the necessary premises for the application of EVT in the strong selection and weak mutation (SSWM) regime in relation to cancer genome sequences at scale. We also confirmed that the stochastic distribution of MFaT is likely of the Fréchet type, which challenges the well-known Gumbel hypothesis of beneficial fitness effects. Based on statistical data analysis, we demonstrated the potential of EVT as a population genetics framework to understand and explain the stochastic behavior of driver-mutation frequency in cancer genomes as well as its applicability in real cancer genome sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W3193503604,"The progressive loss of CD4+ T cells during HIV infection of lymphoid tissues involves both the apoptotic death of activated and productively infected CD4 T cells and the pyroptotic death of large numbers of resting and abortively infected bystander CD4 T cells. HIV spreads both through cellular release of virions and cell-to-cell transmission involving the formation of virological synapses. Cell-to-cell transmission results in high-level transfer of large quantities of virions to the target cell exceeding that achieved with cell-free virions. Broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bNAbs) binding to HIV envelope protein capably block cell-free virus spread, and when added at higher concentrations can also interdict cell-to-cell transmission. Exploiting these distinct dose-response differences, we now show that four different bNAbs block the pyroptotic death of bystander cells, but only when added at concentrations sufficient to block cell-to-cell transmission. These findings further support the conclusion that HIV killing of abortively infected bystander CD4 T cells requires cell-to-cell transfer of virions. As bNAbs attract more interest as potential therapeutics, it will be important to consider the higher concentrations of these antibodies required to block the inflammatory death of bystander CD4 T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3193508906,"Cannabinoid receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) modulates CB1 cannabinoid receptor G-protein coupling in part by altering the selectivity for Gαi subtype activation, but the molecular basis for this function of CRIP1a is not known. We report herein the first structure of CRIP1a at a resolution of 1.55 Å. CRIP1a exhibits a 10-stranded and antiparallel β-barrel with an interior comprised of conserved hydrophobic residues and loops at the bottom and a short helical cap at the top to exclude solvent. The β-barrel has a gap between strands β8 and β10, which deviates from β-sandwich fatty acid-binding proteins that carry endocannabinoid compounds and the Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor predicted by computational threading algorithms. The structural homology search program DALI identified CRIP1a as homologous to a family of lipidated-protein carriers that includes phosphodiesterase 6 delta subunit and Unc119. Comparison with these proteins suggests that CRIP1a may carry two possible types of cargo: either (i) like phosphodiesterase 6 delta subunit, cargo with a farnesyl moiety that enters from the top of the β-barrel to occupy the hydrophobic interior or (ii) like Unc119, cargo with a palmitoyl or a myristoyl moiety that enters from the side where the missing β-strand creates an opening to the hydrophobic pocket. Fluorescence polarization analysis demonstrated CRIP1a binding of an N-terminally myristoylated 9-mer peptide mimicking the Gαi N terminus. However, CRIP1a could not bind the nonmyristolyated Gαi peptide or cargo of homologs. Thus, binding of CRIP1a to Gαi proteins represents a novel mechanism to regulate cell signaling initiated by the CB1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3194441278,"Proteases serve as important tools in biotechnology and as valuable drugs or drug targets. Efficient protein engineering methods to study and modulate protease properties are thus of great interest for a plethora of applications. We established PROFICS (PRotease Optimization via Fusion-Inhibited Carbamoyltransferase-based Selection), a bacterial selection system, which enables the optimization of proteases for biotechnology, therapeutics or diagnosis in a simple overnight process. During the PROFICS process, proteases are selected for their ability to specifically cut a tag from a reporter enzyme and leave a native N-terminus. Precise and efficient cleavage after the recognition sequence reverses the phenotype of an Escherichia coli knockout strain deficient in an essential enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis. A toolbox was generated to select for proteases with different preferences for P1' residues (the residue immediately following the cleavage site). The functionality of PROFICS is demonstrated with viral proteases and human caspase-2. PROFICS improved caspase-2 activity up to 25-fold after only one round of mutation and selection. Additionally, we found a significantly improved tolerance for all P1' residues caused by a mutation in a substrate interaction site. We showed that this improved activity enables cells containing the new variant to outgrow cells containing all other mutants, facilitating its straightforward selection. Apart from optimizing enzymatic activity and P1' tolerance, PROFICS can be used to reprogram specificities, erase off-target activity, optimize expression via tags/codon usage, or even to screen for potential drug-resistance-conferring mutations in therapeutic targets such as viral proteases in an unbiased manner."
https://openalex.org/W3194457664,"Long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are genetic elements that, like retroviruses, replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate into a complementary DNA (cDNA) that is next integrated into the host genome by their own integrase. The Ty1 LTR retrotransposon has proven to be a reliable working model to investigate retroelement integration site preference. However, the low yield of recombinant Ty1 integrase production reported so far has been a major obstacle for structural studies. Here we analyze the biophysical and biochemical properties of a stable and functional recombinant Ty1 integrase highly expressed in E.coli. The recombinant protein is monomeric and has an elongated shape harboring the three-domain structure common to all retroviral integrases at the N-terminal half, an extra folded region, and a large intrinsically disordered region at the C-terminal half. Recombinant Ty1 integrase efficiently catalyzes concerted integration in vitro, and the N-terminal domain displays similar activity. These studies that will facilitate structural analyses may allow elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing Ty1 specific integration into safe places in the genome."

We sought to define associations between infarct volume and stroke subtypes.Inclusion criteria necessitated a Johns Hopkins Hospital inpatient admission (2017-2019) for ischemic stroke with confirmatory brain magnetic resonance imaging. Infarct volume was calculated using MRIcron© by a masked reviewer. Ischemic strokes were adjudicated using TOAST classification. Multivariable/multinomial logistic regression determined associations between infarct volume and stroke subtypes with interaction terms for infarct number and location. Stepwise adjustment accounted for potential confounders.Patients (N = 150) were on average 61 years old, male (58%), and black (57%). Each 5mL increase in infarct volume was associated with cardioembolic (OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.14) and large-artery occlusions (OR 1.10, 95%CI 1.02-1.18), but lower odds of lacunar stroke (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.06-0.55). There was no difference in risk of cardioembolic (base) and large-artery atherosclerotic strokes with increasing infarct volume (RRR 1.01, 95%CI 0.94-1.09), but risk of lacunar stroke was decreased (RRR 0.17, 95%CI 0.06-0.53). Infarct number (single vs multiple) modified the association between volume and subtype for large-artery occlusions (p-interaction 0.09).In this study, larger volume infarcts were significantly associated with both cardioembolic and large-artery atherosclerotic strokes (no difference in the degree of association) and decreased odds of lacunar stroke. A single, large-volume stroke was associated with large-artery atherosclerosis, while multiple infarcts were associated with cardioembolism. Given the differential associations between volume, number of lesions, and stroke etiology, defining stroke subtypes in light of infarct volume might aid in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3193557952,"Human norovirus is a leading cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis, which affects all age groups and are found globally. Infections are highly contagious and often occur as outbreaks. Periodic emergence of new strains are not uncommon and novel variants are named after the place of first reported nucleotide sequence. Here, we identified human norovirus GII.4 Hong Kong variant in stool samples from Thai patients presented with acute gastroenteritis. Comparison of amino acid residues deduced from the viral nucleotide sequence with those of historical and contemporary norovirus GII.4 strains revealed notable differences, which mapped to the defined antigenic sites of the viral major capsid protein. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggests that GII.4 Hong Kong shared common ancestry with GII.4 Osaka first reported in 2007, and more importantly, did not evolve from the now-prevalent GII.4 Sydney lineage. As circulation of norovirus minor variants can lead to eventual widespread transmission in susceptible population, this study underscores the potential emergence of the GII.4 Hong Kong variant, which warrants vigilant molecular epidemiological surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3194931338,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes life-threatening systemic mycoses. During infection of the human host, this pathogen experiences a major change in the availability of purines; the fungus can scavenge the abundant purines in its environmental niche of pigeon excrement, but must employ de novo biosynthesis in the purine-poor human CNS. Eleven sequential enzymatic steps are required to form the first purine base, IMP, an intermediate in the formation of ATP and GTP. Over the course of evolution, several gene fusion events led to the formation of multifunctional purine biosynthetic enzymes in most organisms, particularly the higher eukaryotes. In C. neoformans, phosphoribosyl-glycinamide synthetase (GARs) and phosphoribosyl-aminoimidazole synthetase (AIRs) are fused into a bifunctional enzyme, while the human ortholog is a trifunctional enzyme that also includes GAR transformylase. Here we functionally, biochemically, and structurally characterized C. neoformans GARs and AIRs to identify drug targetable features. GARs/AIRs are essential for de novo purine production and virulence in a murine inhalation infection model. Characterization of GARs enzymatic functional parameters showed that C. neoformans GARs/AIRs have lower affinity for substrates glycine and PRA compared with the trifunctional metazoan enzyme. The crystal structure of C. neoformans GARs revealed differences in the glycine- and ATP-binding sites compared with the Homo sapiens enzyme, while the crystal structure of AIRs shows high structural similarity compared with its H. sapiens ortholog as a monomer but differences as a dimer. The alterations in functional and structural characteristics between fungal and human enzymes could potentially be exploited for antifungal development."
https://openalex.org/W3194990461,"The PAF complex (PAFC) coordinates transcription elongation and mRNA processing and its CDC73/parafibromin subunit functions as a tumour suppressor. The NF2/Merlin tumour suppressor functions both at the cell cortex and nucleus and is a key mediator of contact inhibition but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we have used affinity proteomics to identify novel Merlin interacting proteins and show that Merlin forms a complex with multiple proteins involved in RNA processing including the PAFC and the CHD1 chromatin remodeller. Tumour-derived inactivating mutations in both Merlin and the CDC73 PAFC subunit mutually disrupt their interaction and growth suppression by Merlin requires CDC73. Merlin interacts with the PAFC in a cell density-dependent manner and we identify a role for FAT cadherins in regulating the Merlin-PAFC interaction. Our results suggest that in addition to its function within the Hippo pathway, Merlin is part of a tumour suppressor network regulated by cell-cell adhesion which coordinates post-initiation steps of the transcription cycle of genes mediating contact inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3195220923,"Hunters in Europe gather non-survey game species population estimates to inform wildlife management, however, the quality of such estimates remains unclear. We compared estimates of game density, realized annual intrinsic growth rates, and period mean growth rates between hunter obtained data and data obtained by targeted survey methods for four species in Poland from 1960 to 2014. Raw hunter estimates were strongly positively correlated to spotlight counts of red fox (18 years of monitoring), strip counts of brown hare (21 years) and grey partridge (25 years), male call counts of partridge (24 years), and complete counts of roe deer (49 years), and not related to spotlight counts of brown hare (15 years). Realized annual intrinsic growth rates derived from hunter estimates were strongly positively related to annual intrinsic growth rates derived from strip counts of grey partridge and complete counts of roe deer, but only weakly or not related to strip counts of brown hare, spotlight counts of red fox and brown hare, and male call counts of grey partridge. The period length at which the period mean growth rates derived from hunter estimates and estimates from other methods were strongly correlated was largely variable among methods and species. In the roe deer, correlation between these variables was strong across all years, while in smaller game species the period mean growth rates based on hunter estimates and other methods had the strongest association in period lengths of 6 to 11 years. We conclude that raw hunter estimates convey largely similar information to that provided by other targeted survey methods. Hunter estimates provide a source of population data for both the retrospective and prospective analysis of game population development when more robust estimates are unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W3195753530,"The most effective method of the fruit harvesting is the mechanical harvest. The frequency spectrum of different testing positions on a Ginkgo biloba tree under the impact excitation was tested in the laboratory. The acceleration responses under the harmonic excitation were measured at the frequency of the peak and trough points in the frequency spectrum curves. Results of this research indicate that the frequency spectrum presented the consistency on the same branch but distinction among different branches. There was a correspondence between the frequency spectrum characteristics and the vibration responses. The vibration responses could be strengthened at the resonant frequency. Merely, the acceleration responses at low frequency were very weak. At higher frequency, the vibration responses were strong but presented different characteristics among different branches. The acceleration response on the trunk was always the weakest. On the same branch, the dynamic responses presented the similar characteristics and the acceleration amplitude increased gradually as the testing position was located away from the excitation point on the trunk. Among different branches, the strongest dynamic response appeared at different frequencies. Our results indicate that it was difficult to induce the strong vibration response of all the branches at the single frequency during the practical mechanical harvesting of fruits."

Respondents chose the best and the worst option of three treatment alternatives. Data were analyzed via latent class model (LCM), allowing capture of heterogeneity in the sample. Respondents were grouped into a predefined number of classes with distinct preferences.The final dataset contained 57 respondents. LCM analysis segmented the sample into two classes with heterogeneous preferences. Preferences within each were homogeneous. For class 1, the most decisive factor was bleeding frequency/year. Respondents seemed to focus mainly on this in their choice decisions. With some distance, inhibitor development was the second most important. The remaining attributes were of far less importance for respondents in this class. Respondents in class 2 based their choice decisions primarily on inhibitor development, also followed, by some distance, the second most important attribute bleeding frequency/year. There was statistical significance (P < 0.05) between the number of annual bleedings and the probability of class membership.The LCM analysis addresses heterogeneity in respondents' choice decisions, which helps to tailor treatment alternatives to individual needs. Study results support clinical and allocative decision-making and improve the quality of interpretation of clinical data."

https://openalex.org/W3194454333,"All extant life forms require trace transition metals (e.g., Fe2/3+, Cu1/2+, and Mn2+) to survive. However, as these are environmentally scarce, organisms have evolved sophisticated metal uptake machineries. In bacteria, high-affinity import of transition metals is predominantly mediated by ABC transporters. During bacterial infection, sequestration of metal by the host further limits the availability of these ions, and accordingly, bacterial ABC transporters (importers) of metals are key virulence determinants. However, the structure-function relationships of these metal transporters have not been fully elucidated. Here, we used metal-sensitivity assays, advanced structural modeling, and enzymatic assays to study the ABC transporter MntBC-A, a virulence determinant of the bacterial human pathogen Bacillus anthracis. We find that despite its broad metal-recognition profile, MntBC-A imports only manganese, whereas zinc can function as a high-affinity inhibitor of MntBC-A. Computational analysis shows that the transmembrane metal permeation pathway is lined with six titratable residues that can coordinate the positively charged metal, and mutagenesis studies show that they are essential for manganese transport. Modeling suggests that access to these titratable residues is blocked by a ladder of hydrophobic residues, and ATP-driven conformational changes open and close this hydrophobic seal to permit metal binding and release. The conservation of this arrangement of titratable and hydrophobic residues among ABC transporters of transition metals suggests a common mechanism. These findings advance our understanding of transmembrane metal recognition and permeation and may aid the design and development of novel antibacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W3195131359,"Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remain vulnerable after treatment at nutritional rehabilitation units (NRUs). The objective was to assess the concurrent pathways in a hypothesized model between caregiver body mass index (BMI), the home environment, and child nutritional status, and development (gross motor, fine motor, language, and social domains) in children with SAM following discharge from inpatient treatment. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was performed with data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial at the Moyo Nutritional Rehabilitation and Research Unit in Blantyre, Malawi. This approach was undertaken to explore simultaneous relationships between caregiver BMI, the home environment (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory scores), child nutritional status (anthropometric indicators including weight-for-age z-scores [WAZ]), and child development (Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) z-scores as a latent variable) in children with SAM. These data were collected at participants’ homes six months after discharge from NRU treatment. This analysis included 85 children aged 6–59 months with SAM and their caregivers recruited to the trial at the NRU and followed up successfully six months after discharge. The model with WAZ as the nutritional indicator fit the data according to model fit indices (χ 2 = 28.92, p = 0.42). Caregiver BMI was predictive of better home environment scores (β = 0.23, p = 0.03) and child WAZ (β = 0.30, p = 0.005). The home environment scores were positively correlated with MDAT z-scores (β = 0.32, p = 0.001). Child nutritional status based on WAZ was also correlated with MDAT z-scores (β = 0.37, p&lt;0.001). This study demonstrates that caregiver BMI could ultimately relate to child development in children with SAM, through its links to the home environment and child nutritional status."
