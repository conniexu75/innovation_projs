https://openalex.org/W1550565578,"Non-liganded retinoic acid receptors (RARs) repress transcription of target genes by recruiting the histone deacetylase complex1,2,3 through a class of silencing mediators termed SMRT or N-CoR4,5. Mutant forms of RARα, created by chromosomal translocations with either the PML (for promyelocytic leukaemia)6,7,8 or the PLZF (for promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger)9,10 locus, are oncogenic and result in human acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). PML–RARα APL patients achieve complete remission following treatments with pharmacological doses of retinoic acids (RA); in contrast, PLZF–RARα patients respond very poorly, if at all11. Here we report that the association of these two chimaeric receptors with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex helps to determine both the development of APL and the ability of patients to respond to retinoids. Consistent with these observations, inhibitors of histone deacetylase dramatically potentiate retinoid-induced differentiation of RA-sensitive, and restore retinoid responses of RA-resistant, APL cell lines. Our findings suggest that oncogenic RARs mediate leukaemogenesis through aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that pharmacological manipulation of nuclear receptor co-factors may be a useful approach in the treatment of human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2048602230,Eukaryotic expression vectors can be delivered to macrophages using attenuated self-destructing Listeria monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes cells are preferentially lysed in the host cell macrophage cytosol by the production of a PactA-dependent Listeria-specific phage lysin. Efficient expression of the cloned reporter genes by the macrophages and subsequent antigen presentation were achieved after the delivery of eukaryotic expression vectors by the attenuated suicide L. monocytogenes strain. After delivery by L. monocytogenes plasmid DNAs were found to integrate into the macrophage cell's genome at a frequency of about 10(-7).

While induction of p53 is observed for most of the genotoxins, activation of MAPK/SAPK cascades is not a general response. The role of MAPK/SAPK activation on cell fate, seems to be dependent, in some systems, on the balanced response among both cascades. We have here examined the effect of cis and trans-DDP on the activation of ERK and JNK activities. While no significant induction of ERK was observed with the compounds, both of them are able to strongly activate JNK. Trans-DDP response is rapid and transient while the cis-DDP one is slow and persistent. In contrast with the observed nuclear translocation of JNK in response to U.V. light, none of the platinum compounds induces translocation, on the contrary, activation of JNK occurs in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases by orthovanadate pretreatment prolongs the time of JNK induction in response to both platinum compounds. The positive modulation of JNK activation correlates with an increase in toxicity that, for cis-DDP corresponds to a tenfold decrease in the IC50. A strong increase in MKP-1 levels was observed only in response to trans-DDP suggesting the involvement of this activity in the downregulation of JNK activity in response to this compound. Altogether the results suggest that the prolonged activation of JNK in response to cis-DDP contributes to cell death induction."

https://openalex.org/W2004567377,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 (p16INK4A/CDKN2/MTS1) is a potent inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) product, the inactivation of which induces loss of Rb-dependent G1 arrest through inappropriate phosphorylation of the Rb protein. To analyse the role of p16INK4A as a tumor suppressor in the genesis of non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and correlate loss of p16INK4A protein expression to genetic or epigenetic mechanisms, we have performed a comprehensive study of p16 status in a series of 43 NSCLC. To this end, we have investigated p16INK4A protein expression with immunohistochemistry, deletions of the gene by FISH, and determined the methylation status of exon 1α using a PCR-based methylation assay. Finally, possible mutations were studied by SSCP and subsequent sequencing. Twenty one of the 43 (49%) NSCLC studied exhibited an absence of p16INK4A nuclear staining. Of these, three (14%) had frameshift or missense mutations, seven (33%) displayed methylation of exon1α and 10 (48%) displayed homozygous deletions. In total, 95% of the tumors with p16INK4A negative staining carried one of these three alternative genetic or epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, a high degree of chromosome 9 polysomy was found (58%) in those tumors with p16INK4A inactivation. Taken together these results suggest that deregulation of the p16 gene locus is a frequently occurring event in NSCLC through distinct mechanisms including rare point mutations, promotor methylation and frequent homozygous deletions. Furthermore, our data show that immunohistochemistry is a rapid and an accurate technique for screening of p16INK4A gene inactivation events that result in loss of protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W1982060264,"p21waf1 has been shown to mediate the p53-dependent growth arrest induced by DNA-damaging agents. Several functions have been ascribed to p21waf1 that could be involved in this growth arrest. For one, p21waf1 is an efficient inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Also, p21waf1 can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and as such inhibit in vitro DNA-replication. Finally, p21waf1 has been reported to inhibit stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). In order to study these multiple functions of p21waf1 we have established U2OS-derived cell lines, in which the expression of p21waf1 can be regulated by the concentration of tetracycline in the culture medium. We observed a virtually complete, but reversible inhibition of cell growth upon induction of p21waf1-expression. Both [3H]thymidine-incorporation and CDK2-activity were strongly inhibited by p21waf1. Upon induction of p21waf1 cells accumulated with a 2N or 4N DNA content suggesting events in G1 and G2 can be inhibited by p21waf1. Indeed, kinase activity associated with cyclin B was reduced dramatically upon induction of p21waf1, although cyclin B continues to be expressed. In contrast, p21waf1 does not seem to inhibit the function of PCNA in ongoing DNA replication, since cells expressing high levels of p21waf1 apparently progressed normally through S-phase. Also, the activity of SAPKs was not substantially affected by the high levels of p21waf1. We conclude that, at least in these U2OS-derived cells, p21waf1 functions as an inhibitor of CDK-activity in G1 and G2, but not as an inhibitor of PCNA or SAPKs."

https://openalex.org/W2089673328,"Human colorectal tumor cell lines were established which express wildtype p21 or p21 with a mutation at codon 46 (Cys) or 140 (Gly) on IPTG treatment (LacSwitch). The IPTG-induced wildtype p21 bound to CDK2 and PCNA and inhibited CDK activity in the cells and reduced cell growth rate; whereas, both IPTG-induced mutated p21 proteins neither bound to CDK2 nor affected the CDK activity but did bind to PCNA, and they did not affect the cell growth rate. Wildtype p21 suppressed apoptosis and enhanced survival of X-ray-irradiated or adriamycin-treated cells; but, mutated p21 neither suppressed apoptosis nor affected cell survival. When cells were treated with mimosine, a p53-independent p21-inducer, or butyrolactone I, a specific inhibitor of CDK, cellular endogenous p21 was induced and X-ray or adriamycin-induced apoptosis was blocked. These results suggest that CDK-binding or CDK-inhibitory activity of p21 is required to prevent apoptosis, i.e., CDK is required for apoptosis in human tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2057909055,"We have previously identified a U.V.-response element (URE; TGACAACA) and its bound proteins, members of the AP1 and ATF transcription factor families, in melanoma cells. Using a mutant form of cylic AMP response element binding (CREB), we found that CREB-associated-URE-bound proteins conferred characteristic melanoma phenotypes, including radiation resistance (Oncogene 12: 2223, 1996). In the present study we sought to determine which of the CREB-associated proteins confers radiation resistance on human melanoma cells. To this end we purified and identified via microsequencing ATF2 as a major URE- bound and CREB-associated protein in MeWo cells--a late stage human melanoma cell line. To determine the contribution of ATF2 to radiation resistance, MeWo cells were transfected with ATF2 cDNA lacking the trans-activation domain (ATF2(delta1-195)). MeWo cells that stably express ATF2(delta1-195) showed weaker transcriptional activities and an altered pattern of homo/hetero dimers. ATF2(delta1-195) clones exhibited up to tenfold lower resistance to irradiation by either U.V. or X-rays. The degree of resistance to radiation in the ATF2(delta1-195)-expressing clones could be increased upon transient transfection with ATF2(wt), but not with phosphorylation-defective mutant ATF2(69,71). Similarly, transfection of ATF2(wt) to WM3211, an early stage human melanoma cells line, increased resistance to radiation. Finally, changes elicited through ATF2(delta1-195) also led to reduced drug resistance, as shown for MMC, araC and cisplatinum. Our results suggest that ATF2 is a regulator of radiation and drug resistance in melanomas, and that tumor targeted ATF2 modulators may be useful sensitizers in the treatment of tumors of this type."

https://openalex.org/W2016492620,"We investigated the requirements for protein p53 and the ATM gene product in radiation-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and regulation of the cyclin E/ and cyclin A/cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks). Wild type (WT) mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs), p53−/− knock-out MLFs, normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF-55), and human AT skin fibroblasts (GM02052) were used in the investigations. The absence of p53 had no significant effect on the inhibition or recovery of DNA synthesis throughout the S phase, as determined from BrdU labeling and flow cytometry, or the rapid inhibition of cyclin A/Cdks. γ radiation (8 Gy) inhibited DNA synthesis and progression into G2 during the first 3 h after irradiation, and the recovery of these processes occurred at similar rates in both WT and p53−/− MLFs. The cyclin A/Cdks were inhibited 55–70% at 1 h after irradiation in both cell types, but p21WAF1/Cip1 levels or p21 interaction with Cdk2 did not increase in the irradiated p53−/− MLFs. Although p53−/− MLFs do not exhibit prolonged arrest at a G1 checkpoint, radiation did induce a rapid 20% reduction and small super-recovery of cyclin E/Cdk2 within 1–2 h after irradiation. Similar inhibition and recovery of cyclin E/Cdk2 previously had been associated with regulation of transient G1 delay and the inhibition of initiation at an apparent G1/S checkpoint in Chinese hamster cells. In contrast, loss of the ATM gene product abrogated transient cyclin E/Cdk2 inhibition, most inhibition of DNA synthesis and all, but a 10–15% inhibition, of the cyclin A/Cdks. The results indicate that neither p53 nor p21 is required for transient inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 associated with the G1/S checkpoint or for inhibition of DNA synthesis at `checkpoints' within the S phase. Conversely, the ATM gene product appears to be essential for regulation of the G1/S checkpoint and for inhibition of DNA replication associated with the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2. Differential aspects of DNA synthesis inhibition among cell types are presented and discussed in the context of S phase checkpoints."
https://openalex.org/W2328618670,"p21WAF1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor has been implicated in the control of proliferation, differentiation, and death in various cell lines. To further examine p21 regulation of the transitions between these cellular processes, an inducible p21 vector (lac operon system) was transfected into the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) neural cell line. Induction of p21 led to permanent growth arrest, as evidenced by cell counts, FACS analysis, and thymidine incorporation. This arrest was maintained, even after removal of the inducing signal (IPTG). Northern analysis revealed that endogenous p21 mRNA increased following IPTG removal, which may be responsible for the continued growth arrest despite the decrease in ectopic p21 expression. p21 overexpression did not directly lead to a differentiated phenotype; however, differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) was greatly accelerated. To examine effects on cell death, and specifically test the hypothesis that apoptosis caused by withdrawal of trophic support results from inappropriate entry into cell cycle, serum was removed from proliferating and p21-arrested PC12 cells. The rate of apoptotic death was not affected by p21, nor was it effective in altering the extent of death following other apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2327132181,"The interactions of the cells in the bone microenvironment play important roles in bone remodeling. Osteoblasts are involved in the bone remodeling through the production of soluble factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts and through cell-cell interactions. Histological studies have suggested that endothelial cells are also associated with some osteolytic bone diseases. However, it is still unclear how endothelial cells contribute to bone resorption. We established bone-derived endothelial cells (BDECs) to study their roles in bone remodeling. The established BDECs promoted bone resorption in a murine neonatal calvaria organ culture system by secreting a soluble bone resorption-inducing factor(s) when stimulated by several inflammatory cytokines. This bone resorption-inducing factor was identified as interleukin-11 (IL-11). IL-11 is known to enhance bone resorption by promoting osteoclastogenesis and by suppressing the activity of osteoblasts. The production of IL-11 in BDECs was also promoted by conditioned medium of human melanoma A375M cells. Because A375M cells formed osteolytic bone metastasis in vivo, BDECs might be involved in pathological osteolysis by producing IL-11. These results suggest that endothelial cells in bone play important roles in the promotion of bone resorption by secreting IL-11 in physiological and pathological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2314951634,"hSmad (mothers against decapentaplegic)-related proteins are important messengers within the Transforming Growth Factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) superfamily signal transduction pathways. To further characterize a member of this family, we obtained a full length cDNA of the human hSmad5 (hSmad5) gene by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and then determined the genomic structure of the gene. There are eight exons and two alternative transcripts; the shorter transcript lacks exon 2. We identified the hSmad5 promoter region from a human genomic YAC clone by obtaining the nucleotide sequence extending 1235 base pairs upstream of the 5' end of the cDNA. We found a CpG island consistent with a promoter region, and we demonstrated promoter activity in a 1232 bp fragment located upstream of the transcription initiation site. To investigate the frequency of somatic hSmad5 mutations in human cancers, we designed intron-based primers to examine coding regions by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Neither homozygous deletions or point mutations were found in 40 primary gastric tumors and 51 cell lines derived from diverse types of human cancer including 20 cell lines resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta1. These results suggest that the hSmad5 gene is not commonly mutated and that other genetic alterations mediate the loss of TGF-beta1 responsiveness in human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2323317510,"Malignant mesothelioma is one of the very few extrarenal neoplasms in which the Wilms tumor suppressor gene (wt1) is expressed. We examined wt1 for alterations in rat mesotheliomas, a well characterized animal model for the human disease. Southern analysis revealed a 3.5 kb EcoRI wt1 fragment readily detectable in majority of mesothelioma cell lines and primary mesotheliomas but not in normal rat tissues. Cloning and sequencing of this fragment revealed that the presence of this EcoRI fragment resulted from an inability of this enzyme to cut at a EcoRI site in intron 1 of wt1. This site contains potential motifs for cytosine methylation and treatment of mesothelioma cells with 5-azadeoxycytosine restored the normal EcoRI digestion pattern of wt1 in these cells indicating that cleavage was inhibited by methylation at this site. Southern analysis using HpaII/MspI digestion revealed no differences in methylation between mesothelioma cell lines and normal mesothelium at other CpG sites in wt1 5' region. Renal cell carcinoma lines which did not express wt1 were also methylated at this EcoRI site. Our identification of a site frequently methylated in malignant cells, independent of gene expression, provides a new model system to study determinants of site-specific methylation in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2067163287,"The deregulation of the HER-2/neu protooncogene was demonstrated in a wide variety of human cancers and shown to be correlated with the progress of malignancy and metastasis in animal models. Repression of HER-2/neu overexpression suppressed the malignant phenotypes of HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells. This suggested that HER-2/neu may be a good target for developing anti-cancer drugs. We found a deletion mutant of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LT) suppresses the HER-2/neu oncogene expression at the transcriptional level. PCR clones of this mutant SV40LT, named LT425, which contains the N-terminal region of amino acid residues 1-178 of SV40LT, were subcloned and stably transfected into the HER-2/neu-overexpressing human ovarian cancer SKOV3.ip1 cells. These LT425 clones were found to be able to down-regulate the endogenous production of p185(HER-2/neu). In addition, the LT425-expressing stable transfectants showed reduced growth rate, low soft agarose colony forming ability, and low tumorigenic potential as compared with the parental line. These data suggested that the N-terminal 178 amino acids domain only of SV40LT may act as a transforming repressor of HER-2/neu oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W2314229902,"The Notch1 gene was previously found to be targetted by provirus insertion in a high proportion of T-cell lymphomas arising in Moloney MuLV-inoculated MMTV(D)/myc transgenic mice. Proviral activation of Notch1 was associated with overexpression of truncated Notch1, deleted of the sequences coding for the extracellular domain. The high levels of truncated Notch1 RNA and proteins in these tumors are thought to be involved in the oncogenic transformation. However, in addition to these truncated RNA and proteins, high level expression of full-length Notch1 RNA and proteins was also observed in several tumors, suggesting that they could also contribute to the transformation process. To test this hypothesis, we used a genetic approach and studied MMTV(D)/myc transgenic mice in which one of the Notch1 alleles was mutated by targeted mutagenesis (Notch1+/- mice). Heterozygote (Notch1+/-) and wild-type (Notch1+/+) transgenic mice were inoculated with Moloney MuLV and the frequency of Notch1 rearrangements was compared between both groups. Notch1 was rearranged at similar frequencies in both groups, indicating that the full-length Notch1 allele is dispensable in tumors harboring an activated Notch1 allele."

https://openalex.org/W2315471685,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein binds two copies of a ten base pair motif that is degenerate in eight out of ten bases and conforms to the sequence, 5'PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3'. As a consequence of this high degree of degeneracy, p53 response elements show a great deal of variation and it has been speculated that the variation aids in the selective activation of p53 responsive genes by specific stimuli. Here, we examined the DNA binding characteristics of several different p53 protein complexes present in nuclear extracts prepared from a cell line expressing the murine temperature sensitive p53 protein, p53val135. Interestingly, the complexes exhibited a distinct preference for binding to some p53 response elements and not others. A critical determinant of this specificity was the sequence at the center of the ten base pair motif and alteration of a single base within this region was sufficient to alter the set of complexes that associated with the oligonucleotide. In addition, thermal denaturation experiments demonstrated that some complexes could bind DNA even though the p53val135 protein had a mutant conformation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that p53 can distinguish between various response elements and suggest that this selectivity is manifested, in part, by the sequence of the motif and conformation of the p53 protein."
