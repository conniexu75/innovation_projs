https://openalex.org/W2037238732,"The RNA world hypothesis regarding the early evolution of life relies on the premise that some RNA sequences can catalyze RNA replication. In support of this conjecture, we describe here an RNA molecule that catalyzes the type of polymerization needed for RNA replication. The ribozyme uses nucleoside triphosphates and the coding information of an RNA template to extend an RNA primer by the successive addition of up to 14 nucleotides-more than a complete turn of an RNA helix. Its polymerization activity is general in terms of the sequence and the length of the primer and template RNAs, provided that the 3' terminus of the primer pairs with the template. Its polymerization is also quite accurate: when primers extended by 11 nucleotides were cloned and sequenced, 1088 of 1100 sequenced nucleotides matched the template."
https://openalex.org/W2071362227,"Force microscopy has been used to quantitatively measure the infinitesimal forces that characterize interactions between Shewanella oneidensis (a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium) and goethite (α-FeOOH), both commonly found in Earth near-surface environments. Force measurements with subnanonewton resolution were made in real time with living cells under aerobic and anaerobic solutions as a function of the distance, in nanometers, between a cell and the mineral surface. Energy values [in attojoules (10 −18 joules)] derived from these measurements show that the affinity between S. oneidensis and goethite rapidly increases by two to five times under anaerobic conditions in which electron transfer from bacterium to mineral is expected. Specific signatures in the force curves suggest that a 150-kilodalton putative iron reductase is mobilized within the outer membrane of S. oneidensis and specifically interacts with the goethite surface to facilitate the electron transfer process."
https://openalex.org/W1985065732,"Control of spatiotemporal chaos is one of the central problems of nonlinear dynamics. We report on suppression of chemical turbulence by global delayed feedback using, as an example, catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation on a platinum (110) single-crystal surface and carbon monoxide partial pressure as the controlled feedback variable. When feedback intensity was increased, spiral-wave turbulence was transformed into new intermittent chaotic regimes with cascades of reproducing and annihilating local structures on the background of uniform oscillations. The global feedback further led to the development of cluster patterns and standing waves and to the stabilization of uniform oscillations. These findings are reproduced by theoretical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W1979771830,"Zebrafish are a valuable model for mammalian lipid metabolism; larvae process lipids similarly through the intestine and hepatobiliary system and respond to drugs that block cholesterol synthesis in humans. After ingestion of fluorescently quenched phospholipids, endogenous lipase activity and rapid transport of cleavage products results in intense gall bladder fluorescence. Genetic screening identifies zebrafish mutants, such as fat free, that show normal digestive organ morphology but severely reduced phospholipid and cholesterol processing. Thus, fluorescent lipids provide a sensitive readout of lipid metabolism and are a powerful tool for identifying genes that mediate vertebrate digestive physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2003891151,"The human genome was analyzed for evidence that genes had been laterally transferred into the genome from prokaryotic organisms. Protein sequence comparisons of the proteomes of human, fruit fly, nematode worm, yeast, mustard weed, eukaryotic parasites, and all completed prokaryote genomes were performed, and all genes shared between human and each of the other groups of organisms were collected. About 40 genes were found to be exclusively shared by humans and bacteria and are candidate examples of horizontal transfer from bacteria to vertebrates. Gene loss combined with sample size effects and evolutionary rate variation provide an alternative, more biologically plausible explanation."
https://openalex.org/W2119980642,"To study Ca2+ fluxes between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we used “cameleon” indicators targeted to the cytosol, the ER lumen, and the mitochondrial matrix. High affinity mitochondrial probes saturated in ∼20% of mitochondria during histamine stimulation of HeLa cells, whereas a low affinity probe reported averaged peak values of 106 ± 5 µm, indicating that Ca2+ transients reach high levels in a fraction of mitochondria. In concurrent ER measurements, [Ca2+]ER averaged 371 ± 21 µm at rest and decreased to 133 ± 14 µm and 59 ± 5 µm upon stimulation with histamine and thapsigargin, respectively, indicating that substantial ER refilling occur during agonist stimulation. A larger ER depletion was observed when mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was prevented by oligomycin and rotenone or when Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria was blocked by CGP 37157, indicating that some of the Ca2+ taken up by mitochondria is re-used for ER refilling. Accordingly, ER regions close to mitochondria released less Ca2+ than ER regions lacking mitochondria. The ER heterogeneity was abolished by thapsigargin, oligomycin/rotenone, or CGP 37157, indicating that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake locally modulate ER refilling. These observations indicate that some mitochondria are very close to the sites of Ca2+ release and recycle a substantial portion of the captured Ca2+ back to vicinal ER domains. The distance between the two organelles thus determines both the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ signals and the filling state of neighboring ER regions.

The finely regulated spatial and temporal encoding of the calcium signal ensures that these various, and sometimes opposite, calcium-dependent processes are activated at the appropriate time and place within cells (3Nelson M.T.

Whereas the influx of calcium through voltage-dependent membrane channels triggers rapid secretion at synapses (6Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), the release of Ca2+ from stores in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 can generate sustained [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in both excitable and nonexcitable cells (7Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). These calcium oscillations can be decoded in the cytosol by frequency-sensitive effector proteins such as calmodulin-dependent kinase II (8De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), and have been shown to optimize both secretion (9Tse A. Tse F.W. Almers W. Hille B. Science. 1993; 260: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and gene expression (10Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S.

Calcium oscillations can also be decoded by mitochondria (12Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), several dehydrogenases being activated as the free [Ca2+] increases within the mitochondrial matrix, thereby increasing the level of NAD(P)H and the production of ATP to meet the cell energy demand (12Hajnoczky G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).In addition to being able to decode Ca2+ oscillations, mitochondria also participate actively in calcium signaling (reviewed in Refs. 14Babcock D.F. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 16Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mitochondria take up calcium very efficiently and contribute to the local nature of the calcium signal by acting as a buffer barrier between cellular regions (17Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Importantly, mitochondria are often in close contact with Ca2+ release sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (18Simpson P.B. Mehotra S. Lange G.D. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22654-22661Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). By acting as a Ca2+ buffering system at these strategic locations, mitochondria can modulate the rate of Ca2+ release by IP3 receptors (21Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22Hajnoczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Through this intimate connection with the calcium sources, mitochondria strongly shape calcium signals and, depending on the cellular context, can either potentiate or inhibit Ca2+oscillations (23Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Holmuhamedov E.L. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 24Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25465-25470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Our understanding of the calcium homeostasis of intracellular compartments is still incomplete, because the highly dynamic Ca2+ signals occurring within organelles are difficult to measure. Trapped fluorescent dyes such as Mag-fura and Mag-indo-1 have been used to measure calcium within the ER and mitochondria (27Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28Hirose K. Iino M. Nature. 1994; 372: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Tse A. Tse F.W. Hille B. J.

Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, these dyes are not specifically targeted and their selectivity for calcium over magnesium is poor. The cationic probe rhod2 has also been used to measure calcium within mitochondria (12Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 20Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J.

The calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, on the other hand, can be specifically targeted (32Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Cytotechnology. 1993; 11: S44-46Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the weak luminescence of the photoprotein and its irreversible consumption upon Ca2+ binding severely limits the use of this approach for calcium imaging. The “cameleon” indicators based on green fluorescent proteins and calmodulin developed in the group of R. Y. Tsien (43Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 44Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) appear better suited for calcium measurements in organelles. The bright fluorescence of the green fluorescent protein mutants, combined with selective targeting sequences, allows one to visualize the calcium signals in organelles by fluorescence ratio imaging (45Fan G.Y. Fujisaki H. Miyawaki A. Tsay R.K. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2412-2420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 46Emmanouilidou E. Teschemacher A.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the calcium affinity of calmodulin can be adjusted by molecular engineering, enabling one to match the calcium concentration within the organelle of interest (43Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). Despite these advantages, the cameleons have not yet found widespread applications, probably because their limited dynamic range and pH dependence requires careful in situ calibration to achieve quantitative Ca2+ measurements.In this study, we used yellow cameleons Ca2+indicators to measure Ca2+ signals in the cytosol, [Ca2+]cyt, the endoplasmic reticulum, [Ca2+]ER, and the mitochondria, [Ca2+]mit in HeLa cells. Probes of different Ca2+ affinities and pH dependence were used (YC2, YC4ER, YC2mit, YC3.1mit, and YC4.1mit) and calibrated in situ, providing accurate estimates of the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen and the mitochondrial matrix. Using this approach, we show that [Ca2+]mit transients reach >100 µm in about 25% of mitochondria, and that part of the captured Ca2+ is returned back to the ER. The local cycle of Ca2+ between these two organelles prevents the depletion of ER regions bearing mitochondria, thereby generating two functionally distinct Ca2+ stores within the ER network.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used green fluorescent protein-based cameleon probes to measure Ca2+ changes within the cytosol, ER, and mitochondria. These genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators offer several advantages over other approaches used to measure Ca2+ changes in organelles. Their bright fluorescence and molecular targeting allowed time-resolved imaging of Ca2+ signals in defined intracellular compartments. The tunable Ca2+ affinity of the ratiometric probes ensured quantitative measurements within a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. Furthermore, the probes could be used in conjunction with red shifted dyes to study the interactions between organelles (Figs. 6 and 7). Among the disadvantages, we observed that the targeting efficiency depended on cameleon expression levels, and that the small dynamic range of the probes limited the precision of the measurements. A more significant drawback was the pH dependence of the first generation of cameleons, which precluded the use of protonophores and required independent determination of the pH of the organelle. The stable pH of the ER and the alkaline pH of the mitochondria, however, allowed us to use the pH-sensitive cameleons for Ca2+measurements in these organelles.The resting [Ca2+]ER levels averaged 371 µm in HeLa cells, values that agree well with previous reports using aequorin or cameleons (39Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 41Pinton P. Ferrari D. Magalhaes P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Di Virgilio F.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Substantial ER refilling was observed during agonist stimulation even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, consistent with a recent study using targeted cameleon (47Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). No Ca2+ gradients were observed within the ER at rest or during stimulation with thapsigargin (Fig. 4), suggesting that the ER behaves as a single continuous compartment when IP3 levels are low. In contrast, two functionally distinct ER compartments were observed during stimulation with IP3-generating agonists. During histamine stimulation, regions rich in mitochondria, located deep in the cytosol, had higher [Ca2+]ER levels that regions poor in mitochondria, located at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 6). The difference persisted in ER regions located at similar distance from the cell border, indicating that it did not reflect Ca2+extrusion by the plasma-membrane ATPases. Instead, the two functional ER subdomains reflected the differential activity of SERCA ATPases, as the ER inhomogeneity disappeared in the presence of thapsigargin (Fig.6 b). A large part of the repumped Ca2+originated from mitochondria, as the depletion of ER Ca2+stores increased by 18% when mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux was blocked with CGP 37157 (Fig. 5).Previous studies have shown that mitochondria are very close to the ER in HeLa cells (19Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar), and that Ca2+ signal transmission between these organelles is quasisynaptic (54Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we observed that [Ca2+]mittransients reached submillimolar values in a fraction of mitochondria (Fig. 3), which must be very close to the sites of Ca2+release. These high levels were not detected by the high affinity YC2mit probe, which was near saturation within this range of Ca2+ concentrations, but were readily detected by the low-affinity YC4.1mit probe, which reported an average peak [Ca2+]mit around 100 µm (Fig.3). This finding is consistent with recent imaging data obtained in HeLa cells with a permutated green fluorescent protein engineered to sense Ca2+ (55Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), suggesting that earlier reports using high-affinity fluorescent dyes or aequorin might have underestimated the peak [Ca2+]mit response. Higher, millimolar values were reported in chromaffin cells using a mutated aequorin of reduced Ca2+ affinity (36Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting the close proximity of these mitochondria to both the plasma membrane and Ca2+ release channels (36Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, mitochondria are located far from the plasma membrane. The high [Ca2+]mit levels observed in HeLa cells thus indicate that mitochondria take up a significant portion of the Ca2+ released by the ER. Some of this Ca2+ is then re-used for ER refilling, suggesting that Ca2+ cycles back and forth between the ER and mitochondria during Ca2+oscillations.Mitochondria might increase ER refilling by providing a local source of either Ca2+ or ATP, thereby enhancing the activity of SERCA ATPases. The Ca2+ effect appear predominant, as block of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux by CGP 37157, which should increase the production of ATP by mitochondria, enhanced the depletion of the ER and led to the disappearance of the mitochondria-associated compartment. Furthermore, the ER refilled with similar kinetics regardless of the presence of mitochondria, indicating that the mitochondrial ATP did not contribute significantly to the activity of the SERCA ATPases. Accordingly, the ER refilling kinetics were not affected by oligomycin/rotenone or CGP 37157, consistent with earlier observations indicating that ATP generation is mainly glycolytic in HeLa cells (56Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Thus, the predominant effect of mitochondria is to provide the local source of Ca2+ for refilling the ER. The close proximity of mitochondria from the sites of Ca2+release ensures that a large part of the escaped Ca2+ is returned back into the ER.In previous studies using trapped fluorescent dyes or BAPTA-loaded cells, mitochondria have been shown to increase, rather than prevent, the depletion of the ER (50Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 53Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This might reflect the effect of Ca2+ buffers on the ER/mitochondria interactions, as trapped fluorescent dyes have been shown to accumulate not only into the ER lumen, but also in the mitochondrial matrix (57Gurney A.M. Drummond R.M. Fay F.S. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because the peak [Ca2+]mit are much larger than previously thought (Fig. 3), low-affinity dyes such as Mag-fura can be significantly affected by the [Ca2+]mitchanges. Accordingly, both increase and decreases in [Ca2+] have been reported during agonist stimulation using Mag-fura, depending on the relative contribution of mitochondria to the Mag-fura signal (57Gurney A.M. Drummond R.M. Fay F.S. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The decreased [Ca2+] release observed with Mag-fura in the presence of mitochondrial inhibitors thus likely reflects the decreased [Ca2+]mitsignal, rather than the true [Ca2+]ERresponse (50Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In BAPTA-loaded cells, on the other hand, accumulation of the Ca2+ chelator might trap Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix, increasing the ability of mitochondria to buffer [Ca2+] but minimizing their contribution in the ER refilling process. Consistent with the ability of mitochondria to increase local Ca2+ buffering, we observed that mitochondria slightly increased the depletion of vicinal ER regions when refilling was blocked by thapsigargin (Fig. 6 b).The local cycle of Ca2+ between a portion of the ER and its neighboring mitochondria generates two functionally distinct Ca2+ stores within the ER network. The two stores are not structurally distinct ER pools with different Ca2+transport characteristics, because they behaved similarly in the presence of thapsigargin or when mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling was inhibited (Figs. 6 and 7). Instead, they reflected the imbalance between the local Ca2+ refilling in ER regions bearing mitochondria and the Ca2+ drag occurring in remaining ER regions. Recent studies indicate that the ER is a lumenally continuous organelle, and that Ca2+ changes induced by local uncaging propagate over several micrometers (58Park M.K. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5729-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that [Ca2+]ER changes were homogenous within the ER lumen in the absence of functional mitochondria. In contrast, the presence of functional mitochondria allowed neighboring ER regions to maintain higher [Ca2+]ER levels. Although Ca2+ diffusion within the ER lumen would tend to dissipate these Ca2+ gradients, the high [Ca2+]mit levels detected in some mitochondria indicate that mitochondria might provide sufficient amounts of Ca2+ to achieve a local control of [Ca2+]ER levels in neighboring ER regions. The strategic location of mitochondria thus appears to be a key determinant of their ability to modulate Ca2+ signals. By preventing the depletion of a defined ER region, mitochondria can restrict Ca2+ signals to specific regions of the cell. Depletion of the peripheral ER region could be required for the activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx, while refilling of the central ER region allow generating Ca2+ oscillations near the nucleus. The depletion of the central ER region was indeed associated with an altered cytosolic Ca2+ signal as, in the presence of mitochondria inhibitors, [Ca2+]cyt failed to return to basal levels between oscillations (Fig. 4). The cycling of calcium between the ER and mitochondria thus not only controls the filling state of the ER, but also the spatio-temporal pattern of the cytosolic Ca2+signal. The calcium ion is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger that controls processes ranging from fertilization and cellular differentiation to muscle contraction and synaptic transmission (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The finely regulated spatial and temporal encoding of the calcium signal ensures that these various, and sometimes opposite, calcium-dependent processes are activated at the appropriate time and place within cells (3Nelson M.T.

Biol. 1999; 9: R157-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Whereas the influx of calcium through voltage-dependent membrane channels triggers rapid secretion at synapses (6Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), the release of Ca2+ from stores in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 can generate sustained [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in both excitable and nonexcitable cells (7Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). These calcium oscillations can be decoded in the cytosol by frequency-sensitive effector proteins such as calmodulin-dependent kinase II (8De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), and have been shown to optimize both secretion (9Tse A. Tse F.W. Almers W. Hille B. Science. 1993; 260: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and gene expression (10Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S.

Calcium oscillations can also be decoded by mitochondria (12Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), several dehydrogenases being activated as the free [Ca2+] increases within the mitochondrial matrix, thereby increasing the level of NAD(P)H and the production of ATP to meet the cell energy demand (12Hajnoczky G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition to being able to decode Ca2+ oscillations, mitochondria also participate actively in calcium signaling (reviewed in Refs. 14Babcock D.F. Hille B. Curr. Opin.

Mitochondria take up calcium very efficiently and contribute to the local nature of the calcium signal by acting as a buffer barrier between cellular regions (17Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H.

Several members of human IAP family proteins including X-linked IAP (XIAP), c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 have been shown to be potent direct inhibitors of a subset of cell death proteases, caspase-3, -7 and -9 (3Deveraux Q.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Among the above caspase-inhibiting IAPs, XIAP has the most potent anti-apoptotic effect in cells with the lowest K i for purified caspase-3 and -7 in vitro (3Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). The structure of XIAP is characterized by three tandem repeats of 70 amino acids motif called baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain at its NH2 terminus and a RING zinc finger domain near its COOH terminus. Structure-function analysis of XIAP has shown that the region of XIAP containing the second BIR domain is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting caspase-3 and -7 (6Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I.

A recent report of the NMR solution-structure of XIAP-BIR2 domain revealed that it is similar to classical zinc finger motifs, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and four α-helices (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, conserved amino acids within the linker region between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains were shown to be essential for inhibiting caspase-3 (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover it was suggested that these residues might bind to the active site, whereas the BIR domain might interact with an adjacent site on caspase-3 (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of XIAP-mediated inhibition of caspase-7, in comparison with caspase-3, has yet to be shown. Here, we showed that the inhibitory mode of caspase-7 by XIAP is different from that of caspase-3. Caspase-3 inhibition is competitive whereas caspase-7 involves both competitive and noncompetitive inhibition. Binding and inhibition assays revealed that the linker region between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains of XIAP is responsible for the inhibition of both caspase-3 and caspase-7. However, the BIR2 itself interacts with the NH2-terminal region of caspase-7, an interaction which contributes to the noncompetitive inhibition by XIAP. Full-length XIAP (residues 1–497) cloned into EcoRI-XhoI sites in pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pGEX4T-1-XIAP, was previously described (3Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). BIR1 (residues 1–168) and BIR2 (residues 124–242) were created by a one-step polymerase chain reaction method employing pGEX4T-1-XIAP as the template and using 5′-GGGAATTCATGACTTTTAACAGTTTTGAAG-3′ (BIR1) or 5′-GGGAATTCAGAGATCATTTTGCCTTAGACA-3′ (BIR2) as the forward primer and 5′-TATTCTCGAGTTACTTTAATCTAGCTTCTTC-3′ (BIR1) or 5′-TATTCTCGAGTTAATCAGATTCACTTCGAAT-3′ (BIR2) as the reverse primer. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned intoEcoRI-XhoI sites in pGEX4T-1 plasmid for expression in Escherichia coli. Aspartic acid residue at position 148 of full-length XIAP, BIR1, or BIR2 was mutated to alanine by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using 5′-GGCAGGTTGTAGCTATATCAGACAC-3′ and 5′-GTGTCTGATATAGCTACAACCTGCC-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. Full-length cDNA encoding caspase-3, -6, and -7 cloned into pET23b (Novagen) were previously described (10Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Chimeric caspase-7/3 and -7/6 were constructed by ligation ofXbaI-NcoI fragment of pET23b-caspase-7 intoXbaI-NcoI sites in pET23b-caspase-3 and pET23b-caspase-6, respectively. The proper construction of all the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described elsewhere (6Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N.

The GST fusion form of full-length XIAP and fragments of XIAP (BIR1 and BIR2) were induced with 0.01 mm and 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 1 h, respectively. COOH-terminal His6-tagged caspases were prepared as described elsewhere (10Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

NH2-terminal sequencing of each chimeric caspase (Sawady Technology) demonstrated that the large subunit of each protease was cleaved at aspartate 23 and resulted in removal of the NH2-terminal (pro)peptide as well as wild-type caspase-7 (10Zhou Q.

The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (acetyl-DEVD-MCA), acetyl-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (acetyl-VEID-MCA), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk) were purchased from Peptide Institute. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-DEVD-fmk) and butyloxycarbonyl-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Boc-d-fmk) were from Enzyme Systems Products. Caspase activities were assayed as previously described with some modification (12Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In brief, caspase activity was measured at 37 °C in 100 µl of caspase buffer (20 mmPIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2) containing indicated concentrations of the fluorogenic peptide, acetyl-DEVD-MCA (Peptide Institute). For inhibition assays, increasing concentrations of wild-type or mutated GST·XIAP were mixed with the indicated concentrations of acetyl-DEVD-MCA for 10 min at 37 °C, and then the purified caspases were added to the indicated concentrations. Activity was measured continuously over the indicated time by the release of AMC from acetyl-DEVD-MCA as emission at 460 nm upon excitation at 355 nm using a fluorometer, Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Labsystems) in the kinetic mode. The amount of AMC release was calculated based upon the fluorescence of a known concentration of purified AMC in similar assays. Values are reported as the rate of product formation obtained from the linear portion of the reaction curves within the first 10% of substrate depletion. Preparation of HEK293 cytosolic extracts were previously described (4Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Apoptotic extracts were prepared by the addition of 10 µm cytochrome cand 1 mm dATP for 30 min at 37 °C. These extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of the indicated peptide caspase inhibitors (100 µm) for 30 min at 37 °C. To test binding in cytosolic extracts, GST fusion proteins (50 pmol) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated for 1 h with 50 µg of cytosolic extracts in 100 µl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 142 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5). The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. For the binding to recombinant caspases, 50 ng of caspases were added instead of cytosolic extracts. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 16% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antisera specific for caspase-7 were prepared in rabbits using a large subunit of purified recombinant human caspase-7 as an antigen. A polyclonal antibody for human caspase-3 was previously described (13Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the modes of inhibition of caspase-3 and -7 by XIAP, the velocities of caspase-3- or caspase-7-catalyzed reactions in the presence or absence of full-length XIAP at various concentrations of substrate were measured (Fig. 1, A andB). Unexpectedly, there was a clear difference in their inhibition patterns although these two enzymes are very similar in both sequences and substrate specificities. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed that XIAP acts as a competitive inhibitor for caspase-3, whereas a noncompetitive or a mixed noncompetitive and competitive mechanism was found for caspase-7 (Fig. 1, C andD). Using secondary plots ofK m/V max versus XIAP concentration, K i values of XIAP for caspase-3 (0.15 nm) or for caspase-7 (0.51 nm) were determined, consistent with a previous report (3Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). By definition, competitive inhibitors do not bind to enzyme-substrate complexes, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors can bind with equal affinity to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. To examine the molecular basis of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition of caspase-3 and -7 by XIAP, respectively, we asked whether XIAP physically interacted with caspases whose active sites were occupied with irreversible peptide inhibitors. For binding assays for XIAP with caspases, we used bacterially produced GST·XIAP fusion proteins and cytochrome c-activated cytosolic extract containing large amounts of active caspase-3 and -7 (3Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 and -7 were inactivated by incubation with three different kinds of irreversible peptide inhibitors, z-DEVD-fmk, z-VAD-fmk, and Boc-d-fmk. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the mobilities of the bands of the large subunits of inhibitor-treated caspases are completely shifted upwards according to the molecular size of the peptide inhibitors, indicating that the peptides covalently bound to all of the treated enzyme (Fig. 2,A and B). Although active caspase-3 was efficiently pulled down by either GST·XIAP or GST·Linker+BIR2, inactivated caspase-3 did not bind (Fig. 2 A). This result indicates that the binding of XIAP with caspase-3 requires an intact active site. By contrast, either full-length XIAP or its BIR2 domain containing linker region bound to caspase-7 regardless of treatment with inhibitors, indicating that XIAP binds to caspase-7 at a site that is distinct from the active site (Fig. 2 A). The binding between purified recombinant caspases and GST·XIAP fusion proteins gave essentially the same results (Fig.2 B), supporting the idea that caspase-3 and -7 were inhibited by XIAP in a competitive and noncompetitive manner, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis showed that XIAP is either a noncompetitive or a mixed (competitive and noncompetitive) inhibitor of caspase-7 (Fig. 1 D). If XIAP functions at least partially as a competitive inhibitor, it should also interact with the active site of caspase-7. Recently, the linker region between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains of XIAP was suggested to be essential for active site-directed binding and inhibition of caspase-3 (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover it was also strongly suggested that an aspartate residue in the linker region (Asp-148) interacts with the active site of caspase-3 (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To test if caspase-7, like caspase-3, bound to the linker region through Asp-148 in an active site-directed manner, we used the GST-tagged BIR1 containing the linker region (BIR1+Linker) for binding assays. BIR1+Linker is known to inhibit caspase-3, whereas the BIR1 without the linker region neither inhibits nor binds to caspase-3 or -7 (6Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, the linker region without attached BIRs was found to be inactive at suppressing caspase-3 (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). BIR1+Linker therefore seems to be suitable for examining the active site-directed binding of caspase-7 with the linker region without the influence of the active site-independent binding. The binding assay revealed that caspase-7, as well as caspase-3, bound to BIR1+Linker. When treated with z-VAD-fmk, however, caspase-7 and -3 lost their abilities to bind BIR1+Linker. Moreover caspase-7 and -3 did not bind to the BIR1+Linker-(D148A) mutant in which aspartate at the position 148 is mutated to alanine (Fig.3 B). Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed that BIR1+Linker inhibited caspase-3 and -7 in a competitive manner (data not shown). These results suggest that caspase-7 and caspase-3 require the same aspartate residue Asp-148 in the linker region to suppress these proteases in an active site-directed manner. We next wished to know to which portion of XIAP caspase-7 bound in an active site-independent manner. To address this question, GST-tagged full-length XIAP and Linker+BIR2 mutant proteins were prepared and used for binding assays with caspase-3 and -7 (Fig.3). Both caspase-3 and -7 bound to XIAP or Linker+BIR2. Caspase-3, however, no longer bound to XIAP-(D148A) or Linker+BIR2-(D148A), whereas caspase-7 still bound to both mutant proteins regardless of z-VAD-fmk treatment (Fig. 3 B). This result indicated that caspase-7 bound to the BIR2 region in an active site-independent manner. To examine the possibility that the active site-independent binding between caspase-7 and the Linker+BIR2 region is involved in the noncompetitive inhibition, we examined the caspase-inhibitory activities of various XIAP constructs (Fig. 3 C). The Linker+BIR2 and the BIR1+Linker respectively showed strong and modest inhibition of both caspase-3 and -7 at a concentration of 100 nm. On the other hand, BIR1+Linker-(D148A) inhibits neither caspase-3 nor -7. Although Linker+BIR2-(D148A) and XIAP-(D148A) recombinant proteins did not inhibit caspase-3, they significantly inhibited caspase-7, consistent with the binding data (Fig.3 B). We next tried to examine whether BIR2-(152–242), which does not have the linker region, binds to or inhibits caspase-7. Caspase-7 still bound to, but was not inhibited by the BIR2 itself (Fig. 3, D and E). Collectively, these data indicate that the linker region is critical but that Asp-148 of XIAP is not critical for the inhibition of caspase-7. Although the sequence similarity between caspase-3 and -7 is very high, we noticed that NH2-terminal portions of the large subunit of caspase-3 and -7 are dissimilar from each other and thought that this difference might explain the different binding/inhibition properties of these two caspases. To determine the portions of caspase-7 responsible for its active site-independent binding to XIAP, we constructed chimeric caspase-7/3 and -7/6, in which the NH2-terminal 141 amino acids of caspase-7 were fused to the COOH-terminal 159 amino acids of caspase-3 and 175 amino acids of caspase-6, respectively. The plasmids encoding these chimeric caspase were introduced into bacteria and recombinant proteins were produced. The recombinant chimeric caspase-7/3 and -7/6 were autoactivated in the bacterial cells, showing substrate specificity nearly identical to caspase-3 and -6, respectively (data not shown). The peptide sequence analysis revealed that the NH2-terminal amino acid of either recombinant caspase was alanine at the position 24 of the caspase-7 (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the prodomain region of the caspase-7-(1–23) was cleaved off in bacterial cells. GST pull down assay using GST·XIAP and chimeric caspase-7/3 and -7/6 showed that both of the chimeric caspases bound to either full-length XIAP or Linker+BIR2 fusion proteins regardless of treatment with z-VAD-fmk (Fig.4 B). This result demonstrated that the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7-(24–141) is responsible for the active site-independent binding of caspase-7 with BIR2. To determine the modes of inhibition of chimeric caspases by XIAP, the velocities of chimeric caspases-catalyzed reactions in the presence or absence of full-length XIAP at various concentrations of substrate were measured. Because caspase-7/6 was not inhibited by XIAP, the data obtained from caspase-7/3 were shown (Fig. 4 C). Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed that XIAP acts as a mixed inhibitor with noncompetitive and competitive inhibition for caspase-7/3 (Fig. 4 D) whereas XIAP acts as a competitive inhibitor for caspase-3 (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the association of XIAP with the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 contributes to noncompetitive inhibition. Finally we tested if chimeric caspase-7/3 might be inhibited by Linker+BIR2-(D148A) mutant, which did not inhibit caspase-3 but did inhibit caspase-7. Surprisingly, chimeric caspase-7/3 was inhibited by Linker+BIR2-(D148A) with similar dose-response relationship as wild-type caspase-7, underscoring that the interaction between the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 and the BIR2 region is essential to the active site-independent inhibition (Fig.4 E). In this study, we showed that caspase-3 and -7 were inhibited by XIAP through different mechanisms: caspase-3 is inhibited by active site-directed mechanisms, whereas caspase-7 is inhibited by both active site-directed and noncompetitive mechanisms. Structure-function analysis of XIAP showed that the linker region between BIR1 and BIR2 is responsible for the active site-directed inhibition of caspase-3 and -7 and that the BIR2 region is essential for the noncompetitive inhibition of caspase-7. Analysis using chimeric caspases showed that the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 physically associated with BIR2, and this association mediated the noncompetitive inhibition of caspase-7 by XIAP. We previously reported that a region of XIAP containing the BIR2 domain was necessary and sufficient for inhibiting caspase-3 and -7 (6Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Subsequent structural biological analysis, however, revealed that the conserved aspartate residue within the linker region between BIR1 and BIR2 that was included in our previous BIR2 construct was essential for active site-directed inhibition of caspase-3 and that a BIR2 construct with mutations in this linker region lost the inhibitory activity (9Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the BIR2 domain might not be essential to inhibiting caspase-3. Moreover, very recently three reports on structural analysis on the inhibition of caspase-3 and -7 by XIAP showed that the several amino acids including Asp-148 in the linker region interact with and block the substrate binding groove of caspase-3 or -7 in a backward fashion, consistent with the results shown in Refs. 14Chai J.

Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). These reports, however, did not agree on whether the BIR2 domain is involved in direct binding and inhibition of caspase-3 or -7. We, here, provide evidence that BIR2 is involved in the inhibition of caspase-7 through binding to its NH2-terminal region. We further observed that a truncated form of the BIR2-(152–242) protein, from which all the amino acids essential for interacting with substrate binding pocket in the linker region were deleted, still bound to but did not inhibit caspase-7 (Fig. 3, D and E). Our result is apparently inconsistent with the data by Chai et al. who detected no binding between caspase-7 and BIR2-(157–242) (14Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Although their BIR “without linker” construct is slightly different in their NH2-terminal length from ours, both constructs are devoid of critical linker domain regions and therefore should not cause such difference. The difference of caspase-7 constructs and the higher sensitivity of our binding assay most likely explain the different results. Chai et al. used caspase-7 constructs from which NH2-terminal 50 residues are removed, whereas we used a full-length caspase-7 for our experiments. Considering that the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 starting from residue 24 is important for BIR2 binding (Fig. 4), binding affinity between BIR2 and caspase-7 construct by Chai et al. might be reduced. Moreover, in the binding assay shown in Figs. 2 C, 3 B and D, and4 B, the molar ratio of GST·XIAP to recombinant caspases is about 30:1. In addition, all the binding experiments were performed at 4 °C, enabling the detection of very weak binding. The binding between caspase-7 and XIAP may be weak but obviously specific because caspase-3 did not bind to XIAP at all in the same experimental condition. Indeed, the binding data by Huang et al. showed that a residual amount of caspase-7 was pulled down by GST·BIR2-(156–242), suggesting the presence of weak but significant binding between XIAP and caspase-7 (15Huang Y. Park Y.C. Rich R.L. Segal D. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2001; 104: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the weak interaction between the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 and XIAP resulted in a noncompetitive mode of caspase inhibition. This is most well illustrated by the data that Linker+BIR2-(D148A), in which the structure of the linker region is compromised, inhibits caspase-7 or chimeric caspase-7/3 but not caspase-3 (Fig. 4 E). However, this BIR2-mediated inhibition seems to become apparent only when the BIR2 construct contained the active site-interacting linker region, as indicated by the fact that BIR2, which binds to caspase-7, did not inhibit it at all (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, Linker+BIR2-(D148A) weakly inhibited caspase-3 at 1 µm or higher concentrations, indicating that the mutated linker region retains weak binding affinity to the active site of caspase-3 or -7 and supporting our data that the linker region is indispensable for caspase inhibition. Our interpretation of the above data is as follows. The interaction between BIR2 and the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 will augment the binding affinity of the linker region to the active site. On the other hand, the two sites-mediated binding, but not BIR2-mediated binding alone, will exert allosteric effects on caspases and give rise to a component of noncompetitive inhibition. Unfortunately, it has not been determined which potion of BIR2 interacts with the NH2-terminal region of caspase-7 since the BIR2 domain was invisible in the crystal structure of the complex between caspase-7 and XIAP (14Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Park Y.C. Rich R.L. Segal D. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2001; 104: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our interpretation is consistent with the idea based on structural analyses that the linker region interacts with the active site and plays an essential role in caspase inhibition, whereas BIR2 plays a supportive role by weak binding to a site distinct from the active site (15Huang Y. Park Y.C. Rich R.L. Segal D. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2001; 104: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we demonstrated that BIR2 does bind to a non-active site of caspase-7 and that this binding affects the mode and potency of inhibition of caspase-7 by XIAP in addition to the proposed mechanism of BIR2, which helps the linker region to take the optimal conformation and to stabilize the linker-active site interaction (9Sun C.

https://openalex.org/W1982273913,"We show here that the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), which has been shown to be a mitogen for breast cancer cells, also stimulates cell survival through a distinct signaling pathway. Breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47-D, BT-20, and MDA-MB-231) were found to express both types of NGF receptors: p140trkA and p75NTR. The two other tyrosine kinase receptors for neurotrophins, TrkB and TrkC, were not expressed. The mitogenic effect of NGF on breast cancer cells required the tyrosine kinase activity of p140trkA as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, but was independent of p75NTR. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic effect of NGF (studied using the ceramide analogue C2) required p75NTR as well as the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, but neither p140trkA nor MAPK was necessary. Other neurotrophins (BDNF, NT-3, NT-4/5) also induced cell survival, although not proliferation, emphasizing the importance of p75NTR in NGF-mediated survival. Both the pharmacological NF-κB inhibitor SN50, and cell transfection with IkBm, resulted in a diminution of NGF anti-apoptotic effect. These data show that two distinct signaling pathways are required for NGF activity and confirm the roles played by p75NTR and NF-κB in the activation of the survival pathway in breast cancer cells.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). NGF interacts with two classes of membrane receptor: the TrkA proto-oncogene product p140trkA, which possesses intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and a secondary receptor, p75NTR, that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (2Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The stimulation of cell survival and cell differentiation by NGF and other neurotrophins have been described primarily in neuronal cell systems (3Lewin G.R. Barde Y.-A. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Although the neurotrophic effect through p140trkA is known to involve the MAPK cascade, the role of p75NTR is still controversial; there is evidence that it can both positively and negatively regulate neuronal cell death and differentiation, depending on the cell type examined (4Barker P.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In some cases, p75NTR is an inducer of apoptosis, even without NGF stimulation (5Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.-T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases the activation of p75NTR by NGF results in a protection from cell death (6Gentry J.J. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7558-7565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to its neurotrophic function, other activities of NGF have been described. For example, NGF can modulate gene expression in monocytes (7Ehrhard P.B. Ganter U. Stalder A. Bauer J. Otten U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5423-5427Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), it is chemotactic for melanocytes (8Yaar M. Grossman K. Eller M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and its inhibition on p75NTR can block the migration of Schwann cells (9Anton E.S. Weskamp G. Reichardt L.F. Matthew W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). NGF also stimulates the proliferation of chromaffin cells (10Lillien L.E. Claude P. Nature. 1985; 317: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), lymphocytes (11Otten U. Ehrhard P. Peck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both cellular proliferation as well as tumor cell survival are crucial for malignant progression. The effect of NGF on the survival of cancer cells through the p75NTR receptor has been shown for neuroblastoma (18Lièvremont J.P. Sciorati C. Morandi E. Paolucci C. Bunone G. Della Valle G.

In prostate cancer, p75NTR has been shown to be a mediator of NGF's effects during critical phases of developmental cell death and carcinogenic progression (19Rabizadeh S. Rabizadeh S. Ye X. Wong J.J. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To date only the mitogenic effect of NGF for breast cancer cells has been described (13Descamps S. Lebourhis X. Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16659-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with its roles in the control of breast cancer cell survival unknown. In this study, we have shown that, in addition to its mitogenic effect, NGF is also an anti-apoptotic factor for breast cancer cells. These cells express mRNA for both p140trkA and p75NTRreceptors. Our results indicate that the mitogenic effect of NGF requires p140trkA and the MAPK cascade, but not the p75NTR receptor, whereas the promotion of cell survival strictly requires p75NTR as well as NF-κB, but not p140trkA and MAPK. Thus the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of NGF on breast cancer cells are mediated through two different signaling pathways.

To study the effect of pharmacological inhibitors or blocking antibodies, various concentrations were added simultaneously with NGF (100 ng/ml). After 2 days of NGF exposure, cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted using an hemocytometer. Apoptosis of breast cancer cells was induced by the ceramide analogue C2, which has been described as a pro-apoptotic agent for human breast cancer cells (21Gill Z.P. Perks C.M. Newcomb P.V. Holly J.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25602-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Pirianov G. Danielsson C. Carlberg C. James S.Y. Colston K.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 890-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was obtained by treatment with 2 μm C2 for 24 h. To evaluate the anti-apoptotic activity of NGF, various concentrations of this factor were tested; we found that the maximal effect was obtained for 100 ng/ml. Consequently, this concentration was used in all experiments with pharmacological inhibitors or blocking antibody. For determination of apoptotic cell percentage, cells were fixed with cold methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before staining with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted with coverslips using Glycergel (Dako). The apoptotic cells exhibiting condensed and fragmented nuclei were counted under an Olympus-BH2 fluorescence microscope in randomly selected fields. A minimum of 500–1000 cells was examined for each condition, and results were expressed as a ratio of the total number of cells counted. The statistical analysis of the data gathered from cell and apoptotic nuclei counting was performed using SPSS version 9.0.1 (SPSS inc., Chicago, IL). Analyses of variance were followed by the Tukey's test to determine the significance. Subconfluent cell cultures were harvested by scraping in serum-free medium. After centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min), the pellet was treated with lysis buffer (0.3% SDS, 200 mmdithiothreitol) and boiled 5 min. In the case of PARP, the pellet was lysed with urea-rich buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS), sonicated and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) by electroblotting (100 V, 75 min), and probed with anti-trkA, anti-p75NTR or anti-PARP antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 3 h with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit (TrkA) or anti-mouse (p75NTRand PARP) immunoglobulin G. After 1 h of incubation with extravidin, the reaction was revealed using the chemiluminescence kit ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Kodak X-Omat AR film. Proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) prior to immunoprecipitation. Preclearing was done with protein A-agarose (10 μl/250 μl, 60 min, 4 °C). After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min), the supernatant was incubated with monoclonal anti-MAPK (anti-ERK2) antibody (10 μl/250 μl, 60 min, 4 °C). Protein A-agarose (10 μl) was added for 60 min (4 °C) and then pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min). The pellet was then rinsed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then incubated with PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C, rinsed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 3 h at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed overnight at 4 °C before visualization with ECL. Cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Herrmann et al. (23Herrmann J.L. Beham A.W. Sarkiss M. Chiao P.J. Rands M.T. Bruckheimer E.M. Brisbay S. McDonnell T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and then pelleted in minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were repelleted and resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 mm DTT). After 10 min on ice, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and crude nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mmDTT, and 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 30 min on ice with frequent agitation, the insoluble nuclear material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Crude nuclear protein was collected from the supernatant and snap-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. After thawing and boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer, the nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with an anti-NF-κB p65 antibody. A control was established with anti-lamin B antibody. Cotransfection experiments were carried out using Lipofectin reagent, as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were incubated for 5 h in 1 ml of Opti-MEM transfection medium containing 8 μl of Lipofectin reagent, 0.8 μg of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-carrying vector and 0.2 μg of empty vector PCDNA3 or 0.2 μg of IκBm. In the case of c-rel or rel-A, cells were cotransfected with 0.8 μg of GFP-carrying GFP and 0.6 μg of PSVK3 (empty plasmid), c-rel, or rel-A. Cells were then grown for 24 h with 10% FCS minimal essential medium and rinsed for 2 h in serum-free medium before incubation in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml NGF and/or 2 μm C2 for another 24 h. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% (4 °C) for 30 min, and the percentage of apoptotic cell nuclei in GFP-stained cells was determined as described above. The effects of 100 ng/ml NGF on cell proliferation and C2-induced apoptosis were evaluated by cell counting and Hoechst staining, respectively. The results show that NGF induces an increase in cell number for all breast cancer cell lines tested (Fig.1 A). We have previously demonstrated that NGF has a direct mitogenic effect on breast cancer cells by recruiting cells in G0 phase and by shortening the G1 length (Descamps et al., 1998). In addition, NGF rescued breast cancer cells undergoing C2-induced apoptosis; the maximum survival was observed at 200 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). The morphology of cells undergoing this NGF-induced anti-apoptotic rescue was quite distinct (Fig.2 A). The induction of apoptosis by C2 was found to involve cleavage of poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP); this cleavage was reversed by NGF (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Anti-apoptotic effect of NGF.A, Hoechst staining of apoptotic cell nuclei in control, C2 and C2+NGF-treated MCF-7 cells. Cells were serum-deprived in minimum essential medium and treated with C2. NGF was added at 100 ng/ml. After 24 h, cells were fixed and apoptotic nuclei were observed after Hoechst staining. B, immunoblot detection of PARP cleavage. C2-induced PARP cleavage was reversed by p75NTR activation mediated by NGF. MCF-7 cells were serum-deprived in minimum essential medium for 24 h and were then treated with 100 ng/ml NGF in the presence or absence of 2 μm C2, 10 nm K-252a, 10 μm PD98059, or 10 μg/ml anti-p75NTR-blocking antibody (Euromedex) for another 24-h period. Proteins were detected after SDS-PAGE of cell preparations from MCF-7 breast cancer cells, electroblotting onto nitrocellulose, and immunodetection with anti-PARP antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RT-PCR was used to show the expression of mRNA for both high and low affinity NGF receptors in MCF-7, T47-D, BT-20, and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.3 A); the 102-bp band for the TrkA transcript and a 147-bp band for the p75NTR transcript were readily detectable on 1% agarose gels. Moreover, Western blotting demonstrated that both p140trkA and p75NTR were present in all the breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 3 B). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR indicated that there was no significant change in the levels of TrkA and p75NTR mRNAs in the presence of FCS, NGF, or C2 (data not shown) and that the levels of mRNA for TrkA and p75NTR in breast cancer cells was between 5 and 10 times lower than the level observed in SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (data not shown). This indicates that NGF receptor expression in breast cancer cells is relatively limited. It should be noticed that, although mRNA levels of NGF receptors differ between breast cancer cells and SY5Y, the protein levels apparently do not. However, it has been shown before that the level of a given cellular protein cannot be simply deduced from mRNA transcript level (24Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). One could hypothesize that the stability of mRNA and/or protein for NGF receptors, differs between breast cancer cells and neuroblastoma cells, leading to the observed disproportionality between mRNA and protein levels. We used a combination of specific antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors to study the putative functions of p140trkA and p75NTR in the stimulation of proliferation and cell survival induced by NGF. The Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor K-252a, and the MEK inhibitor PD98059, both strongly inhibited the growth-stimulatory effect of NGF on MCF-7 cells, but had no effect on its anti-apoptotic effects (Fig.4). Conversely, neither the anti-p75NTR blocking antibody nor the NF-κB inhibitor SN50 affected NGF-stimulated proliferation, although both strongly reduced the anti-apoptotic effects (Fig. 4). The tyrosine kinase activity of p140trkA was inhibited by K-252a but not by the anti-p75NTR or PD98059 (Fig.5). On the other hand, the activity of the MAPKs was inhibited by K-252a and PD98059 but not by the anti-p75NTR (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the SN50 peptidic inhibitor of NF-κB, similarly to the anti-p75NTR, inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect of NGF but neither its proliferative effect nor its activation of p140trkA and MAPKs. The effect of other neurotrophins on MCF-7 cell growth and survival was also evaluated (Fig.6 A). In contrast to NGF, no proliferative effect was provided by BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5. However, all neurotrophins tested exhibited a rescue effect on C2-treated cells that was not altered in the presence of the trk inhibitor K-252a (Fig.6 B). These data suggest that trk receptors are not involved in NGF survival activity. Moreover, the participation of trkB and trkC in these events can be ruled out, because they are not expressed in these breast cancer cells (Fig. 6 C).Figure 5p140trkA and MAPK activation.MCF-7 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF in the presence or absence of 10 nm K-252a, 10 μg/ml anti-p75NTR-blocking antibody, or 10 μmPD98059. p140trkA (A) and MAPK activation (B) were determined after immunoprecipitation using polyclonal anti-TrkA and monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibodies, respectively. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, nitrocellulose membranes were counterprobed with the PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. For detection of TrkA (A) and MAPK (B) activation, the lower panel shows reprobing of the blots with the immunoprecipitating antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Effect of different neurotrophins on MCF-7 cells growth and survival. MCF-7 cells were serum-deprived in minimum essential medium, and after 24 h the neurotrophins (100 ng/ml NGF, 50 ng/ml BDNF, 50 ng/ml NT-3, 100 ng/ml NT-4/5) were added.A, after 48 h, cells were harvested and counted. In contrast with NGF, neither BDNF, NT-3, nor NT-4/5 displayed significant bioactivity (for concentrations up to 400 ng/ml). B, MCF-7 cells were serum-deprived in minimum essential medium and treated with 2 μm C2, with or without neurotrophins (100 ng/ml NGF, 50 ng/ml BDNF, 50 ng/ml NT-3, 100 ng/ml NT-4/5). After 24 h, cells were fixed and apoptotic nuclei percentage was determined after Hoechst staining under an Olympus-BH2 fluorescence microscope.

To further investigate this phenomenon, we studied the effect of NGF on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, as well as the consequence of transfection by IkBm (an inhibitor of NF-κB) or by c-rel and rel-A (constitutively active subunits of NF-κB) on the NGF-mediated anti-apoptotic activity in MCF-7 cells. Western blotting revealed no change in the nuclear levels of NF-κB (p65) during apoptosis induced by C2 (Fig.7). In contrast, the addition of NGF on C2-treated cells induced a translocation of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. Computerized quantification revealed a doubling p65 band intensity normalized to the total intensity of the lane (data not shown). Moreover, this NF-κB nuclear translocation was inhibited by the presence of p75NTR-blocking antibody or SN50, but was not affected by K-252a and PD98059. Interestingly, in the absence of C2-induced apoptosis NGF was not able to induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, confirming previous observations that p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation requires cell stress (25Bhakar A.L. Roux P.P. Lachance C. Kryl D. Zeindler C. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21443-21449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transfection of MCF-7 cells with IkBm, an inhibitor of NF-κB, reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of NGF (Fig.8 A). As a control, we transfected MCF-7 cells with an empty vector; no effect was observed. In addition, transfection with activators of the NF-κB pathway, c-rel or rel-A (Fig. 8 B), resulted in an inhibition of C2-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, even in absence of NGF, confirming the involvement of NF-κB family members in human breast cancer cell survival.Figure 8Modulation of NGF anti-apoptotic effect by IκBm, c-rel, and rel-A transfection. MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with EGFPC1 and either IκBm (A) or c-rel or rel-A (B) using the Lipofectin reagent. Controls were performed with both PCDNA3 and EGFPC1 (for IκBm experiments) and both PSVK3 and EGFPC1 (for c-rel and rel-A experiments). After 24 h, cells were serum-deprived in minimum essential medium and either C2 or neurotrophins added for another 24-h period. Cells were then fixed and the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in transfected cells (with the expression of GFP as a transfection control) determined after Hoechst staining.

A 70-kilosecond exposure of the cluster reveals a centrally concentrated population of faint ( L x ∼ 10 30−33 ergs per second) x-ray sources, with at least 108 located within the central 2′ × 2.5′ and ≳ half with L x ≲ 10 30.5 ergs per second. All 15 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) recently located precisely by radio observations are identified, though 2 are unresolved by Chandra. The x-ray spectral and temporal characteristics, as well as initial optical identifications with the Hubble Space Telescope, suggest that ≳50 percent are MSPs, about 30 percent are accreting white dwarfs, about 15 percent are main-sequence binaries in flare outbursts, and only two to three are quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries containing neutron stars, the conventional progenitors of MSPs. An upper limit of about 470 times the mass of the sun is derived for the mass of an accreting central black hole in the cluster. These observations provide the first x-ray “color-magnitude” diagram for a globular cluster and census of its compact object and binary population."
https://openalex.org/W2153256423,"In injured skin, collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)) is induced in migrating keratinocytes. This site-specific expression is regulated by binding of the α2β1 integrin with dermal type I collagen, and the catalytic activity of MMP-1 is required for keratinocyte migration. Because of this functional association among substrate/ligand, receptor, and proteinase, we assessed whether the integrin also directs the compartmentalization of MMP-1 to its matrix target. Indeed, pro-MMP-1 co-localized to sites of α2β1 contacts in migrating keratinocytes. Furthermore, pro-MMP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with α2β1 from keratinocytes, and α2β1 co-immunoprecipitated with pro-MMP-1. No other MMPs bound α2β1, and no other integrins interacted with MMP-1. Pro-MMP-1 also provided a substrate for α2β1-dependent adhesion of platelets. Complex formation on keratinocytes was most efficient on native type I collagen and reduced or ablated on denatured or cleaved collagen. Competition studies suggested that the α2 I domain interacts with the linker and hemopexin domains of pro-MMP-1, not with the pro-domain. These data indicate that the interaction of pro-MMP-1 with α2β1 confines this proteinase to points of cell contact with collagen and that the ternary complex of integrin, enzyme, and substrate function together to drive and regulate keratinocyte migration.

For example, integrin-ligand interactions tell cells which structural proteins they have encountered in the extracellular space, and in turn, these contacts activate signaling pathways involved in differentiation, proliferation, and gene expression, among other processes. During migration, cells need to proteolyze, to some extent, nearby extracellular matrix proteins, and hence, cell-matrix contacts can also instruct cells which proteinases are needed and where the enzyme should be targeted and released.An example of cell-matrix-mediated spatial regulation of proteolysis is seen with collagenase-1 (MMP-1),1 a matrix metalloproteinase, in human cutaneous wounds. In response to injury, collagenase-1 is induced in basal epidermal cells (keratinocytes) as the cells move off of the basement membrane and contact native type I collagen in the underlying dermis (1Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and this inductive response is specifically controlled by the collagen-binding integrin α2β1 (2Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). As we demonstrated in various experiments, the catalytic activity of collagenase-1 is required and sufficient for keratinocyte migration on complex matrices containing type I collagen. For example, keratinocytes plated on mutant, collagenase-resistant type I collagen do not migrate, even in the presence of fibronectin and vitronectin; yet they express MMP-1 at levels equivalent to those released by cells on wild-type collagen (2Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte migration is also completely inhibited by anti-collagenase-1 antibodies, which block the catalytic activity of the enzyme, and by anti-α2β1 blocking antibodies (2Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, MMP-1, collagen, and α2β1 function together in migrating keratinocyte during re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds.It is becoming increasingly clear that extracellular proteolysis is a cell-regulated process. After all, cells do not release proteases indiscriminately, especially enzymes like MMP-1 with such a defined substrate specificity. Rather they rely on precise interactions to accurately degrade, cleave, or process specific substrates in the pericellular space. Indeed, an emerging concept is that metalloproteinases, as for some serine and cysteine proteinases (3Reddy V.Y. Zhang Q.Y. Weiss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The membrane-type MMPs (MMP-14, -15, -16, -17, -24, and -25) are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are fixed and active at the cell surface and, in addition to acting as proteinases, may provide docking sites for other MMPs. Indeed, pro-MMP-2 also interacts with MMP-14 and TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor ofmetalloproteinase 2) on the cell surface, and this trimeric complex is essential for activation of this gelatinase (11Strongin A.Y.

It is likely that other MMPs are also attached to cells via specific interaction to membrane proteins, and determining these anchors will lead to identifying activation mechanisms and relevant substrates.Because the α2β1 integrin regulates MMP-1 expression by binding the substrate of the enzyme, we assessed whether MMP-1 interacts with this collagen receptor on the surface of keratinocytes. We report here that pro-MMP-1 specifically binds the α2β1 integrin on keratinocytes migrating on type I collagen. Formation of the α2β1-pro-MMP-1 complex may provide a mechanism to increase the localized concentrations of enzyme, in turn facilitating the cleavage of type I collagen and keratinocyte migration across the dermal wound bed.RESULTSAs is well established (22Pellegrini G.

However, in response to injury, this integrin gathers along the basal surface of migrating keratinocytes at a wound edge (Fig. 1 B). As we reported previously in studies of actual human wounds (1Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin.

The same population of cells that were positive for MMP-1 were the same as those that showed the most overt redistribution of the α2β1 integrin. Because the interaction of α2β1 with native type I collagen mediates induction of MMP-1 in migrating keratinocytes and because this metalloproteinase is required for cell migration on collagen (2Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the integrin and the secreted enzyme would be found in the same pericellular compartment.To assess this idea, we plated primary adult human keratinocytes on native type I collagen (hereupon called collagen). Reflecting the phenotype of basal cells involved in re-epithelialization in vivo, MMP-1 mRNA is expressed only in keratinocytes migrating from the colonies of proliferating and differentiating cells (2Pilcher B.K.

Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In solitary cells examined 6 h post-plating, prominent immunofluorescence for the α2 subunit, which represents the α2β1 heterodimer, was seen along the periphery of the cells, likely indicating the initial contacts of the spreading membrane with the collagen substratum (Fig. 1, Eand F, red). The signal for MMP-1 protein appeared as clumps slightly internal to the membrane borders (Fig. 1,E and F, green and merged yellow). Co-localization of the α2β1integrin and MMP-1 was seen in many close contact points just behind the edge of newly formed adhesions (Fig. 1, E andF, yellow). These observations suggest that MMP-1 is targeted to and released at sites of established cell-matrix contacts.The overlap of immunofluorescence signals for the α2β1 integrin and MMP-1 raised the possibility that these proteins may interact on the cell surface. Indeed, we found that MMP-1 selectively co-immunoprecipitated with α2β1 from membrane preparations of keratinocytes plated on collagen (Fig.2). In addition, essentially all of the co-immunoprecipitated enzyme migrated along with authentic pro-MMP-1 (Fig. 2, A–C), indicating that the zymogen form of the proteinase was associated with the integrin. In agreement with this conclusion, immunoprecipitation of TIMP-1, which is expressed by keratinocytes (27Tamai K. Ishikawa H. Mauviel A. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 384-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and which does not bind pro-MMP-1, did not bring down any MMP-1 from the surface of keratinocytes (Fig. 2 B). MMP-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with the α3β1 integrin, another collagen-binding receptor on keratinocytes (24Juhasz I. Murphey G.F. Yan H.-C. Herlyn M. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1458-1469PubMed Google Scholar, 25Larjava H. Salo T. Haapasalmi K. Kramer R.H. Heino J. J. Clin.

Nearly identical levels of pro-MMP-1 were precipitated from keratinocyte membrane lysates incubated with either anti-α2 or anti-MMP-1 antibodies (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that essentially all cell surface-associated pro-MMP-1 is complexed with the α2β1 integrin. In contrast, the signal for immunoblotted α2 was stronger in samples precipitated for α2 than in those precipitated for MMP-1, and a much more dramatic difference was seen in samples precipitated for the β1 subunit (Fig. 2 D). These data indicate that only a subset of the α2β1 receptors are occupied with pro-MMP-1, consistent with our confocal findings (Fig. 1,E and F). As for primary keratinocytes, pro-MMP-1 produced by HaCaTs, a line of spontaneously transformed keratinocytes, immunoprecipitated with α2β1, and α2β1 was brought down with pro-MMP-1 (Fig.2 E).Figure 2Pro-MMP-1 is bound to α2β1on the surface of keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were plated on collagen-coated dishes, and 24 h later specific proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the panels shown, the antibody used for precipitation is indicated at the top of eachlane. The antibodies used for immunoblotting are indicated along the side of each panel. In A, purified pro-MMP-1 was included as a migration standard (Std) and, the migration of molecular mass standards is shown on the right (in kDa). In E, proteins were immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts of HaCaT keratinocytes. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” different antibodies were used if samples were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for the same antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In agreement with these data, MMP-3 and MMP-9, which are expressed by keratinocytes in wounded skin (29Madlener M.

Plating keratinocytes on heat-denatured collagen (gelatin) or stimulating their production of MMPs with epidermal growth factor (31Pilcher, B. K., Dumin, J. A., Schwartz, M. J., Mast, B.

Chem. 274.Google Scholar) did not promote an association of MMP-3 or MMP-9 with α2β1(Fig. 3, A and B), nor did these conditions affect the levels of this integrin (Fig. 3 C). We did find, however, that higher levels of MMP-9 were released from keratinocytes on native collagen compared with the levels secreted from cells on gelatin. The matrix-mediated stimulation of MMP-9 expression in keratinocytes is a novel observation.Figure 3α2β1does not interact with MMP-3 or MMP-9. A andB, keratinocytes were plated on gelatin- or collagen-coated dishes; some cells on collagen were treated with epidermal growth factor. Cells and media were collected 24 h later, and α2β1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates. Medium samples and immunoprecipitates were resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to membranes for immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies against gelatinase-A (MMP-9) or MMP-3. C, in another experiment, lysates of keratinocytes on collagen, with or without epidermal growth factor, were immunoprecipitated for α2β1 or MMP-3 and immunoblotted for α2β1. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” different antibodies were used if samples were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for the same antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also used a platelet adhesion assay to assess direct binding of pro-MMP-1 to native, membrane-integrated α2β1 integrin (32Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Platelets bound to dishes coated with collagen in the presence of Mn2+, and this interaction was inhibited with EDTA or 6F1 (Fig.4), a blocking antibody that binds the I domain of α2β1 (33Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets also bound to pro-MMP-1 (Fig. 4), but they did not bind to matrilysin (MMP-7), another MMP expressed by migrating epithelial cells (34Dunsmore S.E. Saarialho-Kere U.K. Roby J.D. Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, by three distinct assays: co-immunoprecipitation, platelet adhesion, and solid phase binding to α2 integrin I domain (35Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L. Nagase H. Parks W.C. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29375-29381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that pro-MMP-1 and active MMP-1 binds to the α2β1 integrin.Figure 4Pro-MMP-1 binds α2β1on platelets. Microtiter plates were coated with native type I collagen, MMP-1, or matrilysin (MMP-7). Washed platelets were permitted to adhere to the substrate for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, adhesion was quantified by measuring the hexose aminidase activity in the adherent platelets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Increasing concentrations of 6F1 displaced pro-MMP-1 from the surface of keratinocytes (Fig. 5 A), whereas a blocking antibody to α3β1 did not (Fig. 5 B). For these studies, 6F1 was added 24 h post-plating to prevent cell detachment, and 2 h later, cells and media were harvested. Because 6F1 recognizes an epitope within the I domain, these results suggests that pro-MMP-1 interacts with this region of the α2 subunit. This conclusion was verified in various experiments reported in our accompanying paper (35Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L. Nagase H. Parks W.C. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29375-29381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Figure 5Pro-MMP-1/integrin association is reduced by anti-α2β1antibodies and on keratinocytes grown on gelatin. A, keratinocytes were plated on type I collagen for 24 h and were treated for the last 2 h with increasing concentrations of 6F1, an anti-α2β1 blocking antibody to an epitope within the I domain. The cell were washed of medium, the lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) for MMP-1, and the resolved products were blotted (IB) for MMP-1 protein. In this experiment, both pro-MMP-1 and active MMP-1 were immunoprecipitated, but the association of both forms with the cell surface was reduced by 6F1.B, in a similar experiment with different primary keratinocytes, 6F1 again reduced the recovery of pro-MMP-1 from cell lysates, whereas a blocking antibody against α3β1, another collagen-binding integrin, did not. C, keratinocytes were plated on heat-denatured collagen (gelatin) or on native fibrillar collagen with or without antibody 6F1 during the last 2 h. The cell layers were immunoprecipitated for α2β1 and immunoblotted for or MMP-1 or α2β1. Medium samples were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for MMP-1.D, keratinocytes were plated on gelatin, enzymatically cleaved collagen (Clvd Col), or native fibrillar collagen. The cell lysates were harvested, lysed, and immunoprecipitated for α2β1 and immunoblotted for MMP-1. Recovery of integrin-associated pro-MMP-1 was reduced from keratinocytes on the denatured substrates. Different antibodies were used if samples were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for the same antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The ability of pro-MMP-1 to interact with α2β1 was dependent on the nature of the collagen substratum. On gelatin, pro-MMP-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with α2β1, even though appreciable levels of the enzyme were released into the medium (Fig. 5 C). Gelatin did not influence the levels of α2β1 on the cell surface (Fig.5 C). In some experiments, plating on gelatin barred an interaction between MMP-1 and α2β1 (Fig.5 C), whereas in others, reduced levels of pro-MMP-1 were co-immunoprecipitated with α2β1 (Fig.5 D). Because each experiment was done with keratinocytes from skin of a different individual, these results may reflect person-to-person variability. Regardless, our data show that pro-MMP-1 interacts poorly, if at all, with α2β1 if keratinocytes are plated on denatured collagen. Similarly, reduced levels of pro-MMP-1 were co-immunoprecipitated with α2β1 from keratinocytes on enzymatically cleaved collagen (Fig. 5 D).A competition assay was used to begin to determine the site on pro-MMP-1 that interacts with α2β1. Keratinocyte surface proteins were labeled with biotin, and cultures were then incubated for 4 h with equimolar amounts of purified active MMP-1 or its pro-domain. Biotinylated surface proteins were precipitated using streptavidin beads, and membrane-associated pro-MMP-1 was detected by immunoblotting. Cell-bound pro-MMP-1 was progressively displaced with increasing concentrations of active MMP-1, with >50% removed with 3.6 µm active MMP-1 (Fig.6). Equal concentrations of the pro-domain had no effect on the recovery of cell-associated pro-MMP-1. We obtained similar results if pro-MMP-1 was immunoprecipitated from biotinylated cell lysates and detected on gels using horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin (data not shown). The efficiency of pro-MMP-1 displacement was possibly hampered by poor accessibility of the relatively large competitors to points of cell-substratum contacts. These findings suggest that pro-MMP-1 is anchored to the α2β1 integrin via its catalytic, linker, or hemopexin domains, a conclusion that is more thoroughly refined in our accompanying paper (35Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L. Nagase H. Parks W.C. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29375-29381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Figure 6Pro-MMP-1/α2β1integrin interaction is disrupted by active MMP-1 and not by its pro-domain. Equal numbers of keratinocytes (2 × 106) were plated on collagen, and 24 h later, surface proteins were biotinylated. The cells were washed, and fresh medium was added with he indicated concentrations of MMP-1 or purified prodomain for 4 h. The cell lysates were collected, and labeled proteins were precipitated using streptavidin beads and resolved by electrophoresis. Surface-associated MMP-1 was detected by immunoblotting. The migration of molecular mass standards is shown on the left (in kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONCell-matrix contacts provide an unambiguous signal informing cells which matrix protein they have encountered and, in turn, which proteinase is needed and where the enzyme should be delivered and released. During migration, cells attach to, extend over, and then release from a matrix substrate, and repeating these steps allows the cell to continue moving (36Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Following injury to the epidermis, basal keratinocytes at the wound edge quickly move off of the basement membrane onto the underlying dermal matrix, which is rich in type I collagen. In addition to being a mechanism for attachment and spreading, the interaction of keratinocytes with dermal collagen provides a site-specific signal that, along with other processes, such as altered cell-cell contacts, initiates the epithelial response to wounding. This response is characterized, in part, by the prominent and invariable expression of pro-MMP-1 (37Parks W.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and is regulated by the ligation of the α2β1 integrin, which is constitutively expressed on keratinocytes (38Symington B.E. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), with dermal collagen (2Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar).Here, we report that pro-MMP-1 specifically binds the α2β1 integrin on enzyme-expressing keratinocytes plated on native type I collagen. Co-localization of this proteinase with this collagen-binding integrin was seen by confocal immunofluorescence, and direct binding of pro-MMP-1 to the α2β1 integrin was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and platelet adhesion. In our accompanying paper, we demonstrate by solid phase assays that pro-MMP-1 interacts with the I domain of the α2β1 integrin (35Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L. Nagase H. Parks W.C. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29375-29381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ternary complex of the α2β1integrin, type I collagen, and pro-MMP-1 would spatially confine proteolysis and selectively direct catalysis to points of cell-matrix contacts. There are several examples of cell-directed proteolysis, some of which are cited in the Introduction. As discussed by Owen and Campbell (39Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and as demonstrated by their studies on serine proteinases in neutrophils (4Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 40Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Owen C.A. J.

Invest. 1999; 104: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), anchoring enzymes to the cell surface provides both a mechanism to increase enzyme concentration at sites of proteolysis and a pericellular barrier to interference by natural proteinase inhibitors, which are abundant in tissue fluids. In addition to these functions, we propose that the α2β1-pro-MMP-1 complex functions also as a molecular motor controlling and driving keratinocyte migration over a dermal collagen.Because the formation of α2β1-collagen contacts would precede the biosynthesis and secretion of pro-MMP-1, not all α2β1-contacts would be complexed with enzyme. Indeed, our co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that pro-MMP-1 binds to a subset of the α2β1integrin receptors (Fig. 2 D), and our confocal observations indicate that pro-MMP-1 binds to established α2β1-collagen contacts (Fig.1 E). This spatial association suggests that MMP-1 functions to dissociate the integrin-collagen contacts, as suggested in our previous studies (2Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), rather than to break down matrix barriers that might be encountered at the forward extent of cell extension. The α2β1 integrins bind native collagen with high affinity (42Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and thus, clustering this receptor at contact points would tether keratinocytes to the dermis, rendering them unable to migrate.

For example, malondialdehyde, a major carbonyl product of lipid peroxidation, is mutagenic and carcinogenic and induces cell cycle arrest at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints (7Ji C. Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Pietenpol J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The G1/S arrest in human colon and lung cancer cells (RKO and H1299, respectively) is caused by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, whereas the G2/M arrest appears to be due to a reduction in the level of the cdc2 kinase. Thus, alteration of gene expression triggered by protein or DNA damage may contribute to the range of biological effects exerted by aldehydes. A panoply of pathophysiological responses is also exerted by 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE),1 the major toxic product of lipid peroxidation (1Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). HNE reacts with sulfhydryl and amino groups and leads to inactivation of DNA polymerases, dehydrogenases, and various transporters, inter alia (13Schauenstein E. Esterbauer H. Zollner H.

NF-κB consists of heterodimers of two polypeptides, p50 and p65, which are members of a family of proteins related to the proto-oncogene c-rel (20Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 21Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Inactive NF-κB is located in the cytosol, bound to its inhibitory protein, IκB. Dissociation of NF-κB from IκB is a critical step in NF-κB activation that leads to translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, enabling DNA binding and transactivation (22Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). This process is triggered by sequential phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκBα, followed by digestion of the ubiquinated protein by the proteasome (23Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 24DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Hence, in most cases, the key event for NF-κB activation is phosphorylation of two serine residues at the N terminus of IκB by IκB kinase (IKK) (23Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 24DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

We report here that treatment of RKO and H1299 cells with HNE leads to a dramatic loss of DNA binding and transcriptional activation by NF-κB in cells treated with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) and ionomycin (IM). The loss of NF-κB activity is due to stabilization to the IκBα-NF-κB complex, which results from a decrease in the rate of turnover of IκBα. The prevention of IκBα turnover is attributable to the inhibition of IKK caused by direct reaction with HNE. These findings indicate that HNE is a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB-dependent cell signaling. Human colorectal carcinoma cells (RKO) were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Hyclone, Logan, Utah). Human large cell lung carcinoma cells (H1299) were maintained in F-12 medium (Hyclone), and human lymphoma Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI (Hyclone). RKO and H1299 cells were grown in the presence of 10% bovine serum, and Jurkat T cells were grown in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RKO and H1299 cells were plated 18–24 h prior to chemical exposure and were 50–70% confluent at a density of 7 × 105/ml at the time of treatment. HNE (a generous gift from V. Amarnath, Vanderbilt University) and TPA (Sigma) were dissolved in 70% ethanol, and IM (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of ethanol or Me2SO in the medium was ≤0.1%. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmDTT, and the protease inhibitors antipain (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (5 μg/ml), chymostatin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml) (Sigma)) for 30 min at 4 °C. After addition of Nonidet P-40 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (final concentration, 0.4%), cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was cleared by further centrifugation at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min (cytosolic extract). The pellets were washed once with buffer A and resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (as above)). The suspension was agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected. For isolation of total cell extracts, cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (KLB: 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants (total cell extracts) were collected. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Cellular protein (30–50 μg) was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with anti-IκBα and anti-IKK polyclonal or anti-phospho-specific Ser-32 IκBα monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies or anti-HNE-Michael adducts antiserum (Calbiochem). The primary antibody complex was then stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used to assay NF-κB and AP1/c-Jun binding were 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ and 5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′, respectively (Promega, Madison, WI; bold letters indicate the binding site). DNA probes (3.5 pmol) were reacted with [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units). Labeled probes were purified on a Sephadex G50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted with 20,000 cpm of oligonucleotide probe per sample (35 fmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide). To assess NF-κB binding, nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) were incubated with the labeled DNA probe in the presence of poly(dI-dC) (2 μg), bovine serum albumin (2 μg), and Nonidet P-40 (0.5%) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mmKCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, and 4% Ficoll) at room temperature for 10 min. Similarly, AP-1 binding was evaluated by incubating nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) in reaction buffer with 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm DTT in the presence of labeled DNA probe, poly(dI-dC) (2 μg), and bovine serum albumin (2 μg) at room temperature for 10 min. The specificity of binding was examined both by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide and by supershift assay with respective antibodies. In supershift experiments, antibodies (1–2 μg) directed against NF-κB/p65, NF-κB/p50, or AP1/c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with nuclear extracts for 45 min at 4 °C before addition of labeled probe. In competition experiments, antibodies were replaced with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. Binding activity was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a 4–5% polyacrylamide gel and Tris, glycine, EDTA buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 8.4), 9 mm glycine, and 0.2 mm EDTA). Visualization and quantification of radioactive bands were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well 18–24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter construct in a pGL2 luciferase-expressing vector (Promega) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The plasmid was constructed with 6× NF-κB binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter. Thus, the luciferase reporter gene was under NF-κB control. Cells were exposed 18–24 h after transfection to TPA/IM (0.08 μm/2 μm) or TPA/IM plus HNE (10–80 μm) for 6 h and lysed in luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Total cell lysates (5–10 μg of protein) were determined for luciferase activity by the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). To determine IKK activity, total cell extracts (200–250 μg of protein) were rotated with anti-IKKα antibody (2 μg/ml) in KLB containing 0.5 m NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C and then for an additional 2 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with KLB, 0.5 m NaCl and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). The washed beads were incubated with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of GST-IκBα substrate, 50 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. IKK activity was evaluated from the formation of γ-32P-IκBα-GST by autoradiography. The levels of IKKα and GST-IκBα were analyzed by Western blot and ink staining, respectively. Total cell extracts (200–250 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα antibody and bound to protein A-Sepharose as described above. Immunoprecipitates served as the enzyme source for testing the effect of HNE on IKK activity in vitro. Prior to use, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with KLB, 0.5 m NaCl and twice with kinase buffer with or without DTT (1 mm). Cleared and washed beads were treated with HNE in 30 μl of kinase buffer in the presence or absence of DTT (1 mm) for 10 min at 30 °C. HNE treatment was terminated by adding 300 μl of ice-cold kinase buffer with 1 mm DTT. Following treatment, beads were centrifuged and subjected to kinase assay as described. To determine whether HNE initiates a cellular response that suppresses NF-κB DNA binding, we evaluated the effects of HNE treatment on NF-κB activity in H1299 cells stimulated with TPA and IM. H1299 cells are derived from a large cell lung carcinoma and are p53-deficient. Fig. 1 demonstrates that treatment of H1299 cells with TPA/IM resulted in enhanced NF-κB DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts. Increased activity was detectable within 5 min, reached a maximum at 15 min, and declined after 30 min of TPA/IM stimulation. The specificity of the nuclear binding activity was confirmed by competition of the labeled probe with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig.1 A, lane 9). No competition was observed with an excess of an oligonucleotide containing an SP-1 sequence (data not shown). Treatment of the extracts with either anti-NF-κB p50 or anti-NF-κB p65/Rel A antibodies yielded supershifted bands (Fig.1 A, lanes 10 and 11). Hence, the binding is indeed NF-κB-specific. Pretreatment of H1299 cells with 40 μm HNE for 30 min completely prevented the TPA/IM-dependent increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity. In fact, HNE pretreatment lowered the basal levels of NF-κB binding activity 2-fold (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and5). The inhibitory effect of HNE was not restricted to H1299 cells. A similar inhibition of TPA/IM-stimulated increase in NF-κB binding was observed in RKO cells. RKO is a human colon carcinoma that is wild-type for p53 but mismatch repair-deficient. The effects of HNE in RKO cells were not as dramatic as in H1299 cells, because of the higher basal level of activity in the former (data not shown). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of HNE was a nonspecific effect, we performed similar experiments probing for an alteration in TPA/IM-stimulated AP-1/c-Jun DNA binding activity. Using the same preparations of nuclear protein from H1299 cells that were used for the experiment summarized in the legend to Fig. 1 A, we found that AP-1 binding activity was neither stimulated by TPA/IM nor inhibited by HNE (Fig. 1 B). Binding specificity was confirmed, as before, by competition with unlabeled probe and supershift with anti-AP-1 antibody (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9 and 10, respectively). The supershift in this particular experiment was relatively weak. Clearly, concentrations of HNE that completely prevent DNA binding by NF-κB have no effect on DNA binding by AP-1. To correlate HNE effects on NF-κB transactivation with DNA binding inhibition, an NF-κB-dependent, luciferase-expressing vector was employed. Twenty-two h after transient transfection with the luciferase reporter, H1299 cells were stimulated with TPA/IM or treated with HNE and TPA/IM for 6 h. Control cells were not treated with HNE or with TPA/IM. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity. TPA/IM treatment induced a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to untreated cells (Fig.2). HNE treatment suppressed the TPA/IM-induced increase in luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with 20 μm HNE providing complete suppression and higher doses decreasing luciferase activity to below unstimulated levels (Fig. 2). Thus, HNE inhibited both NF-κB DNA binding and NF-κB transcriptional activation. Parallel experiments with RKO cells produced similar results, as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. NF-κB activation requires degradation of the inhibitory protein, IκBα (26Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Consequently, HNE inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding and transactivation activities could result from the inhibition of IκBα degradation. To test this possibility, the effects of TPA/IM stimulation and HNE treatment on IκBα degradation were evaluated. Treatment of H1299 or Jurkat T cells with TPA/IM for 0–30 min at 37 °C resulted in a rapid decrease in cellular IκBα protein (Fig. 3). For H1299 cells, the reduction in the level of IκBα protein appeared maximal by 5 min, and some increase was evident by 30 min (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1–4). For Jurkat T cells, the reduction in the level of IκBα protein was detectable at 5 min, with complete disappearance evident in 20 min (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). In Jurkat cells, the TPA/IM-mediated decrease in cellular IκBα concentrations resulted from an induction of IκBα phosphorylation followed by a degradation of phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα, Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, no detectable p-IκBα was found in TPA/IM-treated H1299 cells (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–4). Pretreatment of cells with HNE prevented the TPA/IM-mediated reduction of IκBα concentration (Fig.3, A and B, lanes 5–8). In addition, HNE pretreatment completely abolished the formation of p-IκBα in Jurkat T cells. Thus, it appears likely that HNE treatment prevents IκBα degradation by inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation. IKK activity is required for IκBα phosphorylation (28Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 29Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F.

Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible mechanism to explain the inhibitory effect of HNE on TPA/IM stimulation of NF-κB activity is that HNE inhibits IKK activity. To test this possibility, Jurkat T cells, with or without a 30-min pretreatment with HNE, were stimulated with TPA/IM. Total cell extracts were prepared, and IKK activity was determined using a fusion protein of IκBα and glutathione S-transferase (IκBα-GST) as substrate. Kinase activity was evaluated by incorporation of 32P into the fusion protein substrate. Incubation of the IKK substrate with TPA/IM-stimulated cell extracts resulted in a time-dependent increase in IκBα phosphorylation (Fig.4, lanes 1–4). Pretreatment of cells with HNE significantly inhibited the formation of32P-labeled IκBα-GST. This suggests that HNE inhibition of NF-κB activation is due to inhibition of IKK activity. To clarify whether HNE inhibition of IKK activity occurs by direct interaction with IKK, anin vitro assay for HNE-mediated inhibition of IKK activity was developed. Immune complexes of IKK were precipitated, then incubated with HNE in the presence or absence of DTT for 10 min at 30 °C, and assayed for IKK activity, as shown in Fig.5. Treatment of immune complexes of IKK with HNE in the absence of DTT caused dose-dependent inhibition of IKK activity (Fig. 5 A). Addition of 30 μm HNE resulted in clear inhibition of IKK activity, and 60 μm HNE completely inhibited activity. In fact, the higher dose of HNE lowered IKK activity to below basal levels. When parallel incubations were conducted in which immune complexes were treated with HNE in the presence of an excess of the HNE scavenging agent DTT (1 mm), only a modest decline in IKK activity was detected at the higher HNE concentration. Western blots were performed to probe for the modification of IKK protein by HNE. Incubations of immune complexes of IKK with HNE produced bands that migrated more slowly than IKK as well as bands that migrated at the anticipated size for a dimer of IKK subunits (∼220 kDa) (Fig. 5 A, lower two panels, lanes 4–5). Thus, incubation mixtures of IKK with HNE contained HNE-modified IKK molecules, some of which migrated as cross-linked protein dimers. Comparison of the kinase assay bands in Fig.5 A with the Western blots in the lower panels indicates that the formation of the HNE·IKK conjugates correlated with the loss of IKK activity. When parallel incubations of immune complexes of IKK and HNE were conducted in the presence of an excess of DTT, only trace amounts of slower migrating forms of IKK were detected; no higher molecular size HNE·IKK complexes were evident on gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B, lower two panels, lanes 4–5). These results demonstrate that HNE reacts covalently with IKK, which prevents IκBα degradation and NFκB activation. In the present studies, we show that TPA/IM stimulates IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, resulting in NF-κB activation. This finding is consistent with previous observations that NF-κB activation is responsive to a wide range of activators that lead to phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (19Janssen-Heininger Y.M.

Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that pretreatment of human cancer cells or Jurkat T cells with HNE leads to the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. HNE prevents IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, reducing NF-κB DNA binding activity and NF-κB transactivation. These results are in good agreement with the findings that HNE modulates NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent proteolysis in human monocytic cells (33Page S. Fischer C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the complete process of IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation following treatment of cells with TPA/IM was only observed in Jurkat T cells. Phosphorylation of IκBα was not observed in H1299 cells even though its TPA/IM-stimulated degradation was obvious (Fig. 3). Three possibilities may explain the inability to detect p-IκBα in H1299 cells. TPA/IM-induced phosphorylation of IκBα may occur at a residue other than Ser-32 or Ser-36, so that the phosphorylated protein may not be recognized by the antibody employed in these studies. This possibility has been documented with anoxia, which stimulates phosphorylation of IκBα at Tyr-42 and NF-κB activation without proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα (34Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that activation of NF-κB in H1299 cells results from phosphorylation-independent IκBα degradation. For example, UV irradiation leads to IκBα degradation without phosphorylation in HeLa cells, 293 cells, and human fibroblasts (35Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar,36Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, the kinetics of IκBα phosphorylation and p-IκBα degradation in H1299 cells may prevent a detectable steady-state concentration of p-IκBα from accumulating. Phosphorylation of IκB requires IKK activity (22Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). IKK is a complex, which contains two catalytic subunits, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), along with a regulatory protein, IKKγ (37DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Thus, the IKK activity represented the combination of IKKα and IKKβ. A variety of stimuli modulate the signal transduction pathways that lead to activation of upstream kinases including NF-κB-inducing kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1. These kinases are responsible for phosphorylation and activation of IKK (29Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B.

A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). HNE did not inhibit any of these upstream kinases, and in fact, a brief survey indicated that it stimulated the activity of ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, and JNK2 (data not shown). This is consistent with a previous finding of stimulation of p38 kinase activity by HNE (42Uchida K. Shiraishi M. Naito Y. Torii Y. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4909-4912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The effects of HNE are directly on IKK activity and appear to result from covalent modification of IKK protein. Aspirin, salicylate, and sulindac inhibit IKKβ activity by competing for binding to ATP (43Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar,44Yamamoto Y. Yin M.J. Lin K.M. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27307-27314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), whereas anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandins inhibit NF-κB activation by covalently modifying Cys-179 on the activation loop of IKKβ, leading to substantially reduced IKKβ activity (45Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). It is well known that HNE can rapidly react with proteins containing sulfhydryl groups by Michael addition; so it is possible that HNE inhibits IKK activity by direct reaction with a cysteine residue (16Parola M. Robino G. Marra F. Pinzani M. Bellomo G. Leonarduzzi G. Chiarugi P. Camandola S. Poli G. Waeg G. Gentilini P. Dianzani M.U. J. Clin.

To test this possibility, we conducted an in vitroassay to assess the effect of HNE on IKK activity and protein modification. Our results demonstrated that HNE induced the loss of IKK activity concomitant with the formation of higher molecular size forms of IKK (Fig. 5 A). A prominent band was detected at a molecular size corresponding to cross-linked homodimers or heterodimers of IKK subunits. The higher molecular size band on SDS-PAGE gels reacted with antibodies specific for IKKα and with antibodies specific for a Michael addition product of HNE with protein residues. This is consistent with the formation of an HNE-mediated cross-link of IKK protein subunits. The activation domains of IKKα or IKKβ are believed to be located in close proximity to each other in the IKK complex, which might place the cysteine residues of the two activation domains close enough to enable cross-link formation (22Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 45Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The importance of the reaction of HNE with cysteine residues is suggested by the observation that treatment with DTT inhibited HNE-induced cross-link formation and loss of enzyme activity. DTT is a dithiol that is used as a reducing agent to protect free protein thiols from oxidation; it is commonly added to enzyme assays or purification buffers for this purpose. DTT also reacts with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds such as HNE. Its inclusion in the present experiments abolished modification and inhibition of IKK in cell-free extracts. We believe this accounts for previous reports that HNE does not inhibit IKK activity (33Page S. Fischer C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Neumeier D.

We demonstrate here that the key target in HNE modification of NF-κB activity is IKK. Inhibition of IKK activity by this major product of lipid peroxidation occurs through covalent modification of the constituent proteins. Because NF-κB stimulates transcription in response to oxidative stress, HNE modification may limit the magnitude of this transcriptional response. A similar role was recently proposed for 15-deoxyprostaglandin J2, which is a decomposition product of prostaglandin D2, a product of arachidonic acid metabolism in inflammatory cells (45Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 47Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a related reaction with IKK may account for the previously noted inhibition of NF-κB by acrolein (48Li L. Hamilton Jr., R.F. Holian A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L550-L557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNE is structurally related to 15-deoxyprostaglandin J2 and acrolein, because it contains an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound capable of reacting as a bifunctional electrophile. In this way, it may serve as an endogenous factor that regulates the inflammatory response associated with oxidative stress. We thank Lawrence D. Kerr for generously providing an NF-κB-dependent luciferase construct and V. Amarnath for providing HNE. We are especially grateful to Dean Ballard for very helpful discussions and to Carol Rouzer for a critical reading and editorial suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2040497595,"Island arc lavas have radium-226 excesses that extend to higher values than those observed in mid-ocean ridge or ocean island basalts. The initial ratio of radium-226 to thorium-230 is largest in the most primitive lavas, which also have the highest barium/thorium ratios, and decreases with increasing magmatic differentiation. Therefore, the radium-226 excesses appear to have been introduced into the base of the mantle melting column by fluids released from the subducting plate. Preservation of this signal requires transport to the surface arguably in only a few hundreds of years and directly constrains the average melt velocity to the order of 1000 meters per year. Thus, melt segregation and channel formation can occur rapidly in the mantle."

In contrast to endogenous opioid peptides, morphine activates the µ-opioid receptor without causing its rapid endocytosis. Recently, three novel C-terminal splice variants (MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E) of the mouse µ-opioid receptor (MOR1) have been identified. In the present study, we show that these receptors differ substantially in their agonist-selective membrane trafficking. MOR1 and MOR1C stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells exhibited phosphorylation, internalization, and down-regulation in the presence of the opioid peptide [d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) but not in response to morphine. In contrast, MOR1D and MOR1E exhibited robust phosphorylation, internalization, and down-regulation in response to both DAMGO and morphine. DAMGO elicited a similar desensitization (during an 8-h exposure) and resensitization (during a 50-min drug-free interval) of all four µ-receptor splice variants. After morphine treatment, however, MOR1 and MOR1C showed a faster desensitization and no resensitization as compared with MOR1D and MOR1E. These results strongly reinforce the hypothesis that receptor phosphorylation and internalization are required for opioid receptor reactivation thus counteracting agonist-induced desensitization.

An important mechanism of desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor domains by G protein-coupled receptor kinases or second messenger-regulated protein kinases such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or protein kinase C. After phosphorylation of the receptor, arrestins are frequently recruited to the plasma membrane, at which they facilitate endocytosis by serving as scaffolding proteins that bind to clathrin (6Ferguson S.S.

For some time it has been assumed that the rapid removal of ligand-activated receptors from the cell surface plays a major role in the receptor degradation, thus enhancing functional desensitization. Recent studies have suggested that endocytozed receptors are predominantly recycled to the cell surface in a reactivated state (8Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Semin. Cell Dev.

The rapid internalizing variant rMOR1B revealed a faster resensitization and consequently a slower desensitization as compared with rMOR1. These results clearly show that receptor recycling after internalization affects the rate of agonist-induced desensitization of the µ-opioid receptor. Interestingly, morphine, which is a highly addictive opioid, can activate µ-opioid receptors but does not induce receptor internalization (12Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Replacement of the C-tail of the µ-opioid receptor by the C-tail of the δ-opioid receptor led to a receptor chimera that is internalized after morphine treatment, indicating that the C terminus of the µ-receptor can influence the agonist selectivity of endocytosis (14Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).Recently, three novel splice variants (MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E) were identified for the mouse µ-opioid receptor (15Pan Y.X. Xu J. Bolan E. Abbadie C. Chang A. Zuckerman A. Rossi G. Pasternak G.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The differences between MOR1 and the new variants are restricted to the terminal portion of the intracellular tail (MOR1,387LENLEAETAPLP398; MOR1C,387PTLAVSVAQIFTGYPSPTHVEKPCKSCMDRGMRNLLPDDGPRQESGEGQLGR438; MOR1D, 387RNEEPSS393; and MOR1E,387KKKLDSQRGCVQHPV401). Immunohistochemical studies revealed marked differences in the regional distribution of the µ-opioid receptor splice variants in the central nervous system (16Abbadie C. Pan Y. Drake C.T. Pasternak G.W. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Abbadie C. Gultekin S.H. Pasternak G.W.

In the present study, we investigated whether these splice variants differ in their DAMGO- and morphine-induced phosphorylation, internalization, desensitization, and receptor resensitization. Our results provide strong evidence that DAMGO treatment resulted in a rapid internalization and similar desensitization and resensitization rates of all receptor splice variants, whereas after morphine treatment only the splice variants MOR1D and MOR1E showed receptor phosphorylation and internalization, a faster resensitization, and a slower desensitization as compared with MOR1 and MOR1C.DISCUSSIONAlternative splicing of the cytoplasmic tail has been observed for a number of G protein-coupled receptors including the sst2Asomatostatin receptor (20Vanetti M. Kouba M. Wang X. Vogt G. Höllt V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the D2 dopamine receptor (21Guiramand J. Montmayeur J.P. Ceraline J. Bhatia M. Borrelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7354-7358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the EP3 prostaglandin receptor (22Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and a number of serotonin receptor subtypes (23Lucas J.J. Hen R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 246-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). C-terminal splicing is thought to modulate several aspects of G protein-coupled receptor physiology, i.e. cell- and tissue-specific expression, subcellular targeting, and coupling to specific G proteins. We have shown recently that the cytoplasmic tail of the rat µ-opioid receptor undergoes alternative splicing, giving rise to two isoforms, rMOR1 and rMOR1B (24Zimprich A. Simon T. Höllt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These isoforms exhibit similar pharmacological profiles; however, they differ in agonist-induced desensitization. Specifically, the shorter isoform rMOR1B desensitized at a slower rate than the longer isoform rMOR1 (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, DAMGO-induced internalization and receptor resensitization of rMOR1B proceeded at a faster rate than that of rMOR1 (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). rMOR1B lacks only one phosphorylation site (Thr-394) compared with rMOR1. Changing this Thr-394 into alanine results in a reduction of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation and a slower DAMGO-mediated desensitization of the T394A receptor mutant (11Wolf R. Koch T. Schulz S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of Thr-394 leads to facilitated receptor internalization, enhanced resensitization, and recycling of the T394A receptor mutant (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 11Wolf R. Koch T. Schulz S. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Raulf E. Buhling F. Höllt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, length and amino acid composition of the C terminus of the µ-opioid receptor seem to play a crucial role in agonist-induced endocytosis and receptor reactivation (10Koch T. Schulz S.

Raulf E. Buhling F. Höllt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).It has been reported that individual opioid agonists differ substantially in their ability to induce receptor endocytosis. Although endogenous opioid peptides promote a rapid endocytosis of the µ-opioid receptor, the highly addictive opioid alkaloid morphine fails to stimulate receptor phosphorylation and internalization (12Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar,13Sternini C. Spann M. Anton B. Keith Jr., D.E. Bunnett N.W. von Zastrow M. Evans C. Brecha N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9241-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Interestingly, replacement of the entire µ-opioid receptor tail with the δ-opioid receptor tail results in a receptor chimera that undergoes endocytosis after morphine treatment (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated further that the µ/δ-tail swapping results in a receptor conformation that facilitates morphine-induced phosphorylation and subsequent β-arrestin binding (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Three novel splice variants, MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E, were identified recently for the mouse µ-opioid receptor, MOR1, that differ in the number of potential S/T phosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic tails (15Pan Y.X. Xu J. Bolan E. Abbadie C. Chang A. Zuckerman A. Rossi G. Pasternak G.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Instead of the Thr-394 in the very end of the MOR1 cytoplasmic tail, the C termini of MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E contain seven (Thr-388, Ser-392, Thr-398, Ser-402, Thr-404, Ser-412, and Ser-431), two (Ser-392 and Ser-393), and one (Ser-392) new potential phosphorylation sites, respectively. We therefore addressed the question of whether C-terminal splicing of the µ-opioid receptor may influence agonist selectivity of receptor phosphorylation and internalization. The µ-receptor isoforms showed similar binding profiles and functional properties compared with the MOR1 receptor when expressed in HEK 293 cells (Table I). Our immunocytochemical analysis revealed that all splice variants underwent rapid endocytosis after 30 min of DAMGO treatment, whereas after 30 min of morphine treatment only MOR1D and MOR1E showed marked receptor endocytosis (Fig. 2). MOR1 and MOR1C revealed a faster receptor desensitization under morphine compared with DAMGO treatment, whereas MOR1D and MOR1E showed similar desensitization curves in response to either morphine or DAMGO (Fig. 3,A and B). After complete desensitization, all splice variants resensitized during 50 min of DAMGO withdrawal (Fig.3 C). However, during 50 min of morphine withdrawal, only MOR1D and MOR1E but not MOR1 and MOR1C showed partial resensitization of receptor activity (Fig. 3 D). These findings suggest a model in which the rapid morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR1D and MOR1E permits accelerated resensitization and recycling of these receptors, thus conferring resistance to agonist-induced desensitization. In contrast, the morphine-desensitized MOR1 and MOR1C receptors cannot gain entrance into the endocytotic-endosomal recycling pathway and are therefore not resensitized after morphine withdrawal. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that agonist-induced endocytosis is required for the reactivation of desensitized µ-opioid receptors and hence counteracts the development of physiological drug tolerance: 1) the µ-opioid receptor no longer resensitized when receptor recycling was blocked by monensin, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), 2) the internalization rate of the µ-opioid receptor was increased in the presence of monensin (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), 3) the µ-opioid receptor desensitized faster when receptor recycling was blocked with monensin (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and 4) the µ-opioid receptor desensitized faster after blocking receptor internalization by sucrose (28Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).To delineate the mechanistic basis of these observations we carried out whole-cell phosphorylation studies for all splice variants. Previous studies have shown that morphine fails to induce intense µ-opioid receptor phosphorylation. It is believed that morphine restrains the MOR1 receptor in a conformation that is recalcitrant to phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that DAMGO mediates robust phosphorylation of all splice variants. In contrast, morphine promotes marked receptor phosphorylation only in MOR1D and MOR1E but fails to promote phosphorylation to a similar extent as DAMGO in the MOR1 and MOR1C receptor isoforms (Fig. 5). Thus, the sequence alterations of the cytoplasmic tail caused by C-terminal splicing result in a conformation that makes the morphine-activated MOR1D and MOR1E receptors accessible for G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation and permit subsequent receptor sequestration.However, we also found that morphine activates and desensitizes all four µ-opioid receptor variants. Consequently, the question arises as to which mechanisms guide the morphine-mediated desensitization of MOR1 and MOR1C. Our results show that in HEK 293 cells, morphine elicits phosphorylation of MOR1 and MOR1C to 30 and 55% of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation, respectively. It is therefore not unreasonable to speculate that partial phosphorylation of the MOR1 and MOR1C receptors elicited by morphine is sufficient to terminate signaling but not sufficient to promote receptor endocytosis (29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).After extended exposure (16 h) to DAMGO we observed a marked reduction of monomeric and dimeric forms of the MOR1 receptor (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, treatment of MOR1 with naloxone led to an increase in the amount of receptor monomers and dimers (Fig.1 B). Moreover, among the four µ-opioid receptor splice variants, only MOR1 and MOR1C form homodimers that are stable under denaturing and reducing conditions, whereas only very faint bands were detected at the expected molecular masses for the MOR1D and MOR1E dimers (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, when constitutive internalization of MOR1D and MOR1E was blocked by prolonged exposure to naloxone, MOR1D and MOR1E homodimers were readily detectable (Fig.1 C). The simplest explanation for these findings is that the DAMGO-induced internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation leads to down-regulation of the receptor proteins. On the other hand, the antagonist naloxone blocks receptor internalization and seems to stabilize opioid receptor dimers at the plasma membrane, thereby preventing monomerization and down-regulation of the receptor proteins. This conclusion is supported by the present findings that DAMGO promoted down-regulation of all four µ-opioid receptor splice variants, whereas morphine induced selectively the down-regulation of MOR1D and MOR1E but not of MOR1 or MOR1C (Fig. 4).In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that changes in the C-terminal sequence by alternative splicing determine agonist selectivity of phosphorylation and internalization of the µ-opioid receptor isoforms. We show that two splice variants, MOR1D and MOR1E, of the mouse µ-opioid receptor were rapidly phosphorylated and internalized after morphine treatment. The rapid morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR1D and MOR1E confers resistance to desensitization and permits receptor resensitization and down-regulation. In contrast, the lack of morphine-induced phosphorylation and internalization of MOR1 and MOR1C splice variants also prevents receptor resensitization and down-regulation. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that endocytosis is required for the µ-opioid receptor to enter either the endosomal recycling pathway, leading to receptor resensitization, or the lysosomal degradation pathway, leading to receptor down-regulation. Given the emerging evidence of cell- and tissue-specific expression of the four µ-opioid receptor isoforms, it is likely that C-terminal splicing may significantly modulate the development of tolerance to the various effects of morphine. Opioid receptors couple via G proteins to a variety of downstream effectors including adenylate cyclase (1Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K., Yu, L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334PubMed Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (2Burt R.P. Chapple C.R. Marshall I. Br. J.

An important mechanism of desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor domains by G protein-coupled receptor kinases or second messenger-regulated protein kinases such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or protein kinase C.

Recent studies have suggested that endocytozed receptors are predominantly recycled to the cell surface in a reactivated state (8Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that two C-terminal splice variants (rMOR1 and rMOR1B)1 of the rat µ-opioid receptor differ in their DAMGO-mediated internalization and resensitization rates (10Koch T.

Schröder H. Raulf E. Buhling F. Höllt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The rapid internalizing variant rMOR1B revealed a faster resensitization and consequently a slower desensitization as compared with rMOR1. These results clearly show that receptor recycling after internalization affects the rate of agonist-induced desensitization of the µ-opioid receptor. Interestingly, morphine, which is a highly addictive opioid, can activate µ-opioid receptors but does not induce receptor internalization (12Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Replacement of the C-tail of the µ-opioid receptor by the C-tail of the δ-opioid receptor led to a receptor chimera that is internalized after morphine treatment, indicating that the C terminus of the µ-receptor can influence the agonist selectivity of endocytosis (14Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recently, three novel splice variants (MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E) were identified for the mouse µ-opioid receptor (15Pan Y.X. Xu J. Bolan E. Abbadie C. Chang A. Zuckerman A. Rossi G. Pasternak G.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The differences between MOR1 and the new variants are restricted to the terminal portion of the intracellular tail (MOR1,387LENLEAETAPLP398; MOR1C,387PTLAVSVAQIFTGYPSPTHVEKPCKSCMDRGMRNLLPDDGPRQESGEGQLGR438; MOR1D, 387RNEEPSS393; and MOR1E,387KKKLDSQRGCVQHPV401). Immunohistochemical studies revealed marked differences in the regional distribution of the µ-opioid receptor splice variants in the central nervous system (16Abbadie C. Pan Y. Drake C.T. Pasternak G.W. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Abbadie C. Gultekin S.H. Pasternak G.W.

In the present study, we investigated whether these splice variants differ in their DAMGO- and morphine-induced phosphorylation, internalization, desensitization, and receptor resensitization. Our results provide strong evidence that DAMGO treatment resulted in a rapid internalization and similar desensitization and resensitization rates of all receptor splice variants, whereas after morphine treatment only the splice variants MOR1D and MOR1E showed receptor phosphorylation and internalization, a faster resensitization, and a slower desensitization as compared with MOR1 and MOR1C. DISCUSSIONAlternative splicing of the cytoplasmic tail has been observed for a number of G protein-coupled receptors including the sst2Asomatostatin receptor (20Vanetti M. Kouba M. Wang X. Vogt G. Höllt V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the D2 dopamine receptor (21Guiramand J. Montmayeur J.P. Ceraline J. Bhatia M. Borrelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7354-7358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the EP3 prostaglandin receptor (22Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A.

Sci. 1995; 16: 246-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). C-terminal splicing is thought to modulate several aspects of G protein-coupled receptor physiology, i.e. cell- and tissue-specific expression, subcellular targeting, and coupling to specific G proteins. We have shown recently that the cytoplasmic tail of the rat µ-opioid receptor undergoes alternative splicing, giving rise to two isoforms, rMOR1 and rMOR1B (24Zimprich A. Simon T. Höllt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These isoforms exhibit similar pharmacological profiles; however, they differ in agonist-induced desensitization. Specifically, the shorter isoform rMOR1B desensitized at a slower rate than the longer isoform rMOR1 (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, DAMGO-induced internalization and receptor resensitization of rMOR1B proceeded at a faster rate than that of rMOR1 (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). rMOR1B lacks only one phosphorylation site (Thr-394) compared with rMOR1. Changing this Thr-394 into alanine results in a reduction of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation and a slower DAMGO-mediated desensitization of the T394A receptor mutant (11Wolf R. Koch T. Schulz S.

In addition, the lack of Thr-394 leads to facilitated receptor internalization, enhanced resensitization, and recycling of the T394A receptor mutant (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E.

Thus, length and amino acid composition of the C terminus of the µ-opioid receptor seem to play a crucial role in agonist-induced endocytosis and receptor reactivation (10Koch T. Schulz S.

Although endogenous opioid peptides promote a rapid endocytosis of the µ-opioid receptor, the highly addictive opioid alkaloid morphine fails to stimulate receptor phosphorylation and internalization (12Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar,13Sternini C.

Interestingly, replacement of the entire µ-opioid receptor tail with the δ-opioid receptor tail results in a receptor chimera that undergoes endocytosis after morphine treatment (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated further that the µ/δ-tail swapping results in a receptor conformation that facilitates morphine-induced phosphorylation and subsequent β-arrestin binding (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Three novel splice variants, MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E, were identified recently for the mouse µ-opioid receptor, MOR1, that differ in the number of potential S/T phosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic tails (15Pan Y.X. Xu J. Bolan E. Abbadie C. Chang A. Zuckerman A. Rossi G. Pasternak G.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Instead of the Thr-394 in the very end of the MOR1 cytoplasmic tail, the C termini of MOR1C, MOR1D, and MOR1E contain seven (Thr-388, Ser-392, Thr-398, Ser-402, Thr-404, Ser-412, and Ser-431), two (Ser-392 and Ser-393), and one (Ser-392) new potential phosphorylation sites, respectively. We therefore addressed the question of whether C-terminal splicing of the µ-opioid receptor may influence agonist selectivity of receptor phosphorylation and internalization. The µ-receptor isoforms showed similar binding profiles and functional properties compared with the MOR1 receptor when expressed in HEK 293 cells (Table I). Our immunocytochemical analysis revealed that all splice variants underwent rapid endocytosis after 30 min of DAMGO treatment, whereas after 30 min of morphine treatment only MOR1D and MOR1E showed marked receptor endocytosis (Fig. 2). MOR1 and MOR1C revealed a faster receptor desensitization under morphine compared with DAMGO treatment, whereas MOR1D and MOR1E showed similar desensitization curves in response to either morphine or DAMGO (Fig. 3,A and B). After complete desensitization, all splice variants resensitized during 50 min of DAMGO withdrawal (Fig.3 C). However, during 50 min of morphine withdrawal, only MOR1D and MOR1E but not MOR1 and MOR1C showed partial resensitization of receptor activity (Fig. 3 D). These findings suggest a model in which the rapid morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR1D and MOR1E permits accelerated resensitization and recycling of these receptors, thus conferring resistance to agonist-induced desensitization. In contrast, the morphine-desensitized MOR1 and MOR1C receptors cannot gain entrance into the endocytotic-endosomal recycling pathway and are therefore not resensitized after morphine withdrawal. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that agonist-induced endocytosis is required for the reactivation of desensitized µ-opioid receptors and hence counteracts the development of physiological drug tolerance: 1) the µ-opioid receptor no longer resensitized when receptor recycling was blocked by monensin, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), 2) the internalization rate of the µ-opioid receptor was increased in the presence of monensin (10Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), 3) the µ-opioid receptor desensitized faster when receptor recycling was blocked with monensin (10Koch T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and 4) the µ-opioid receptor desensitized faster after blocking receptor internalization by sucrose (28Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).To delineate the mechanistic basis of these observations we carried out whole-cell phosphorylation studies for all splice variants. Previous studies have shown that morphine fails to induce intense µ-opioid receptor phosphorylation. It is believed that morphine restrains the MOR1 receptor in a conformation that is recalcitrant to phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that DAMGO mediates robust phosphorylation of all splice variants. In contrast, morphine promotes marked receptor phosphorylation only in MOR1D and MOR1E but fails to promote phosphorylation to a similar extent as DAMGO in the MOR1 and MOR1C receptor isoforms (Fig. 5). Thus, the sequence alterations of the cytoplasmic tail caused by C-terminal splicing result in a conformation that makes the morphine-activated MOR1D and MOR1E receptors accessible for G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation and permit subsequent receptor sequestration.However, we also found that morphine activates and desensitizes all four µ-opioid receptor variants. Consequently, the question arises as to which mechanisms guide the morphine-mediated desensitization of MOR1 and MOR1C. Our results show that in HEK 293 cells, morphine elicits phosphorylation of MOR1 and MOR1C to 30 and 55% of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation, respectively. It is therefore not unreasonable to speculate that partial phosphorylation of the MOR1 and MOR1C receptors elicited by morphine is sufficient to terminate signaling but not sufficient to promote receptor endocytosis (29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).After extended exposure (16 h) to DAMGO we observed a marked reduction of monomeric and dimeric forms of the MOR1 receptor (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, treatment of MOR1 with naloxone led to an increase in the amount of receptor monomers and dimers (Fig.1 B). Moreover, among the four µ-opioid receptor splice variants, only MOR1 and MOR1C form homodimers that are stable under denaturing and reducing conditions, whereas only very faint bands were detected at the expected molecular masses for the MOR1D and MOR1E dimers (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, when constitutive internalization of MOR1D and MOR1E was blocked by prolonged exposure to naloxone, MOR1D and MOR1E homodimers were readily detectable (Fig.1 C). The simplest explanation for these findings is that the DAMGO-induced internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation leads to down-regulation of the receptor proteins. On the other hand, the antagonist naloxone blocks receptor internalization and seems to stabilize opioid receptor dimers at the plasma membrane, thereby preventing monomerization and down-regulation of the receptor proteins. This conclusion is supported by the present findings that DAMGO promoted down-regulation of all four µ-opioid receptor splice variants, whereas morphine induced selectively the down-regulation of MOR1D and MOR1E but not of MOR1 or MOR1C (Fig. 4).In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that changes in the C-terminal sequence by alternative splicing determine agonist selectivity of phosphorylation and internalization of the µ-opioid receptor isoforms. We show that two splice variants, MOR1D and MOR1E, of the mouse µ-opioid receptor were rapidly phosphorylated and internalized after morphine treatment. The rapid morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR1D and MOR1E confers resistance to desensitization and permits receptor resensitization and down-regulation. In contrast, the lack of morphine-induced phosphorylation and internalization of MOR1 and MOR1C splice variants also prevents receptor resensitization and down-regulation. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that endocytosis is required for the µ-opioid receptor to enter either the endosomal recycling pathway, leading to receptor resensitization, or the lysosomal degradation pathway, leading to receptor down-regulation. Given the emerging evidence of cell- and tissue-specific expression of the four µ-opioid receptor isoforms, it is likely that C-terminal splicing may significantly modulate the development of tolerance to the various effects of morphine.

Thus, the sequence alterations of the cytoplasmic tail caused by C-terminal splicing result in a conformation that makes the morphine-activated MOR1D and MOR1E receptors accessible for G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation and permit subsequent receptor sequestration. However, we also found that morphine activates and desensitizes all four µ-opioid receptor variants. Consequently, the question arises as to which mechanisms guide the morphine-mediated desensitization of MOR1 and MOR1C. Our results show that in HEK 293 cells, morphine elicits phosphorylation of MOR1 and MOR1C to 30 and 55% of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation, respectively. It is therefore not unreasonable to speculate that partial phosphorylation of the MOR1 and MOR1C receptors elicited by morphine is sufficient to terminate signaling but not sufficient to promote receptor endocytosis (29Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). After extended exposure (16 h) to DAMGO we observed a marked reduction of monomeric and dimeric forms of the MOR1 receptor (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, treatment of MOR1 with naloxone led to an increase in the amount of receptor monomers and dimers (Fig.1 B). Moreover, among the four µ-opioid receptor splice variants, only MOR1 and MOR1C form homodimers that are stable under denaturing and reducing conditions, whereas only very faint bands were detected at the expected molecular masses for the MOR1D and MOR1E dimers (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, when constitutive internalization of MOR1D and MOR1E was blocked by prolonged exposure to naloxone, MOR1D and MOR1E homodimers were readily detectable (Fig.1 C). The simplest explanation for these findings is that the DAMGO-induced internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation leads to down-regulation of the receptor proteins. On the other hand, the antagonist naloxone blocks receptor internalization and seems to stabilize opioid receptor dimers at the plasma membrane, thereby preventing monomerization and down-regulation of the receptor proteins. This conclusion is supported by the present findings that DAMGO promoted down-regulation of all four µ-opioid receptor splice variants, whereas morphine induced selectively the down-regulation of MOR1D and MOR1E but not of MOR1 or MOR1C (Fig. 4). In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that changes in the C-terminal sequence by alternative splicing determine agonist selectivity of phosphorylation and internalization of the µ-opioid receptor isoforms. We show that two splice variants, MOR1D and MOR1E, of the mouse µ-opioid receptor were rapidly phosphorylated and internalized after morphine treatment. The rapid morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR1D and MOR1E confers resistance to desensitization and permits receptor resensitization and down-regulation. In contrast, the lack of morphine-induced phosphorylation and internalization of MOR1 and MOR1C splice variants also prevents receptor resensitization and down-regulation. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that endocytosis is required for the µ-opioid receptor to enter either the endosomal recycling pathway, leading to receptor resensitization, or the lysosomal degradation pathway, leading to receptor down-regulation. Given the emerging evidence of cell- and tissue-specific expression of the four µ-opioid receptor isoforms, it is likely that C-terminal splicing may significantly modulate the development of tolerance to the various effects of morphine.

Nine members of the dual specificity phosphatases specific for MAPKs, termed MKPs, have been reported. Each member has its own substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and subcellular localization. In this study, we have cloned and characterized a novel MKP, designated MKP-7. MKP-7 is most similar to hVH5, a member of previously known MKPs, in the primary structure. MKP-7 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm when expressed in cultured cells, whereas hVH5 is both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. MKP-7 binds to and inactivates p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK, but not ERK. Furthermore, we have found that MKPs have the substrate specificity toward the isoforms of the p38 family (α, β, γ, and δ). MKP-7 binds to and inactivates p38α and -β, but not γ or δ. MKP-5 and CL100/MKP-1 also bind to p38α and -β, but not γ or δ.

To regulate the cellular responses, the timing of the activation and inactivation of MAPKs should be strictly controlled. There are three major subgroups in the MAPK family, ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK/SAPK. ERK is activated mainly by mitogenic stimuli, whereas p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK are activated mainly by stress stimuli or inflammatory cytokines. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate several substrates, such as MAPKAPKs (MAPK-activated protein kinases) and transcription factors (1Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys.

It has been reported that the forced and sustained activation of ERK leads to oncogenic transformation of the cells (4Marshall C.J.

MAPKs are activated by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) through the phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the P-loop of the molecules. The phosphorylation of both residues is necessary and sufficient for the activation. Thus, inactivation of MAPKs can be achieved by the dephosphorylation of either the threonine residue or the tyrosine residue, or both. PP2C-type phosphatases are reported to dephosphorylate the threonine residue of p38 MAPK and inactivate it (12Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Takekawa M. Adachi M. Nakahata A. Nakayama I. Itoh F. Tsukuda H. Taya Y. Imai K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6517-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Several tyrosine phosphatases are known to dephosphorylate the tyrosine residue of ERK and p38 and inactivate them (14Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J.

They share sequence homology and are highly specific for MAPKs, but differ in the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and inducibility by extracellular stimuli (16Camps M.

Here we have identified and characterized a novel MKP, designated MKP-7. MKP-7 shows high homology with all known MKPs and shares all the features of dual specificity phosphatases. MKP-7 is most similar to hVH5 in the primary sequence. Both molecules have a C-terminal stretch, which is not present in other MKPs. MKP-7 possesses a nuclear export signal (NES) sequence in the C-terminal stretch region, which regulates the subcellular localization of the molecule. MKP-7 binds to and inactivates p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK, but not ERK. Furthermore, we show for the first time that MKPs including MKP-7 have the substrate specificity toward the isoforms of the p38 MAPK family. MKP-7 binds to and inactivates p38α and -β, but not δ or γ. CL100/MKP-1 and MKP-5 also bind to p38α and -β, but not δ or γ. Finally, we propose a tentative classification of MKPs based on their sequences of the MAPK-docking site. A Super Script human fetal brain cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a template. The vector sequence (5′-caccaaacagctatgacc-3′) and a gene specific primer (5′-gtttcgctgaatgctggatgagctc-3′) were used for the first PCR of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and the T7 primer and a gene specific primer (5′-gagctcatccagcattcagcgaaac-3′) were used for the first PCR of 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The SP6 primer and gene-specific primers (5′-gcaaccttcgcttcataagcttggagcag-3′ or 5′-ctgctccaagcttatgaagcgaaggttgc-3′) were used for nested PCR. Klentaq polymerase mix (CLONTECH) was used in PCR reactions and PCR products were subcloned into TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The full-length MKP-7 was obtained by the PCR method using Super Script human fetal brain library as a template. The primers used were 5′-agatctatggcccatgagatgattggaactc-3′ and 5′-agatcttcaggagacctcaatgatttccatgctg-3′. cDNAs encoding CL100/MKP-1 (human), MKP-3 (rat), and hVH5 (human) were kindly provided by S. Keyse, S. Arkinstall, and J. E. Dixon, respectively. They were subcloned into SRα-Myc (3X) vector. The full-length of MKP-7 was cloned into SRα-Myc (3X) vector. The deletion mutants of MKP-7 were produced by the PCR method. The primers used were 5′-agatctatggcccatgagatgattggaactc-3′ and 5′-agatctttactccaggtgcagcagcttgagtttgctc-3′ for MKP-7ΔC, and 5′-agatctaaccagactggagcatcagggcc-3′ and 5′-agatcttcaggagacctcaatgatttccatgctg-3′ for MKP-7ΔN. The catalytically inactive mutant of MKP-7ΔC, in which Cys-244 was replaced by Ser, was constructed by a PCR-based mutagenesis. The primers used were 5′-gtgttctagtgcactctttagctgggatctccc-3′ and 5′-gggagatcccagctaaagagttcactagaacac-3′. MKP-7ΔC in SRα-Myc vector was used as a template. A catalytic activity of Myc-MKP-7 towardp-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma) was measured at 37 °C. Myc-MKP-7 protein was prepared from the cells transfected with SRα-Myc-MKP-7 by immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibody (9E10). The precipitate was washed once with lysis buffer, twice with TBS, and once with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Reactions were performed for the indicated hours in 200 µl of 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm pNPP, and the indicated amounts of Myc-MKP-7 protein. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH, and pNPP hydrolyzed was measured by absorbance at 405 nm with microplate reader (Life Technologies, Inc.). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were split on 35- or 60-mm dishs at 2 × 105 or 5 × 105 cell number per dish, respectively. After 19 h, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NIH3T3 cells and COS7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged MKP-7 or Myc-tagged hVH5. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After three times wash with PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and washed with PBS three times. And then, cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and incubated with anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After three times wash with PBS, and twice with Milli-Q water, coverslips were mounted with mowiol. Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgC2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 µg/ml aprotinin). Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (about 3 × 106 cells in each sample) by incubation with 5 µg of anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz) or 5 µg of anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and protein A-Sepharose beads (25 µl) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were then washed twice with lysis buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 µg/ml aprotinin). Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (about 1 × 106 cells in each sample) by incubation with 2 µg of appropriate antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (15 µl) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Each precipitate was washed twice with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 µg/ml aprotinin), and then washed with Tris buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). The washed beads were mixed with substrates in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 µm ATP (2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP)), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and BAS 2500 (Fuji Film) after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We previously identified a member of MKP, MKP-5, and revealed its MAPK-docking site (36Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 50Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Using the primary sequence of the MAPK-docking site of MKP-5 (CADKISRRRLQQGKITV), we searched the EST cDNA bank for cDNAs encoding a protein containing a similar sequence. We identified one clone, that has a sequence CSKLMKRRLQQD. By performing the 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends/PCR method in the human fetal brain cDNA library, we obtained a 2345-base pair cDNA fragment (Fig.1 A). The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 665 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 73 kDa (Fig. 1 B). It resembles all the known MKPs. We then designated it MKP-7. In its N-terminal portion, there is a “Cdc25-like domain,” in which the two regions showing amino acid similarity to the Cdc25 phosphatase and the MAPK-docking site (CSKLMKRRLQQD) exist (Fig. 1, A andB). In the middle portion, there appears to be a phosphatase catalytic domain, in which the active site sequence VLVHCLAGISRSATIAIAYIM (residues 240–261) exists (Fig. 1, Aand B) (16Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 17Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The two amino acids, Cys-244 and Ser-231 in this motif, together with Asp-203, are likely to participate in the catalytic mechanism of dual specificity phosphatase activity (39Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MKP-7 is most similar to hVH5 (29Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Both molecules have a long C-terminal stretch which is not present in other MKPs. In the C-terminal stretch region (residues 300–665), two portions show high similality to hVH5 in the primary sequence. We named them HC1 and HC2 (highly conserved regions 1 and 2) (HC1, residues 373–406; HC2, residues 596–665) (Fig. 1, B andC). Near HC1, there is a PEST-like sequence in both MKP-7 and hVH5 (indicated as dotted box in Fig. 1 B). Near HC2, a serine-rich sequence exists (residues 552–588) (Fig.1 C). The C-terminal stretches of MKP-7 and hVH5 including both HC1 and HC2 show no sequence similarity to other proteins.Figure 1cDNA cloning of MKP-7.

Then, we determined the chromosomal location of the gene for MKP-7. The MKP-7gene localizes to human chromosome 12 between the BAC clones, RPCI11-180M15 (accession numberAC008115) and RP11–161A14 (accession number AC022276) (Fig.2, left). The organization of the exon and intron of the gene was also determined (Fig. 2,right). It is similar to that of the hVH5gene (data not shown). Different members of MKPs show different patterns of subcellular localization (16Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 17Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). We expressed Myc-tagged MKP-7 or Myc-tagged hVH5 in COS7 cells, C2C12 cells, and NIH3T3 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence with anti-Myc antibody showed that Myc-MKP-7 predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in these cells (Fig. 3 A, upper), whereas Myc-hVH5 localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3 A, lower), the pattern of which being different depending on the cell type, as previously described (29Martell K.J.

While Myc-hVH5 localized predominantly in the nucleus in COS7 cells, when expressed in C2C12 cells it showed pan-cellular distribution in some cells but nuclear localization in other cells. When expressed in NIH3T3 cells, Myc-hVH5 showed almost the same subcellular localization pattern as in C2C12 cells, although the NIH3T3 cells expressing Myc-hVH5 became small (Fig. 3 A, lower). Essentially the same results were obtained using GFP-tagged MKP-7 and hVH5 (data not shown). In the C-terminal portion of MKP-7, there are two regions (HC1 and HC2) that show high homology with hVH5 in the primary sequence, as described above (Figs. 1 A and 3 D). In HC1, there exists a putative NES sequence. Then, the cytoplasmic localization of MKP-7 in cultured cells might be caused by this putative NES sequence (Figs.1 B and 3 B). To test this idea, we constructed and expressed deletion mutants of MKP-7 and examined their subcellular localizations and the effect of leptomycin B (LMB) (a specific inhibitor of NES-mediated active nuclear export) on them in COS7 cells. While full-length MKP-7 and MKP-7ΔN (residues 300–665), in which the N-terminal portion including the phosphatase domain is deleted (see Fig. 3 D), localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, MKP-7ΔC (residues 1–317), in which the C-terminal stretch is deleted (see Fig. 3 D), localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, full-length MKP-7 and MKP-7ΔN became localized to the nucleus after treatment with LMB (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate the existence of a functional NES in the C-terminal portion of MKP-7. To narrow down a region responsible for nuclear export of MKP-7, we made several additional deletion mutants of MKP-7 and examined their subcellular localization. The obtained results summarized in Fig. 3 Dindicate that HC1 is required for the cytoplasmic localization of MKP-7. Essentially the same results were obtained by using C2C12 or NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Therefore, these results, taken together, suggest that the putative NES sequence in HC1 is functional and regulates the cytoplasmic localization of MKP-7 in cultured cells. It has been shown that docking interactions play an important role in regulating the efficiency and specificity of the enzymatic reactions in the MAPK cascades (15Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A.

We examined the docking ability of MKP-7 to the three major members of MAPKs (ERK2, p38α, and JNK2) using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. p38α and JNK2 co-immunoprecipitated well with MKP-7, but ERK2 did not (Fig.4 A). As the MAPK-docking site and the catalytic domain are both located in the N-terminal portion (see Fig. 1), the N-terminal half of the molecule was supposed to be sufficient to bind to MAPKs. We then examined the docking ability of both the N-terminal half and the C-terminal half of MKP-7 (MKP-7ΔC and MKP-7ΔN; see Fig. 3 D). MKP-7ΔC, like full-length MKP-7, co-immunoprecipitated well with p38α and JNK2, but not with ERK2 (Fig. 4 B). But, MKP-7ΔN did not co-immunoprecipitate with p38α (Fig. 4 C) or JNK2 (data not shown) even when the expression level of MKP-7ΔN was increased (Fig. 4 C). These results have clearly shown that MKP-7 specifically binds to p38α and JNK2, not to ERK2, through the N-terminal portion of the molecule. Previously, we have identified the domain on MAPKs, termed the CD domain, which is commonly utilized for binding to MAPKKs, MAPKAPKs, and MKPs (50Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 51Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To examine whether the CD domain is also utilized in the docking interactions with MKP-7, we used the CD domain-disrupted mutant of p38α (p38CDm), in which Asp-313, Asp-315, and Asp-316 in the CD domain were replaced by asparagines (50Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 51Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 D, while wild-type p38α co-precipitated well with MKP-7ΔC, p38CDm did not. Therefore, the CD domain is indispensable for the docking interaction between MKP-7 and p38 MAPK. Next, we examined the catalytic activity of MKP-7 toward MAPKs using a co-expression assay. Co-expression of full-length MKP-7 efficiently suppressed the activation of p38α or JNK2, but did not affect the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 4 E). As the expression level of full-length MKP-7 in cultured cells was too low to examine its activity in higher expression levels (compare the lower panels of Fig. 4, E and F), we used MKP-7ΔC, in which both the MAPK-docking domain and the phosphatase catalytic domain are present (see Fig. 3 D). MKP-7ΔC also efficiently inactivated p38α or JNK2, but not ERK2 (Fig. 4 F). Furthermore, MKP-7ΔC inactivated p38α or JNK2 in a dose-dependent manner, but not ERK2 (Fig.5 A). These results demonstrate that MKP-7 binds to and efficiently inactivates p38α and JNK2, but not ERK2. Thus, we can conclude that there is good correlation between the docking ability of MKP-7 to MAPKs and its enzymatic activity toward them. It is known that when a Cys residue in the catalytic active site (VXVHCXXGSRSXTXXXAYLM) is replaced by Ser, dual specificity phosphatases are converted to catalytically inactive forms. We tested whether MKP-7 was made catalytically inactive by such a mutation. As shown in Fig.5 B, the mutant form of MKP-7 (C244S) could not inactivate JNK2.Figure 5MKP-7 inactivates p38α and JNK2 efficiently. A,"

The tethered receptor complex provides a platform on which receptor tyrosine kinase and G-protein-coupled receptor signals can be integrated to produce more efficient stimulation of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. This was based on several lines of evidence. First, we have shown that pertussis toxin (which uncouples G-protein-coupled receptors from inhibitory G-proteins) reduced the platelet-derived growth factor stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Second, transfection of cells with inhibitory G-protein α subunit increased the activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase by platelet-derived growth factor. Third, platelet-derived growth factor stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the inhibitory G-protein α subunit, which was blocked by the platelet-derived growth factor kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG 1296. We have also shown that the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor forms a tethered complex with Myc-tagged endothelial differentiation gene 1 (a G-protein-coupled receptor whose agonist is sphingosine 1-phosphate) in cells co-transfected with these receptors. This facilitates platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the inhibitory G-protein α subunit and increases p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In addition, we found that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and β-arrestin I can associate with the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor. These proteins play an important role in regulating endocytosis of G-protein-coupled receptor signal complexes, which is required for activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Thus, platelet-derived growth factor β receptor signaling may be initiated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2/β-arrestin I that has been recruited to the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor by its tethering to a G-protein-coupled receptor(s). These results provide a model that may account for the co-mitogenic effect of certain G-protein-coupled receptor agonists with platelet-derived growth factor on DNA synthesis.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar). For many years it has been known that certain GPCR agonists can function as co-mitogens with growth factors to stimulate DNA synthesis. However, the molecular mechanism for this interaction has not been fully defined. It is known that both growth factors and GPCR agonists stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (SH2-containing protein) and the sequential activation of Grb-2-mSos (son of sevenless), Ras, c-Raf, MEK1, and p42/p44 MAPK. GPCR agonists also activate non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. c-Src), which function as intermediates between Gβγ subunits and Ras-dependent p42/p44 MAPK activation (2Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A significant advance in our understanding of co-mitogenicity comes from recent studies showing that certain growth factors can use classical GPCR-mediated signaling pathways to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK in mammalian cells. For instance, the insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor utilizes the G-protein, Gi, to stimulate activation of p42/p44 MAPK in fibroblasts (3Luttrell L.M. Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This was established using pertussis toxin (which uncouples G-protein-coupled receptors from Gi/o) and the C-terminal domain of β-adrenergic kinase (which sequesters Gβγ subunits), both of which reduced the IGF-1-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. These agents also reduced fibroblast growth factor-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK in fibroblasts and promoted differentiation (4Fedorov Y.V. Jone N.C. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This model has recently been supported by Hallak et al. (5Hallak H. Seller E.M. Green J.S. Ross B.N. Rubin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the IGF-1 receptor forms a complex with Giαβγ and that IGF-1 stimulates release of the G-protein βγ subunits, which can initiate activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. There are also other studies that have shown that insulin receptors can interact with Gi (6O'Brien R.M. Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Siddle K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Luttrell L.M. Kilgour E. Larner J. Romero G. J. Biol.

In addition to these findings, GRK2 and β-arrestin II are implicated in the regulation of IGF-1 and β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated endocytic signaling and activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway (9Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S.

GRK2 is activated in an agonist- and Gβγ subunit-dependent manner. β-arrestin II is a clathrin adaptor protein that is recruited to ligand-bound GPCRs that have been phosphorylated by GRK2, and this promotes dynamin II-mediated endocytosis of receptor signal complexes containing Raf-1-MEK1 for subsequent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Recent studies by Dalle et al. (12Dalle S. Ricketts W. Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have shown that IGF-1 promotes the binding of β-arrestin I to the IGF-1 receptor in adipocytes. Rakhit et al. (13Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have also shown that NGF stimulates β-arrestin I binding to a GRK2-Trk A receptor complex in PC 12 cells. In this case, GRK2/β-arrestin I appears to initiate endocytosis of Trk A signal complexes, which leads to the activation of p42/p44 MAPK in response to NGF. In recent studies, we reported that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor stimulates c-Src and p42/p44 MAPK via a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway in airway smooth muscle cells (14Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We suggested that Gi might function to recruit c-Src close to the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase for activation. PDGF also stimulates a pertussis toxin-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation of the Grb-2-associated binding protein, Gab1. This promotes the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K1a) to Gab1, which is required for dynamin II-mediated endocytic signaling to the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in response to PDGF (15Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The realization that growth factor receptors can use G-proteins to signal to p42/p44 MAPK provides a mechanism that begins to explain the co-mitogenic properties of some GPCR agonists. Thus, GPCR agonists might provide G-protein α and βγ subunits for use by growth factor receptors to produce stronger activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway and therefore DNA synthesis. Certain G-protein-coupled receptor agonists have also been shown to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation and transactivation of growth factor receptors. The subsequently phosphorylated sites on the receptor act as acceptors for the recruitment of signaling proteins, such as Grb-2, PLCγ (phospholipase C γ), and PI3K, and complex assembly to elicit mitogenic responses. For instance, lysophosphatidic acid has been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor and p185neu to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK activation in Cos-7 cells (16Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature (Lond.). 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), while angiotensin II promotes PDGF receptor transactivation in vascular smooth muscle (17Linsemen D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, this model does not adequately explain the co-mitogenicity of certain GPCR agonists with growth factors, since the transactivation of the growth factor receptor by GPCR agonist appears to be growth factor-independent. In the current paper we have used HEK 293 cells transfected with PDGFβ receptors to investigate the molecular mechanism for the involvement of Gi in regulating the transmission of signals from this receptor. We have focused on the possibility that the PDGFβ receptor might exist in a functional signaling complex with GPCRs. We have also tested this model by looking at the specific interaction between the PDGFβ receptor and EDG1 (endothelial differentiation gene 1), whose natural agonist is sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). To date, five closely related GPCRs of the EDG family (EDG1, EDG3, EDG5/AGR16/H218, EDG6, and EDG8/nrg-1) have been identified as high affinity S1P receptors (18Hla T. Macaig T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Okazaki H. Ishizaki N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14281-14286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The rationale for looking at interaction between the PDGFβ receptor and EDG1 was 2-fold. First, S1P is co-mitogenic with PDGF in airway smooth muscle cells, which predominantly express EDG1 (22Rakhit S. Conway A.-M. Tate R. Bower T. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and second Hobson et al. (23Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) showed that PDGF-stimulated cell motility is EDG1-dependent. While these authors reported the existence of cross-talk regulation between these different receptor classes, they did not establish the molecular basis of this interaction. Here we show that the PDGFβ receptor is tethered to GPCR(s) in a complex. The tethered receptor complex provides a platform on which receptor tyrosine kinase and GPCR signals can be integrated to produce more efficient regulation of downstream effector pathways. This model provides a molecular dynamic that may explain the co-mitogenic effect of GPCR agonists on PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis.

HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum. These cells were placed in MEM for 24 h before experimentation. Cultured airway smooth muscle cells were prepared and maintained as described previously (14Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem.

The medium was removed, and cells lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (1 ml) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain pepstatin, and aprotinin (all protease inhibitors were at 10 µg/ml, pH 8) for 10 min at 4 °C. The material was harvested and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 200 µl of cell lysate supernatant (equalized for protein, 0.5–1 mg/ml) was taken for immunoprecipitation with antibodies (5 µg of antibodies and 40 µl of one part immunoprecipitation buffer and one part protein A-Sepharose CL4B). After agitation for 2 h at 4 °C, the immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A (containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.1% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS), twice in buffer B (containing 10 mmHepes, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and once in buffer B without Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitates were then combined with boiling sample buffer containing 62 mm-Tris HCl, pH 6.7, 1.25% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3.75% (v/v) mercaptoethanol and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Cells (airway smooth muscle cells or PDGFβ receptor-transfected HEK 293) were quiesced overnight before preincubation for 1 h in serum-free medium supplemented with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml). Incubations, in the presence and absence of PDGF (10 ng/ml) were initiated by replacing the medium with that containing [3H]sphingosine (2.22 × 105 dpm/well). After 3 min, the medium was removed, and the cells harvested into 0.5 ml ice-cold methanol. Lipids were extracted by vortexing in the presence of an equal volume of chloroform. [3H]S1P was isolated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel G60 plates developed with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (25:10:1:2, v/v). A [32P]S1P standard was run in parallel. [3H]S1P, which co-migrated with the S1P standard, was measured by scintillation counting of appropriate sections of silica that were excised from the plate. Vector transfected HEK 293 cells exhibit a PDGFβ receptor null background. Thus, endogenous PDGFβ receptor was not detected on Western blots probed with anti-PDGFβ receptor antibodies (Fig.1a), and PDGF did not stimulate the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in vector-transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1 b). This provides an ideal cell model system for transfection with recombinant PDGFβ receptors to study the involvement of GPCR(s) in regulating PDGFβ receptor signaling. Overexpression of recombinant PDGFβ receptor (Rm= 180 kDa) in PDGFβ receptor-transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-PDGFβ receptor antibody (Fig.1 a). Moreover, PDGF induced a robust activation of p42/p44 MAPK in these cells, a response that was abolished by the PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG 1296 (Fig. 1 b). In general we found that the extent to which p42 MAPK was phosphorylated in response to PDGF exceeded that of p44 MAPK, which on some Western blots was barely detectable. Several lines of evidence suggest that the PDGFβ receptor uses a classical GPCR signaling pathway to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK in PDGFβ receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells. Thus, pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, which uncouples GPCRs from Gi/o,substantially reduced the PDGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig. 2a). The specificity of action of pertussis toxin was established by results showing that the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by the Gi/oreceptor agonist, thrombin, was also reduced by pretreating cells with this toxin (Fig. 2 b), while the response to EGF, which does not use Gi/o to signal, was unaffected (Fig.2 b). Pertussis toxin did not increase basal cAMP (data not shown), which in some cases can block (via protein kinase A) growth factor-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation. Because pertussis toxin is an inhibitor of Giα signaling, we tested the effect of transfecting cells with recombinant Giα on the PDGF-dependent stimulation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. Fig. 2 c (upper panels) shows that the overexpression of recombinant Giα markedly increased the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by PDGF. This reflects more efficient downstream signaling from the PDGFβ receptor because recombinant Giα was without effect on PDGFβ receptor expression (Fig. 2 d) and reduced PDGFβ receptor auto-phosphorylation (Fig. 2 d). Studies to delineate the mechanism by which Giα potentiates the PDGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK were performed. These results show that both endogenous and recombinant Giα were basally tyrosine-phosphorylated in PDGFβ-transfected cells and that PDGF induced an increase in their tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 c, lower panels). Tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant Giα migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 40-kDa protein. Two lines of evidence were used to identify Giα. First, endogenous Giα co-migrated with recombinant protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Second, tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous Giα was immunoprecipitated by anti-Giα antibodies (Fig. 2 e). These results show that only a small fraction of the recombinant Giα is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF but that this is sufficient to increase p42/p44 MAPK activation in response to this growth factor. The pretreatment of cells with the PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG 1296, reduced the PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Giα (Fig. 2 f), suggesting that the PDGFβ receptor kinase might catalyze the phosphorylation of this G-protein. The concentration range of tyrphostin AG 1296 that was inhibitory (1–5 µm) was the same as that which inhibits PDGF receptor kinase activity and PDGF-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation (14Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results are compatible with a model in which an endogenous ligand-bound GPCR(s) releases Giα from the αβγ heterotrimeric G-protein complex for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by the PDGFβ receptor kinase. The efficiency of this process could be greatly increased by proximity-induced effects if the PDGFβ receptor was tethered in a complex with the GPCR. To test the model, we investigated whether the recombinant forms of the PDGFβ receptor and the GPCR EDG1 (whose natural agonist is S1P) form a functional signaling complex in HEK 293 cells. The overexpression of recombinant EDG1 was demonstrated by a more robust stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK in response to S1P compared with that observed in vector-transfected cells (Fig.3a). The evidence that the PDGFβ receptors and EDG1 form a complex was obtained from results showing that PDGFβ receptor and Myc-tagged EDG1 were co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-Myc antibodies (Fig.3 b) or anti-PDGFβ receptor antibodies (Fig.3 c). Neither PDGF nor S1P stimulated an increase in the amount of each receptor in the complex. Controls were included to show that the PDGFβ receptor was not co-immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc tag antibodies when PDGFβ receptor plasmid construct was omitted from the co-transfection (Fig. 3 b), while Myc-tagged EDG1 was not co-immunoprecipitated using anti-PDGFβ receptor antibodies when Myc-tagged EDG1 plasmid construct was omitted from the co-transfection (Fig. 3 c). Consistent with a model in which GPCR(s) release Giα for tyrosine phosphorylation by the PDGFβ receptor kinase, we found that PDGF induced a stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα (Fig. 2 c, lower panels) and a more robust activation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig. 2, a andc, upper panels, Fig. 3 d) in cells co-transfected with PDGFβ receptor and EDG1 versus PDGFβ receptor alone. This response remained sensitive to pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 a). We have excluded the possibility that the improved effect of PDGF was due to an EDG1-induced increase in the expression (Fig. 1 a) or tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown) of recombinant PDGFβ receptor. Furthermore, PDGF did not stimulate p42/p44 MAPK in cells transfected with EDG1 alone (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the formation of the EDG1-PDGFβ receptor improves the efficiency of PDGFβ receptor signaling to p42/p44 MAPK. It is also important to note that PDGF did not increase S1P synthesis/release in these cells (Fig.4), thereby excluding the possibility that S1P might function as an autocrine to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK activation by binding to recombinant EDG1 receptors. However, we do not exclude this as a possible mechanism in other cell types. As a positive control, we have shown that PDGF stimulated S1P formation in airway smooth muscle cells, measured after 3 min cell stimulation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the pretreatment withdl-threo-dihydrosphingosine at a concentration (1 µm) that inhibits sphingosine kinase (23Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), an enzyme that catalyzes S1P formation, did not reduce PDGF-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation in PDGFβ receptor/EDG1-transfected cells or exogenous S1P stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK in cells overexpressing EDG1 alone (Fig. 5). We confirmed that the concentration of dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine was effective at inhibiting sphingosine kinase by showing that this inhibitor prevented PDGF-stimulated S1P formation in airway smooth muscle cells (Fig. 4).Figure 5The lack of effect ofdl-threo-dihydrosphingosine on PDGF - and S1P-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with PDGFβ receptor and/or EDG1 plasmid constructs. Transfected HEK 293 cells were pretreated with and withoutdl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (1 µm, 10 min), prior to stimulation with PDGF (10 ng/ml, 10 min) or S1P (5 µm, 10 min).

The involvement of GRK2 and β-arrestin I might be explained by the binding of these proteins to a growth factor receptor-GPCR complex. Several lines of evidence support this model. Using cells transfected with recombinant forms of PDGFβ receptor and GRK2 (Rm= 85 kDa), we show that both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-PDGFβ receptor antibodies (Fig. 6a), suggesting that these proteins form a complex. The stimulation of cells with PDGF or S1P did not increase the amount of GRK2 associated with the PDGFβ receptor (Fig. 6 a). Less than 1% of the total GRK2 present in the anti-PDGFβ receptor immunoprecipitates was endogenous GRK2. This was evidenced by residual binding of GRK2 in anti-PDGFβ receptor immunoprecipitates from cells where recombinant GRK2 plasmid construct had been omitted from the co-transfection (Fig.6 b). As with recombinant GRK2, the stimulation of cells with PDGF did not increase the association between endogenous GRK2 and the PDGFβ receptor. Using cells transfected with recombinant forms of PDGFβ receptor and β-arrestin I (Rm= 55 kDa), we show that β-arrestin I can also be co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-PDGFβ receptor antibodies (Fig. 6 c). In common with GRK2, we found that stimulation of cells with PDGF did not induce further association of recombinant β-arrestin I with the PDGFβ receptor (Fig.6 c). We also detected residual endogenous β-arrestin I (<1% of recombinant β-arrestin I) in the anti-PDGF immunoprecipitates. Treatment of cells with PDGF did not increase β-arrestin I association with the PDGFβ receptor (Fig.6 c). Using cells transfected with Myc-tagged EDG1 and recombinant GRK2, we show that both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-Myc tag antibodies (Fig. 6 d), suggesting that these proteins also form a complex. The stimulation of cells with S1P did not increase the amount of recombinant GRK2 associated with Myc-tagged EDG1 (Fig. 6 d). However, the treatment of cells with S1P stimulated an increase in the association of recombinant β-arrestin I with Myc-tagged EDG1 (Fig. 6 e). The presence of endogenous GRK2 and β-arrestin I in anti-Myc-tagged immunoprecipitates could not be detected, possibly as the amounts of these proteins may be below the level of detection (Fig. 6,d and e). Certain growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases can use classical GPCR-mediated signaling pathways to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK in mammalian cells. It is therefore possible that these growth factor receptors might exist in functional signaling complexes with GPCRs. Here, we provide evidence to show that the PDGFβ receptor is tethered to an endogenous GPCR(s) and to recombinant EDG1 in HEK 293 cells. The tethered receptor complex provides a platform on which receptor tyrosine kinase and GPCR signals can be integrated to produce more efficient regulation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. This involves (i) tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα, possibly catalyzed by the PDGFβ receptor kinase and (ii) the association of GRK2/β-arrestin I with the PDGFβ receptor. There are reports that show that Giα is also a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation by another growth factor receptor, the insulin receptorin vitro (6O'Brien R.M. Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Siddle K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Krupinski J. Rajaram R. Lakonishok M. Benovic J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12333-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the PDGFβ receptor can use Giα to signal to the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in HEK 293 cells. First, pertussis toxin reduced the PDGF stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK. Second, transfection of cells with recombinant Giα increased the activation of p42/p44 MAPK by PDGF. Third, PDGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα. These results are compatible with a model in which an unidentified ligand-bound GPCR(s) releases Giα from the αβγ heterotrimeric G-protein complex for tyrosine phosphorylation by the PDGFβ receptor kinase. Indeed, the inhibitory effect of pertussis toxin on the PDGF stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK is consistent with the established effect of this toxin on GPCR signaling. This is to prevent ligand-bound GPCRs from activating inhibitory G-proteins. Therefore, the mode of action of pertussis toxin suggests involvement of a GPCR, particularly as there is no evidence that the PDGFβ receptor can directly activate G-protein αβγ complexes. The supply of Giα to the PDGFβ receptor kinase suggests that the GPCR is either tethered to or is in close association with the PDGFβ receptor. The results showing the presence of Myc-tagged EDG1-PDGFβ receptor complexes in transfected HEK 293 cells suggest that the former possibility is more likely. Evidence that Giα is involved in the PDGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK was based upon the fact that transfection of cells with recombinant Giα potentiated p42/p44 MAPK activation by this growth factor. Moreover, this could be directly correlated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα. We also noted that recombinant and endogenous Giα were basally tyrosine-phosphorylated in PDGFβ receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells. This is not unexpected, as there is substantial PDGFβ receptor kinase activity in unstimulated cells (indicated by the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor) to support basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα. However, it is important to note that the basally tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant Giα does not induce activation of p42/p44 MAPK on its own. Therefore, the potentiating effect of recombinant Giα on the PDGF-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation may require the PDGF-induced recruitment to tyrosine-phosphorylated Giα of other intermediates involved in the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. We also found that overexpression of recombinant Giα reduced PDGF receptor auto-phosphorylation consistent with substrate competition between specific phosphotyrosine sites on the PDGFβ receptor and Giα for the kinase. The fact that overexpression of recombinant Giα reduced PDGFβ receptor tyrosine phosphorylation provides further evidence to support our proposal that Giα interacts with the PDGFβ receptor kinase. It also is significant that the stimulatory effect of overexpressing recombinant Giα on the PDGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK occurs in the face of reduced PDGFβ receptor autophosphorylation. This suggests that the PDGFβ receptor uses the Gi signaling pathway as a major route for regulating p42/p44 MAPK in HEK 293 cells. Indeed, this is supported by other results reported here, which show that inactivation of endogenous Giα signaling by pertussis toxin reduced the PDGF stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by ∼90% in these cells. A major finding confirming our proposal was obtained by data showing that the PDGFβ receptor can exist in a tethered complex with Myc-tagged EDG1 in cells co-transfected with these receptors. There is one other example of growth factor receptor tethering to a GPCR. This was shown for the insulin and β-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes (25Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Wang H. Doronin S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36086-36093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These authors showed that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of the β-adrenergic receptor on Tyr-350 and this promotes the binding of the insulin receptor via Grb-2, which serves to tether the two receptors. Moreover, the integrity of the insulin receptor-Grb-2-β-adrenergic receptor complex is critical for β-adrenergic agonist amplification of insulin-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Therefore, we suggest that the purpose of tethering the PDGFβ receptor with a GPCR is to improve the efficiency of PDGFβ receptor signaling, possibly via proximity-induced effects. This is borne out experimentally where we show that PDGF induced a stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα and a more robust activation of p42/p44 MAPK in cells transfected with both PDGFβ receptor and EDG1 compared with PDGFβ receptor alone. We consider these studies to be very important in identifying novel signaling platforms. It is also possible that endogenous PDGF receptors form complexes with endogenous GPCRs in other cells types, such as airway smooth muscle cells. This is based upon data showing that pertussis toxin abolished PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3K-Gab1 association, and dynamin II binding to Grb-2 (15Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and reduced the PDGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK by ∼50% (14Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effect of recombinant EDG1 on PDGFβ receptor signaling was not a consequence of its binding S1P released from cells in response to PDGF but is instead probably due to constitutive activation of EDG1. Indeed, it is a common feature of recombinant GPCRs that they are often constitutively activated when expressed in cells. Moreover, others have shown this to be the case for EDG1, EDG3, and EDG5. These authors showed that when these receptors are overexpressed they form active complexes with G-proteins α subunits (27Windh R.T. Lee M.-J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 28Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K.-L. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanada T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23940-23947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We have excluded a role for released S1P based on the following. First, we were unable to detect S1P formation in response to PDGF in PDGFβ receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells. Second, the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine, had no effect on PDGF-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation in PDGFβ receptor/EDG1 co-transfected cells. However, we do not exclude the possibility that released S1P could act via tethered EDG1-PDGFβ receptors in other cells types. We also found that GRK2/β-arrestin I can associate with the PDGFβ-receptor. The stimulation of cells with PDGF did not increase the amount of either protein in the receptor complex, suggesting that the PDGFβ receptor-GRK2-β-arrestin I complex is preformed. These data again support the possibility that GRK2 and β-arrestin I are bound to an endogenous ligand-GPCR(s) that is tethered with the PDGFβ receptor. This is a plausible explanation given that the PDGFβ receptor does not have binding sites for GRK2 and β-arrestin I. We surmise that the putative GPCR is ligand-bound based upon the fact that GRK2 and β-arrestin I association with GPCRs is dependent upon free Gβγ activation released upon ligand binding to the GPCR. In addition, the finding that PDGF did not stimulate further association of these proteins with the PDGFβ receptor suggest to us that this growth factor receptor cannot itself induce Gαβγ dissociation and that PDGF does not stimulate release of the putative GPCR ligand from these cells. GRK2 and β-arrestin I play an important role in regulating endocytosis of GPCR signal complexes, which is required for activation of p42/p44 MAPK. In this regard, we have previously shown that endocytosis of PDGF receptor signal complexes is also required for p42/p44 MAPK activation and that this is G-protein-regulated in airway smooth muscle cells (14Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that endocytosis of PDGFβ receptor-signal complexes may be initiated by GRK2/β-arrestin I that have been recruited to the PDGFβ receptor by its tethering to GPCR(s). This possibility is currently under investigation in our laboratory. The model proposed here for the interaction of the PDGFβ receptor with GRK2/β-arrestin I appears to be slightly different from that reported for two other growth factor receptors where binding of β-arrestin I is apparently growth factor-dependent. First, Dalle et al. (12Dalle S. Ricketts W. Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) showed that IGF-1 uses Gβγ subunits to stimulate the binding of β-arrestin I to the IGF-1 receptor in adipocytes. These authors also showed that IGF-1 induced Gβγ subunits dissociation and stimulated binding of Giα to the IGF-1 receptor. These workers therefore proposed that the IGF-1 receptor uses both G-protein subunits to promote signal transduction. Second, we have shown that the NGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK can be potentiated in PC 12 cells transfected with GRK2 or β-arrestin I (13Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). GRK2 is preassociated with the Trk A receptor, while NGF stimulates the pertussis toxin-sensitive binding of β-arrestin I to the Trk A receptor-GRK2 complex. However, in the light of the current findings in this article, there is a need to establish whether these growth factor receptors are also tethered to GPCRs and whether they elicit release of the corresponding GPCR ligand, which may in turn trigger binding of β-arrestin I to the GPCR within the putative complex with growth factor receptor. We also found that GRK2 and β-arrestin I are associated with recombinant EDG1, thereby providing further evidence that this receptor may be constitutively active when overexpressed. However, recombinant EDG1 appears to be capable of further activation based upon the fact that S1P induces an increase in the binding of β-arrestin I and can stimulate activation of p42/p44 MAPK. This is in line with current thinking where it is proposed that receptors can exist in different receptor-G-protein conformations and that ligands induce a more productive conformation in terms of efficacy. Thus, S1P may convert recombinant EDG1 from a partially constitutively activated conformation to one that is capable of stimulating further Gβγ release and binding of β-arrestin I. In conclusion, growth factor receptor-GPCR complexes provide a platform for integrating signals from these different receptor classes. This represents a mechanistic model that may account for the co-mitogenic effect of GPCR agonists with growth factors. More specifically, our proposed model provides a mechanism that may account for the recent findings of Hobson et al. (23Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) who showed that PDGF-stimulated cell motility is EDG1-dependent. Thus, S1P released from cells (not HEK 293 cells) in response to PDGF could act back on EDG1-PDGFβ receptor complexes to induce more efficient downstream stimulation of effector pathways in response to PDGF. This might be specific to certain cell types where S1P functions as an autocrine with PDGF. The findings in the current study break the conventional paradigm for growth factor receptor signaling and strengthen an emerging model that such receptors can use GPCR-mediated pathways to stimulate p42/p44 MAPK. Future goals will be to identify the structural determinants that govern the interaction between the PDGFβ receptor and GPCRs."

We have studied how the m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap structure affects the activity of PARN. It is shown that the cap has four distinct effects: (i) It stimulates the rate of deadenylation if providedin cis; (ii) it inhibits deadenylation if provided at high concentration in trans; (iii) it stimulates deadenylation if provided at low concentration in trans; and (iv) it increases the processivity of PARN when provided in cis. It is shown that the catalytic and cap binding sites on PARN are separate. The important roles of the 7-methyl group and the inverted guanosine residue of the cap are demonstrated. An active deadenylation complex, consisting of the poly(A)-tailed RNA substrate and PARN, has been identified. Complex formation does not require a cap structure on the RNA substrate. The multiple effects of cap are all accounted for by a simple, kinetic model that takes the processivity of PARN into account.

In yeast, it acts in synergy with the mRNA cap structure to stimulate initiation of translation. This requires a specific interaction between the poly(A) binding protein (PABP)1 and the eIF4G factor of the eIF4F complex, where eIF4E interacts with the cap (reviewed in Refs. 1Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 2Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Sachs A.B. Varani G.

Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The major pathway of mRNA degradation in yeast, i.e. the deadenylation-dependent pathway, is initiated by degradation of the poly(A) tail (5Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). When less than 10 adenosine residues remain, the decapping enzyme Dcp1 and associated factors remove the mRNA cap structure (6Boeck R. Lapeyre B. Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell.

Taken together, it is believed that the poly(A) tail through its interaction in cis with the cap structure controls gene expression both at the level of initiation of translation and during mRNA decay. The poly(A) tail plays most likely similar roles in mammalian cells (e.g. Refs. 12Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), although there is less experimental evidence than for yeast. The recent development of in vitro mRNA decay systems based on mammalian cell free extracts is a significant achievement (14Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) can now be studied at the molecular level. Poly(A) tail synthesis and degradation have been extensively studied in eukaryotic systems. Although poly(A) tail synthesis is now comparatively well understood (reviewed in Refs. 21Wahle E. Ruegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism behind poly(A) removal has remained obscure. Some nuclease activities that degrade poly(A) have been found (23–27, reviewed in Refs.28Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ross J. Microbiol.

Biol. 1997; 16: 199-220Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and among these the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) has been particularly well studied. PARN was initially described as a poly(A)-specific 3′ exonuclease in HeLa cell free extracts (23Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A.

Recently, PARN was purified to apparent homogeneity and cloned (32Körner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol.

It was shown that its enzymatic activity in calf thymus cell free extracts is either associated with a 74-kDa polypeptide (32Körner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 33Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or with a 54-kDa fragment thereof (34Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Also in Xenopusoocytes, two isoforms of PARN, 74 and 62 kDa in molecular sizes, have been identified (33Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The two isoforms differ in nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution, the 74-kDa form being exclusively nuclear while the 62-kDa form is cytoplasmic (33Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). So far it is not known how the subcellular localization of PARN is regulated, although it appears likely that proteolytic cleavage of PARN could play a role. In support of this, a putative nuclear localization signal has been found in the C-terminal part of 74-kDa PARN, a region that is absent in the 54-kDa PARN fragment. 2J. Martı̂nez, Y.-G. Ren, P. Nilsson, M. Ehrenberg, and A. Virtanen, unpublished observation. Active PARN is oligomeric, highly processive, and stimulated by the presence of an m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap structure at the 5′-end of the RNA substrate (19Gao M. Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The interaction between PARN and the cap structure at the 5′-end of an mRNA affects mRNA decay and most likely also initiation of translation; therefore, it is fundamental for the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. In this report we have studied how the cap affects the activity of the 54-kDa PARN fragment, and four different effects have been identified. First, cap stimulates deadenylation when provided in cis. When provided in trans it inhibits deadenylation at high concentration but stimulates deadenylation at low concentration. Finally, cap amplifies the processivity of poly(A) degradation by PARN. How cap affects PARN activity is interpreted in a simple kinetic model that takes the processivity of the enzyme into account. RNA substrates L3(A30) non capped or capped at the 5′-end with m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G or G(5′)ppp(5′)G, and L3(A5) non capped or capped at the 5′-end with m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T3 RNA polymerase (Stratagene 600111) and plasmids pT3-L3 (A30) or pT3-L3(A5) (23Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) digested with NsiI, as DNA template. Plasmid pT3-L3(A5) is identical to plasmid pT3-L3(A30) with the exception of the number of inserted A residues (i.e. 5 versus 30 residues). RNA substrate was labeled either in its 54-nucleotide-long body or in its poly(A) tail by inclusion of radioactively labeled mononucleotides (UTP and ATP, respectively) during in vitro transcription as previously outlined (23Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18154-18159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific radioactivities of the included radioactive mononucleotides were 40 Ci/mmol in the transcription mixture for body labeling or 5 Ci/mmol in the transcription mixture for poly(A) tail labeling. Transcribed RNA was purified according to Moore and Sharp (36Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The following conditions were used forin vitro deadenylation: 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2.5% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma Chemical Co., P-8136, M r 10,000), 100 mm KCl, 0.15 unit of RNA guard, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5–1200 fmol of RNA substrate (equivalent to 0.25–60 nm), and indicated amounts of homogeneously purified 54-kDa PARN fragment isolated from calf thymus (34Martinez J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or, when indicated, recombinant 54-kDa PARN fragment, purified as described below. The RNA substrates were radioactively labeled as indicated. The reaction volume was 24 µl, and the incubations were performed at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated, and their products were analyzed either by purification of the RNA and subsequent electrophoreses in 10 or 15% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 19:1, v/v)/7 m urea gels as previously described (23Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18154-18159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by one-dimensional TLC analysis (see below). Inhibition of deadenylation activity was done by addition of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G or G(5′)ppp(5′)G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to in vitro deadenylation reactions. Deadenylation activity was quantified as follows: L3(A30) RNA substrate labeled by inclusion of [α-32P]ATP during in vitro transcription was incubated in conditions for in vitro deadenylation as described above with the addition of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using 0.75 mKH2PO4, pH 3.5 (H3PO4), as the solvent. The resulting polyethyleneimine cellulose F plate (Merck, number 5579) was dried and scanned by a 400 S PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The fraction of released [32P]AMP was determined. Knowing the specific activity of [32P]AMP in the RNA substrate, the amount of released AMP was calculated. One unit of deadenylation activity was defined as the release of 1 µmol of AMP/min. Deadenylation reactions were carried out as described above. After incubation, samples were placed on ice and incubated 15 min in the presence of 500 ng/µl (final concentration) of heparin. Samples (6 µl) were immediately loaded on native polyacrylamide gels (1× TBE buffer, 3.5% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (79:1, v/v), agarose 0.5%) pre-run for 30 min at 100 V at 4 °C. After electrophoreses, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min, transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, and dried in a Bio-Rad gel dryer for 1 h. The gels were finally exposed, scanned, and quantified by a 400 S PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Elution of ES complexes from native polyacrylamide gels was done by cutting the region of the gel containing the complex and extracting the RNA by rotation over night at 4 °C in a buffer containing 0.5 m NH4OAc, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The eluted RNA was precipitated in ethanol, collected by centrifugation, and fractionated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HeLa cells poly(A) mRNA was prepared using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 54-kDa fragment of PARN was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using a First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) followed by PCR with the following oligonucleotides: (5′) 5′-TCGCATATGGAGATAATCAGGAGCA-3′, containing the NdeI restriction site, and (3′) 5′-CGTGGATCCTCAGTTACCAAAGGCACTGAA-3′, containing the BamHI restriction site. The obtained PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The inserted fragment, between the NdeI and BamHI sites, was purified and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pET 33 (Novagen). The obtained plasmid was finally transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) to express the recombinant protein. Colonies were grown over night at 37 °C with agitation in TB medium containing kanamycin, 50 µg/ml. The cultures were diluted (1:16) in the same medium and grown at 37 °C to reach 1 OD, and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). After 1.5 h of induction, the cells were harvested and the expressed soluble protein was purified using a TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) following the instructions from the manufacturer. We assume steady-state kinetics, meaning that the partitioning of the enzyme between its different states (in Fig. 7B, below) remains unchanged with time. Such conditions, commonly used in Michaelis-Menten kinetics carried out in vitro, can be obtained when the enzyme concentration is very small in relation to the initial substrate concentration Sn, when back reactions from intermediates and final product are negligible and when a single enzyme molecule has processed several substrates so that initial phase relations are lost. Such conditions are fulfilled for the experiments in Fig. 3and Table Ibelow. The processivity model has been used to interpretK m and V max values obtained for the experiments described therein. For the experiments in Fig. 4, where the hydrolytic reaction goes to completion, a more elaborate kinetic analysis is necessary, where inflows to the enzyme over all intermediate steps as well as product rebinding must be taken into account. This situation defies analytic solutions and must be treated numerically. For the scheme in Fig. 7 B the following steady-state relations can be derived for the rate of production of free adenosines A by putting up flow relations for all the steps in the scheme and taking conservation of mass into account,Figure 3Lineweaver-Burk plots showing that m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G and G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogues are non-competitive inhibitors of PARN. Different concentrations, as indicated, of the m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped L3(A30) RNA substrate, radioactively labeled in its poly(A) tail, were incubated for 30 min under standard conditions for in vitro deadenylation using 0.04 ng of 54-kDa PARN fragment in a total reaction volume of 10 µl. The reactions were performed in the absence or in the presence of (A) m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogue at 0 (open squares), 0.5 (open triangles), 3 (cross), and 10 µm (open circles) or (B) G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogue at 0 (filled squares), 50 µm (filled triangles), 200 µm(encircled crosses), and 500 µm (filled circles). The release of radioactively labeled 5′-AMP was monitored by the one-dimensional TLC assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reciprocal initial velocities of AMP release is plotted versus 1/[RNA substrate].

Accordingly, q n is the probability that PARN removes all adenosines from a poly(A) tail with n bases without falling off. S i is a substrate with a poly(A) tail containing i adenosines. E 0 is the total enzyme amount. The derivation is for initial enzyme kinetics, where S n dominates over substrates with smaller poly(A) tails (S i for i smaller than n). For perfect processivity when q is very close to 1, we can put q = 1 − x,where x ≪ 1 and Taylor expand q n to first order in x,qn(x)=(1−x)n≈qn(0)+x·d(1−x)ndxx=0=1−nx(Eq. 5) It also follows by Taylor expansion that in this limit,q=11+k−a/kc≈1−k−akc(Eq. 6) so thatk −a/k c =x. Using these expressions for q andq n in the above formulas forV max /K m andV max gives, in the high processivity limit,VmaxKm≈E0k−an,Vmax≈E0nk−a(Eq. 7) When n = 1, the normal Michaelis-Menten expressions are recovered in all the above cases. It may also be noted that when q is so small that q n can be neglected, i.e. in the low processivity limit, the expressions for V max /K m andV max become instead,VmaxKm=E0kaq1−q=E0kakc/k−a,Vmax≈E0kc(Eq. 8) The factor q/(1 − q) in the first of these expressions is, in this limit, the average number of bases removed by PARN before dissociation, once it has bound its substrate. We recently showed that a purified 54-kDa fragment of PARN deadenylates capped RNA substrates more efficiently than uncapped ones (34Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, the role of the cap structure is further clarified by experiments where the same PARN fragment is used to deadenylate m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped, G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped or uncapped L3(A30) RNAs. Fig. 1indicates that the m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped RNA is the most efficient, the G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped RNA the second most efficient, and the uncapped RNA the least efficient substrate for PARN. The effects of the cap structures on PARN activity were quantified by determination of Michaelis-Menten parameters for all three substrates, and the results are given in Table I. Deadenylation was in this case monitored by detection of the release of 5′-AMP mononucleotides with one-dimensional TLC (“Experimental Procedures”). It is seen that the efficiency parameter V max /K m is increased 1.5-fold by G(5′)ppp(5′)G and 3-fold by m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G in relation to the uncapped substrate. The maximal enzyme rate, V max, goes up more than 10-fold by addition of G(5′)ppp(5′)G to uncapped RNA but increases only about 3-fold by addition of methylated cap. This interesting result means that, although methylation of cap increasesV max /K m 2-fold, it reduces at the same time V max about 3-fold (Table I, see “Discussion”). Taken together these data show that the cap structure stimulatesin vitro deadenylation when provided in cis,suggesting that capped and polyadenylated mRNAs are the preferred substrates for PARN in vivo. It is known that a m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogue provided in transinhibits PARN-dependent poly(A) degradation of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped RNA substrates (19Gao M. Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Mol.

Fig. 2shows that PARN-dependent deadenylation of both m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped and uncapped RNA substrates was inhibited by a trans-acting m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogue present at 10 µm concentration. The mechanism of inhibition was studied further by Michaelis-Menten analysis of the rate of release of 5′-AMP from m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped L3(A30) RNA substrates in the presence of different concentrations of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (i.e. 0, 0.5, 3, and 10 µm) or G(5′)ppp(5′)G (i.e. 0, 50, 200, and 500 µm) cap analogues provided in trans (Fig. 3). Because theK m values did not change by the presence of the cap-analogues when the V max values were reduced, the inhibition of PARN by trans-acting cap structures must be non-competitive. This suggests that the binding site for the cap structure is separate from the active site of PARN. AK i value, defined as the concentration of cap analogue that reduces PARN activity to half, was calculated for each of the two analogues acting on deadenylation of each of the three substrates. Table IIshows that methylated cap analogue is an inhibitor that is about 50-fold more efficient than its unmethylated counterpart and that theK i values do not depend on the 5′-end of the RNA substrates. Surprisingly, when a methylated cap analogue is providedin trans at low concentrations (<0.5 µm) it stimulates, rather than inhibits, PARN-catalyzed deadenylation of uncapped substrates or substrates with unmethylated cap. A similar activation is also visible in Fig. 2. There is, at the same time, no such stimulation for substrates with a methylated cap structure.Table IISummary of inhibition and activation constantsRNA substrate2-aThe L3(A30) RNA substrate was used with the indicated 5′-end structure.Inhibition constant2-bThe inhibition constant,K b was defined as the concentration of cap analogue that reduced PARN activity to half.

Open table in a new tab We have previously reported that the 54-kDa fragment of PARN deadenylates m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped RNA substrates processively (34Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U.

However, the degradation pattern observed in Fig. 1 suggested that the cap structure influenced the processivity of PARN. Therefore, we asked if the cap structure is an indispensable processivity factor for PARN or whether it tunes processivity without being essential. An important prediction for a processive mode of degradation is that for enzymes working close to their V max values the earliest time point when fully deadenylated products appear is independent of the amount of RNA substrate added to the reaction. If, in contrast, the enzyme is distributive, the appearance of completely deadenylated substrates will be increasingly delayed as more substrate is added above the saturation level of the enzyme. Different amounts of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped or uncapped L3(A30) RNA substrates (12 and 60 nm, corresponding to concentrations at or in 5-fold excess over their K m values) were deadenylated in vitro. Fig. 4reveals that the m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G capped RNA substrate was deadenylated in a highly processive mode, as previously observed (34Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. V"

The predominant form (termed secPrP) is fully translocated into the ER lumen, whereas the other two forms (termedNtmPrP and CtmPrP) are single-spanning membrane proteins. CtmPrP spans the membrane with its C terminus in the lumen, whereas NtmPrP is in the reverse orientation, with its N terminus in the lumen (see Fig. 1 Bfor a diagram). Mutations that result in increased generation of CtmPrP were shown to result in dose-dependent development of neurodegenerative disease (4Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies have suggested that the ability to generate CtmPrP may also play a role in the neurodegeneration seen in transmissible forms of prion disease (4Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, elevated levels of CtmPrP appear to be one mechanism by which PrP is able to mediate neurodegeneration. The role of CtmPrP in the pathogenesis of at least a subset of prion diseases highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which PrP topology is determined and controlled. Generally, a protein's topology is thought to be unique and determined by “topogenic elements” encoded within the primary sequence (11Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 12Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Lipp J. Flint N. Haeuptle M.T. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PrP contains three such topogenic sequences: an N-terminal signal sequence, generally used to target proteins to the ER (14Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar); a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids that can serve as a transmembrane domain (TMD); and a C-terminal sequence for glycolipid anchor addition (15Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). However, not only do these elements fail to specify a homogeneous population of chains in a single topology, but the three topologic forms of PrP differ in two fundamental ways: localization of the N terminus (secPrP andNtmPrP have their N terminus in the ER lumen, whereasCtmPrP has it in the cytosol) and integration of the potential TMD into the lipid bilayer (secPrP is not integrated, whereas NtmPrP and CtmPrP are). The region(s) of PrP that encode the key determinants for each of the topologic forms have not been clearly elucidated. The N-terminal signal sequence is likely to be necessary for at least targeting PrP to the secretory pathway. This is supported by the observation that deletion or replacement of this domain results in PrP being made as a cytosolic protein (16Ma J. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2S. J. Kim, R. Rahbar, and R. S. Hegde, unpublished data. Whether the signal plays any role in topogenesis beyond its targeting function has not been studied. By contrast, previous studies demonstrating that mutations within or immediately preceding the TMD can alter the topologic forms of PrP generated have implicated this domain in PrP topogenesis (4Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the role of this domain in the generation of each of the topologic forms remains obscure. Finally, results from Stewart and Harris (6Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrating that various mutations in the C terminus of PrP do not significantly affect topology suggest that regions C-terminal to the TMD may not play a significant role in topogenesis. This is consistent with previous observations that replacement of the entire C-terminal domain of PrP with a protein domain from globin does not significantly affect the generation of any of the topologic forms (17DeFea K.A. Nakahara D.H. Calayag M.C. Yost C.S. Mirels L.F. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16810-16820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, other than a poorly defined role for the TMD, relatively little is currently understood about either the domain(s) involved or their respective role(s) in directing PrP topogenesis. This study was undertaken to elucidate a conceptual framework for understanding PrP topogenesis that would both provide tools and serve as a starting point for future mechanistic studies. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate and dog pancreatic rough microsomes were prepared and used as described (Ref. 18Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar and references therein). Anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 was a gift from the laboratory of S. B. Prusiner. Restriction enzymes, other DNA-modifying enzymes, and SP6 RNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs Inc. RNase inhibitor was from Promega. Routine laboratory chemicals were of the highest quality available commercially from Sigma, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, or ICN. Standard techniques were used in the creation of all plasmid constructs (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All constructs were made in the pSP64 vector (Promega). Signal sequence mutants were all derived from a modified wild-type Syrian hamster PrP construct that contained silent NheI and AatII sites introduced at codons 8 and 19, respectively. This plasmid was digested with the desired combination of BglII (immediately preceding the start codon), NheI, AatII, or PflMI (codon 26) and ligated to synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutations. Most of the TMD mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis. The remaining TMD mutations were made by first introducing silent restriction sites (BstBI and NdeI) at codons 103 and 111 to facilitate replacement of selected regions surrounding the TMD with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutations. Combinations of signal and TMD mutants were made by replacing the wild-type TMD region of the wild-type mature region (excised with either KpnI and XbaI orBsu36I and EcoRI) with the relevant mutant TMD. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. In vitrotranscription with SP6 RNA polymerase, translation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine, and translocation into canine rough microsomal membranes have been described (Refs. 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar and 18Hegde R.S. Voigt S.

Proteolysis was with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 60 min at 0 °C. Reactions were terminated with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and transferred into 10 volumes of 1% SDS and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8) preheated to 100 °C. Samples were either analyzed directly by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% Tris/Tricine gels (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10479) Google Scholar) or immunoprecipitated with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 18Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of the translocation reactions shown were performed in the presence of a competitive peptide inhibitor of glycosylation (NH2-Asp-Tyr-Thr-COOH). Inhibition of glycosylation does not affect the ratios of topologic forms generated (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). It does, however, simplify the analysis since each topologic form is then represented by a single band, rather than the heterogeneous banding pattern seen with variable glycosylation. Quantitative ratios of topologic forms were determined by analysis of digitized autoradiographs on either Kodak X-Omat or BioMax films. Band size (in pixels) multiplied by mean band density (subtracted for film background) was used to assign a value to each band, followed by calculation of the appropriate ratios. It should be noted that the relative effect of each mutant was consistently and reproducibly observed in multiple experiments (with an effect as little as 10% difference in the formation of a topologic form being readily detectable). However, the absolute amount of the topologic forms generated for any given construct (including the wild type) varied from experiment to experiment, depending on temperature, time of translation, and batch of in vitro translation extract and microsomal membranes used. This is consistent with the observation that PrP topogenesis is dependent on multiple protein factors in both the cytosol (21Lopez C.D. Yost C.S. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and ER membrane (18Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For this reason, the data in Figs. 2and 4 represent quantitative analysis of experiments in which all of the signal mutants (Fig. 2) or TMD mutants (Fig. 4) were analyzed simultaneously, in triplicate, to allow accurate and direct comparisons between the mutants. The raw data shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are from translation reactions performed at another time with different batches of reagents. Thus, although the relative differences between the mutants in these experiments and the quantitative analyses in Figs. 2and 4 are similar, the absolute amounts of each topologic form are somewhat different.Figure 4The relative amounts of the topologic forms generated by each of the TMD mutants shown in Fig. 3 A were quantitated, and the ratios between any two of the forms (CtmPrP/secPrP (A),CtmPrP/NtmPrP (B), andsecPrP/NtmPrP (C)) were plotted as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

PK, proteinase K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During the course of our ongoing studies of signal sequence function, we noticed that replacing the signal sequence of PrP with functional signal sequences from certain other secretory proteins (for example, prolactin and angiotensinogen) resulted in a change in the ratio of topologic forms.2 This observation raised the possibility that, in addition to facilitating targeting of nascent PrP to the ER, the signal sequence may play a role in PrP topogenesis. To explore this idea, we generated and analyzed the effect on topology of mutations introduced into the PrP signal sequence. Signal sequences generally contain three domains. The h-region, a feature that is common among all signal sequences (22von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 23von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), forms the hydrophobic core of at least 6 amino acids. Preceding the h-region in many signals is the n-region, a polar and often charged domain that is at the amino terminus of a signal sequence. The c-region is composed of the amino acids immediately preceding the signal sequence cleavage site. The polar n-region of the PrP signal (residues 1–7) was chosen for mutagenesis for three primary reasons. First, the n-region is highly divergent among signals of different proteins, varying in both length (from 1 to 17 amino acids) and net charge (ranging from −2 to +4) (22von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 23von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Second, mutations disrupting the h-region often severely impair the obligate targeting function of a signal sequence (24Silhavy T.J. Benson S.A. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 313-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). And third, the signal sequences from other proteins that affected PrP topology most notably differed from each other in the n-region, particularly charged residues. 3R. S. Hegde, unpublished data. Thus, we focused our mutagenesis primarily on those changes that alter the net charge of the n-region of PrP (Fig.1 A). A protease protection assay was used to assess the topology of the n-region signal sequence mutants synthesized in an in vitrotranslation and translocation system (5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). In this assay, only PrP that is translocated across the microsomal membrane generates protease-protected species. The size of the fragment generated upon protease digestion indicates the topologic form from which it was derived (an ∼18-kDa C-terminal fragment fromCtmPrP and an ∼14-kDa N-terminal fragment fromNtmPrP), with protection of full-length PrP indicative ofsecPrP. As shown in Fig. 1 C, many of the signal sequence mutations resulted in a significant change in comparison with the wild type in the relative amounts of the protease-protected PrP fragments. The N1, N2, N6, N7, N7a, and N11 mutants generated, to varying degrees, increased amounts of the 18-kDa CtmPrP fragment upon protease digestion. By contrast, we consistently observed that the N4, N5, N10, and N12 mutants generated slightly lessCtmPrP than the wild type (see the quantitative analysis in Fig. 2 below). The N3 and N7a mutants, unlike the other mutants, showed a clear discrepancy in the amounts of the protease-protected fragments relative to the amount of synthesized PrP. In both cases, less than half of the synthesized PrP could be accounted for after protease digestion of the sample (Fig. 1 C, compare − PK and + PK lanes for these constructs). Presumably, these unaccounted chains are cytosolic and thus digested completely upon protease addition. This suggests that these two signal mutants, in addition to affecting the ratio of topologic forms generated, translocate less efficiently, resulting in some of the PrP remaining in the cytosol. Thus, although some mutations (e.g. N3) appear to reduce translocation efficiency, probably by affecting the targeting function of the signal sequence, other mutations (e.g. N2) appear to have a significant impact on topogenesis without an overall decrease in translocation efficiency. Together, these results suggest that, in addition to targeting, the signal may play a separate role in topogenesis. To gain additional insight into which aspects of PrP topogenesis were most influenced by mutations in the signal sequence, we quantified (see “Experimental Procedures”) and plotted the relative ratios of the three topologic forms of PrP generated by the signal mutants that did not significantly affect translocation efficiency (e.g. all mutants except N3 and N7a). As shown in Fig.2, theCtmPrP/secPrP ratio varied dramatically between the different mutants, spanning an order of magnitude from ∼0.17 (e.g. N12) to ∼1.7 (e.g. N6) (Fig.2 A). The CtmPrP/NtmPrP ratio similarly ranged from ∼0.28 to ∼2.1 with these same mutants (Fig.2 B). By marked contrast, thesecPrP/NtmPrP ratio was surprisingly invariant, being between ∼1.1 and 1.8 regardless of the mutation analyzed (Fig.2 C). These results suggest that the primary effect on topogenesis of signal sequence mutations is to increase or decrease the amount ofCtmPrP relative to both NtmPrP andsecPrP. We have not observed a significant change in the ratio of NtmPrP to secPrP upon manipulation of the signal sequence with either mutations (Figs. 1 and 2) or replacement with other signal sequences.2 Consequently, the amounts of NtmPrP and secPrP, relative toCtmPrP, appear to either both increase (e.g. with N4) or both decrease (e.g.N2) with mutations in the signal sequence. Two additional observations from the analysis of these mutants are noteworthy. First, introduction of charged residues into the n-region of the signal sequence generally alters the topogenesis of PrP. This does not appear to be due to disruption of an existent sequence motif, but rather an effect of the introduced charge. Thus, replacement of residues 4 and 5 with Asn or Gln (N13 and N14, respectively) does not alter topology, whereas Asp, Glu, Arg, or Lys (N2, N11, N5, and N12, respectively) significantly alters topology. Second, acidic residues in the n-region often result in increased CtmPrP, and basic residues generally favor decreased CtmPrP. However, this was not universally true. Introduction of Asp at position 4 (N7) resulted in a significant increase in CtmPrP, whereas the same change at position 5 (N8) had a minimal effect on topology. Additionally, basic residues at positions 6 and 7 (N6) increasedCtmPrP significantly. We next performed a similar analysis of mutations either within or immediately preceding the hydrophobic stretch of amino acids (residues 113–135) thought to compose the membrane-spanning domain in bothNtmPrP and CtmPrP (5Hegde R.S.

Previous studies have shown that mutations in this region of PrP can not only affect topology, but can also result in neurodegenerative disease (4Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

However, the number of mutants analyzed was not sufficient to allow general conclusions to be drawn about the role of this domain in determining specific aspects of PrP topology. Over the past several years, numerous mutations have been made in this region for a variety of reasons, many unrelated to studies of PrP topogenesis. We took advantage of these existent mutants (Fig.3 A) to perform a careful analysis of their effects on PrP topogenesis. Just as with the signal sequence mutants, we reasoned that a systematic pattern may emerge that could provide insight into the role of the TMD in determining PrP topology. The autoradiographs of representative TMD mutants show that, consistent with previous observations (4Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), mutations within or preceding the TMD can significantly affect PrP topology (Fig. 3 B). However, it was also apparent that mutations in the TMD affect PrP topology in a qualitatively different manner than the signal mutants. First, unlike the signal mutants, several TMD mutants make essentially all of the translocated PrP in the secPrP form (e.g. G123P, ΔSTE, and, to a lesser extent, A120G). And second, in contrast to some of the signal mutants (e.g. N3 and N7a), none of the 17 TMD mutants analyzed generated exclusivelyCtmPrP or affected translocation efficiency. To consolidate these observations, we quantitated and graphed the relative ratios of the topologic forms generated by each of the TMD mutants (Fig. 4). We found that theCtmPrP/secPrP ratio varied from <0.05 to ∼2.4 among the various mutations (Fig. 4 A). ThesecPrP/NtmPrP ratio also varied significantly, ranging from ∼0.7 to >20 (Fig. 4 C). By comparison, theCtmPrP/NtmPrP ratio was less variant, ranging from ∼0.4 to ∼2.3, with the majority of mutants showing a ratio of close to 1 (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, it appears that the primary effect of mutations in the TMD region is to alter the amounts of the topologic forms that are membrane-integrated (NtmPrP andCtmPrP) relative to the fully translocatedsecPrP. For example, some mutations, such as G123P and ΔSTE, make almost exclusively the secPrP form. Others, such as KH-II, AV3, and A120L, make relatively littlesecPrP in favor of increased NtmPrP andCtmPrP. These results suggest that the major role for the TMD in PrP topogenesis is to specify the percent of PrP chains that integrate into the lipid bilayer. The above analyses identified two domains within PrP that each contribute to the determination of topology. Although both of these domains affect topology, the quantitative analyses (Figs. 2 and 4) suggest that they affect it in qualitatively different ways. The general distinction is that the signal sequence increases or decreases CtmPrP relative to the other two topologic forms, whereas the TMD increases or decreases secPrP relative to the other two topologic forms. Given that the signal and TMD affect PrP topogenesis in different ways, it was conceivable that the effect of one domain is dominant to the other. Alternatively, the two domains may both contribute to PrP topogenesis by acting either sequentially or in concert. To determine the manner in which the signal and TMD mutants interact with each other, we generated and analyzed an array of PrP double mutants that contain various combinations of the signal sequence and TMD mutations (Fig. 5). We analyzed constructs that combined various signal sequence mutations with either of two TMD mutants: PrP(A120L) and PrP(ΔSTE) (Fig. 5,A and B). In addition, we also examined constructs in which various TMD mutati"

Photometric analysis of the fragments indicates that the largest ones have effective spherical diameters of about 100 meters, which implies that the total mass in the observed fragments was about 2 × 10 9 kilograms. The comet's dust tail, which was the most prominent optical feature in August, was produced during a major fragmentation event, whose activity peaked on UT 22.8 ± 0.2 July 2000. The mass of small particles (diameters less than about 230 micrometers) in the tail was about 4 × 10 8 kilograms, which is comparable to the mass contained in a large fragment and to the total mass lost from water sublimation after 21 July 2000 (about 3 × 10 8 kilograms). HST spectroscopic observations during 5 and 6 July 2000 demonstrate that the nucleus contained little carbon monoxide ice (ratio of carbon monoxide to water is less than or equal to 0.4%), which suggests that this volatile species did not play a role in the fragmentation of C/1999 S4 (LINEAR)."

The measurements show that as we approach the transition from the metallic side, a new phase emerges that consists of weakly coupled fragments of the two-dimensional system. These fragments consist of localized charge that coexists with the surrounding metallic phase. As the density is lowered into the insulating phase, the number of fragments increases on account of the disappearing metallic phase. The measurements reveal that the metal-insulator transition is a result of the microscopic restructuring that occurs in the system."

The activity of ENaC is controlled by its interaction with Nedd4; mutations that disrupt this interaction increase Na+absorption, causing an inherited form of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome).

The C2 domain is thought to be involved in the Ca2+-dependent localization of Nedd4 at the cell surface. However, we found that the C2 domain was not required for human Nedd4 (hNedd4) to inhibit ENaC in both Xenopus oocytes and Fischer rat thyroid epithelia. Rather, hNedd4 lacking the C2 domain inhibited ENaC more potently than wild-type hNedd4. Earlier work indicated that the WW domains bind to PY motifs in the C terminus of ENaC. However, it is not known which WW domains mediate this interaction. GlutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins of WW domains 2–4 each bound to α, β, and γENaC in vitro. The interactions were abolished by mutation of two residues. WW domain 3 (but not the other WW domains) was both necessary and sufficient for the binding of hNedd4 to αENaC. WW domain 3 was also required for the inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4; inhibition was nearly abolished when WW domain 3 was mutated.

Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC is critical for Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. An important unresolved question is which WW domain or domains mediate the interaction with ENaC. In vitro, multiple WW domains have the capacity to interact with ENaC PY motifs. For example, all three rat WW domains interacted with ENaC using an in vitro binding assay (6Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse and human WW domain 1 did not interact with ENaC (8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which WW domains interact with ENaC in the intact cell. At the N terminus, Nedd4 has a C2 domain, first described as a regulatory domain in protein kinase C (13Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). Homologous sequences were subsequently identified in a number of other proteins, where they function in the binding and modulation of protein function by Ca2+ and phospholipids (14Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In Nedd4, the function of the C2 domain is unknown. Previous work found that increased cytosolic Ca2+ induced the translocation of a C2 domain-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein to the cell surface, possibly by interacting with annexin XIIIb (15Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This suggests that the C2 domain might function in the Ca2+-dependent localization of Nedd4. Consistent with such a model, ENaC is inhibited by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). However, the role of the C2 domain in the Nedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC is not known. The goal of this work was to identify the sequences in human Nedd4 (hNedd4) that are necessary for the inhibition of ENaC. First, we tested the requirement for the C2 domain using a hNedd4 construct lacking the C2 domain. Second, we asked which of the four hNedd4 WW domains participate in the inhibition of ENaC. We used two different expression systems with distinct advantages: (a)Xenopus oocytes, and (b) Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelia. Oocytes reconstitute some aspects of the Nedd4-dependent regulation of ENaC (3Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Conversely, FRT cells allowed us to study hNedd4-mediated regulation in a polarized epithelium. hNedd4 was cloned by polymerase chain reaction of cDNA reverse transcribed from kidney polyadenylated RNA (CLONTECH). The 5′ primer was CCATCGATGGAGCCATGGCAACTTGCGCGGTGGAGGTG and included aClaI site for cloning into pMT3. The 3′ primer was CAGGGCTTTGATGGAGTTGATTAGGGGGTACCCC and included a KpnI site. A hNedd4 construct lacking the C2 domain (ΔC2) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange; Stratagene) (amino acids 22–114 were deleted). To abolish binding to ENaC, each of the four WW domains was mutated (individually or in combination) at two positions (WW1, V210W and H212G; WW2, V367W and H369G; WW3, I440W and H442G; WW4, I492W and H494G). These mutations were generated in ΔC2 because this construct inhibited ENaC more potently than wild-type hNedd4. Human α, β, and γENaC in pMT3 or pcDNA3 were cloned as described previously (17McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-L734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was introduced in the extracellular domain (residue 511) of αENaC (αENaC-FLAG), as described previously (10Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This epitope did not alter the function of ENaC. αENaC-FLAG was used for the hNedd4 binding assay, as described below. Each cDNA was sequenced in the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. α, β, and γENaC (0.2 ng each) were coexpressed with either wild-type or mutant hNedd4 or with an irrelevant protein (secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP); 0.2–0.8 ng) in Xenopus oocytes by nuclear injection of cDNA. Expression of SEAP with ENaC did not alter Na+ current compared with expression of ENaC alone. One day after injection, whole-cell current was measured by two-electrode voltage clamp at −60 mV with oocytes bathed in 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Statistical significance was assessed using Student's unpaired t test. FRT cells were grown on permeable filter supports (Millicell PCF; 0.4 µm, pore size; 12 mm, diameter) in F-12 Coon's media (Harlan) with 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, as described previously (19Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One day after seeding, cells were cotransfected with α, β, and γENaC (0.07 µg each) and wild-type or mutant hNedd4 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a negative control (0.8 µg). The total DNA was held constant by varying the ratio of hNedd4 and GFP. Expression of GFP did not alter ENaC Na+ currents. The plasmids were mixed with TFX 50 (Promega; 7.9 µg/millicell) in 360 µl/millicell serum-free F-12 Coon's media for 15 min and transferred to the apical surface of the monolayer. One h later, the apical media were replaced with F-12 Coon's media containing 5% fetal calf serum and amiloride (10 µm). Na+ transport was measured 2–3 days after transfection in modified Ussing chambers (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, IA). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmdextrose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37 °C and bubbled with O2. Amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (ISC) was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (10 µm) in the apical bathing solution cDNA encoding wild-type or mutant hNedd4 (0.2 ng) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes as described above. Oocytes not injected with cDNA were used as a negative control. One day after injection, 15 oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution containing 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 4 h and then homogenized in 800 µl of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml aprotonin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin A) by 10 pulls through an 18-gauge needle, followed by 1 pull through a 26-gauge needle. Yolk pellets were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and then at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. hNedd4 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate with polyclonal sheep antisera (1:100 dilution) prepared against GST-WW domain fusion proteins (GST-WW1, GST-WW2, or GST-WW3, described below) (Elmira Biologicals, Iowa City, IA). After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were imaged by fluorography and quantitated using a Kodak Image Station 440CF and 1D software (version 3.0; Kodak). cDNAs encoding WW domains 1–4 (wild-type or mutant as described above) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequences correspond to the WW domains shown in Fig. 2B. GST-WW domain proteins were expressed and isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Each produced a single band of the expected molecular weight on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Protein was quantitated with a Bio-Rad protein assay, and 50 µg of protein was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked overnight with 5% dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Pierce). [35S]Methionine-labeled α, β, and γENaC were transcribed and translated in vitro (Promega TNT kit). The membranes were incubated with 25 µl of one of the three ENaC subunits in 25 ml of TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% dry milk overnight at 4 °C (with rocking), washed four times with TBS/0.1% Triton X-100, and exposed to Kodak Biomax film. To examine the relative binding, GST-WW fusion proteins (2 µg) were applied directly to nitrocellulose using the Bio-Dot SF apparatus (Bio-Rad) and probed with α, β, or γENaC as described above. αENaC-FLAG was expressed in COS-7 cells by electroporation, as described previously (10Snyder P.M.

Two days after electroporation, the cells were lysed, and protein was solubilized in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml aprotonin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin A). Insoluble protein was solubilized in 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and diluted 1:10 (1 ml, final volume) in TBS/1% Triton X-100. αENaC-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from 100 µl of lysate (0.74 µg/µl total protein) with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Kodak) and protein A beads (Pierce). The immunoprecipitated αENaC-FLAG could be detected either by metabolic labeling of the cells or by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (data not shown). hNedd4 (wild-type or mutant) was generated and labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro transcription and translation. After SDS-PAGE and fluorography, the protein was quantitated using Kodak Image Station and 1D software. The immunoprecipitated αENaC-FLAG (30 µl immobilized on beads) was then incubated for 16 h with wild-type or mutant hNedd4 (equal specific activities, 12.8–20 µl) in a total volume of 800 µl. The beads were washed three times with TBS/1% Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, and imaged by fluorography. We tested the effect of hNedd4 on ENaC in two different expression systems. In Xenopusoocytes, expression of α, β, and γENaC generated amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. Coexpression of the channel with hNedd4 decreased Na+ current (Fig.1A and Ref. 8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether hNedd4 inhibits ENaC in epithelia, we transiently expressed the channel with or without hNedd4 in FRT epithelial cells. These cells lack endogenous Na+ channels and form a polarized epithelium when grown on permeable filter supports (19Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Ostedgaard L.S. Denning G.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L405-L413PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of FRT epithelia with α, β, and γENaC using cationic lipids generated transepithelial short-circuit Na+ current (ISC) that was completely blocked by amiloride (19Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B, Control). hNedd4 decreased Na+current when coexpressed with ENaC (Fig. 1, B andC, hNedd4). Thus, similar to Xenopusoocytes, hNedd4 inhibited ENaC in epithelial cells. The N terminus of hNedd4 contains a C2 domain (Fig.2 A). To test whether the C2 domain is required for the hNedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC, we generated a hNedd4 lacking the C2 domain (ΔC2). If this domain was required, we predicted that ΔC2 would not inhibit ENaC. We coexpressed ENaC in Xenopus oocytes with increasing amounts of wild-type hNedd4, ΔC2, or an irrelevant protein (SEAP). Wild-type hNedd4, but not SEAP, produced a dose-dependent decrease in Na+ current (Fig.3A). Surprisingly, deletion of the C2 domain did not prevent hNedd4 from inhibiting ENaC (Fig.3 A). On the contrary, ΔC2 was a more potent inhibitor of ENaC than wild-type hNedd4. This difference did not result from altered protein expression; immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against WW domain 2 revealed similar amounts of protein for wild-type and mutant hNedd4 (Fig. 3, C and D). We also tested the effect of ΔC2 in FRT epithelia. Similar to the results seen in oocytes, ΔC2 inhibited ENaC more potently than wild-type hNedd4 (Fig. 3 B). Together, these results indicate that the C2 domain is not required for the hNedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC. Rather, the data suggest that the C2 domain may suppress the activity of hNedd4. hNedd4 contains four WW domains (Fig. 2, A andB). To investigate the interactions between hNedd4 and ENaC, we used an overlay assay. GST fusion proteins containing individual WW domains (GST-WW1, GST-WW2, GST-WW3, and GST-WW4; 50 µg) were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Fig.4A, bottom panel shows Coomassie Blue staining), and probed with [35S]methionine-labeled α, β, or γENaC. Consistent with previous work (8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that WW domains 2, 3, and 4 each interacted with α, β, and γENaC (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, WW domain 1 and GST alone (negative control) did not interact with the ENaC subunits (Fig. 4 A). In Fig. 4 B,smaller quantities of fusion proteins (2 µg) were applied to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with ENaC. GST-WW3 bound more of the α, β, and γENaC probes than did GST-WW2 or GST-WW4. Espanel and Sudol (21Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) recently identified two WW domain residues (Leu-190 and His-192) involved in the binding of Yes-associated protein to a PY motif peptide. Mutation of both residues abolished the interaction. The residue corresponding to His-192 in Yes-associated protein is conserved in each of the hNedd4 WW domains (Fig.2 B). At the position equivalent to Leu-190, the hNedd4 WW domains contain conservative substitutions; valine (WW1 and WW2) or isoleucine (WW3 and WW4). To determine whether these residues are required for the interaction between the hNedd4 WW domains and ENaC PY motifs, we generated GST-WW fusion proteins containing mutations in both residues (Val/Ile to Trp; His to Gly). Using an overlay assay, we found that these mutations abolished binding of WW domains 2, 3, and 4 to each ENaC subunit (α, β, and γ) (Fig. 4 A). We took advantage of these mutations to determine the role of each WW domain in the binding of full-length hNedd4 to ENaC. We mutated one or more WW domains and tested the binding of hNedd4 to one of the ENaC subunits (αENaC). αENaC-FLAG was expressed in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated, and then incubated with wild-type or mutant hNedd4 (labeled with [35S]methionine). Fig.5shows autoradiograms of the in vitro translated hNedd4 probes (bottom panel) and hNedd4 that bound to αENaC-FLAG (top panel). We found that wild-type hNedd4 bound to αENaC-FLAG, but not to immunoprecipitated proteins from COS-7 cells expressing GFP as a negative control (wt-GFP). Deletion of the C2 domain (ΔC2) did not disrupt binding. The WW domain mutations were therefore generated in a construct lacking the C2 domain. Simultaneous mutation of all four WW domains (WW1–4) abolished the binding of hNedd4 to αENaC-FLAG, confirming a role for one or more of the WW domains in the interaction between these proteins. Mutation of WW domain 3 alone was sufficient to abolish binding, but individual mutations of WW domains 1, 2, or 4 were not sufficient to abolish binding. However, these mutations appeared to decrease the binding of hNedd4 to αENaC-FLAG (compared with ΔC2). Thus, WW domain 3, but not WW domains 1, 2, or 4, is required for the interaction between hNedd4 and αENaC. To determine whether individual WW domains were sufficient to interact with αENaC-FLAG, we simultaneously mutated three of the four WW domains (leaving one WW domain intact) (Fig. 5, right). When WW domains 1, 2, or 4 alone were intact, we did not detect significant binding between hNedd4 and αENaC-FLAG. Conversely, hNedd4 bound to αENaC-FLAG when WW domain 3 alone was intact (WW domains 1, 2, and 4 were mutated). Together, the data indicate that WW domain 3 is necessary and sufficient for hNedd4 to interact with the αENaC subunit. This is consistent with our finding that more GST-WW3 than the other WW domain fusion proteins bound to each ENaC subunit (Fig. 4). Although WW domains 1, 2, and 4 were not sufficient alone or in combination for full-length hNedd4 to bind αENaC-FLAG, the data to not exclude a role for these WW domains in the interaction of hNedd4 with the ENaC channel complex. We therefore used two functional assays to determine the role of the four WW domains in the interaction between hNedd4 and ENaC in the intact cell. To determine which WW domains are required for hNedd4 to inhibit ENaC in the intact cell, we coexpressed α, β, and γENaC with hNedd4 cDNAs containing WW domain mutations (described in the previous section). These mutations were generated in ΔC2 hNedd4 because it inhibited ENaC better than did wild-type hNedd4. We found that simultaneous mutation of all four WW domains (WW1–4) abolished hNedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC in FRT epithelia (Fig.6, A and B). Similar results were obtained in Xenopus oocytes (Fig.6 B). Thus, the interaction between one or more of the WW domains and ENaC was required for inhibition. To identify which of the four WW domains was required, we tested individual WW domain mutations. Mutation of WW domain 1 did not prevent hNedd4 from inhibiting ENaC in either FRT epithelia or Xenopus oocytes (Fig.6 B). This is consistent with the finding that WW1 did not bind to ENaC in vitro (Figs. 4 and 5). Interestingly, the WW1 mutant inhibited ENaC slightly (but significantly) better than did hNedd4 with wild-type WW domains (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, mutation of WW3 nearly abolished inhibition; expression of the WW3 mutant in epithelia or oocytes produced a minimal decrease in Na+ current (Fig. 6 B). Mutation of WW2 or WW4 had an intermediate effect. In epithelia, both mutants inhibited ENaC, but they did so to a lesser extent than did ΔC2 containing wild-type WW domains (Fig. 6 B). Although mutation of WW2 also decreased inhibition in Xenopus oocytes, the WW4 mutant inhibited ENaC to an extent similar to that of ΔC2 (Fig.6 B). The WW domain mutations did not alter the expression of hNedd4 proteins in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 6, C andD). Thus, WW3 is required for hNedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC. WW2 and WW4 are not required, but they are also involved in ENaC inhibition. The data are consistent with our observation that WW3 was required for the interaction between hNedd4 and ENaC (Fig. 5) and also suggest a functional role for WW domains 2 and 4. Our binding studies suggested that WW domain 3 was sufficient alone to bind to ENaC (Figs. 4 and 5). To test whether this interaction would inhibit ENaC, we expressed the channel with hNedd4 containing mutations in WW domains 1, 2, and 4 (WW3 alone was intact). Surprisingly, the mutant hNedd4 decreased Na+ current only 20% in FRT epithelia, much less than did ΔC2 hNedd4 (Fig.7A). This result could not be explained by decreased hNedd4 protein; similar amounts of ΔC2 and mutant hNedd4 protein were expressed (Fig. 7 B). Current was also minimally inhibited when only WW domain 2 was intact and was not inhibited at all when WW domain 4 alone was intact (Fig.7 A). Thus, the interaction between a single WW domain and ENaC produced only minimal inhibition of ENaC. WW domains in hNedd4 interact with PY motifs in ENaC (6Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found that simultaneous mutation of all four WW domains abolished the inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4. In previous work, inhibition was also abolished by mutation or deletion of ENaC PY motifs (3Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, a physical interaction between one or more WW domain(s) and the PY motifs of ENaC is required for hNedd4 to inhibit the channel. Although three of the four hNedd4 GST-WW domain fusion proteins interacted with the PY motifs of ENaC in vitro, several findings suggest that the WW domain 3 interaction is critically important. First, GST-WW3 bound more ENaC probe than did GST-WW2 or GST-WW4. This suggests the possibility that WW domain 3 has a higher relative affinity for ENaC than the other WW domains, although we cannot exclude other potential explanations (e.g. differences in conformation or aggregation of the fusion proteins). Second, mutation of WW domain 3, but not of the other WW domains, abolished the binding of hNedd4 to an ENaC subunit. Third, WW domain 3 alone was sufficient to mediate the binding of full-length hNedd4 to αENaC. Because GST-WW3 bound well to all three ENaC subunits, it seems likely that WW domain 3 is also important in the binding of hNedd4 to β and γENaC. Finally, the inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4 in both epithelial cells andXenopus oocytes was nearly abolished by mutation of WW domain 3. Thus, WW domain 3 was critical not only for the binding of hNedd4 to ENaC in vitro but also for its binding and inhibition of the heteromultimeric channel in the intact cell. However, the interaction between WW domain 3 and ENaC alone was not sufficient for hNedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC; hNedd4 produced only a small decrease in Na+ current when WW domain 3 was the only intact WW domain. This suggests that WW domain 2 and/or WW domain 4 also participate in the functional interaction with ENaC. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of WW domain 2 or WW domain 4 decreased ENaC inhibition (although the decrease was less than for the WW domain 3 mutation). Thus, although the interaction with WW domain 3 appears to be most important, WW domains 2, 3, and 4 each participate in the interaction of hNedd4 with ENaC in intact cells. This is also consistent with the previous finding that multiple WW domains were required for a WW domain-GST fusion protein to disrupt the Na+ (70 mm)-induced inhibition of Na+ current in mouse mandibular duct cells (9Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An important unresolved question is which of the ENaC PY motifs interact with WW domains 2–4. Mutation or deletion of the PY motif in βENaC was sufficient to disrupt Nedd4-mediated inhibition of the channel and cause Liddle's syndrome (3Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Lifton R.P. Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, all three PY motifs have the capacity to interact with WW domains 2, 3, and 4in vitro (8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in any of the three PY motifs increase Na+ current (10Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the interactions are relatively promiscuous. For example, WW domain 3 might bind to the αENaC PY motif in one channel, but it might bind to the PY motif of βENaC in another channel. Multiple PY motif-WW domain interactions might be required to increase the affinity of the interaction between ENaC and hNedd4. Alternatively, there could be a high degree of specificity in the interaction between WW domains and PY motifs in the intact cell. For example, each WW domain might bind to a different ENaC subunit. Finally, it is possible that WW domains 2–4 bind to PY motifs in different ENaC channels or even different proteins, cross-linking them into a larger complex. Future studies will be required to differentiate between these models. However, each model is consistent with the finding that a single WW domain interaction is not sufficient to inhibit ENaC. The function of WW domain 1 is not known. It does not bind to ENaC subunits in vitro (8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of WW1 did not prevent hNedd4 from inhibiting ENaC, suggesting that it does not bind to ENaC in the intact cell. Rather, the WW domain 1 mutant inhibited ENaC to a greater extent than did wild-type hNedd4. Perhaps the binding of WW domain 1 to one or more other proteins modulates the localization or function of hNedd4. Identification of such proteins may provide new candidate genes for the pathogenesis of hypertension. The interaction between WW domain 3 and ENaC was most important for the inhibition of the channel. Interestingly, this domain is not present in rat or mouse Nedd4 (which contain only three WW domains); based on sequence similarity, the three WW domains of rat and mouse Nedd4 correspond to WW domains 1, 2 and 4 in hNedd4 (8Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the pattern of interactions between the WW domains and PY motifs and the affinity of the interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC may differ between species. Thus, it may be difficult to extrapolate PY motif-WW domain binding data between different species, and it may therefore be particularly important to study human Nedd4 to understand the role of this protein in human blood pressure control and hypertension. Previous work suggested that the Nedd4 C2 domain may be involved in the Ca2+-dependent translocation of Nedd4 to the cell surface through a mechanism potentially involving an interaction between the C2 domain and annexin XIIIb (15Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This might be important for the binding of Nedd4 to ENaC at the cell surface. Such a mechanism could be involved in the regulation of ENaC by cytosolic Ca2+. Surprisingly, we found that the C2 domain was not required for the hNedd4-mediated inhibition of ENaC. Instead, a mutant hNedd4 lacking the C2 domain inhibited ENaC better than did wild-type hNedd4. Perhaps under basal conditions, the C2 domain blocks the interaction and/or inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ might relieve this block, resulting in channel inhibition by hNedd4. Deletion of the C2 domain might allow hNedd4 to inhibit the channel in the absence of an increase in Ca2+. Such a model is consistent with the observation that increased cytosolic Ca2+ inhibits Na+ absorption via ENaC. Alternatively, Nedd4 might interact with ENaC at an intracellular location, rather than at the cell surface. Inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4 plays a critical role in Na+homeostasis and blood pressure control. Mutations in ENaC that abolish the interaction between these proteins cause Liddle's syndrome, a genetic form of hypertension. We found that mutations in WW domains 2, 3, and 4 disrupted the ability of hNedd4 to inhibit ENaC. Mutations in the ubiquitin ligase domain also disrupted inhibition (3Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems possible that loss of function mutations in hNedd4 could increase renal Na+ absorption, identifying hNedd4 as a candidate gene for hypertension. An understanding of the molecular requirements for the binding and inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4 will facilitate the search for sequence variations that alter this regulation and may provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of blood pressure control and the pathogenesis of hypertension.

Since many cancers up-regulate the FR it has enabled the targeting of toxins to tumor cells resulting in specific cell death. However, current conjugation methods rely on chemistries that can affect certain catalytic subunits, such as the A-chain of the plant toxin gelonin. As a result many folate-targeted toxins are a compromise between receptor/ligand interaction and toxin activity. We describe the first example of folate conjugated to a protein via carbohydrate residues, using a novel SH-folate intermediate. The folate-gelonin conjugate retains over 99% of toxin activity in a cell-free translational assay compared with unmodified gelonin and is able to bind the FR at the same affinity as free folic acid (10−10m). Additionally, the conjugate exhibits prolonged inhibition of protein synthesis in FR positive cell lines in vitro. Folate linked to gelonin via amino conjugation exhibits the same affinity for FR as free folic acid but the toxin is 225-fold less active in a cell-free translational assay.

Kreitman R.J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1998; 31: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The main reason for their use is their extreme potency; for example, it has been shown that a single plant toxin molecule injected into the cytoplasm can kill a cell (2Yamaizumi M. Mekada E. Uchida T. Okada Y. Cell. 1978; 15: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Therefore a selectively targeted plant toxin has the potential to be a powerful anti-cancer therapy. Gelonin is a member of the type I ribosome-inactivating plant toxin family (3Stirpe F. Olsnes S. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6947-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this family possess the catalytic A-chain necessary for protein synthesis inhibition but lack the B-chain that is characteristic of the type II toxins (e.g. ricin (1Pastan I. Kreitman R.J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1998; 31: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)). The B-chain is required for cell binding and endosomal translocation of the type II toxins into the cytoplasm of cells where protein synthesis is then inhibited (4Eiklid K. Olsnes S. Pihl A. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Since gelonin has no active mechanism of cell entry it is relatively non-toxic to intact cells, relying instead on nonspecific endocytosis and fluid phase uptake for cellular entry (3Stirpe F. Olsnes S. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6947-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cell-free translational systems gelonin is extremely efficient at inhibiting protein synthesis (IC50 10−9m), acting by preventing the association of elongation factors 1 and 2 with the 60 S ribosomal subunit (1Pastan I. Kreitman R.J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1998; 31: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As a result gelonin is a potential candidate for use as a cytoplasmic targeted toxin, and previous studies have shown it to be useful for targeting using transferrin (5Yazdi P.T. Wenning L.A. Murphy R.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3763-3771PubMed Google Scholar), gonadotrophin (6Singh V. Curtiss R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 130: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and antibodies (7Rosenblum M.G. Zuckerman J.E. Marks J.W. Rotbein J. Allen W.R. Mol. Biother. 1992; 4: 122-129PubMed Google Scholar).The use of such a potent toxin as a targeted therapy is limited unless sufficient selectivity can be incorporated into the drug, thus reducing the effect of nonspecific cell death. Therefore, targeting moieties that exhibit high affinity for cell surface receptors selectively up-regulated on tumor cells are required for this approach. One such targeting ligand is folate, which exhibits high affinity for the folate receptor (FR)1(10−10m). The FR is overexpressed on a range of cancers (8Wang S. Low P.S. J. Control Release. 1998; 53: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), in particular epithelial ovarian cancer where 90% of cases exhibit up-regulation (9Toffoli G. Cernigoi C. Russo A. Gallo A. Bagnoli M. Boiocchi M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In its unconjugated state folate is non-immunogenic, it is also small in size (441.4 Da) and retains its affinity for the FR upon conjugation to various proteins (8Wang S. Low P.S. J. Control Release. 1998; 53: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown to be a useful targeting moiety for the selective delivery of proteins into the cytoplasm of tumor cellsin vitro (10Leamon C.P. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24966-24971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Turek J.J. Leamon C.P. Low P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, folate is a potential candidate ligand for the targeted delivery of gelonin into the cytoplasm of tumor cells.However, one difficulty with the synthesis of targeted toxins is the effect of ligand conjugation upon toxin activity. For example, it has been shown that modification of gelonin amino groups by a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent (12Singh V. Sairam M.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Singh V. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 677-688PubMed Google Scholar, 14Singh V. Curtiss R. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 531-536PubMed Google Scholar) and conjugation of targeting agents to the toxin (3Stirpe F. Olsnes S. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6947-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Singh V. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 677-688PubMed Google Scholar) can result in up to 99% reduced toxin activity. Therefore the method of ligand conjugation is critical for retaining toxin activity while attaining sufficient selectivity for target cells. In this study, we have compared two strategies for the synthesis of folate-gelonin conjugates. The first exploits conjugation of SH-folate to gelonin carbohydrate residues (folate-S-gelonin) using 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionyl hydrazide (PDPH), a carbohydrate-selective cross-linker. The second uses N-hydroxysuccinimide-folate to conjugate the ligand directly to amino groups present in gelonin (folate-CO-gelonin). We demonstrate by competitive inhibition of [3H]folic acid binding to HeLa cells that both conjugates bind to the FR with the same affinity as free folic acid. However, folate-CO-gelonin is 225-fold less active at inhibiting translation than both folate-S-gelonin and gelonin in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay. Folate-S-gelonin also exhibits prolonged inhibition of protein synthesis in HeLa and Skov3 cell lines in vitro compared with gelonin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolid Phase Synthesis of SH-folateA glass column with a join connection and glass frit (porosity number 2) on the upper and lower end, respectively, was used as a reaction vessel.

After each step, the resin was stirred (20 min) and rinsed successively with CH2Cl2 (5 × 10 ml) and CH3OH (5 × 10 ml).Cysteamine Grafting to the Resin via Thioether Bond Formation4-Methoxytrityl chloride poly(styrene) (1% divinyl benzene) resin (200 mg, 0.346 mmol of chloride group; Novabiochem, Meudon, France) suspended in CH2Cl2/CH3OH (2 ml; 3/1) and pyridine (24 µl; 0.346 mmol) was poured into the glass column. Two molar excess of cysteamine hydrochloride (78.6 mg, 0.692 mmol; Fluka, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) was then added to the resin. The column was connected to a rotary evaporator and stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvent was filtered off and the resin washed as described above, followed by two washes with CH2Cl2/pyridine (100/5) to avoid the resin sticking to the glass wall. At this stage the resin turned yellow. A positive Kaiser test (15Sarin V.K. Kent S.B. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) showed the presence of amino groups on the resin, and Ellmans' reagent (16Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) showed no presence of free thiol groups.Reaction of Cysteamine Bound onto the Resin with Folic AcidFolic acid (763 mg, 1.73 mmol; Fluka) was slowly added in Me2SO (2 ml) heated to 50 °C, and diisopropylethylamine (303 µl, 1.73 mmol) was added to the dry resin. Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate was then added (PyBOPTM; 900 mg, 1.73 mmol; Novabiochem) and the mixture was stirred overnight at 30 °C. The mixture was filtered and the resin washed with Me2SO (5 × 10 ml),N,N-dimethylformamide (5 × 10 ml), CH2Cl2 (5 × 10 ml), and CH3OH (5 × 10 ml) resulting in an orange resin.Cleavage of the Folic Acid-Cysteamine Conjugate from the ResinA mixture of CH2Cl2/trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml; 97/3) was added to the resin and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was filtered and the resin washed with CH2Cl2 (10 ml) followed by CH3OH (10 ml). After 3 cycles of cleavage/wash the combined organic fractions were concentrated under vaccum in the presence of toluene. The crude product was precipitated by addition of 40 ml of acetonitrile, centrifuged, and washed twice with diethyl ether before drying under vaccum. An orange powder was obtained (183 mg) which was identified by1H NMR and mass spectroscopy. 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d 6) δ 8.75 (s, 1H, C7-H1), 7.64 (d, 2H, J = 8, C13-H1/C15-H1), 6.62 (d, 2H, J = 8, C12-H1/C16-H1), 4.52 (s, 2H, C9-H2), 4.28 (dd, 1H, C19-H1), 3.18 (m, 2H, C25-H2), 2.8–2.4 (m, 4H, C21-H2/C22-H2), 2.50 (m, 2H, C26-H2), 1.25 (s, 1H, S27-H1).

Free sodium periodate was removed from the solution by size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK) and fractions containing gelonin were pooled. The solution was treated with PDPH (40 µl of 0.1 m PDPH in ethanol to 1 ml of gelonin solution; Perbio, Tattenhall, UK) and incubated stirring at room temperature for 5 h. Free PDPH was removed from the solution by size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column) and fractions containing gelonin were pooled. The gelonin solution was then mixed, under reduced conditions, with SH-folate (10-fold molar excess of SH-folate:gelonin) and HEPES buffer (pH 8.3) to give an overall HEPES molarity of 50 mm. The solution was incubated stirring overnight at 4 °C. Free folate was removed from the solution by size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column) and fractions containing gelonin were pooled. The protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay (Sigma) and the number of folate moieties per gelonin was calculated using spectroscopic analysis (ε365 nm = 9120.1m−1 × cm−1). The molar incorporation of folate:gelonin was calculated to be ∼1:1.Synthesis of N-Hydroxysuccinimide-folate (NHS-folate)NHS-folate was synthesized according to the method of Lee and Low (17Lee R.J. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3198-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Folic acid (5 g, 11.3 mmol; Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO (100 ml) and triethylamine (2.5 ml) and reacted withN-hydroxysuccinimide (2.6 g, 22.6 mmol) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (4.7 g, 22.7 mmol) overnight at room temperature. The solution was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure at 37 °C, and NHS-folate precipitated in diethyl ether (yellow-orange precipitate). The NHS-folate was washed three times in anhydrous ether, dried under vacuum, and stored as a powder at −20 °C. 1H NMR analysis confirmed the presence ofN-hydroxysuccinimide on the γ-carboxyl (67%) and α-carboxyl (33%) groups of folic acid (data not shown).Synthesis of Folate-CO-GeloninFolate-CO-gelonin was prepared by incubating gelonin (1 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.5) with NHS-folate (8:1 molar ratio of NHS-folate:gelonin) stirring at 4 °C overnight. The solution was spun to remove precipitates and free folate removed by size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column). The protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay and the number of folate moieties per gelonin was calculated using spectroscopic analysis (ε365 nm = 9120.1 m−1 × cm−1). The molar incorporation ratio of folate:gelonin was calculated to be ∼1:1.Competitive Inhibition of [3H]Folic Acid Binding to Cells by Folate-GeloninA sterile tube containing PBS (0.5 ml, pH 7.4), HeLa cells (100,000 total), [3H]folic acid (approximately 10−9m; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and either folate-conjugated or unconjugated compounds (concentration ranging from 0 to 20 µg/ml) was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2200 × g, 30 s), washed twice in PBS, and dissolved in urea buffer (9m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). The samples were diluted in Ultima Flo AF scintillation fluid (4 ml) and assayed for radioactivity in a Packard 1900TR liquid scintillation analyser (Packard, Berkshire, UK).Cell-free Translational Reticulocyte Lysate AssayGelonin, folate-S-gelonin, or folate-CO-gelonin (concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−7m) was added to a sterile vial containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate reagent (17 µl) and SP6 luciferase mRNA-luc (1 µg; Promega, Southampton, UK). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. An aliquot of each sample (1 µl) was assayed for luciferase activity by the following method. Luciferin (250 µl of a stock solution consisting of: 10 mg of beetle luciferin; 0.47 ml of 1m glycylglycine, pH 8.0; 15 ml water) was added to luciferase assay reagent (5 ml: consisting of 1 mglycylglycine, pH 8.0 (2.0 ml), 100 mm MgCl2 (1 ml), 500 mm EDTA (20 µl), dithiothreitol (50.8 mg), ATP (27.8 mg), coenzyme A (21.3 mg), water (99.0 ml); final pH 8.0). This luciferin/luciferase reagent (100 µl) was added to the sample (1 µl) and the luminescence intergrated over 10 s in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany).Protein Synthesis Inhibition in HeLa and Skov3 Cells in VitroHeLa or Skov3 cells were grown in a 96-well plate (10,000 cells/well) in folate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gelonin or folate-S-gelonin (10−7m) was added to each well and the cells incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for various lengths of time. Media was removed, the cells washed in PBS (pH 7.4, 2 washes) and methionine and cysteine-free media (Sigma, Dorset, UK) was added to the cells for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. [35S]Methionine/cysteine mixture (5 µCi/well; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the media and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS. Lysis buffer was added to each well (50 µl; Promega) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Bovine serum albumin (50 µl of 10 mg/ml in water; Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer followed by ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (100% w/v; Sigma) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was centrifuged (1,000 × g; 1 min) and washed twice in trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v). The precipitate was resuspended in water and assayed for radioactivity in a Packard 1900TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard, Berkshire, UK).DISCUSSIONThe formation of targeted toxins presents several problems of a chemical and biochemical nature. First, the binding of the ligand to the toxin must enable relatively simple and reproducible conjugation. Second, the conjugation must occur at a site that will not impede receptor-ligand interactions nor affect the activity of the toxin. Most targeted toxins cause a decrease in at least one of these areas (3Stirpe F. Olsnes S. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6947-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Singh V. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 677-688PubMed Google Scholar,14Singh V. Curtiss R. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 531-536PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fu Q. Gowda C. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Sharma S. Podder S.K. Karande A.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 200: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), therefore there is a pressing need for the design of alternative conjugation chemistries. In the results presented here we show that attachment of folate via gelonin carbohydrate residues retains both toxin activity and ligand binding affinity. This work has implications for the targeting of other glycoproteins via the FR and also for other ligands where similar chemistries can be performed.One advantage of using folate as a targeting ligand is the selective up-regulation of the FR on many epithelial tumors (8Wang S. Low P.S. J. Control Release. 1998; 53: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Indeed, Toffoli and others (9Toffoli G. Cernigoi C. Russo A. Gallo A. Bagnoli M. Boiocchi M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) have shown that the folate receptor is up-regulated on 90% of ovarian carcinomas, making the FR a potential target for this high mortality cancer. It has recently been described that tumor cells isolated from the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients internalize folate-conjugated albumin via the FR (19Ward C.M. Acheson N. Seymour L.W. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore folate-targeted toxins have the potential to be useful within a clinical setting. The targeting of gelonin to the cytoplasm of cells using other targeting ligands, such as transferrin (5Yazdi P.T. Wenning L.A. Murphy R.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3763-3771PubMed Google Scholar) and antibodies (23Sforzini S. Bolognesi A. Meazza R. Marciano S. Tazzari P.L. Stein H. Stirpe F. Ferrini S. J. Hematother. 1995; 4: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), has been shown to lead to target cell death. However, the receptors for these ligands are expressed on a range of neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. Therefore the use of these ligands may give rise to toxin uptake in non-target cells, a phenomenon not observed with folate-targeted conjugates (19Ward C.M. Acheson N. Seymour L.W. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Shinoda T. Takagi A. Maeda A. Kagatani S. Konno Y. Hashida M. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1521-1526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Wang S. Luo J. Lantrip D.A. Waters D.J. Mathias C.J. Green M.A. Fuchs P.L. Low P.S. Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).It has been reported that folate linked to a variety of proteins via amino conjugation has no effect on the binding of the conjugates to the FR (26Leamon C.P. Low P.S. Drug Discov. Today. 2001; 6: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We show that this is also true of folate-CO-gelonin and folate-S-gelonin. It has recently been shown, contrary to popular belief, that folate linked to proteins via the α- or γ-carboxyl group retain both receptor affinity and the ability to trigger endocytosis of the FR (27Leamon C.P. DePrince R.B. Hendren R.W. J. Drug Target. 1999; 7: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additionally, removal of the remaining unconjugated carboxyl group on folate-protein conjugates had no effect on their cell binding or uptake (27Leamon C.P. DePrince R.B. Hendren R.W. J. Drug Target. 1999; 7: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore folate is a versatile molecule that can withstand various conjugation chemistries. Such versatility may be advantageous for the formation of alternative folate-targeted proteins for use as cancer therapies.The effect of the two conjugation procedures on the activity of folate-gelonin in a cell-free translational assay is striking. Folate-S-gelonin exhibits the same IC50 as unmodified gelonin, implying that the presence of folate on the toxin has no detrimental effect. Since carbohydrate modification of plant toxins have not been reported before it is difficult to conclude the reasons for the retention of toxin activity, however, it is possible that the small size of folate is a factor. For example, it has recently been shown that the attachment of antibodies via terminal galactose residues of cobra venom factor leads to a 25% reduction in cobra venom factor activity (20Fu Q. Gowda C. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The large size of the antibody (150 kDa) compared with cobra venom factor (137 kDa) may lead to steric hindrance or physical obstruction of the cobra venom factor activity. Thus folate may not be large enough to exert steric hindrance on the toxin. Alternatively the folate may be located in a region of the toxin that is not dependent on activity, although the conjugation of a larger ligand to the same site could lead to steric hindrance.Conjugation of folate to gelonin via amino modification results in a 225-fold decrease in activity of the toxin. The effect of amino modification of gelonin on the ribosomal inactivating properties of the toxin has been previously reported, with the attachment of conconavilin A (3Stirpe F. Olsnes S. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6947-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or amino modification of the toxin (13Singh V. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 677-688PubMed Google Scholar) both leading to decreased ribosomal inactivating properties. The ribosomal inactivating properties of the toxin are extremely dependent on lysine residues within the protein (13Singh V. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 677-688PubMed Google Scholar). Since NHS-folate reacts with lysines it is likely that this is the reason for the loss of toxin activity in the folate-CO-gelonin conjugate. Trypsin digest of folate-CO-gelonin followed by mass spectroscopy analysis revealed no evidence of folate binding to a single amino residue (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that folate is linked to a number of sites within the toxin, resulting in a heterogeneous conjugate population. Whether the activity of folate-CO-gelonin at 10−7m (Fig. 4) is due to a small population of conjugates that retain 100% activity or an overall reduction in activity of the total population has yet to be established. The activity of folate-CO-gelonin at 10−7m may also be due to the presence of unmodified gelonin within the sample.It has been previously shown that gelonin is relatively non-toxic to HeLa cells (3Stirpe F. Olsnes S. Pihl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6947-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we show that 10−7mgelonin does not lead to decreased protein synthesis in this cell line. However, the ovarian cancer cell line Skov3 is more sensitive to gelonin, with decreased protein synthesis apparent at 10−7m of toxin. These differential effects may be due to altered uptake of the unconjugated toxin or reflect its differential intracellular trafficking within these cell lines. An unexpected effect of unmodified gelonin in both cell lines is the increase in protein synthesis above the control following toxin challenge. This could be due to increased translation of mRNA already present in the cytoplasm in an attempt to equilibrate cellular protein levels. Alternatively, it could reflect an increase in stress response factors stimulated by the presence of the toxin or its downstream by-products. This effect is also seen with folate-S-gelonin, although it is most prominent in the HeLa cell line.The prolonged protein synthesis inhibition exhibited by folate-S-gelonin in both cell lines shows that the conjugation of folate to the toxin is having an enhanced effect on the toxin activity. This may reflect increased uptake and cytoplasmic delivery of folate-S-gelonin compared with unmodified gelonin. Alternatively the half-life of folate-S-gelonin may be increased upon conjugation to folate, perhaps due to the folate moiety inhibiting cellular protein degradation processes. HeLa and Skov3 cell lines exhibit the same level of uptake of folate-protein conjugates over 8 h. 2C. M. Ward, unpublished data. If this is also true of folate-S-gelonin it suggests that the increased protein inhibition in Skov3 compared with HeLa cells is due to the increased sensitivity of Skov3 to the toxin, rather than increased uptake of the conjugate.In a clinical setting it is desirable to administer the lowest level of drug possible to achieve a therapeutic effect, thus decreasing any side effects to the patient and the overall cost of the treatment. There are several approaches that may be useful for increasing the potency of folate-S-gelonin. Conjugation of folate to multiple carbohydrate residues on gelonin is possible by increasing the stringency of the sugar oxidation reaction. Alternatively, the use of a branched peptide, such as di- or tri-lysine, would present several connecting points allowing the grafting of 2 or more folates per sugar residue. Such approaches may increase the avidity of folate-S-gelonin for the FR, as demonstrated by the attachment of multiple folate moieties to liposomes (8Wang S. Low P.S. J. Control Release. 1998; 53: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the uptake of folate-albumin-FITC conjugates in tumor cells freshly isolated from the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients is higher than that seen in both HeLa and Skov3 cell lines (up to 22-fold higher (19Ward C.M. Acheson N. Seymour L.W. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)).2 Therefore, the level of toxin required to inhibit protein synthesis in tumor cells within a clinical setting may be much lower than the levels used in this study. This, along with the optimization of the folate-S-gelonin conjugate, may enable the administration of much lower levels of the toxin to patients to achieve a therapeutic effect.Deglycosylated plant toxins exhibit increased half-lives in the blood (28Fulton R.J. Tucker T.F. Vitetta E.S. Uhr J.W. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2618-2625PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fulton R.J. Uhr J.W. Vitetta E.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2626-2631PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blakey D.C. Watson G.J. Knowles P.P. Thorpe P.E. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 947-952PubMed Google Scholar), probably due to decreased phagocytosis by scavenging receptors in the liver (28Fulton R.J. Tucker T.F. Vitetta E.S. Uhr J.W. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2618-2625PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fulton R.J. Uhr J.W. Vitetta E.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2626-2631PubMed Google Scholar, 31Magnusson S. Berg T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that the conjugation of folate to gelonin carbohydrate residues will lead to an increase in the blood circulation of the conjugate compared with toxin alone. Intravenous administration of folate-targeted conjugates to mice has been shown to lead to tumor accumulation of the conjugates, with minimal accumulation in other tissues (24Shinoda T. Takagi A. Maeda A. Kagatani S. Konno Y. Hashida M. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1521-1526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Wang S. Luo J. Lantrip D.A. Waters D.J. Mathias C.J. Green M.A. Fuchs P.L. Low P.S. Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore folate-S-gelonin may be a suitable candidate as an intravenous administered cancer therapy. Alternatively, the conjugate could be administered by intraperitoneal or intratumoral injection, thus providing an additional means of selectivity. The use of the conjugate as an intraperitoneal administered therapy is promising since it has already been shown that folate conjugates are internalized by tumor cells isolated from ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients (19Ward C.M. Acheson N. Seymour L.W. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).We have shown that the conjugation of folate to gelonin carbohydrate residues enables targeting of active t"

During the reductive half-reaction, the oxidized FAD accepts a hydride from the alcohol, and in the ensuing oxidative half-reaction, the reduced flavin transfers the redox equivalents to molecular oxygen, which is the final acceptor. COs are a group of enzymes isolated (and frequently secreted) from various microorganisms, they are characterized by a broad substrate specificity within the cholestan family. The first three-dimensional structure of a CO was that of the enzyme from Brevibacterium sp., which contains a noncovalently linked FAD (1Vrielink A. Lloyd L.F. Blow D.M. J. Mol.

Intriguingly, it has a different primary sequence, it contains a FAD covalently linked to N(1) of His69, and its three-dimensional structure belongs to a different family compared with the two COs mentioned above. 2R.

Biochem. 1999; 30: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar). With only the exception of glucose oxidase, CO is the most widely used enzyme in clinical laboratories (for a recent and exhaustive review on CO applications in analytical chemistry, see Ref. 9MacLachlan A.T.L. Wotherspoon R.O. Ansell C.J.W. Brooks J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 169-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). BCO catalysis proceeds via a ping-pong mechanism, whereas SCO follows a sequential pathway (10Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the two enzymes have similar rates of flavin reduction (∼230 s−1 in the presence of 1% Thesit and 10% propan-2-ol), the turnover number at infinite oxygen and cholesterol concentrations is higher for SCO than for BCO (202 s−1 and 105 s−1, respectively). Alcohols can be used as detergents and are useful for solubilizing steroids such as cholesterol. The effect of propan-2-ol on CO consists in an increase of enzyme activity with increasing concentration of the alcohol up to 10% (v/v) (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Gadda G. Ambrosius D. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biotech. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar). This has been attributed to the effect of the alcohol on the availability of substrate that is incorporated into micelles and to the decrease of the critical micelle concentration for cholesterol (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Gadda G. Ambrosius D. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biotech. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar). While SCO is slowly reduced by propan-2-ol under anaerobic conditions with 1.3 m propan-2-ol (half-time ≈86 min at 25 °C), BCO does not react under similar conditions (10Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The isomerization reaction (Scheme FS1) is efficiently catalyzed by the oxidized form of both enzymes and is never rate-limiting in catalysis. In the last few years, the reaction mechanism of CO has also received some attention (11Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and studies based on directed mutagenesis have been conducted (12Sampson N.S. Kass I.J. Ghoshroy K.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5770-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Up to now, more than 30 flavoenzymes have been reported to contain flavin covalently linked to a histidine, cysteine, or tyrosine residue of the polypeptide chain (6Decker K. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 343-393Google Scholar, 13Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The BCO used in the present work contains covalent flavin and is structurally distinct from the previously studied COs because it belongs to the subfamily of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase, that contains a fold proposed to favor covalent flavinylation (14Fraaije M.W. Van Berkel W.J. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the existence of covalent flavin-protein linkages has been known for many years, only recently has its mechanism of formation emerged and its functions been proposed (13Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar): (i) it allows saturation of the active site with the cofactor (particularly favorable for flavoenzymes that are localized in a flavin-deficient environment); (ii) it modifies the redox properties; (iii) it modulates substrate specificity; (iv) it protects the coenzyme from modification (i.e. hydroxylation) and inactivation; (v) it facilitates the electron transfer to another coenzyme; and (vi) it induces structural benefits such as improved protein stability. To elucidate the function of covalent flavin linkage in BCO, we have studied a mutant in which the exchange His69 → Ala prevents formation of the histidyl-FAD bond. This was also spurred on by the expected results of the study of the three-dimensional structure of BCO. Comparison of the structure of the present BCO with the crystal structure of the noncovalent CO from B. sterolicum, particularly in light of the data presented here, is expected to expand our understanding of the role of the flavin covalent attachment in flavoprotein oxidases. Cholesterol and ThesitTM(dodecyl poly(ethyleneglycol ether)n, n = 9–10) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were of the highest commercially available purity. Wild-type and H69A recombinant B. sterolicum CO, fromEscherichia coli, were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cholesterol oxidase activity was assayed at 25 °C monitoring H2O2 production at 440 nm (ε440 = 13 mm−1cm−1) in an enzyme-coupled assay with 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase and 16 mg/ml o-dianisidine as previously described (7Gadda G.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The isomerization reaction (Scheme FS1) is followed by monitoring the production of 4-cholesten-3-one from 5-cholesten-3-one spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (Δε240 = 15.5 mm−1cm−1) due to the formation of two conjugated double bonds. Another procedure used to assay the CO activity was the enzyme-monitored turnover (EMTN) method of Gibson et al.(15Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 259: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), in which the enzyme was mixed anaerobically with substrate in a stopped-flow instrument and the absorption change was monitored at 446 nm to follow reaction progress. At this wavelength the conversion of oxidized into reduced, enzyme bound flavin is detected. All concentrations mentioned in these experiments are those after mixing,i.e. at 1:1 dilution. Rapid reactions were routinely recorded in the 300–700 nm wavelength range with an acquisition time of 0.8 ms/spectrum and resolution of 1 nm, as detailed in Ref. 10Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Enzyme activity was assayed in 50 or 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% (v/v) Thesit and 1% or 10% (v/v) propan-2-ol. EMTN data were analyzed using traces at 446 nm according to the method of Gibson et al. (15Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 259: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and using KaleidaGraphTM (Synergy Software). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with an Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Extinction coefficients were determined by measuring the change in absorbance by heat denaturation (boiling 5 min in the dark). An extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm−1 cm−1 at 445 nm for free FAD and one of 10.6 mm−1 cm−1 at 445 nm for free 8Cl-FAD (8-chloro-FAD) were used. Photoreduction experiments were carried out at 15 °C using a cuvette containing ≈7.5 μm enzyme, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 μm 5-deazaflavin which had been rendered anaerobic by subjecting it to alternative cycles of vacuum and O2-free argon. The enzyme was photoirradiated (7Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the progress of the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically. Flavin and protein fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 15 °C. Protein fluorescence emission was monitored at 340 nm (λexc = 285 nm) and flavin fluorescence emission at 530 nm (λexc = 450 nm), using an excitation slits = 5 nm and an emission slit = 10 nm. The fluorescence data were analyzed using the Spectra Analysis Program (Jasco Corp.). The dissociation constant of the apoprotein-coenzyme complex was calculated using the Stinson equation (17Stinson R.A. Holbrook J. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and assuming a simple 1:1 equilibrium (PF ⇌ P+F),1/(1−a)=1/Kd([L0]/a−[E0]Equation 1 where a, fractional saturation of the total concentration of binding sites; Kd, dissociation constant of the enzyme-ligand complex; [L0], total ligand concentration; and [E0], total enzyme concentration. To determine the stability in solution of wild-type and H69A BCO, enzyme samples were incubated at 25 °C and at 0.1 mg/ml final protein concentration in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. To assess the effect of propan-2-ol on enzyme stability, the samples (0.1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the presence of 0–60% (v/v) propan-2-ol. In all cases, aliquots were retrieved periodically and assayed for cholesterol oxidase activity using the H2O2 peroxidase method. Redox potentials for the EFlox/EFlseq and EFlseq/EFlred couples of CO were determined using the dye equilibration (18Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) method with the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reduction system at 15 °C (19Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, New York1991: 59-66Google Scholar). An anaerobic cuvette containing ≈12 μm enzyme, 0.2 mm xanthine, 5 μm benzyl viologen, and 1–10 μm of the appropriate dye was purged of oxygen, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 10 nm xanthine oxidase. The reaction was measured spectrophotometrically until completion, typically 3–4 h. Data were analyzed as described by Minnaert (18Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of oxidized and reduced dye was determined at a wavelength at which the enzyme shows no absorbance (>500 nm), and the amount of oxidized and reduced enzyme was determined at an isosbestic point for the dye. The apoprotein of H69A BCO was prepared by overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 250 mmTris buffer, pH 8.5, containing 2.5 m KBr, 20% glycerol, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The sample was then desalted by gel permeation chromatography on a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25) equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. In comparison to wild-type BCO, the visible spectrum of the H69A mutant exhibits some differences both in the oxidized and reduced states (Fig.1). In addition to the main band in the visible, oxidized H69A BCO has a shoulder at ≈395 nm and lacks the band in the near UV typical of wild-type BCO. The spectrum of the mutant also exhibits a substantial increase in the extinction coefficient of the band at 444 nm (ε = 16.07 and 13.4 mm−1 cm−1 for H69A and wild-type BCO, respectively). Anaerobic addition of excess cholesterol results in full flavin reduction (Fig. 1), demonstrating that the noncovalently bound FAD mutant is competent in catalysis. The reduced form of H69A BCO is spectrally different from wild-type BCO in that the 376 nm band is replaced by a shoulder at ≈389 nm (Fig. 1). An anaerobic titration of H69A BCO with cholesterol is depicted in Fig. 1. The intercept of the initial slope of the titration curve with the maximal, observed absorbance change at 445 nm indicates a stoichiometry ≈1 for the reaction with substrate (16.3 nmol of enzyme and 18 nmol of substrate,inset of Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with wild-type and (8Cl-FAD)-H69A BCO (not shown). During the anaerobic titration with H69A BCO, a small absorbance at ≈550 nm is evident that might be attributed to formation of a small quantity of anionic radical. Stabilization of the anionic semiquinone is typical for cholesterol oxidase (7Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and for the family of flavoprotein oxidases (20Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Fed. Proc. U. S. A. 1964; 3: 18-29Google Scholar). The amount of semiquinone (EFlseq) formed by wild-type BCO upon anaerobic photoreduction is ≈70% of the extrapolated, possible maximum (Fig. 1). With the mutant this is reduced to ≤5% (Table I). Mutant and wild-type BCO display similar fluorescence emission spectra with maxima at 535 nm (λexc = 450 nm) and very low quantum yields (≈3% of the fluorescence of free FAD with wild-type BCO, and ≈10% with H69A BCO).Table ISpectral and redox properties of wild-type, H69A, and (8Cl-FAD)-H69A forms of BCOWild-typeaData from Ref. 7.H69A(8Cl-FAD)-H69ASpectral propertiesEFloxλmax (nm)275, 368, 448274, 389, 444272, 380, 444ɛ (mm−1 cm−1)170, 8.7, 13.4161.3, 11.3, 16.07403.6, 13.25, 20.5Absorbance ratios12.7, 0.65, 110.1, 0.7, 119.7, 0.65, 1Fluorescence emission λmax(nm)bλ excitation is 285 and 450 nm, respectively.325, 525336, 526334, 527EFlredλmax (nm)268, 362271, 406369, 438ɛ (mm−1cm−1)174.4, 7.3170.6, 5.512.28, 6.88EFlseqλmax (nm)382, 445BDcBD, below detection.384, 444ɛ (mm−1 cm−1)17.7, 4.0BD23.47, 11.18Semiquinone measured (%)70<5≈40Redox propertiesEm (mV)−101−204−160The enzyme solutions used for the absorbance spectra were ∼10 μm in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C; those for fluorescence spectra were ∼0.15 μm in the same buffer.

The measurements were made in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 15 °C in the presence of cresyl violet (Em = −176 mV) and phenosafranine (Em = −239 mV). The pKa value for the deprotonation of the flavin N(3)H position was estimated from the pH dependence of the visible spectrum of the oxidized enzymes. For wild-type BCO the pKa is ≈11 (7Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a value higher than that (pKa ≈10) of free FAD (21Müller F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-71Google Scholar). For H69A BCO a similar value was determined (pKa ≈11.1 ± 0.1). This confirms the absence of an effect of the covalent linkage specifically on this ionization process. The increase in pK observed for wild-type and H69A BCO compared with free FAD is likely to result from the microenvironment around the oxidized flavin pyrimidine: N(3)-H forms a tight H-bond (2.8 Å) with the backbone His202C(1)=O. The Arg477 guanidinium group is at 3.1 Å from the flavin C(4)=O and can make hydrogen bond contacts directly with the side chains of both Glu475 and Glu311, this interaction likely neutralizing its charge.2 The stability of BCO in solution was studied by assessing the activity of each enzyme form at 25 °C in the presence of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and as a function of time. Both wild-type and H69A cholesterol oxidases maintained more than 90% of the initial activity after 300 min at 25 °C (Fig. 2). The effect of organic solvents, surfactants, and ionic strength on CO catalysis is fundamental, since these factors affect the solubility of steroid substrates (very low in aqueous media), the micellar composition of the system and the enzyme activity (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Gadda G. Ambrosius D. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biotech. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of propan-2-ol in the final concentration range 0–60% (v/v) on the time dependent activity of the two enzymes (shown in Fig. 2). Somewhat surprisingly, the (in)stability of the H69A mutant is quite comparable to that of wild-type BCO (Fig. 2), the main difference being the ≈30% residual activity observed with wild-type BCO at 20% propan-2-ol after 300 min, where H69A BCO is completely inactivated. The reaction of H69A BCO with cholesterol was studied using the H2O2 assay (7Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Gadda G. Ambrosius D. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biotech. Appl.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the EMTN method (15Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 259: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) under standard conditions (50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Thesit, 1 or 10% propan-2-ol). With the first assay, and at a fixed (21%) O2concentration, a strong decrease in catalytic activity is evident for the H69A mutant: kcat is reduced 30-fold andKm increased 6-fold compared with the wild-type BCO (Table II). Although thekcat values are quite similar at 1 and 10% (v/v) propan-2-ol, the increase in the alcohol concentration resulted in a sharp increase in the Km value for cholesterol and with both wild-type and H69A COs. As wild-type BCO, the mutant catalyzes the isomerization reaction, i.e. the conversion of 5-cholesten-3-one, the assumed intermediate, into 4-cholesten-3-one, the final product (Scheme FS1). Comparison of the rate of isomerization with those for oxidation of cholesterol (Table II) show that the Δ5–6 → Δ4–5 isomerization step is not rate-limiting for either enzyme, the kcat for the isomerization step being 150 s−1 and 28 s−1 for wild-type and H69A BCO, respectively.Table IIKinetic parameters for the reaction of wild-type, H69A, and (8Cl-FAD)-H69A forms of BCO with cholesterol (oxidation) and 5-cholesten-3-one (isomerization)ConditionsOxidation (A)Isomerization (B)kcatKm,cholkcatKm,5-chol-3-ones−1mms−1mmWild-typeaData from Ref. 7.1% Thesit, 1% propan-2-ol480.041% Thesit, 10% propan-2-ol430.251500.37H69A1% Thesit, 1% propan-2-ol1.40.261% Thesit, 10% propan-2-ol1.41.3280.35(8Cl-FAD)-H69A1% Thesit, 1% propan-2-ol6.70.951% Thesit, 10% propan-2-ol5.21.6200.58Measurements were in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C.

The kinetic mechanism of BCO with cholesterol as the substrate was recently studied by a combination of steady state and pre-steady state approaches (10Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on these results, BCO was proposed to work via a ping-pong (binary complex) mechanism. The steady state kinetic behavior of H69A BCO was analogously studied using the EMTN method and cholesterol as the substrate. The oxidized enzyme was mixed aerobically with cholesterol and the change in flavin absorption monitored at 446 nm. A very rapid decrease in absorption was observed, amounting to ≈15% of the total change (data not shown). The value is significantly smaller than the one observed for the wild-type BCO (≈60%) which is due to the particular kinetic situation in which the rates of flavin reduction and reoxidation are similar (10Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The smaller amplitude of the 446 nm absorbance change observed with the H69A BCO indicates that in the noncovalent mutant the rate of enzyme reduction is significantly decreased in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. The initial decrease in absorption was followed by a stationary phase, the duration of which depends on the initial cholesterol concentration and which leads to the fully reduced enzyme as the final state. The 446-nm traces were analyzed as a function of oxygen concentration according to Ref. 15Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 259: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar; the kinetic parameters obtained are given in TableIII. The double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plot of the turnover number as a function of substrate concentration always gave a set of parallel lines, suggesting that a ping-pong mechanism is still operative for the H69A BCO. EMTN experiments confirm that the absence of covalent flavin linkage in BCO results in a large decrease in the turnover number and in a large increase in the ΦChol term of the steady state equation (Table III).Table IIIComparison of steady-state coefficients obtained for the reaction of wild-type and H69A BCO with cholesterol as substrate in stopped-flow experimentsLineweaver-Burk patternkcatΦCholKm,CholΦO2KmO2s−1m s × 10−6mmm s × 10−6mmWild-typeaData from Ref. 10.Parallel19.2120.217.30.14H69AParallel0.554950.47250.45Measurements were in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1% propan-2-ol, and 1% Thesit, at 25 °C.a Data from Ref. 10Pollegioni L.

https://openalex.org/W2038310113,"Previous studies have established that ligation of keratinocyte α2β1integrin by type I collagen induces expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and that MMP-1 activity is required for the α2β1 integrin-dependent migration of primary keratinocytes across collagenous matrices. We now present evidence that MMP-1 binds the α2β1integrin via the I domain of the α2 integrin subunit. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified human MMP-1 and recombinant α2 integrin I domain, we showed that the α2 integrin I domain specifically bound in a divalent cation-dependent manner to both the pro and active forms of MMP-1, but not to MMP-3 or MMP-13. Although both the I domain and MMP-1 bind divalent cations, MMP-1 bound, in a divalent cation-dependent manner, to α2 integrin I domains containing metal ion-dependent adhesion sites motif mutations that prevent divalent cation binding to the I domain, demonstrating that the metal ion dependence is a function of MMP-1. Using a series of MMP-1-MMP-3 and MMP-1-MMP-13 chimeras, we determined that both the linker domain and the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-1 were required for optimal binding to the I domain. The α2 integrin/MMP-1 interaction described here extends an emerging paradigm in matrix biology involving anchoring of proteinases to the cell surface to regulate their biological activities. Previous studies have established that ligation of keratinocyte α2β1integrin by type I collagen induces expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and that MMP-1 activity is required for the α2β1 integrin-dependent migration of primary keratinocytes across collagenous matrices. We now present evidence that MMP-1 binds the α2β1integrin via the I domain of the α2 integrin subunit. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified human MMP-1 and recombinant α2 integrin I domain, we showed that the α2 integrin I domain specifically bound in a divalent cation-dependent manner to both the pro and active forms of MMP-1, but not to MMP-3 or MMP-13.

Remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix is a vital component of physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as development and differentiation, cell migration, angiogenesis, wound healing, and metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 play a central role in the turnover of extracellular matrix components (1Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). MMPs constitute a large family of metal-dependent endo-proteases with varying substrate specificities for many extracellular proteins. The structure of native triple helical type I collagen makes it resistant to proteolysis, and only six MMPs, MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-14 (MT1-MMP), MMP-18, and MMP-2, exhibit an ability to cleave native fibrillar collagen within its triple helical domain (2Fields G.B.

Similar to most MMPs, the collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13) have several structural features in common, including an N-terminal pro-domain, a catalytic domain, and a short proline-rich linker connected to a hemopexin-like domain at the C terminus (9Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain contains a Zn2+-binding site that is conserved in all MMPs and is required for catalytic activity (10Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Stockler W.

During cutaneous wound healing, human keratinocytes express MMP-1 while migrating over the type I collagen-rich dermis. This spatially and temporally confined expression of MMP-1 is induced by ligation of the α2β1 integrin by dermal type I collagen (19Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Both migration and MMP-1 expression induced by type I collagen are inhibited by function blocking antibodies against the α2β1 integrin, but not by antibodies directed against the α1 β1 or α3β1 integrins (19Pilcher B.K.

Previous studies have established the role of the α2β1 integrin as a receptor for type I collagen, as well as for type IV collagen, laminins, echovirus 1 and 8, and rotaviruses (20Dickeson S.K.

Virus Res. 2001; 76: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence have revealed that the I domain of the α2 integrin subunit mediates the binding of the α2β1 integrin to its ligands (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, the α2β1 integrin-binding site for collagen and the epitopes recognized by antibodies that block type I collagen binding to the integrin map to the I domain of the α2 integrin subunit (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant α2 integrin I domain specifically binds all known ligands of the α2β1 integrin, including collagens, laminin, the C-terminal propeptide of type I collagen, and echovirus 1 and 8 (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Ohman T. King S.L. Krithivas A. Cunnigham J. Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Bergelson J.M.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29368-29374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that, in addition to inducing expression of MMP-1, the α2β1 integrin also directly binds MMP-1. In this paper, we show that MMP-1 binds to the I domain of the α2 integrin subunit, and we define the structural basis of the interaction. The cloning and expression of the α2integrin subunit I domain has been described elsewhere (24Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA of full-length α2 integrin was used as a template in the polymerase chain reaction to produce a fragment that encodes Ser124 through Met349 of the published α2 sequence (25Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were designed such that the amplification product would contain a BglII site at the 5′-end and a XhoI site at the 3′-end. The products were digested, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into aBglII-XhoI-digested pGEX-5x-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which is a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expression vector. The cDNA of the full-length α1 integrin (Dr. Eugene E. Marcantonio, Columbia University) was used as a template to amplify the α1 I domain. As with the α2 construct, this cDNA encodes for Ser124 through Met349 of the published α1 sequence (26Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the α2 integrin I domain, the PCR primers were designed with a 5′ BglII site and a 3′ XhoI site, and the resulting product was cloned into the pGEX-5x-1 vector. The purification of the α1 and α2 integrin I domains have been described elsewhere (24Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, DH5α Escherichia coli containing the appropriate plasmid were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of 2× yeast extract/tryptone buffer until A 550 reached 0.3–0.4. The cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and returned to the incubator for 3 h. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 2,600 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −70 °C until needed. The GST-I fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized exactly as recently described (24Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The glutamate at position 254 or 151 of the α2 integrin I domain sequence was replaced with an alanine in a single mutagenesis reaction using pBluescript/α2 I. The 966-base pair BSTBI-XhoI fragment of pBluescript and the 4669-base pairXhoI-BST BI fragment of pGEX-5x-1/α2 I were isolated and ligated to create pGEX-5x-1/D151A or D254A. The sequences of the cDNAs used in this study, including all of the chimeras, were determined using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing method (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were compared with the published α2 sequenced (25Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 26Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human pro-MMP-1 was purified by two-step chromatography from conditioned medium of interleukin-1-treated dermal fibroblasts cultured as described (27Busiek D.F. Baragi V. Nehring L.C. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6484-6491PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate prodomain and activated MMP-1, autolysis of pro-MMP-1 was induced with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and the two fragments were separated by size selection dialysis in 0.5 ml of 0.05m Tris-HCl, 0.01 m CaCl2 using a 10,000 Molecular Weight Cut-Off Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce). The construction of these chimeras has been described elsewhere (28Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs for MMP-1, MMP-3, or MMP-13 cDNAs in the pET3a (Novagen, Madison, WI) vector were used as templates for overlapping PCR. To generate the N-terminal portion of the chimera, PCR was performed with the sense T7 promoter primer and an antisense chimeric junction primer containing the N-terminal MMP sequence at the 5′-end and a portion of the C-terminal MMP sequence at the 3′-end. To construct the C-terminal portion of the chimera, PCR was performed with an antisense primer containing plasmid sequence and a sense chimeric junction primer containing C-terminal MMP sequence at the 5′-end and N-terminal MMP sequence at the 3′-end; this sequence overlapped with the previous chimeric junction primer. These two fragments were then used as template in a final PCR reaction, along with the sense T7 promoter primer and the antisense pET3a primer to construct the full-length chimera. The PCR product was cut with NdeI andBamHI, cloned into pET3a vector, and sequenced at the Biotech Facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The MMP chimeras were expressed and purified as described previously. Briefly, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells, and protein production was induced upon addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The proteins were resuspended from inclusion bodies in 8 m urea and purified over a High Q Support Anion Support column (Bio-Rad). The proteins were refolded in dialysis as described previously (28Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and folded proteins were further purified by chromatography on Green A Dyematrex column (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Immulon 2, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 ml/well of 30 µg/ml type I collagen from calf skin (Sigma) or BSA or 10 µg/ml pro-MMP-1, activated MMP-1, propeptide from MMP-1, or chimeric MMP. The wells were then washed twice with 0.15 ml of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 0.15 ml of 300 µg/ml BSA in Tris-buffered saline. Purified recombinant I domain proteins were diluted to the desired concentration in wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, 30 µg/ml BSA, and 2 mmMnCl2, MgCl2, EDTA, or CaCl2). The wells were washed once with 0.15 ml of the appropriate wash buffer, and then 0.1 ml of each recombinant protein was added and allowed to interact with the collagen or MMP substrate at room temperature for 1.5 h. The wells were then washed with 0.15 ml of the appropriate wash buffer, and 0.1 ml of a 1:8000 dilution of anti-GST antiserum in the appropriate wash buffer was added for 1 h at room temperature. Again the wells were washed three times, and then a 1:20,000 dilution of pig anti-goat IgG secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the appropriate wash buffer was added per well for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were again washed three times, and 0.1 ml of tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride, prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, was added per well. After 10 min of substrate conversion, the reactions were stopped with 0.025 ml of 4 nH2SO4, and the plates were read at 450 nm. Human monocytes were isolated from blood and differentiated in culture to macrophages as described (27Busiek D.F. Baragi V. Nehring L.C. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6484-6491PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared as described (23Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Stricker T.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Roby J.D. Santoro S.A. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29368-29374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The α1integrin subunit was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). MMP-1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using MAB1346 (Chemicon). The products were resolved through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to membranes. Immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated MMP-1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (19Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) as described (23Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Stricker T.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Roby J.D. Santoro S.A. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29368-29374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In our accompanying paper (23Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Stricker T.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29368-29374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we used co-immunoprecipitation and platelet adhesion to demonstrate that MMP-1 binds to the α2β1 integrin. The 226-amino acid I domain of the α2 subunit mediates binding of all identified ligands of the α2β1 integrin. As a GST fusion protein, recombinant I domain provides a reliable reporter in a solid phase binding assay. Wells were coated with collagen or with pro or activated forms of MMP-1, MMP-3, or MMP-9, enzymes that are expressed by keratinocytes in wounded skin (13Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Madlener M. Parks W.C. Werner S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 242: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mn2+, which shifts α2β1 to a more active state (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), soluble I domain bound to both pro and active MMP-1 (Fig. 1). The level of binding to MMP-1 was equivalent to that detected for collagen, used as a positive control. Of note, we found that the I domain still bound appreciable levels of pro and active MMP-1 in the presence of EDTA, which abolished binding to collagen (Fig. 1). Next, we sought to establish whether the pro or active forms of MMP-1 were ligands for the α2 integrin I domain and whether the prodomain bound directly. Fig.2 A demonstrates that the α2 integrin I domain binds to both pro-MMP-1 and activated MMP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. No binding to BSA was observed. To determine whether the slight difference observed between the binding of α2 integrin I domain to pro-MMP-1 and active MMP-1 was a result of a binding interaction between the I domain and the propeptide, we also investigated the binding of I domain to the propeptide of MMP-1. Although activated MMP-1, which lacks the propeptide, bound to of the α2integrin I domain, the purified propeptide failed to bind (Fig.2 B). Thus the propeptide of MMP-1 is not directly involved in the interaction between the α2 integrin I domain and pro-MMP-1. This conclusion is further supported by the data from experiments with MMP chimeras shown in Fig. 6. The small difference observed between the binding of pro-MMP-1 and activated MMP-1 is most likely due to differences in coating efficiency, because the difference is in the amount of α2 integrin I domain bound at saturation. Additionally, the binding data were best described by a single binding site with half-maximal binding for both active and proMMP-1 occurring between 10 and 40 nm, depending upon the experiment. There was no significant difference between the half-maximal binding of α2 I domain to pro or active MMP-1. These data indicate that both the pro and active forms of MMP-1 are ligands for the α2 integrin I domain, but, as suggested in our accompanying paper (23Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Stricker T.P.

In the chimeras, entire domains are replaced with corresponding domains from either MMP-3 or MMP-13. B, the binding of the α2 integrin I domain (12.5 nm) to chimeras 3-1-1, 3-3-1, 1-1-13, and 13-13-1, as well as controls pro-MMP-1, proMMP-3, pro-MMP-13, and BSA was measured in a solid phase binding assay. The microtiter plates were coated with one of the matrix metalloproteinases or chimeras or BSA at a concentration of 10 µg/ml. Binding was determined in 2 mm Mn2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further characterize MMP-1 binding to the α2 integrin I domain, we studied the divalent cation dependence of this interaction. The different ligands for the α2β1 integrin differ in their dependence upon divalent cations for binding (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both Mn2+ and Mg2+ support I domain binding to collagen, whereas Ca2+ does not (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Predictably, EDTA completely inhibits the binding of collagens to the I domain (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, binding of echovirus 1 to the α2 integrin I domain is divalent cation-independent (30Dickeson S.K. Mathis N.L. Rahman M. Bergelson J.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32182-32191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The metal dependence of I domain interaction with ligands is mediated by the divalent cation-binding site called the MIDAS motif (31Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The catalytic and hemopexin domains of MMP-1 also bind divalent cations (12Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Struct. Fold Des. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because both MMP-1 and the α2 integrin I domain contain divalent cation-binding sites, any divalent cation dependence of MMP-1 binding to the α2 integrin I domain could arise from either or both the MMP and the I domain. Fig. 3 demonstrates that both 2 mm Mn2+ and 2 mmMg2+ supported binding of α2 integrin I domain to pro-MMP-1 and to collagen. As shown previously (24Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), 2 mm EDTA abolishes the binding of the α2integrin I domain to type I collagen; however, a significant component (about 50–60%) of the binding of α2 integrin I domain to pro-MMP-1 was retained in 2 mm EDTA, indicating a fundamental difference in the binding of the α2 integrin I domain to MMP-1 as compared with collagen type I. These results suggest that there are two components to the α2 integrin I domain MMP-1 interaction: a metal-dependent component and a metal-independent component. As expected, 2 mmCa2+ did not support binding of the α2integrin I domain to collagen. In contrast, 2 mmCa2+ effectively supported binding of the α2integrin I domain to pro-MMP-1. Because Ca2+ does not bind to the I domain MIDAS motif (24Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the metal enhancement of I domain binding to MMP-1 observed in the presence of Ca2+ and the significant difference in metal cation dependence between the α2 integrin I domain-collagen interaction and the α2 integrin I domain/MMP-1 interaction suggest that the metal dependence of the MMP-1/α2 integrin I domain interaction may arise from the MMP-1 rather than from the I domain. These results indicate that there are critical differences between the binding of α2 integrin I domain to collagen as opposed to pro-MMP-1. To investigate further the metal dependence of the MMP-1/α2 integrin I domain interaction, we utilized I domains with either of two point mutations in the MIDAS motif of the α2 integrin I domain. D256A and D151A both result in loss of essential metal coordinating side chains within the MIDAS motif of the α2 integrin I domain (31Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). As expected, these mutants do not bind collagen in either the presence or absence of divalent cations (Fig. 4 A). However, the mutant I domains retained the ability to bind to pro-MMP-1 in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mn2+. Divalent cation-dependent binding of the MIDAS motif mutants to pro-MMP-1 was comparable with that of wild-type I domain, even though the divalent cation chelation site of the I domain had been disrupted (Fig. 4 B). Both the wild-type and mutant α2integrin I domains bound to pro-MMP-1 to a lesser extent in the presence of EDTA, again indicating both a metal-dependent, as well as a metal-independent, component of binding. These results further demonstrate that the divalent cation requirement for the optimal binding of MMP-1 by the α2 integrin I domain derives from the MMP and not the I domain. Like the α2β1 integrin, the α1β1 integrin is a cell surface collagen receptor that contains a structurally similar I domain (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As with the α2 I domain, recombinantly expressed α1I domain recapitulates the binding properties of the full-length α1β1 integrin (20Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested the binding of the α1 integrin I domain to pro-MMP-1. As observed with the α2 integrin I domain, Ca2+ and Mn2+ supported binding of pro-MMP-1 by the α1 I domain. In 2 mm EDTA, both I domains showed a significant degree of metal-independent binding to pro-MMP-1, again suggesting the presence of both metal-dependent and metal-independent interactions (Fig.5 A). The binding of pro-MMP-1 to the α1β1 integrin was confirmed in intact cells by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Monocytic U937 cells were differentiated to macrophages in culture, and then MMP-1 and α1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation with both anti-α1 integrin and anti-MMP-1 antibodies precipitated nearly equivalent amounts of MMP-1 derived from the cell layer (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that most of the MMP-1 was bound to the cell surface via α1β1. As described above, pro-MMP-1 contains an N-terminal propeptide, a catalytic domain, and a short proline-rich linker connected to a hemopexin-like domain (12Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Struct. Fold Des. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although the data shown in Fig. 2 suggest that the propeptide sequence of MMP-1 does not mediate the binding by the α2 integrin I domain, we were interested in determining in greater detail which domain(s) of MMP-1 are required for binding to α2 integrin I domain. To address this question, we used MMP chimeras in which domains of MMP-1 were replaced with the equivalent domains of either MMP-3 or MMP-13, neither of which binds the α2 integrin I domain (Fig.6 B). To name the chimeras, the principal domains (namely, the propeptide and catalytic domain, the linker, and the hemopexin-like domain) were assigned a number corresponding to the MMP from which they originated. Thus, pro-MMP-1 was designated 1-1-1, and proMMP-3 was 3-3-3 (Fig."

The MDM2 protein is likely to be extensively modified in vivo, and such modification may regulate its functions in cells. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) site in murine MDM2, and found the protein to be efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by cyclin A-containing complexes (cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK1), but MDM2 was either weakly or not phosphorylated by other cyclin-containing complexes. Moreover, a peptide containing a putative MDM2 cyclin recognition motif specifically inhibited phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2. The site of cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylation was identified as Thr-216 by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and mutational analysis. Phosphorylation of MDM2 at Thr-216 both weakens its interaction with p53 and modestly augments its binding to p19ARF. Interestingly, an MDM2-specific monoclonal antibody, SMP14, cannot recognize MDM2 phosphorylated at Thr-216. Changes in SMP14 reactivity of MDM2 in staged cell extracts indicate that phosphorylation of MDM2 at Thr-216 in vivo is most prevalent at the onset of S phase when cyclin A first becomes detectable.

Yang-Feng T. Francke U. George D.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Its potential pro-oncogenic activity was supported by the observation that amplification or overexpression of MDM2 promotes tumorigenesis in NIH 3T3 or Rat2 cell lines (2Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In cooperation with ras, MDM2 overexpression can also promote transformation of primary rodent fibroblasts (3Finlay C.A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) further suggests that it is a proto-oncogene that promotes cell proliferation. The murine MDM2 protein contains several conserved functional regions. Its N terminus encodes a domain that interacts with p53 (residues 26–108) (5Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and to interact with proteins. The C terminus of MDM2 contains a RING finger domain (residues 442–481) that is important for ubiquitin-mediated degradation or SUMO-mediated stabilization of p53 (12Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 13Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). One important function of the MDM2 protein is to down-regulate p53 protein levels and p53 activity (reviewed in Refs. 15Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 16Momand J. Wu H.H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In response to various cellular stresses, the active p53 protein regulates numerous effectors that are involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or other cellular processes (reviewed in Ref. 17Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The interaction between the N terminus of MDM2 and p53 proteins is important for inhibiting p53-mediated transactivation (18Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 19Leng P. Brown D.R. Shivakumar C.V. Deb S. Deb S.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1275-1282PubMed Google Scholar) as well as for targeting p53 for degradation (20Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 21Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 22Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). In turn, the p53 protein can bind to the promoter of MDM2 and activate MDM2 transcription (23Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). This feedback loop between MDM2 and p53 fine-tunes the cellular responses after p53 activation (24Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Another tumor suppressor protein, p19ARF, can also bind to a region of MDM2 spanning its central acidic domain (25Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G.

In some cases p19ARF renders MDM2 inactive in regulating p53 protein by translocating MDM2 into the nucleolus (29Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 30Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Curr.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The importance of MDM2 in p53 down-regulation has also been shown by genetic analysis.Mdm2-null mouse embryos die by day 5 of gestation, whereas mice null for both the mdm2 and p53 genes are viable (32Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 33Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). The rescue of embryonic lethality ofmdm2-null mice by p53 deletion implies that the MDM2 protein is essential for p53 regulation during early embryogenesis. In addition to its interaction with the p53 protein, MDM2 possesses other activities that promote cell proliferation. It was reported to interact with and stimulate the S phase promoting factor E2F1 (34Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 35Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). MDM2 also binds to the retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressor proteinin vitro and inhibits the growth regulatory function of pRb (36Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In transforming growth factor-β-resistant human breast cancer cells, MDM2 overexpression is correlated with a failure to produce the growth inhibitory form of pRb and to reduce E2F1 protein levels after transforming growth factor-β treatment (37Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This regulation is independent of the p53 status of the cells. Genetic studies of transgenic mice with targeted MDM2 overexpression in the mammary gland also elucidate the effect of MDM2 in promoting cell cycle progression, especially entry into S phase (38Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 39Reinke V. Bortner D.M. Amelse L.L. Lundgren K. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Lozano G. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). MDM2 transgenic mice have abnormal mammary gland development and a high incidence of mammary tumors. Over-production of MDM2 protein uncouples S phase from mitosis, which leads to the production of mammary epithelial cells that are polyploid and have nuclear abnormalities. P53 deletion has no effect on this phenotype and neither does E2F1 deletion or overexpression. The uncoupling of S phase has been correlated with elevated cyclin A but not cyclin E or cyclin D mRNA levels in MDM2-overexpressing cells (38Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). MDM2 expression was reported to lead to the activation of the cyclin A promoter (10Leveillard T. Wasylyk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30651-30661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This may be related to interactions of MDM2 with components of the basal transcription factor TFIID; the MDM2 C-terminal RING finger domain interacts with TAFII250, and the region close to the acidic domain interacts with the TATA-binding protein TBP (10Leveillard T.

Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression depends on the formation of active cyclin-CDK1 complexes that are regulated by the synthesis and degradation of cyclins, their state of phosphorylation, and their association with inhibitory subunits (reviewed in Refs. 42Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 43Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 44Murray A.

Cyclin A, which forms complexes with CDK2 at the beginning of S phase and CDK1 at the beginning of M phase, is required for entry into S phase, passage through G2, and mitosis (46Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 47Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G.

The substrates of cyclin A-CDK2 include a number of proteins including the p53 protein (50Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). MDM2 is likely to be extensively regulated by phosphorylation. More than one third of the amino acids on the MDM2 protein are either serine or threonine residues, and the MDM2 protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo, especially in the N terminus and the central acidic domain (51Hay T.J. Meek D.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) (52Khosravi R. Maya R. Gottlieb T. Oren M. Shiloh Y. Shkedy D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14973-14977Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), DNA-dependent protein kinase (53Mayo L.D. Turchi J.J. Berberich S.J.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) can phosphorylate MDM2 proteins and modulate MDM2 functions. Murine MDM2 has at least one potential site for CDK phosphorylation. We report here that cyclin A-CDK complexes are unique in their ability to efficiently phosphorylate MDM2 and that this phosphorylation affects the interactions of MDM2 with proteins. A construct expressing GST-MDM2 was provided kindly by M. Oren (Weizmann Institute). Mutant GST-MDM2 T216A and T384A constructs were generated from wild-type GST-MDM2 using the Stratagene QuickChange® mutagenesis kit. Bacterially expressed GST-MDM2 proteins were purified from glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). Complexes containing cyclin E and CDK2 (300 ng of cyclin E and 600 ng of CDK2 in 10 µl), cyclin A and CDK2 (200 ng of cyclin A and 300 ng of CDK2 in 10 µl), cyclin B and CDK1 (12 ng of cyclin B and 25 ng of CDK1 in 10 µl), or cyclin A and CDK1 (10 ng of cyclin A and 150 ng of CDK1 in 10 µl) were purified from extracts of insect Sf9 cells that had been co-infected with these respective pairs of recombinant baculoviruses as described previously (50Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A purified complex containing cyclin D1 and CDK4 was provided generously by Y. Taya (56Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K.

The murine p53 protein was isolated from extracts of baculovirus-infected insect cells by immunoaffinity purification over a PAb 421 column as described previously (57Wang E.H. Friedman P.N.

Sherr and was purified from bacteria as described (58Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell.

Kinase assay mixtures (30 µl) contained kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 µm ATP, and 4 µCi of γ-[32P]ATP) and 100 ng of purified GST-MDM2, pRb, or histone H1 proteins as substrates. Cyclin-CDK complexes were added into reaction mixtures, which were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and then resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were either silver-stained or stained with Coomassie Blue to detect protein levels before exposure to x-ray film. Peptides used in the cyclin recognition motif experiments were synthesized by Synpep. 32P-labeled GST-MDM2 (1 µg) was phosphorylated by cyclin A-CDK2 as described above and then run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. The phosphorylated GST-MDM2 full-length protein was then cut out and eluted from the gel slice in buffer containing 0.05 mNH4HCO3 (pH 7.3), 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% SDS. The eluted proteins were acid-precipitated and oxidized as described (59Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) and then digested with 10 µl of V8 protease (1 µg/µl) at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 µl of buffer containing 0.05 m NH4HCO3 (pH 7.3) (60Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Breddam K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The proteolytically digested MDM2 was subjected to electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer in the first dimension and chromatography in phospho-buffer (N-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/H2O, 15:10:3:12) in the second dimension as described (59Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed murine wild-type p53 protein (50 ng) or bacterially expressed p19ARF-N-37 peptide (20 ng) was used to coat each well in a 96-well Pro-bind plate (Falcon) in 200 µl of PBS for 2 h in 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween and then incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST-MDM2 (15–180 ng) in 200 µl of PBS was then added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Roscovitine (10 µm) was present in the PBS to prevent the kinase from phosphorylating the coating protein. The wells were washed briefly three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, at which time an anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody and either a 1:1000 dilution of purified mAb SMP14 (200 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a 1:40 dilution of mAb 4B11 hybridoma supernatant (generously provided by A. Levine) in blocking buffer was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, a 1:2000 dilution of monoclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in blocking buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After five washes, 10 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma) in 100 mm 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (Sigma) was added to the wells. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 10-min intervals using a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader. The amount of MDM2 bound to the coating protein was calculated from the change in absorbance at different time points. Each data point is an average of readings from triplicate wells. Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Log-phase cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h before being released into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell cultures (1 plate each) were collected at different time points and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. The cells were scraped, centrifuged at 1500 rpm in 4 °C, and then lysed in extraction buffer (PBS containing 2% SDS and 10 mm iodoacetamide). Extracts were then heated at 95 °C for 10 min and sonicated for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce), and 150 µg of each extract was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüell). MDM2 protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-MDM2 antibodies, either mAb SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mAb 3G5 hybridoma supernatant (a gift from Dr. A. Levine). The same blots were also probed with an anti-cyclin A polyclonal antibody H437 or an anti-cyclin B monoclonal antibody Ab-2 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Duplicate plates of cells at each time point were collected and processed for FACS analysis. GST-tagged proteins in kinase reaction mixtures were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 µl of ice-cold TEGN washing buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 2500 rpm, washed twice with TEGN buffer, and blocked in 200 µl of TEGN buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Beads containing 100 ng of GST-tagged protein were rocked with mouse p53 protein in 200 µl of TEGN buffer at 4 °C for 1 h, washed five times with the same buffer, and then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. GST-MDM2 and mouse p53 protein were detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-MDM2 rabbit polyclonal antibody or a mixture of mouse p53 monoclonal antibodies (PAb 242, PAb 246, and PAb 248). Examination of the sequence of murine MDM2 protein indicated that there are two possible CDK sites in the protein at residues 216 (TPSH) and 384 (TPLS). In fact, Thr-216–Pro-217 is conserved between murine and human (Thr-218–Pro-219) MDM2. Using bacterially expressed full-length murine GST-MDM2 as the substrate, we performed in vitro kinase assays with increasing amounts of purified cyclin A-CDK2 complex (Fig.1). GST-MDM2 was phosphorylated by cyclin A-CDK2 in a dose-dependent fashion. At the highest level of kinase complex added, the mobility of MDM2 protein was shifted completely to a slower migrating form, indicating that it had been efficiently phosphorylated (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and7). To ensure that the phosphorylation observed was the result of cyclin A-CDK2 activity rather than a contaminating kinase, we used a CDK2 inhibitor roscovitine (ID50 = 700 nm, specific for CDK1 and CDK2) (61Rudolph B. Saffrich R. Zwicker J. Henglein B. Muller R. Ansorge W. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3065-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 62Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The incorporation of label from [32P]ATP was substantially decreased by roscovitine with a concomitant increase in electrophoretic mobility of the MDM2 polypeptide when compared with the phosphorylated form (Fig.1, compare lanes 7 and 8). We then investigated the abilities of other cyclin-CDK complexes to phosphorylate GST-MDM2. The activities of the complexes were normalized using either histone H1 or pRb as a positive control. Although the cyclin E-CDK2 complex has the same kinase component as cyclin A-CDK2, it only very weakly phosphorylated GST-MDM2 (Fig.2A, lanes 6–9). Cyclin D1-CDK4 was also impaired in phosphorylating GST-MDM2 when compared with its ability to phosphorylate pRb protein (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and4). It is interesting as well that the cyclin B-CDK1 complex phosphorylated GST-MDM2 more modestly than did cyclin A-CDK2 (Fig.2 C, lanes 5–8) even though, as expected, both kinases phosphorylated histone H1 to roughly the same extent. Because cyclin A has been shown to form a complex with CDK1 at the onset of mitosis (47Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), we then compared the abilities of purified cyclin A-CDK1 and cyclin B-CDK1 complexes to phosphorylate GST-MDM2 in vitro (Fig. 2 D). Indeed, cyclin A-CDK1 phosphorylated GST-MDM2 and, similar to cyclin A-CDK2, did so more effectively than cyclin B-CDK1. Therefore, cyclin A-containing CDK complexes are the most effective in phosphorylating the MDM2 protein. To identify the CDK site(s) in MDM2, either Thr-216 or Thr-384 was mutated to alanine in full-length GST-MDM2, and wild-type and T216A or T384A MDM2 proteins were purified from bacteria and treated with cyclin A-CDK2 in mixtures containing [32P]ATP. We then performed two-dimensional mapping of phosphopeptides generated from V8 protease digestion of phosphorylated wild-type or mutant proteins. In the map of the phosphorylated wild-type protein, a predominant phosphopeptide was observed (Fig. 3 A,arrow). This spot was diminished when the CDK2-specific inhibitor roscovitine was added to the kinase reaction mixture (Fig.3 B), supporting the possibility that it is specifically phosphorylated by cyclin A-CDK2. Importantly, this phosphopeptide was absent in the two-dimensional map of the T216A mutant (Fig.3 C) but was present in the map of the T384A mutant (Fig.3 D). The additional minor phosphopeptides that were in the two-dimensional maps are most likely the result of cryptic phosphorylation by the CDK complex, because they are largely suppressed by roscovitine. We conclude that cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylates predominantly Thr-216 in murine MDM2. Phosphorylation of a number of cyclin-dependent kinase substrates requires their interaction with cyclins mediated by sequences (CRMs) termed cyclin-CDK substrate recognition motifs (63Ewen M.E.

Located between the nuclear localization and nuclear export signals on murine MDM2 is a sequence containing RRSL (residues 181–184), which fits the consensus sequence ZRXL for CRMs in E2F, p107, p21, p27, pRb, and poly(A) polymerase (65Adams P.D.

It is possible that this sequence may be involved in CDK phosphorylation of MDM2. Peptides containing the potential MDM2 CRM sequence (RKRRRSLSFDP), scrambled CRM sequence (LRPKSFRDSRR), or the CDK phosphorylation site (SESTETPSHQDL) were synthesized and used as competitive inhibitors in the kinase reaction mixtures. The CRM peptide efficiently inhibited the cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylation of MDM2 (IC50 < 500 nm), whereas the scrambled CRM peptide was much less inhibitory (Fig.4, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, the MDM2 CRM peptide specifically inhibited cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylation of pRb, also shown to be CRM-dependent, but not the phosphorylation of histone H1, which does not require cyclin recognition. It is thus possible that this region may mediate a transient but critical interaction between cyclin A and MDM2. Although we failed to detect a stable interaction between GST-MDM2 and cyclin A (alone or in complex with CDK2) in a GST pull-down assay (data not shown), the ph"
https://openalex.org/W2053713095,"We previously identified RA-GEF-1, a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1 with the ability to associate with Rap1·GTP at its Ras/Rap1-associating (RA) domain. Because it possesses a PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, it was also named PDZ-GEF. In this report, we have examined the role of the RA domain of this protein in Rap1-mediated cellular responses. A mutant of RA-GEF-1 (RA-GEF-1ΔRA) carrying a 21-residue deletion at its RA domain fully retains the in vitro GEF activity toward Rap1 but completely loses the Rap1 binding activity. In contrast, RA-GEF-1ΔRA, expressed in COS-7 cells, exhibits a 3-fold reduction in its in vivo GEF activity toward Rap1 compared with wild-type RA-GEF-1 as examined by the Rap1 pull-down assay. Correspondingly, when coexpressed with wild-type Rap1, RA-GEF-1ΔRA is unable to further activate B-Raf, whereas RA-GEF-1 stimulates B-Raf as efficiently as activated Rap1. Consistent with these observations, coexpression of activated Rap1 induces translocation of RA-GEF-1, which is otherwise located in the cytoplasm, to the perinuclear compartment, where Rap1 is also predominantly localized. This localization almost coincides with that of the Golgi apparatus, which was detected by anti-trans-Golgi-network 38 antibody. RA-GEF-1ΔRA fails to show the translocation. These results indicate that RA-GEF-1 defines a novel category of GEF that is translocated to a particular subcellular compartment by association with the GTP-bound form of a small GTPase and catalyzes activation of the GDP-bound form present in the compartment, thereby causing an amplification of cellular responses induced by the small GTPase.

Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form is active in that it directly binds to and activates specific effector molecules (3Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The effector region of Ras family GTPases (amino acids 32–40 in human Ha-Ras) is involved in the interaction with effectors (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The Ras-binding domain of the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, one of the best characterized Ras effectors, interacts directly with the effector region of Ras in a GTP-dependent manner. On the other hand, the RA1 domain, which is also responsible for binding to Ras, was identified in several Ras effectors such as RalGDS and AF-6/Afadin (4Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 is similar to that of the RA domain of RalGDS, although no obvious homology was found in their amino acid sequences (5Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct.

The Ras family consists of ∼20 members, including Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras, Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, Rap2B, R-Ras, R-Ras2/TC21, R-Ras3/M-Ras, RalA, and RalB. Among them, Rap1 was originally characterized as an antagonist of Ki-Ras-induced transformation and is thus termed Krev-1 as well (8Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Rap1 to block transformation is likely ascribed to its competitive binding to Ras effectors because Rap1 shares the effector region with Ras and in fact associates with a subset of Ras effectors such as Raf-1 without stimulating their activities. This property of Rap1 is attributable to its greatly enhanced interaction with the cysteine-rich domain, a second Ras-binding site, of Raf-1 (9Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Okada T. Hu C.-D. Jin T.-G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6057-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, including fibroblasts, platelets, T and B lymphocytes, and neutrophils, Rap1 is activated in response to a diverse array of extracellular stimuli. Interleukin-2 gene transcription in T cells and insulin-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells, for instance, are presumed to be regulated by both positive and negative actions on Raf-1 exerted by Ras and Rap1, respectively (2Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, Rap1 is rapidly activated after various stimulations without affecting the Ras signaling pathway (11Posern G.

Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is feasible that Rap1 also exerts its own physiological function other than the modulation of Ras-dependent pathways. In nerve growth factor-triggered signaling in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, Rap1 is reported to be involved in B-Raf activation, leading to the sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases that is required for neuronal differentiation (13Vossler M.R.

McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Rap1-dependent activation of B-Raf, but not Raf-1, was observed in COS-7 cells as well (10Okada T. Hu C.-D. Jin T.-G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6057-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of Rap1 in integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion has recently been delineated. An active form of Rap1 potently induced the activation of integrins and subsequent cell aggregation (15Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell.

Lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of integrins in macrophages also requires Rap1 (18Schmidt A. Caron E. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underlying the regulation of Rap1 remain largely unknown. Like Ras, Rap1 is believed to be activated by specific GEFs such as smgGDS (19Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M.

RA-GEF-1 contains the cNMP-binding, Ras exchanger motif and PDZ and RA domains as well as the GEF catalytic domain. The RA domain of RA-GEF-1 associates directly with the GTP-bound form of Rap1, whereas it exhibits no detectable binding to Ha-Ras. On the other hand, RA-GEF-1 shows GEF activity toward Rap1 and Rap2, but not Ha-Ras. However, regulatory mechanisms of GEF activity remained obscure.

Here we investigated the role of the RA domain in the regulation of RA-GEF-1. We show that a deletion mutation within the RA domain that virtually abolishes Rap1 binding significantly diminished GEF activity in the cell, whereas it did not affect GEF activity in vitro. Additionally, Rap1-dependent translocation of RA-GEF-1 to the perinuclear compartment was observed, which was totally abolished by the RA domain mutation. Hence, GEF activity of RA-GEF-1in vivo is likely to be enhanced through the RA domain-mediated translocation to the perinuclear region, where Rap1 exerts its function.

For expressing EGFP- fused RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-1ΔRA in mammalian cells, an EGFP cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/HisC-RA-GEF-1 and pcDNA3.1/HisC-RA-GEF-1ΔRA, yielding pcDNA3.1/HisC-EGFP-RA-GEF-1 and pcDNA3.1/HisC-EGFP-RA-GEF-1ΔRA, respectively. pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-1, pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-1ΔRA, pBlueBacIII-FLAG-RA-GEF-1, and pBlueBacIII-FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA were constructed by subcloning N-terminally FLAG-tagged RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-1ΔRA coding sequences into pCMV2 (Sigma) and pBlueBacIII (PharMingen), respectively. Polypeptides corresponding to RA domains of RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-1ΔRA (amino acids 539–709 and 539–688, respectively) were expressed as MBP-fusion proteins (MBP-RAWT and MBP-RAMUT, respectively) in Escherichia coli AG1 cells by using pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs). pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1AWT, pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1AV12, pH8-FLAG-B-Raf, pGEX2-MEK-His6, and pGEX5-kinase-negative extracellular signal-regulated kinase were described previously (10Okada T.

COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). Transfections were performed using Superfect (Qiagen) or GENEPORTER (Gene Therapy System) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocols. The post-translationally modified form of Rap1A was purified from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus overexpressing Rap1A as described previously (9Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G.

The in vitro binding assay was carried out by incubating 20 µl of amylose resin carrying MBP-RAWT or MBP-RAMUTwith guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)- or guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)-loaded Rap1A in a total volume of 100 µl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Lubrol PX). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, resin was washed, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mmmaltose and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot detection was performed using anti-Rap1A antibody (sc-65) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FLAG-RA-GEF-1 and FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA were expressed in Sf9 cells and affinity-purified with agarose resin conjugated with the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma). GEF assays were performed as described previously (24Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

Briefly, 2 pmol of Rap1A loaded with [3H]GDP (5,000 cpm/pmol) was incubated with 1 µg of FLAG-RA-GEF-1 or FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA in 50 µl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 3 mm unlabeled GTP for the indicated periods. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold stop buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the reaction mixture was subjected to filtration through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.22-µm pore size). After washing with stop buffer, the membrane-trapped radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. GST-RalGDS-RID, a GST-fusion protein of RID of human RalGDS, was described previously (24Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y.

Briefly, COS-7 cells (50% confluent) in 100-mm plates were cotransfected with pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1AWT (1 µg) and either pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-1 or pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-1ΔRA (2 µg) by using the GENEPORTER reagent. COS-7 cells transfected with pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1AV12 served as a positive control. After a 4-h incubation with the transfection mixture, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 26 h. Subsequently, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for another 16 h in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmleupeptin). Soluble cellular extracts (250 µl) were incubated with 5 µg of GST-RalGDS-RID immobilized on glutathione-agarose resin. After a 60-min incubation at 4 °C, resin was washed four times with lysis buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot detection was performed using anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). COS-7 cells (60–70% confluent) in 100-mm plates were cotransfected with a combination of pH8-FLAG-B-Raf (0.5 µg), pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1AWT (1 µg), and either pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-1 or pFLAG-CMV2-RA-GEF-1ΔRA (2 µg) by using the Superfect reagent. COS-7 cells cotransfected with pH8-FLAG-B-Raf and pEF-BOS-HA-Rap1AV12 served as a positive control. After a 4-h incubation with the transfection mixture, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 8 h. Subsequently, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for another 24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then harvested and lysed by sonication in 300 µl of lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% Triton X-100). Soluble cellular extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, and FLAG-B-Raf in extracts was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma). B-Raf kinase activity was examined by incubating immunoprecipitates in the presence of GST-tagged mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (0.1 µg) and GST-kinase-negative extracellular signal-regulated kinase (1 µg) in 50 µl of the kinase reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 µm [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 cpm/pmol)) for 20 min at 30 °C as described previously (10Okada T.

After incubation, reaction mixtures were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized and quantified using the BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). HA-Rap1AWT, FLAG-RA-GEF-1, FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA, and FLAG-B-Raf in extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA (12CA5), anti-FLAG (M2), and anti-B-Raf (sc-166) antibodies, respectively, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). COS-7 or Rat-1 cells were seeded on a 2-well chamber slide (Nalge Nunc) and transfected with pEFBOSHA-Rap1AV12 (0.5 µg) in combination with either pcDNA3.1/HisCEGFP-RA-GEF-1 or pcDNA3.1/HisC-EGFP-RA-GEF-1ΔRA (0.5 µg) by using the Superfect reagent. After a 4-h incubation with the transfection mixture, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 8 h. Subsequently, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for another 16 h in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were stained with anti-HA (12CA5) and tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (T2762) antibodies. Subcellular localization of EGFP-RA-GEF-1, EGFP-RA-GEF-1ΔRA, and HA-Rap1AV12 was analyzed under a confocal laser microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). FLAG-RA-GEF-1 was purified from Sf9 cells as described above. GST-fused protein kinase A regulatory subunit Iα (GST-PKA-RIα) was prepared as described previously (24Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37815-37820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cAMP binding assay was performed essentially as described previously (24Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J.

FLAG-RA-GEF-1 (1 µg) immobilized on anti-FLAG M2 resin or GST-PKA-RIα (0.5 µg) immobilized on glutathione-agarose resin was incubated in a 100-µl reaction mixture containing 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 500 nm [2,8-3H]cAMP (10,000 cpm/pmol) at 25 °C for 90 min with gentle shaking. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with 0.2% SDS and counted for 3H label. The cGMP binding assay was carried out in a similar manner, except that [8-3H]cGMP (5,000 cpm/pmol) replaced cAMP. RA-GEF-1 acts as a GEF for Rap1 and Rap2 (24Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M.

However, the role of the RA domain in the regulation of GEF activity remained unknown. To clarify this point, we first tried to identify a mutation in the RA domain that abolishes the binding activity. Arg-20 of RalGDS is critical for the association between RalGDS-RID and Rap1, as indicated by the finding that the R20A mutation of RalGDS completely eliminated the binding activity (6Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although this Arg residue is conserved in the RA domain of RA-GEF-1 (Arg-611), RA-GEF-1 carrying the R611A mutation still retained a residual binding activity toward Rap1A·GTP (data not shown). Subsequently, we deleted 21 N-terminal amino acids (amino acids 606–626) of the RA domain by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1A), and the association of MBP-RAWT and MBP-RAMUT with GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms of Rap1A was examined (Fig.1 B). Whereas MBP-RAWT associated with Rap1Ain vitro in a GTP-dependent fashion, as we described previously (24Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.-G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37815-37820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), MBP-RAMUT exhibited no detectable binding to Rap1A. To examine the effect of the RA domain mutation on GEF activity, we assayed the GEF activities of full-length wild-type RA-GEF-1 and its RA domain mutant (RA-GEF-1ΔRA). Both proteins were expressed with a FLAG tag in Sf9 cells and purified to near homogeneity by using anti-FLAG M2 resin. As shown in Fig.2A, both of these proteins exhibited virtually the same enzymatic activity to stimulate GDP release from Rap1A. Therefore, the internal deletion in the RA domain does not interfere with the intrinsic activity of the GEF domain. It has been reported that binding of a ligand to the regulatory domain of certain GEFs, such as Epac/cAMP-GEF (21de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A.

To examine the possibility of ligand induction of GEF activity in vitro, FLAG-RA-GEF-1 and FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA were incubated with guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-loaded Rap1A, and reaction mixtures were subjected to in vitro GEF assays. FLAG-RA-GEF-1 and FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA preincubated with or without guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-loaded Rap1A exhibited no significant differences in their GEF activity toward Rap1A (data not shown). GEF activities of RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-1ΔRA in vivo were examined by pull-down assays for Rap1A·GTP. RA-GEF-1 and RA-GEF-1ΔRA were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins in COS-7 cells in combination with HA-tagged wild-type Rap1A (HA-Rap1AWT). Cell lysates prepared from transfectants were incubated with immobilized GST-RalGDS-RID, and bound HA-Rap1AWT·GTP was quantitated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). Coexpression of FLAG-RA-GEF-1 caused a 6-fold increase in the amounts of the GTP-bound form of HA-Rap1AWT, which were almost equivalent to those of constitutively active HA-Rap1A (HA-Rap1AV12). In contrast, the GTP-bound Rap1A level in FLAG-RA-GEF-1ΔRA-expressing cells was ∼3-fold lower than that in cells expressing FLAG-RA-GEF-1. We next examined B-Raf activation following expression of RA-GEF"
https://openalex.org/W2055180432,"We analyzed photometric measurements and images of comet C/LINEAR before perihelion and after its breakup. Results from our photometry data include a lower limit of 0.44 kilometer for the radius of the nucleus before breakup, and a determination that it was depleted in carbon-chain molecules relative to most other comets. Our imaging and modeling results, which include a constraint on the rotational state of the nucleus, indicate that the disintegration likely started on 18 or 19 July 2000. The total mass detectable in the dust tail after the breakup was 3 x 10(8) kilograms, comparable to one of the fragments in the Hubble Space Telescope images; we therefore infer that most of the comet's original mass is hidden in remnants between 1 millimeter and 50 meters in diameter."

Genetic studies suggest that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3 carry out two types of modifications as follows: both Dnmt3A and -B establish patterns of methylation early in embryogenesis by de novo methylation of cytosine residues, whereas Dnmt1 maintains such patterns throughout life by copying them onto newly synthesized DNA (4Okano M.

In individuals with full mutation, the disease state also requires the de novo methylation of the CGG·CCG tract and the proximal CpG island (23de Vries B.B. Jansen C.C. Duits A.A. Verheij C. Willemsen R. van Hemel J.O. van den Ouweland A.M. Niermeijer M.F. Oostra B.A. Halley D.J. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Merenstein S.A. Sobesky W.E.

However, two important unknowns include the following: first, what mechanisms trigger this de novoactivity, and second, which methyltransferase(s) are involved. Herein, we present steady-state kinetic investigations on human recombinant DNMT1 (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) using DNA substrates of random sequence or substrates composed of CGG·CCG repeats. The data show that DNMT1 is under allosteric repression, a control mechanism that reconciles the results in vitro with the genetic studies in vivo. The binding of AdoMet and the DNA to the active site occurs by a random mechanism; however, the preferred pathway involves binding of AdoMet followed by DNA. The enzymatic activity depends on the topological state of the DNA and increases with negative supercoiling. These results indicate that although the methylation reaction is under tight control, factors such as CGG·CCG expansion and the accumulation of high levels of supercoiling stimulate de novo activity, which are consistent with the possibility that DNMT1 may be involved in the fragile X syndrome. Full-length human DNMT1 expression constructs were derived from pBKSHMT5.0(b) (gift of Prof. S. Baylin, The Johns Hopkins University). This plasmid had the full-length humanDNMT1 cDNA based on the previously published sequence (26Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D., Yu, J.J. El-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Baculovirus expression of the full-length DNMT1 was from clone HMT8. Transfer vector pVICHMT (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) has threeBamHI sites, one before the DNMT1 translation initiation (in the vector) and the other two in the DNMT1open reading frame at nucleotide positions 1704 and 2784 (GenBankTM accession number X63692). For the preparation of the N-terminal 501 amino acid deletion mutant, DNMT1Δ501, partial digestion of pVICHMT was done with BamHI. A 14.5-kilobase pair band corresponding to the DNA fragment lacking the first 1704 nucleotides of theDNMT1 cDNA was excised from the gel, religated, and transformed into Escherichia coli. The ligated junctions in the final pVICD501HMT construct were verified by DNA sequencing. The enzyme was purified from clone 21 (HMT21). A pupal ovarian cell line (SF9) from the worm Spodoptera frugiperda was used for co-transfection and expression of the human DNMT1 and DNMT1Δ501 as described previously (27Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. SF9 cells were maintained as a suspension culture in TNM-FH media (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum and an antibiotic/antimycotic solution at a final concentration of 5 units of penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.125 μg/ml amphotericin B at 27 °C on a Bellco steering platform at 70–80 rpm. Co-transfection of a monolayer of SF9 insect cells was carried out using BaculoGold DNA, a modified, linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and the transfer vector pVICD501HMT. Screening for recombinant clones and plaque purification was described previously (28O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 124-127Google Scholar). For routine protein expression, SF9 cells were grown in spinner culture flasks. SF9 cells at a density of 1.2–1.5 × 106ml−1 were infected at a multiplicity of infection between 7 and 10 with HMT8/HMT21. The cells were kept at 27 °C and stirred at 60 rpm. Cells were harvested 48 h post-infection, pelleted, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Protein purification and quantitation were described previously (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Enzyme preparations were >95% pure (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We previously developed a velocity equation for DNMT1 (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), based on the King-Altman and Cleland methods (30Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 505-845Google Scholar), that considered the enzyme species bound to the AdoMet and unmethylated DNA substrates but not to the AdoHcy and methylated DNA products (initial forward velocity equation). These conditions are met experimentally when the amount of substrate utilized is negligible compared with its total concentration. The velocity equation in the presence of products would be quite complex. In our velocity equation, the term associated with Kia was arbitrarily chosen to be AdoMet because the order for substrate addition in the methyl transfer reaction was unknown. Because evidence is now presented that the reaction order for DNMT1 is random, we re-write the velocity equation in the form shown in Equation1: v=Vmax[A][B]Kia(app)KmB+KmB[A]+Km(app)A[B]+[A][B]Equation 1 where both [A] and [B] are the concentrations of AdoMet and DNA, in CG (or CI, where CI is the CpI dinucleotide in the poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC template) steps, andKia(app) indicates the apparent dissociation constant for both AdoMet and the DNA (Ki(app)AdoMet andKi(app)DNA). Accordingly,Ki(app)AdoMet =KiAdoMet (1 +KDNA/[DNA]),Ki(app)DNA =KiDNA (1 +KDNA/[DNA]),KiAdoMet =k4/k3,KiDNA =k6/k5,KDNA =k2/k1,Km(app)AdoMet =KmAdoMet (1 +KDNA/[DNA]),Km(app)DNA =KmDNA (1 +KDNA/[DNA]) as outlined in Fig. 1. This modification of the velocity equation does not alter the estimation of the Michaelis constants andkcat; however, it enables the calculation of the dissociation constants for AdoMet and DNA as follows. In Equation 1when [A] is the variable substrate the reciprocal of the velocity is as shown in Equation 2.1v=1Vmax1+KmB[B]+Km(app)AVmax1+KiaKmBKmA[B]·1[A]Equation 2 When the slopes in Equation 2, which are obtained by varying the fixed concentrations of [B], are replotted as a function of 1/[B], they yield the following Equation 3,Slope1/A=Km(app)AVmax+Kia(app)KmBVmax·1[B]Equation 3 Alternatively, when [B] is the variable substrate in Equation 1, the reciprocal of the velocity is given in Equation4.1v=1Vmax1+Km(app)A[A]+KmBVmax1+Kia(app)[A]·1[B]Equation 4 Similarly, when the slopes in Equation 4, which are obtained by varying the fixed concentrations of [A], are replotted as a function of 1/[A], they yield the following Equation5,Slope1/B=KmBVmax+Kia(app)KmBVmax·1[A]Equation 5 Because Equations 3 and 5 have the identical slope ofKia(app) KmB/Vmax, where Kia(app) is the apparent dissociation constant for substrate A andKmB is the Michaelis constant for substrate B,Ki(app)AdoMet may be found by setting KmB =KmDNA, whereasKi(app)DNA may be found by setting KmB =KmAdoMet in the replots of the slopes of the double-reciprocal plots obtained from Equations 2 and 4. A comparable method, which we did not utilize, would be to analyze the vertical coordinate of the crossover point for the same double-reciprocal plots (31Cleland W.W. Enzymes. 1990; 19: 99-158Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions for the methyl transfer reaction with recombinant human DNMT1Δ501 and DNMT1 with all of the DNA substrates used and the calculation of the steady-state kinetic constants were as described (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the reactants and those of the products analyzed were always converted to nanomoles or micromoles per liter and therefore are expressed in nm or μm, respectively. Also, the given concentrations are always those in the final reaction mixture. The DNA substrates used for calculating the kinetic constants were the polymer poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, average length 7000 bp); the oligonucleotides (CGG·CCG)12, (m5CGG·CCG)12, (CGG·Cm5CG)12, and (CGG·CCG)73;SNRPN (exon 1 of the small nucleoriboprotein Ngene); SNRPN methylated on the upper strand;SNRPN methylated on the lower strand; and plasmid DNA that included linear, relaxed circular, and negatively supercoiled pRW3602. The synthesis and characterization of these substrates were reported (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Its average negative superhelical density (−<ς> = 0.045) was determined from a series of agarose gel electrophoreses performed in the presence of chloroquine using known populations of topoisomers as reference (32Bacolla A.

Two oligonucleotides were employed for product inhibition studies as follows: MeCG20, a chemically synthesized 40-bp duplex oligonucleotide containing 5-methylcytosine at all 20 CG steps, andF/MeCG12, a chemically synthesized 36-bp duplex oligonucleotide containing the FMR1-associated CGG·CCG triplet repeat substituted with 5-fluorocytosines on the upper strand and 5-methylcytosines on the lower strand at the CG steps as described (29Bacolla A.

The concentration of CG steps for each of the six purified topoisomer populations was obtained from the DNA concentration measured spectrophometrically at 260 and 280 nm. For each topoisomer population, an amount of pRW3691 corresponding to 25 μm CG steps in the final reaction mixture was incubated with 40 nm DNMT1 and 10 μm S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet) (specific activity 15.0 Ci/mmol (1 Ci = 37 GBq), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 25 μl in buffer A (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were frozen, heated to 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate DNMT1, supplemented with 5 μl of 10× buffer B (1 m NaCl, 100 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 2 μl each of HindIII and BamHI, 16 μl of H2O, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to release the (CGG·CCG)73-containing fragment and the vector DNA. This restriction splits the total number of CG steps of pRW3691 into two nearly equal parts, 170 CG steps in the vector and 164 in the (CGG·CCG)73-containing fragment. The two restriction fragments were isolated on a preparative 1.2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, cut from the gel, transferred to scintillation vials containing 2 ml of distilled H2O, melted, immediately diluted with 15 ml of Ultima-Gold liquid scintillation mixture (Packard Instrument Co.), and counted on a liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). Control vials containing free [3H]AdoMet, but no melted gels slices, or free [3H]AdoMet plus a melted gel slice of comparable weight (∼0.8 g), but no DNA, indicated that the melted gel matrix did not quench the radioactive signals. The concentration of [3H]CH3 incorporated in each DNA fragment was obtained from the ratio of the counts/min of the DNA samples minus the counts/min of the blank, divided by the counts/min given by 2 μl of free [3H]AdoMet. The blank consisted of an average counts/min value obtained from four melted gel slices of 0.8 g each that were excised from the DNA lanes of the agarose gels used to separate the restriction fragments. This value was 590 cpm. The values for the DNA samples ranged from 3,788 to 2,306,472 cpm. Previous studies with full-length recombinant human DNMT1 revealed the linear and intersecting velocity patterns for the majority of the DNA substrates used (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, complex patterns were observed with two DNA substrates, poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (35Grant R.C. Harwood S.J. Wells R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 4474-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and hemimethylated (CGG·Cm5CG)12, which revealed both inhibition and activation of the reaction. Furthermore, inhibition studies with fully methylated random sequence DNA (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) showed that this product stimulated methylation. These data suggested that the reaction was normally repressed and that de-repression could be achieved once the DNA substrate was bound to an allosteric site. To test this hypothesis, deletions were made in the N-terminal portion of DNMT1, which was believed not to be involved in catalysis (2Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), and the velocity curves were re-evaluated at various concentrations of AdoMet and DNA (poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and hemimethylated (CGG·Cm5CG)12). Herein, we report the results with DNMT1Δ501, a catalytically active enzyme that lacks the first 501 N-terminal amino acids (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Fig. 3 shows the velocity patterns for (CGG·CCG)12, as control, and for (CGG·Cm5CG)12 (note the changes of scale on the horizontal axes). The reciprocal transfer of [3H]CH3 from AdoMet to the DNA is indicated on the ordinate as a function of DNA concentration at various fixed concentrations of AdoMet (A and C) or as a function of AdoMet at various fixed concentrations of DNA (B and D). The patterns for (CGG·CCG)12 with the truncated enzyme are identical to those obtained with the full-length enzyme (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), i.e. they are linear and intersect to the left of the vertical axis. This result indicates that the truncation did not alter the bi-reactant sequential mode of substrate binding characteristic of DNMT1 and gives confidence that kinetic studies carried out with DNMT1Δ501 contribute to elucidating the properties of the full-length enzyme. The patterns for the hemimethylated (CGG·Cm5CG)12 are also linear and intersecting (C and D), contrary to those observed with DNMT1 (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which were curved and not intersecting. This result indicates that a region within the 501 N-terminal amino acids was involved in generating the complex kinetic pattern (29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) for (CGG·Cm5CG)12 with DNMT1. The velocity curves with full-length DNMT1 showed substrate inhibition with poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), particularly at low AdoMet concentrations (19Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The patterns obtained with DNMT1Δ501 are shown in Fig.4. At the identical AdoMet concentrations, substrate inhibition is no longer present (A), confirming a role for the N-terminal domain in regulating the turnover rate. When AdoMet is the variable substrate (B) the velocity responses are linear from 1.74 to 20 μm (1/AdoMet of 0.05–0.57). The loss of linearity at 1.02 μm (1/AdoMet = 0.98) probably reflects a departure from steady-state conditions. In summary, this transformation from curved velocity patterns with DNMT1 (19Pradhan S.

Replots of slopes and intercepts of the double-reciprocal plots shown in Figs. 3and 4 indicate linear relationships with respect to the various fixed concentrations of substrate (Fig. 5). These results enable the evaluation of the Michaelis constants for DNA and AdoMet as well as the turnover numbers (TableI) (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 29Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A comparison of the kcat andkcat/KmDNAvalues for the unmethylated and the hemimethylated FMR1sequence indicates that preference for the hemimethylated template is retained in DNMT1Δ501, showing that the residues involved are downstream of the N-terminal regulatory domain.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of recombinant human DNMT1Δ501 using poly(dI-dC) · poly(dI-dC) and FMR1 locus as substratesOligonucleotide duplexkcatK mAdoMetKmDNAkcat/KmDNAh−1μm106 ×m−1 h−1Poly(dI-dC) · poly(dI-dC)52390.7747(CGG · CCG)121140.814(CGG · Cm5CG)1295 (9×)40.2475 (34×)The standard deviations from two determinations ranged from 0.6 to 14% of the mean values.

Both the values ofkcat andkcat/KmDNAare greater for the truncated enzyme, indicating that the N-terminal peptide represses the enzymatic activity. Inspection of the ratios for the substrate dissociation constants (Ki(app)DNA andKi(app)AdoMet) indicates that the truncation increases the apparent affinity of DNMT1Δ501 for the hemimethylatedFMR1 sequence. Furthermore, because theKi(app)AdoMet andKi(app)DNA ratios are 0.1 and 0.3 for the unmethylated sequence, respectively, we conclude that the truncation increases the apparent affinity for both AdoMet and theFMR1 sequence.

We demonstrate that both MV glycoproteins possess a basolateral targeting signal that is dependent upon the unique tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tails. These tyrosines are shown to be also part of an endocytosis signal. In MV-infected cells, internalization of the glycoproteins was not observed, indicating that recognition of the endocytosis signals is disturbed by viral factors. In contrast, basolateral transport was not substantially hindered, resulting in efficient cell-to-cell fusion of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Thus, recognition of the signals for endocytosis and polarized transport is differently regulated in infected cells. Mutation of the basolateral sorting signal in one of the MV glycoproteins prevented fusion of polarized cells.

Madin-Darby canine kidney influenza virus hemagglutinin measles virus monoclonal antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline Epithelial cells play crucial roles in diverse processes such as water and ion balance, secretion, adsorption of nutrients, and signal transduction. The polarized nature of these cells is central to their function. The plasma membrane of these cells is divided into an apical and a basolateral domain that have different lipid and protein compositions (for review, see Ref. 1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Sorting of membrane proteins was shown to occur in the trans-Golgi network and to depend on special targeting signals. The most thoroughly investigated model for epithelial polarity is the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)1 continuous cell line. Several viral glycoproteins have been shown to be sorted to either the apical or basolateral surfaces (2Tucker S.P. Compans R.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 187-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since glycoproteins of enveloped viruses perform critical functions during viral assembly and serve as main targets of humoral immune responses, polarized expression of these proteins affects the viral life cycle. The viral glycoproteins studied in most detail are the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was found to contain basolateral sorting information that is critically dependent upon the presence of a tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tail (3Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal responsible for the apical transport of HA is contained within the extracellular or transmembrane portion of the molecule (4McQueen N. Nayak D.P. Stephens E.B. Compans R.W. Proc. Natl.

However, recent data on virus release and glycoprotein sorting indicated that this model is not valid for measles virus (10Maisner A. Klenk H.-D. Herrler G. J.

Measles virus (MV) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and possesses a negative-stranded RNA genome encoding for six structural proteins. The nucleoprotein together with the phosphoprotein, the viral polymerase, and the genomic RNA form the ribonucleoprotein complex that assembles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The matrix protein (M protein), synthesized in the cytoplasm, mediates the contact of the ribonucleoproteins with viral envelope proteins initiating virus budding at the plasma membrane (12Cathomen T.

Hemagglutinin (H protein), the envelope protein responsible for the binding of the virus to the cell surface receptor (14Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C.

Nature. 2000; 406: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), is a type II integral membrane protein with a C-terminal ectodomain. The second envelope protein, the fusion protein (F protein), is a type I glycoprotein possessing an N-terminal ectodomain that has to be cleaved into the F1/F2 subunits to mediate pH-independent fusion of virus with the plasma membrane (17Maisner A. Mrkic B. Herrler G. Moll M. Billeter M.A. Cattaneo R. Klenk H.-D. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that both proteins are abundantly expressed on the basolateral side of polarized MDCK cells, although virus budding is restricted to the apical cell surfaces (10Maisner A. Klenk H.-D. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5276-5278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was recently confirmed using another polarized cell line, CaCo2 cells (11Naim H.Y. Ehler E. Billeter M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3576-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that upon stable expression in MDCK cells, both H and F proteins are targeted almost completely to the basolateral surface (10Maisner A. Klenk H.-D. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5276-5278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, targeting information resides in the proteins itself. Since MV glycoproteins do not determine the site of virus budding, MV must have developed a maturation strategy different from those of viruses such as influenza virus or vesicular stomatitis virus. Most recent work has shown that MV M protein may specify apical virus release because it is predominantly localized at the apical plasma membrane of polarized MDCK 2P. Riedl, M. Moll, H.-D. Klenk, and A. Maisner, submitted for publication.2P. Riedl, M. Moll, H.-D. Klenk, and A. Maisner, submitted for publication. and CaCo2 cells (11Naim H.Y. Ehler E. Billeter M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3576-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the signals responsible for the basolateral sorting of H and F proteins to elucidate the importance of the basolateral glycoprotein expression for the pathogenesis of measles virus infection. We show that polarized targeting of both proteins is dependent upon a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tails. The same tyrosines are shown to be part of an endocytosis signal. Since the signals in the F protein cytoplasmic tail appeared to be more efficiently recognized than those of the H protein, they were transferred to another protein. Chimeric proteins from MV F protein and influenza virus HA revealed that the signals residing in MV F protein can only partly override the targeting signals of an apical protein that is not internalized. To analyze the biological importance of the signals residing in the cytoplasmic tails of the MV envelope proteins, the polarized transport and endocytosis of the glycoproteins in infected cells were monitored. Endocytosis, but not polarized transport, appeared to be inhibited. Fusion of polarized MDCK cells was observed only when basolateral sorting signals of both glycoproteins were intact. This result led us to suggest that endocytosis interferes with the assembly of new viruses at the plasma membrane, whereas basolateral expression of the MV glycoproteins favors virus spread in epithelial cells. MDCK cells (strain II) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. For studies of cell polarity, tissue culture-treated 0.4-μm pore size Transwell polycarbonate filters (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were used. Cells were seeded 5 days before experiments (2 × 106 cells/24-mm unit). The polarity was determined by measurement of the transepithelial resistance using a Millipore ERS instrument. MDCK cells formed a tight monolayer with an electrical resistance of 1000–2500 ohms × cm2. The different patterns of surface proteins on the apical and basolateral membranes of the polarized cell line were controlled by surface biotinylation. Cloning of the viral glycoprotein (H and F protein) genes into the expression vector pCG under the control of the cytomegalovirus early promotor has been described previously (18Cathomen T. Buchholz C.J. Spielhofer P. Cattaneo R. Virology. 1995; 214: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein mutants were prepared by introduction of site-specific mutations with the complementary primers F549Y/A 1 (5′-GGAACATCAAAATCCGCTGTAAGGTCGCTCTGATCC-3′) and F549Y/A 2 (5′-GGATCAGAGCGACCTTACAGCGGATTTTGATGTTCC-3′) and H12Y/A 1 (5′-CGGATAAATGCCTTCGCCAAAGATAACCCC-3′) and H12Y/A 2 (5′-GGGGTTATCTTTGGCGAAGGCATTTATCCG-3′) in the double-stranded pCG plasmids using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The chimeras used in this study are marked by their composition (ectodomain-transmembrane domain-cytoplasmic tail) as H7-H7-F, H7-F-H7, and H7-F-F. H7 represents the respective domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin, and F represents the respective domain of the measles virus fusion protein. The recombinant proteins H7-H7-F and H7-F-F were generated by a recombinant polymerase chain reaction technique (19Higuchi R Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides and pSG5new-HAmut7 and pCG-F as templates. The mutant hemagglutinin HAmut7 of the influenza A virus has been described elsewhere (20Vey M. Orlich M. Adler S. Klenk H.-D. Rott R. Garten W. Virology. 1992; 188: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The internal sense primers were 5′-CTTGTTTTCATATGTGTGAGGGGGCGTTGTAATAAA-3′ (H7-H7-F) and 5′-GAGTAGTGGCTACAAAGATGGTTTATCGAGCACTAGC-3′ (H7-F-F), and the internal antisense primers were 5′-TTTATTACAACGCCCCCTCACACATATGAAAACAAG-3′ (H7-H7-F) and 5′-GCTAGTGCTCGATAAACCATCTTTGTAGCCACTACTC-3′(H7-F-F). The external primers were 5′-ATACTTATGATCACAGCAAAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCGGCGCGCAGATCTTGTGTTTCAAGAGTTGTAGAGG-3′ (antisense). pSG5new-H7-F-F and pSG5new-HAmut7 were used to produce H7-F-H7 by the same recombinant polymerase chain reaction technique with the internal primers 5′-GCTTTAATATGTTGCTGCAAGAACGGAAACATGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCATGTTTCCGTTCTTGCAGCAACATATTAAAGC-3′ (antisense) and the external primers 5′-ATACTTATGATCACAGCAAAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCGGCGCGCACTAGTAATAAACAAGTTCTGC-3′ (antisense). The sequences of the plasmid constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. For stable expression, MDCK cells were cotransfected with either of the expression plasmids and the neomycin resistance-conferring plasmid pIGI at a ratio of 1:10 using the cationic lipid transfection reagent LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells were screened for Geneticin resistance by addition of 1.0 mg of Geneticin (Calbiochem)/ml medium. The selected cell clones were screened for expression of foreign proteins by immunofluorescence analysis. MDCK cells stably expressing parental proteins (FEdm and HEdm) or tyrosine mutants (F549Y/A and H12Y/A) were grown on glass coverslips and incubated with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) A504 (directed against MV F protein; kindly provided by J. Schneider-Schaulies) or mAb 8905 (directed against MV H protein; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 60 min at 4 °C without prior fixation. The primary antibodies were detected using an FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp.) for 45 min at 4 °C. The samples were mounted in Mowiol and 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane. The coverslips were viewed and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with UV optics. Filter-grown MDCK cells were biotinylated essentially as described by Lisantiet al. (21Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. The apical or basolateral cell surface was incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 2 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) by adding 1 ml of the biotinylating reagent to the respective filter chamber. The same volume of PBS containing 0.1 m glycine was placed into the opposite filter chamber. After biotinylation, cells were washed once with cold PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and three times with cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units/ml aprotinin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with mAb A504 (directed against MV F protein), mAb 8905 (directed against MV H protein), or mAb 2A11-H7 (directed against the H7 subtype of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin; kindly provided by W. Garten) at a final dilution of 1:100. After addition of 40 μl of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp.), immunocomplexes were washed three times with radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer and suspended in reducing (MV H protein) or nonreducing (MV F and recombinant proteins) sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following separation on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose by the semidry blot technique. After blocking of nonspecific binding sites by 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, blots were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) diluted 1:2000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Biotinylated proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by exposure to Eastman Kodak XAR autoradiography film. MDCK cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with either the parental (pCG-FEdm and pCG-HEdm) or mutant (pCG-F549Y/A and pCG-H12Y/A) protein-expressing plasmids alone or cotransfected with plasmids containing parental proteins using the transfection reagent LipofectAMINE 2000. A total amount of 1 μg of DNA was used. Since infection of confluent MDCK cells has been shown to be very inefficient (10Maisner A. Klenk H.-D. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5276-5278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), virus was added to the cells directly after seeding. At 7 h post-infection, the virus-containing growth medium was replaced by fresh minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. At 20 h post-transfection or 30 h post-infection, surface-expressed protein was labeled with mAb A504 (directed against MV F protein) or mAb 8905 (directed against MV H protein). After incubation for 60 min on ice, the antibody was removed by washing with PBS, and the cells were incubated with cell culture medium for 15 min at 37 °C to allow endocytosis of the antigen-antibody complexes. Internalization was stopped by rapid cooling on ice. Surface-bound antibodies were detected by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab fragments (Dianova) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS for 60 min on ice. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed and permeabilized for 5 min at −20 °C with methanol/acetone (1:1). Internalized antibodies were detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:100. The samples were mounted in Mowiol containing 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with UV optics. The experiment was mainly performed as described by Graeve et al. (22Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MDCK cells stably expressing either one of the parental or one of the mutant proteins were grown on 6-cm plastic dishes and incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with a 2 mg/ml concentration of the non-membrane-permeating, cleavable biotin derivative sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce). Following washing with cold PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and several washings with cold PBS, cells were incubated with cell culture medium for 0, 5, 15, or 30 min at either 4 or 37 °C to allow endocytosis of the labeled proteins. After internalization was stopped by rapid cooling on ice, cells were incubated three times for 20 min at 4 °C with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Biotin exposed at the cell surface was thereby cleaved. After thorough rinsing with PBS containing 20 mm Hepes, cells were lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer, and proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Biotinylated proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected as described above. The internalization rate was determined by densitometric quantification. MDCK cells were seeded in 35-mm diameter wells to reach 90–95% confluence 1 day after plating. The MV glycoprotein-expressing plasmids pCG-FEdm and pCG-HEdm were transfected in the absence or presence of either the corresponding parental protein-expressing plasmids (pCG-FEdm and pCG-HEdm) or the mutant protein-expressing plasmids (pCG-F549Y/A and pCG-H12Y/A) using the cationic lipid transfection reagent LipofectAMINE 2000. A total amount of 5 μg of DNA was used. At 20 h post-transfection, the transiently expressing cells were fixed with ethanol and stained with 1:10 diluted Giemsa staining solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). To analyze the biological activity of the MV glycoproteins in polarized MDCK cells, MDCK cells stably expressing either MV FEdm or MV F549Y/A were seeded on coverslips at high density. At 24 h post-seeding, cells were transfected with pCG-HEdm or pCG-H12Y/A, respectively. For comparison, MDCK cells were infected as described above. At 7 h post-transfection or post-infection, transfection complexes or virus-containing growth medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified essential medium either with or without calcium. Since the maintenance of tight junctions requires calcium, the lack of calcium abolishes cell polarity. To visualize syncytium formation in polarized or non-polarized cells, immunostaining was performed. After fixation and permeabilization at −20 °C with methanol/acetone (1:1), cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody 8905 (directed against MV H protein) and an FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Corp.). The samples were mounted and analyzed as described above. Cytoplasmic tyrosines have been identified as important constituents of many, but not all, basolateral sorting signals. The cytoplasmic tails of both MV glycoproteins contain a single tyrosine at position 12 in the H protein and at position 549 in the F protein. To determine if these tyrosines residues contribute to a basolateral targeting signal, mutants were constructed in which amino acid 12 of the H protein and amino acid 549 of the F protein were changed to an alanine. The sequences of parental proteins and mutants H12Y/A and F549Y/A (tyrosine mutants) are shown in Fig. 1 A. Successful use of site-specific mutagenesis to identify amino acids serving as recognition signals during intracellular transport requires that local changes do not disturb other, perhaps distant, parts of the protein, resulting in inefficient transport or loss of function. Without prior fixation, surfaces of transiently expressing MDCK cells were incubated with anti-H protein (mAb 8905) or anti-F protein (A504) antibodies and an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The surface immunofluorescence in Fig. 1 B shows that the exchange of the tyrosine did not prevent surface transport. A common assay for testing the biological function of H and F proteins is to analyze cells coexpressing H and F proteins for their ability to induce syncytium formation. Only fusion-competent F proteins in combination with H proteins that bind to MV receptors and that can interact with the F protein support virus-to-cell or cell-to-cell fusion (23Wild T.F Malvoisin E. Buckland R. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 429-442Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To analyze the mutants for syncytium formation, subconfluent MDCK cells coexpressing either parental HEdm or H12Y/A in combination with parental FEdm or F549Y/A were fixed at 20 h post-transfection and stained with Giemsa staining solution. As shown in Fig. 1 C, H or F proteins expressed alone did not induce fusion, whereas syncytium formation was observed in cells expressing different combinations of parental and mutant proteins. This result indicates that tyrosine mutants were not affected in their ability to mediate fusion of non-polarized cells. To analyze the polarized transport of membrane proteins, stably expressing cell lines have to be established. For this purpose, plasmids expressing either the parental HEdm or FEdm protein or tyrosine mutants were transfected into MDCK cells, and neomycin-resistant transfectants were selected using G418. To monitor the targeting of the expressed proteins, the cells were cultured on permeable filter supports, where they form polarized monolayers. Cells grown on filters were cooled to 4 °C, and either the apical or basolateral surface proteins were labeled by adding the non-membrane-permeating reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin to the respective filter chamber. The cells were lysed, and H or F proteins were immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies (mAb 8905 or A504). After separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (reducing conditions for H proteins and nonreducing conditions for F proteins), proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Biotin-labeled proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. As shown in Fig.2 (lanes b), efficient biotinylation of both parental proteins was obtained only after labeling the cells from the basolateral side (HEdm, 95%; and FEdm, >99%). This confirms our previous results that both MV glycoproteins are predominantly expressed on the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK cells. In contrast, strong labeling of both tyrosine mutants was detected only after apical surface biotinylation (F549Y/A and H12Y/A panels, lanes a). Only a minor band was found after basolateral labeling (lanes b). The protein distribution was further confirmed by surface immunofluorescence of filter-grown cells using a confocal laser scanning microscope (data not shown). The redirection of the mutant proteins to the apical cell membrane indicates that both MV glycoproteins contain a tyrosine-dependent basolateral sorting signal. In certain cases, the cytoplasmic signal responsible for efficient localization to coated pits may be very similar to that responsible for basolateral targeting (24Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maisner A. Zimmer G. Liszewski M.K. Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To determine if MV glycoproteins also possess an endocytosis signal, we performed an antibody uptake experiment. Without prior fixation, H or F proteins on the surface of stably expressing cells were labeled with the respective antibodies at 4 °C and warmed to 37 °C for 15 min to allow endocytosis to occur. Surface-bound antibodies were detected by incubation of the living cells with a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody at 4 °C. After permeabilization of the cells, internalized H or F protein-antibody complexes were detected with FITC-conjugated second antibody. In Fig.3 A, the result of the double immunofluorescence (surface and intracellular) is shown. Cells expressing parental HEdm and FEdmproteins showed both surface fluorescence and numerous small fluorescent intracellular vesicles distributed throughout the cell. Both MV glycoproteins were internalized during 15 min at 37 °C, indicating that both proteins possess an endocytosis signal. Since the antibody uptake experiment is only a qualitative test, we performed a biotin internalization assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). With this assay, it can be determined at what rate MV proteins are internalized and whether mutation of tyrosine 12 in the H protein and tyrosine 549 in the F protein affects endocytosis. In Fig.3 C, quantitation of the blots shown in Fig. 3 Brevealed that the FEdm protein was endocytosed at a higher rate than the HEdm protein (3 versus 2.5%/min). Since the antibody uptake experiment is only a qualitative assay, this difference could not be detected. The amount of intracellular F protein increased with increasing incubation at 37 °C. In contrast, the amount of intracellular H protein decreased after 15 min of endocytosis. The same reduction was also observed when the total amount (surface and intracellular H proteins) was determined (data not shown). Thus, the decrease was due to intracellular degradation. The endocytosis rate of the tyrosine mutants was significantly lower than that of parental proteins, indicating that the tyrosines responsible for the basolateral transport are also responsible for endocytosis of H and F proteins. Tyrosine mutants are internalized at a slow rate (<1%/min) that is more characteristic of bulk uptake during membrane turnover than of active clustering into endocytotic vesicles. In infected MDCK cells, the F protein was found to be targeted to the basolateral surface, as found in cells singly expressing FEdm (10Maisner A. Klenk H.-D. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5276-5278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basolateral transport of the H protein was found to be less stringent in infected cells. Furthermore, endocytosis of MV F protein was more efficient than was internalization of the H protein. Taken together, the F protein cytoplasmic tail appeared to have stronger transport signals. To know whether this signal functions as an autonomous sorting sequence, we wanted to determine whether it is able to redirect an apical membrane protein to the basolateral cell surface. For this purpose, we chose the hemagglutinin (H7) protein of fowl plaque virus, an avian influenza A virus. The apical localization"

We have identified a novel 70-kDa (nonreduced) form of the α6 integrin called α6p for the latin word parvus, meaning small. The variant was immunoprecipitated from human cells using four different α6-specific monoclonal antibodies but not with α3 or α5 antibodies. The α6p integrin contained identical amino acid sequences within exons 13–25, corresponding to the extracellular “stalk region” and the cytoplasmic tail of the α6 integrin. The light chains of α6 and α6p were identical as judged by α6A-specific antibodies and electrophoretic properties. The α6p variant paired with either β1 or β4 subunits and was retained on the cell surface three times longer than α6. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a single polymerase chain reaction product. The α6p variant was found in human prostate (DU145H, LnCaP, PC3) and colon (SW480) cancer cell lines but not in normal prostate (PrEC), breast cancer (MCF-7), or lung cancer (H69) cell lines or a variant of a prostate carcinoma cell line (PC3-N). Protein levels of α6p increased 3-fold during calcium-induced terminal differentiation in a normal mouse keratinocyte model system.

However, it remains largely unknown how the body regulates leptin expression acutely and chronically in response to changes in physiological state such as adiposity. In the present study, we searched for diffusible regulators of leptin production from tissue extracts by taking advantage of a reporter cell line, Ob-Luc. Ob-Luc is a mouse adipocyte cell line that has a luciferase cassette knocked in at one allele of the leptin gene, which makes it possible to analyze leptin gene expression by high throughput luciferase assays. This search identified endothelin-1 (ET-1) as a leptin expression activator from rat brain extracts. ET-1 is a 21-amino acid vasoactive peptide originally isolated from endothelial cell-conditioned medium (31Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayasi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10305) Google Scholar). It induces constriction of vascular smooth muscle cells and is the most potent vasopressor known. In addition to its vascular effects, ET-1 exerts a wide variety of actions on many tissues. An elevated serum ET-1 concentration is associated with cardiovascular (32Hocher B. Thone-Reineke C.

Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). ET-1 is produced primarily by the endothelium but also by a number of other cell types including neurons (37Yamada H. Kurokawa K. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31 Suppl. 1: 215-218Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In accordance with its multiple activities, ET-1 production has been shown to be regulated by many factors, such as growth factors and cytokines (38Kurihara H. Yoshizumi M. Sugiyama T. Takaku F.

A. 1993; 90: 5999-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The endothelin family includes three isopeptides: ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 (43Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. Miyauchi T. Goto K. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Although they are encoded by different genes, these three peptides are closely related structurally and functionally. There are two known endothelin receptors encoded by separate genes, the endothelin-A receptor (ETA) (44Arai H. Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar) and the endothelin-B receptor (ETB) (45Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). Both receptors are seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. They have different affinities for endothelin isopeptides. ETA is selective for ET-1 and ET-2 (44Arai H. Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar); ETB has similar high affinities for all three peptides (45Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). The expression patterns and activities of ETA and ETB are distinct yet partially overlap (46Yanagisawa M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here we report that ET-1 stimulates leptin expression in two different adipocyte cell lines, Ob-Luc and 3T3-L1. Furthermore, the stimulatory action of ET-1 primarily involves ETA signaling. In reporter assays, ET-1 acts as potently as insulin and positively interacts with insulin in stimulating leptin gene expression. We also detected expression of both ETA and ETBreceptors in mouse white adipose tissues. Peptide extract was prepared as previously described (47Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I.

Briefly, about 270 g of frozen rat brains (150 pieces, Pel-Freeze) were homogenized in a 10× volume of homogenization solution (70% acetone, 1 m acetic acid, 20 mmHCl) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected and extracted three times with an equal volume of diethyl ether. The aqueous phase was centrifuged again, and the supernatant was loaded onto six 10-g cartridges of Sep-Pak C18 (Waters), which were preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Cartridges were washed with 5% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted with 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was lyophilized and redissolved in 1 m acetic acid. The extract was loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column, Vydac 218TP510 (10 mm × 250 mm), preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted with a 100-min linear gradient of 15–45% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and 20–80 µl from each fraction were used for activity assays. The active fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto a diphenyl reverse-phase column, Vydac 219TP54 (4.6 mm × 250 mm), preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An 18–38% gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and assayed. The active fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase column, TosoHaas TSK-ODS120T (4.6 mm × 250 mm), preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 23–43% gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and assayed. The active fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto a C3CN reverse-phase column, TosoHaas TSK-CN 80Ts (4.6 mm × 250 mm), preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 13–38% gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and assayed. The active fraction was subjected to a final round of HPLC using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech µRPC C2/C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm) preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The activity was eluted with a 45-min linear gradient of 20–50% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The active fraction, which was collected manually, was subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry on a Micromass Quatro II spectrometer. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was determined by an Applied Biosystems Model 494 protein sequencer. The Ob-Luc preadipocyte cell line was generated to enable ex vivo cell-based transcription assays using adipocytes from transgenic animals having a “knock-in” luciferase reporter at one ob allele (48de la Brousse, F. C., and Chen, J. (July 14, 1998) U. S. Patent 5,780,258.Google Scholar). The cell line was established from 14-day chimeric knock-in embryos, in which a luciferase reporter was inserted into the second exon of the leptin gene via standard gene targeting technique (48de la Brousse, F. C., and Chen, J. (July 14, 1998) U. S. Patent 5,780,258.Google Scholar). Ob-Luc cells were grown in M3:20 media (InCell) and fed every 3 days. When confluent (day 0), cells were given fresh M3:20 media containing 50 µm 2-bromopalmitate (Aldrich). On day 3, the medium was switched to high glucose DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 µg/ml insulin. On day 5, cells were plated into a 96-well plate for luciferase assay or 100-mm dishes for RNA extraction. 3T3-L1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and fed every 3 days. One to two days after confluence (day 0), medium was switched to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 µg/ml insulin, 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 1 µmdexamethasone. On day 2, medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 µg/ml insulin. Beginning on day 4, medium was changed to DMEM containing only 10% FBS, and cells were given fresh medium every 2 days until day 12. On day 12, cells were plated into a 96-well plate for luciferase assay or a 100-mm dish for RNA extraction. Ob-Luc cells were plated in opaque 96-well plates (Corning). After 24 h, HPLC fractions or test compounds were added to wells, and cells were further incubated for 14 h. After incubation, the medium was removed, and 50 µl of assay buffer (30 mm tricine (pH 7.8), 8 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm luciferin) were added to each well. After a 1-min incubation, luminescence was measured with a Torcon AML-34 luminometer. Sources of test compounds are as listed: insulin (Sigma); ET-1, ET-3, and BQ788 (American Peptide Company, Inc.); and FR139317 (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, Co.). Immunoassay of leptin in cell culture media was performed using a mouse leptin immunoassay kit (R & D Systems) as instructed by the manufacturer. 3T3-L1 cells were plated in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h to allow them to attach and recover. Cells were then fed fresh DMEM, 10% FBS containing the indicated compounds and incubated for 24 h, and media were collected and frozen at −80 °C for immunoassay. Isolation of mouse adipocytes was performed as described previously (49Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, the epididymal fat pad was dissected from mice fed ad libitum. The fat pad was minced and digested with 5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (135 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 0.45 mmKH2PO4, 2.17 mmNa2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mmd-glucose, 2% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking every 5 min. Digested fat tissues were filtered through a 500-µm and then a 100-µm nylon mesh (Small Parts) and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The precipitated stromal-vascular cells and top lipid layer were removed, and fat cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer three times. Packed fat cells were frozen at −80 °C for RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted with the RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test). Poly(A)-rich RNA was prepared from total RNA with the Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples were electrophoresed in a 1% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel, blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with specific probes using Quickhyb solution (Stratagene). Probes consisting of a 0.9-kb fragment of mouse ETA cDNA, a 0.38-kb fragment of mouse ETB cDNA, a 0.5-kb fragment of mouseleptin cDNA, and a 0.4-kb fragment of mouseβ-actin cDNA were labeled with a Prime It II kit (Stratagene) in the presence of [32P]dCTP. Sectional in situhybridization analysis was performed as described previously (50Benjamin I.J. Shelton J. Garry D.J. Richardson J.A. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Omental and epididymal white fat sections were taken from male C57BL/6J mice fasted for 24 h. A 0.35-kb fragment of mouseETA cRNA, a 0.38-kb fragment of mouseETB cRNA, and a 0.5-kb fragment of mouseleptin cRNA were used as probes. Riboprobes were generated with T7 RNA polymerase using a Maxiscript kit (Ambion) in the presence of both 35S-CTP and 35S-UTP. We screened tissue extracts for diffusible endogenous factors that increase expression of the leptin gene. Luciferase reporter assay was used to detect transcription activity in Ob-Luc adipocytes. Activity was detected in rat brain extract fractionated with a C18 reverse-phase column (Fig. 1A). We purified this activity through four additional steps of reverse-phase HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified active fraction (Fig.1 B) was subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry and Edman microsequencing. The N-terminal sequence was CSCSSLMDKECVYF … , and the molecular mass was determined to be 2491.8 Da. These results revealed that the active substance was ET-1. We confirmed the up-regulation of luciferase activity in response to synthetic ET-1 peptide in differentiated Ob-Luc cells. ET-1 increased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, as did ET-3 and insulin. The EC50 values for ET-1, ET-3, and insulin were 8.8 nm, 0.84 µm and 55 nm, respectively (Fig.2B). ET-1 failed to increase luciferase activity in a control HEK293 cell line in which a plasmid containing the same luciferase cassette was stably transfected. To further confirm that ET-1 can increase leptin expression, mRNA was extracted from Ob-Luc cells treated with vehicle, 100 nmET-1, or 100 nm insulin and hybridized with a cDNA probe specific for leptin. ET-1 and insulin significantly increased leptin mRNA level in Ob-Luc cells (Fig. 2 A). To show that the stimulation of leptin expression by ET-1 is not unique to the Ob-Luc cell line, we examined the effects of ET-1 on leptin expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Northern blot analysis and leptin immunoassay. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with 10–100 nmET-1 or 10 nm insulin for 4 h. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized with a leptin probe. Both 10 and 100 nm ET-1 increased leptin mRNA in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.3A). Furthermore, ET-1 increased leptin levels in the culture medium after a 24-h incubation. The EC50 values of ET-1, ET-3, and insulin were 4.1 nm, 8.4 µm, and 1.9 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to Ob-Luc cells, insulin was more potent than ET-1 in 3T3-L1 cells. This is probably caused by differences between the two cell lines and the methods used to induce adipocytic differentiation (Fig. 3 B). ET-1 was significantly more potent in stimulating leptin expression than ET-3 in both Ob-Luc and 3T3-L1 cells. ETA is selective for ET-1 over ET-3, whereas ETB has similar affinities for ET-1 and ET-3. Therefore, we felt that the stimulatory action of ET-1 probably involves ETA signaling. To confirm that ET-1 stimulates leptin expression via the ETA receptor, we analyzed the expression of ETA and ETB in adipocyte cell lines. RNA extracted from differentiated Ob-Luc cells and 3T3-L1 cells was hybridized with cDNA probes specific for mouse ETA and ETB. We detected abundant expression of ETA, but not ETB, mRNA in both cell lines (Fig.4A). Next, we preincubated cells for 30 min with various concentrations of FR139317, an ETA-selective antagonist, or BQ788, an ETB-selective antagonist, and then stimulated the cells with 100 nm ET-1. FR139317 was significantly more potent than BQ788 in inhibiting ET-1-induced leptin expression. In Ob-Luc cells, the IC50 of FR139317 and BQ788 were 15 nm and 3.9 µm, respectively (Fig.4 B). In 3T3-L1 cells, the IC50 of FR139317 and BQ788 were 67 nm and 0.67 µm, respectively (Fig. 4 C). These findings indicate that the stimulatory action of ET-1 involves ETA signaling. Insulin is a well known activator of leptin expression (25Kolaczynski J.W. Nyce M.R. Considine R.V. Boden G. Nolan J.J. Henry R. Mudaliar S.R. Olefsky J. Caro J.F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrate that insulin enhances the ability of ET-1 to bind smooth muscle cell and stimulate cell proliferation (51Frank H.J. Levin E.R. Hu R. Pedram A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and ET-1 modulates insulin signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (52Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q. Chatterjee A. Feener E.P. Myers M.G. White M.F. King G.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ET-1 and insulin cross-talk with each other in stimulating leptin expression in adipocytes, Ob-Luc cells and 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of ET-1 in the presence of insulin. In Ob-Luc cells, both 3 and 10 nm insulin increased the efficacy of ET-1 (Fig.5B). Insulin increased the maximum effect of ET-1 but did not change the EC50 value. This effect of insulin is not merely additive. Low concentrations (1 and 3 nm) of ET-1 also increased the efficacy of insulin without changing the EC50 value of the insulin dose-response curve (Fig. 5 C). In 3T3-L1 cells, 10 nm insulin increased the potency of ET-1, i.e.decreased the EC50 value (0.7 nm compared with 4.3 nm) (Fig. 6B). Ob-Luc cells stimulated with 100 nm insulin and 100 nm ET-1 together had a higher leptin expression level than cells stimulated solely with 100 nm insulin or 100 nm ET-1 (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, 3T3-L1 cells expressed more leptin mRNA when stimulated with 10 nminsulin and 100 nm ET-1 than when stimulated by either 10 nm insulin or 100 nm ET-1 alone (Fig.6 A).Figure 6Endothelin positively interacts with insulin to activate leptin production in 3T3-L1 cells.

This is consistent with previous reports that ETA is expressed in isolated rat adipocytes (53Lee Y. Juna C. Fang V. Hsu Y. Lin S. Kwok C. Ho L. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 1468-1471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 3T3-L1 cells (54Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Expression of ETAand ETB receptor mRNA on white fat cells from mice was examined by Northern blot analysis. RNA was extracted from adipocytes isolated from mouse epididymal fat (see “Experimental Procedures”) and hybridized with cDNA probes specific for ETA or ETB. We detected expression of both ETA and ETB on these fat cells, and ETB was expressed at a higher level than ETA (Fig.7A). We also confirmed expression of endothelin receptor mRNA in adipocytes by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Sections of omental and epididymal fat tissues were taken from fasted mice and hybridized with antisense riboprobes specific for leptin, ETA, or ETB. The results of in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that ETA and ETB mRNA are expressed in mouse white fat cells (Fig. 7 B). We purified ET-1 from rat brain and bovine hypothalamus (data not shown) as a leptin gene activator and showed that synthetic ET-1 stimulates leptin production in two distinct adipocyte cell lines, Ob-Luc and 3T3-L1 cells. ET-1 acts via ETA and is as potent as insulin in these cells. Furthermore, both ETA and ETB receptors are expressed in white adipose tissues in mice. When undertaking this study, we did not suspect that ET-1 stimulates leptin expression. It is well established that leptin is a hormone involved in energy homeostasis, whereas ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor. To our knowledge, this is the first report directly linking leptin and endothelin. Recently it was revealed that leptin receptor (OB-Rb) is expressed in endothelial cells and that leptin promotes angiogenesis (16Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Nath A.K. Murakami C. Garcia-Cardena G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Schwabb M.B. Polverini P.J. Flores-Riveros J.R. Science. 1998; 281: 1683-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Leptin also has profound sympathetic, vascular, and renal actions, and leptin-overexpressing transgenic mice are lean but hypertensive due to hyperleptinemia (55Mark A.L. Correia M. Morgan D.A. Shaffer R.A. Haynes W.G. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 537-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In leptin-transgenic obese KKAy mice, caloric restriction reduces only body weight but not blood pressure, whereas it improves both obesity and hypertension in non-transgenic KKAy mice (56Aizawa-Abe M. Ogawa Y. Masuzaki H. Ebihara K. Satoh N. Iwai H. Matsuoka N. Hayashi T. Hosoda K. Inoue G. Yoshimasa Y. Nakao K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ET-1 is known to act on adipocytes, affecting adipogenesis (57Hauner H. Petruschke T. Gries F.A.

ET-1 stimulates leptin expression in Ob-Luc and 3T3-L1 cells through ETA in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 of this ET-1 effect was comparable with the EC50 of insulin to stimulate leptin expression as well as with the EC50 of ET-1 to induce vasoconstriction. This is also consistent with previous reports that adipocytes express ETA (53Lee Y. Juna C. Fang V. Hsu Y. Lin S. Kwok C. Ho L. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 1468-1471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 54Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, we detected expression of both ETA and ETB in native mouse white fat cells by both Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. Despite the involvement of ETA in the stimulation of leptin production in adipose cell lines, ETB is expressed at a higher level than ETA in native fat cells. This may indicate a different expression pattern of ETA and ETB in adipocytes at different stages of differentiation. Further studies are needed to elucidate expression patterns of endothelin receptors in adipocytes in various states and to clarify how endothelin affects leptin expression through these receptors. We also showed that ET-1 positively interacts with insulin in stimulating leptin production. Physiological concentrations of ET-1 seem to modulate the amplitude of the well known stimulatory effect of insulin on leptin production in adipocytes. Insulin and ET-1 share common signal transduction pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (52Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q. Chatterjee A. Feener E.P. Myers M.G. White M.F. King G.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and both peptides can affect expression levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 and insulin receptor-β (64Shih K. Kwok C. Ho L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Insulin also augments ET-1 activity on vascular smooth muscle cells (51Frank H.J. Levin E.R. Hu R. Pedram A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mechanism and physiological significance of this interaction will be the subject of further studies. It is well recognized that body energy homeostasis impacts on the cardiovascular system. Metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus are high risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and hypertension. However, little is known about how the vascular system affects energy homeostasis. Our findings suggest that vascular factors such as ET-1 may regulate the metabolic system through leptin. This line of investigation may help to elucidate the physiological and pathological roles that ET-1 and leptin play in the cross-talk between cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

https://openalex.org/W2142062951,"The SWAN (Solar Wind ANisotropies) Lyman-alpha all-sky camera on the SOHO spacecraft observed the hydrogen coma of comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) from the end of May through mid-August 2000. A systematic set of water-production rates was obtained for this well-documented event of complete fragmentation of a cometary nucleus. The observations indicate that the lower limit for the sunlit surface area of the nucleus was about 1 square kilometer before the fragmentation and that the amount of water released throughout the observing period was 3.3 x 10(9) kilograms. Evidence suggests that the activity of the comet was dominated by successive fragmentation. There were four major outbursts, occurring about every 16 days. The 21 July event led to the complete fragmentation and sublimation of what remained of the nucleus, producing the last 3 x 10(8) kilograms of water. A model where the fragment size distribution follows the power law N(R) approximately R-(2.7), where N and R are the number and radius of fragments, reproduces the observed dissipation. This distribution possibly reflects the internal structure of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2062648533,"Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a putative tumor suppressor in breast and ovarian cancers. Its expression is lost in a majority of tumors, and homozygous deletions have been identified in a small percentage of tumors. Dab2 expression is absent or very low in the majority of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 and SK-Br-3 breast cancer cells. Transfection and expression of Dab2 in MCF-7 and SK-Br-3 cells suppress tumorigenicity. The cells reach a much lower saturation density and have reduced ability to form colonies on agar plates. In examining the signal transduction pathway of Dab2-transfected cells, we found that serum-stimulated c-Fos expression was greatly suppressed; however, the effects of Dab2 on MAPK family kinases were not as consistent. In MCF-7 and SK-Br-3 cells, although c-Fos expression was suppressed, the Erk1/2, JNK, and p38MAPK activities were unchanged or even increased. Serum-stimulated c-Fos expression is dependent on MAPK/Erk activity because the MEK inhibitor PD98059 suppresses Erk activity and c-Fos expression. Therefore, Dab2 appears to uncouple MAPK activation and c-fos transcription. Thus, we conclude that Dab2 re-expression suppresses tumorigenicity by reducing c-Fos expression at a site downstream of the activation of MAPK family kinases. Because Dab2 is frequently lost in cancer, the uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression may be a favored target for inactivation in tumorigenicity.

The cellular components of these oncogenes function in the Ras/MAPK pathway. The pathway is also a key target for cell transformation in tumor development in that about 50% of cancers harbor an activating mutation of Ras (6Verheijen M.H. Wolthuis R.M. Bos J.L. Defize L.H. J.

The cell regulatory system has developed an intricate network for the fine regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway to counter cell transformation. For example, normal human fibroblasts will undergo senescence or programmed cell death when an activated Ras is introduced (9Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

Additionally, the surrounding environment of the cells, such as contact with the extracellular matrix, can modify the effects of growth factors on the activation of Ras/MAPK pathway (16Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In breast and ovarian cancers, mutations of Ras are rare, and activating mutations of other components in the Ras/MAPK pathway are also uncommon (18Clark G.J. Der C.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is believed that regulators in the fine-tuning of the Ras/MAPK pathway are lost, resulting in aberrant activation of the pathway. The conservation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila has helped to delineate the components and regulation of the pathway. In mammalian cells, the growth factor binds to its tyrosine kinase receptor and stimulates its autophosphorylation on its tyrosine residues. The phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor act as a docking site for assembling critical intracellular signaling molecules at the cell membrane to initiate a signal cascade (19Egan S.E.

The adapter molecule Grb2 binds to the tyrosine receptor through Shc or directly to the phosphotyrosine residue, bringing associated Sos to activate Ras on the plasma membranes. Ras is activated upon conversion to the GTP bound form and initiates the Raf-1/MEK/MAPK kinase cascade. An established target for MAPK is Elk-1, a transcription factor required for transactivation of c-Fos (21Cruzalegui F.H. Cano E. Treisman R.

We now report that the expression of c-Fos is a target for the regulatory function of Disabled-2 (Dab2), a candidate tumor suppressor of breast and ovarian tumors (28Wong K.K. Mok C.H. Welsh J.

Dab2 was identified by differential displaying to be a gene whose expression was absent in ovarian cancer cells but present in normal ovarian epithelial cells (28Wong K.K. Mok C.H. Welsh J. McClelland M. Tsao S.W. Berkowitz R.S. Intern. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found that Dab2 is expressed in breast and ovarian epithelial cells, but its expression is lost in the majority (about 85%) of breast and ovarian tumor cells (28Wong K.K. Mok C.H. Welsh J. McClelland M. Tsao S.W. Berkowitz R.S. Intern. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Dab2 contains a phosphotyrosine-interacting domain (PID, or PTB) in its N terminus and a proline-rich, SH3-binding domain in its C terminus, resembling an adapter molecule (32Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Its binding to Grb2, competing with Sos, leads to the hypothesis that Dab2 is a Ras/MAPK pathway regulator that is lost in cancer (33Xu X.X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found that re-expression of Dab2 in breast cancer cells leads to suppression of c-Fos expression and cell growth inhibition. Surprisingly, Dab2 does not inhibit MAPK activity. Thus, a regulatory step in the Ras/MAPK pathway is the uncoupling of the activation of MAPK and transcriptional activation of c-Fos, mediated by Dab2. Tumor cells likely abrogate the essential regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in normal cells by the elimination of Dab2, which might contribute to cell transformation.

In some cases, after gaining experience with usage of a single antibody, two or more antibodies were used in the same incubation to detect various molecular weight proteins simultaneously. The full-length human DAB2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF188298) was inserted into the pcDNA/zeo eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen Maxiprep column, and LipofectAMINE reagent was used for transfection. Briefly, 2 µg of Dab2 expression construct or vector control plasmid DNA was mixed with 20 µl of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM and was added to cells for 16 h. The transfection mix was removed, and fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS was added. After 12 h, selection medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and 300 ng/ml of Zeomycin) was added to the cells. Following a 10–12 day selection with change of medium every 2 days to removed dead cells, selected clones were isolated and collected by cloning rings, expanded by further culturing, and examined for Dab2 expression by Western blotting. Cell growth was determined by counting under a microscope and the MTT assay (Promega). For cell counting, cells (around 105 per plate) were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dish (6-well dish), and medium was changed daily. At the indicated times, cells were harvested in 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA, collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 µl of phosphate-buffered saline for counting. For the MTT assay, cells (around 104) were plated in 96-well plates, and medium was changed daily. On the indicated day, the MTT dye was added and incubated with the cells for 2 h in the tissue culture incubator. The reaction was stopped by addition of cell solubilization solution. After 2 h at room temperature, the absorbance of the solution at 570 nm was measured with a microplate reader. Cells were embedded in a 0.3% low melting point agarose top layer in culture medium, plated on top of a 0.6% agarose bed in DMEM containing 10% FBS and complete supplements. The agarose plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 weeks, with addition of fresh medium every 3 days. Cells on 100-mm plates were harvested with trypsin-EDTA solution and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol, pelleted, and resuspended in propidium iodine staining solution for 30 min at 4 °C. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. We have previously found that Dab2 is expressed in breast and ovarian epithelial cells, but its expression is lost in the majority (about 85%) of breast and ovarian tumor cells tested (28Wong K.K. Mok C.H. Welsh J. McClelland M. Tsao S.W. Berkowitz R.S. Intern. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V.

Forced expression of Dab2 in tumor cells reduces cell growth, induces cell death, and suppresses tumorigenicity in the nude mouse xenograft model (29Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To further determine the biological consequence of Dab2 loss for the tumor cells and to examine the signal transduction pathway affected, we have transfected and established Dab2 expression in MCF-7 and Sk-Br-3 breast tumor cells. Dab2 expression is absent in these two breast carcinoma cell lines (30Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Following transfection of the human Dab2 cDNA in the pcDNA expression vector into MCF-7 breast cancer cells, 26 zeomycin-resistant clones were selected. Of these clones, only two clones were found to express Dab2 as detected by Western blot, and a single clone (clone 8) still retained Dab2 expression upon expansion of the cells in culture (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, 22 of 64 Sk-Br-3 clones selected retained some expression of the transfected Dab2, and the three high expressing clones 49, 50, and 57 were chosen for further analysis (Fig. 1 B). Three randomly selected vector transfected clones of each cell line were expanded for use as controls. Upon establishment of the Dab2-expressing cells, we first characterized the growth properties of the cells. Transfected MCF-7 cells (clone 8) were found to grow more slowly in either low (0.1%) or high (10%) serum compared with vector-transfected controls (Fig.2 A). A similar growth retardation was found in the three Dab2-expressing SK-Br-3 clones compared to three vector-transfected clones (Fig. 2 B). The Dab2-transfected MCF-7 cells were found to have a reduced ability to form colonies on agar plates; MCF-7-Dab2 clone 8 cells formed fewer (about 20% of control) and smaller colonies than vector-transfected clones (data not shown). All three clones of Dab2-transfected Sk-Br-3 cells also had a reduced ability to form colonies on agar plates (not shown). All four selected Dab2-expressing tumor cell clones were analyzed for cell cycle parameters using flow cytometry (TableI). Compared with vector-transfected and non-transfected cells, both MCF-7 and Sk-Br-3 cells expressing Dab2 have about a 50% lower percentage of cells in S phase and about 25% lower percentage of cells in G2/M phase, suggesting a prolonged G1 phase. These results are consistent with previous reports with different tumor cell lines on the negative cell growth regulatory properties and tumor suppressive activity of Dab2 (29Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Tseng C.P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong E.C.

Our goal is to analyze the effects on the cellular signal transduction pathways by the Dab2 protein in these cells.Table ICell cycle parameters of the transfected cell clonesCell cloneG0/G1SG2/MCell cycle distribution%MCF-7661618MCF-7-Vector641521MCF-7-Dab2 (no. 8)76915SK-Br-344848SK-Br-3-vector521038SK-Br-3-Dab2 (no. 49)71326SK-Br-3-Dab2 (no. 50)63334SK-Br-3-Dab2 (no. 57)69427MCF-7 and Sk-Br-3 non-transfected, pcDNA3 vector-transfected, and Dab2-expressing clones were grown to 80% confluency on 10-mm plates in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

Duplicate plates of cells for each clone were used in each experiments, and the variation between the result of the duplicates was smaller than 10%. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments, and data from a representative experiment are shown.

Duplicate plates of cells for each clone were used in each experiments, and the variation between the result of the duplicates was smaller than 10%. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments, and data from a representative experiment are shown. Next, we examined the possible changes in mitogenic signaling in Dab2-expressing cells compared with vector-transfected cells. We observed by both Western and Northern blots a reduction of c-Fos expression upon serum stimulation of the Dab2-expressing cells. For both MCF-7 cells and Sk-Br-3, c-Fos is induced by serum at 30 min and is maximal at 60 min in vector-transfected cells (and also in non-transfected cells). In Dab2-expressing MCF-7 cells (clone 8) (Fig.3) and a representative clone 49 of Dab2-expressing SK-Br-3 cells (Fig. 5 B), little c-Fos expression is induced by serum. The same effect of Dab2 expression on c-Fos expression was also observed in transfection of tumor cells with Dab2 using an adenoviral vector in our previous investigation (34Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Sheng Z. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the suppression of c-Fos expression is not because of the particular properties of the selected cell clones but the result of Dab2 expression.Figure 5Comparison of Dab2 expression and PD98059 on the inhibition of serum-stimulated c-Fos expression in SK-Br-3 cells. A, SK-Br-3 cells (untransfected) were seeded onto 35-mm plates and were cultured without serum for 18 h. By the end of the 18-h incubation, PD98059 (100 µm) was added to one set of cells for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated with 10% serum, with or without addition of PD98059 (100 µm) for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. The cell lysates were analyzed for c-Fos expression and MAPK activation by Western blotting. B,SK-Br-3 cells transfected with vector or Dab2 (clone 49) were seeded onto 35-mm plates, and were cultured without serum for 18 h. The cells were then stimulated with 10% serum. Cell lysates were harvested at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min and were assayed for c-Fos expression and MAPK activation simultaneously by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been established that MAPK activation leads to c-Fos transcription and increases in AP-1 activity (21Cruzalegui F.H. Cano E. Treisman R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7948-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 23Yang S.H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To our surprise, however, no reduction in MAPK activity was observed in Dab2-expressing MCF-7 or SK-Br-3 cells although c-Fos expression was suppressed. To eliminate possible artifacts and to confirm this observation, we performed Western blot analysis to determine c-Fos expression and MAPK activation simultaneously on the same blot by including a proper mix of anti-c-Fos and anti-phospho-MAPK (activated) antibodies in the same incubation. c-Fos expression and MAPK activation by serum were determined for clone 8 Dab2-expressing MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3), and a representative clone 49 of Dab2-expressing Sk-Br-3 cells (Fig. 5 B). In the Dab2 expressing MCF-7 cells, though serum-stimulated c-Fos expression is greatly reduced compared with vector-transfected control, MAPK activity is enhanced as detected by phosphopeptide antibodies in this experiment (Fig. 3). Similar effects of Dab2 expression in SK-Br-3 on c-Fos expression and MAPK activation were found in Dab2-expressing clones (not shown). We also investigated and found no effect of Dab2 expression on Ras and Raf-1 activation (not shown). Thus, restoration of Dab2 expression appears to dissociate MAPK activation and c-Fos expression in tumor cells. The effect of Dab2 expression on other MAPK family kinases including JNK and p38MAPK kinases was also investigated. Dab2 expression appears to have no significant and consistent effect on serum-stimulated JNK activity as detected by Western blot with JNK-phosphopeptide specific antibodies (Fig. 3). In either Dab2-expressing or vector-transfected MCF-7 and SK-Br-3 cells, serum stimulation did not notably activate p38MAPK as detected by anti-p38MAPK phosphopeptide antibodies (not shown), though in the same experiment, strong activation was observed in a positive control using anisomycin as a stimulating agent. The effect of MAPK family kinase activation on c-Fos expression was further explored in MCF-7 and Sk-Br-3 cells using kinase inhibitors PD98059 and SB202190. In MCF-7 cells, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited MAPK activation and c-Fos expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A), indicating PD98059-inhibitable MAPK activity is necessary for serum to activate c-Fos expression. In contrast, the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190, although it appears to reduce the basal state of MAPK activity, had no inhibitory effect on serum-stimulated MAPK (Erk) activation and c-Fos expression (Fig. 4 B). In comparison, inhibition of c-Fos expression by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig.5 A) mechanistically differed from inhibition of c-Fos expression by Dab2 expression (Fig.5 B) in SK-Br-3 cells. Thus, Erk1/2, but not p38MAPK, is required for serum-stimulated c-Fos expression. Unlike PD98059, Dab2 restrains c-Fos expression at a step between MAPK activation and c-Fos expression without inhibiting MAPK activity (Fig.6).Figure 6Schematic model presentation of Dab2 regulation of c-Fos expression. Serum and growth factor activates Ras and MAP kinase, which is inhibited upon addition of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 by MAPK is required for serum-stimulated c-Fos transcription. The pathway is regulated by Dab2 by uncoupling MAPK activation and c-Fos expression. This regulatory mechanism is often absent in tumor cells because of the loss of Dab2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been established that MAPK phosphorylates/activates the transcription factor Elk-1, and activated Elk-1 binds to the c-Fos promoter and activates expression of c-Fos (21Cruzalegui F.H. Cano E. Treisman R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7948-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found that Dab2 expression reduced the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of Elk-1 in MCF-7 cells and in Sk-Br-3 cells (not shown). To explore the mechanism for the effects of Dab2 on MAPK and Elk-1, we examined the physical interaction between Erk1/2, Elk-1, and Dab2. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that Dab2 is not associated in any significant way with Erk1/2 or Elk-1, either the phosphorylated or unphosphorylated proteins. Thus, through an indirect but unclear mechanism, Dab2 uncouples MAPK activation and Elk-1 phosphorylation. Dab2 is frequently lost in breast and ovarian tumors (30Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have shown here in MCF-7 and SK-Br-3 breast cancer cells, and others have shown in additional tumor cells (29Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), that transfection and expression of Dab2 suppresses tumorigenicity: the cells reach a much lower saturation density, have reduced ability to form colonies on agar plates, and have suppressed ability to develop tumors in nude mice. In analysis of signal transduction pathways affected, we have found that serum-stimulated c-Fos expression is greatly suppressed. Expression of c-Fos is activated through the action of MAP kinase phosphorylation (21Cruzalegui F.H. Cano E. Treisman R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7948-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the Erk1/2, JNK kinase, and p38MAPK activities were unchanged or even increased upon serum stimulation in transfected Dab2-expressing cells compared with vector-transfected cells. Thus, we conclude that Dab2 re-expression suppresses tumorigenicity by uncoupling MAPK activation and c-Fos expression. Although Dab2 could have additional effects on the cells, the suppression of c-Fos expression may be sufficient to suppress cell growth and transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1997918326,"Although arachidonic acid has been demonstrated to stimulate a wide variety of cellular functions, the responsible mechanisms remain poorly defined. We now report that arachidonic acid stimulated the activity of class Ia phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HL60 cells, and human neutrophils. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with AG-1478, an inhibitor of the ErbB receptor family, resulted in the suppression of PI3K activation by arachidonic acid. The fatty acid enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 but not of ErbB2 or ErbB3. The ability of arachidonic acid to stimulate PI3K activity in neutrophils was suppressed by indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, respectively, but not by 17-octadecynoic acid, an inhibitor of ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Consistent with this, the activity of PI3K in neutrophils was stimulated by 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Arachidonic acid also transiently stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 and Ser-473. Although PI3K was not required for the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1, ERK2, and p38, in arachidonic acid-stimulated neutrophils, the fatty acid acted via PI3K to stimulate the respiratory burst. These results not only define a novel mechanism through which some of the actions of arachidonic acid are mediated but also demonstrate that, in addition to ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor), ErbB4 can also be transactivated by a non-epidermal growth factor-like ligand.

In an endeavor to understand further the mechanisms through which 20:4ω6 acts, we investigated whether 20:4ω6 affected the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K is a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate inositol-containing phospholipids on the D-3 position of the inositol ring, resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3 P, PtdIns 3,4 P2, and PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). PI3K is divided into three main classes based on structural similarity and in vitrosubstrate specificity. Class I kinases are heterodimers of a catalytic and regulatory subunit and are coupled to either tyrosine kinases (class Ia) or to heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (class Ib) (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Within cells, the preferred substrate for class I PI3K is PtdIns 4,5 P2, and only class I PI3Ks have been shown to activate Akt (also known as PKB), which is encoded by three closely related genes, PKBα, PKBβ and PKBγ (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Class Ia enzymes include the p110α, p110β, and p110δ catalytic subunits that are complexed to one of seven adaptor (regulatory) proteins derived from three separate genes (p85α, p85β, and p55γ) (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The adaptor proteins, via their two Src homology 2 domains, mediate the interaction of class Ia PI3K with tyrosine-phosphorylated residues. To date, only one class Ib PI3K, PI3Kγ, has been identified, and this is composed of a p110γ catalytic subunit and a 101-kDa regulatory subunit (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Class I PI3Ks are sensitive to inhibition by wortmannin and LY294002 (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Mammalian class II PI3K is exemplified by the 190-kDa PI3K-C2α (26Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This kinase is refractory to inhibition by wortmannin and LY294002, and it predominantly uses PtdIns and PtdIns 4P as substrates in vitro and can phosphorylate PtdIns 4,5 P2 in the presence of phosphatidylserine (26Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The third class of PI3K is structurally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps34. This is a PtdIns-specific 3-kinase, and it associates with p150 for enzymatic activity (27Panaretou C. Domin J. Cockcroft S. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PI3K has a diverse range of roles in cell biology including the promotion of cell survival, mediation of the actions of insulin, and regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis in response to bacterial peptides (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 28Wymann M.P. Sozzani S. Altruda F. Montavani A. Hirsch E. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We now report that 20:4ω6 stimulated the activity of PI3K in human endothelial and myeloid cells. A role for ErbB4 in the activation of PI3K by 20:4ω6 in the endothelial cells was also established. Although ω-hydroxylation of the fatty acid by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases was not required for the stimulation of PI3K activity in neutrophils, metabolism of 20:4ω6 by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases was required. These data suggest that some of the actions of 20:4ω6 may be mediated by PI3K. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). 17-octadecynoic acid was purchased from Cayman. Formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fMLP), myelin basic protein, protein A-Sepharose, phosphatidylinositol, and general reagents for kinase assays were from Sigma-Aldrich. Lavendustin A and B and AG-1478 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and AG-1296 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Victoria, Australia). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 4000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Geneworks (Adelaide, Australia). Polyclonal anti-p85α, ERK2, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, and Akt antibodies and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY99, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY100, was obtained from New England Biolabs. Anti-ACTIVE ERK, anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308) and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibodies were obtained from Promega(Madison, WI), New England Biolabs, and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. The Western blot recycling kit was obtained from Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX). Enhanced chemiluminescence solutions and reinforced nitrocellulose were from NEN Life Sciences Products (Boston, MA) and Schleicher and Schuell (Dassel, Germany), respectively. Arachidonic acid was dissolved in ethanol, and fMLP, 17-octadecynoic acid, and the tyrphostins, AG-1478 and AG-1296, were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentrations of the vehicles were: 0.1% ethanol (v/v) and 0.1% Me2SO (v/v). Control cells received an equivalent amount of a vehicle that did not affect cellular responses. HL60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at up to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by the rapid single-step method of Ferrante and Thong (29Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 48: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The preparations of neutrophils were at least 98% pure and 99% viable as judged by morphological examination of cytospin preparations and the ability of viable cells to exclude trypan blue. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated by collagenase treatment and cultured as described previously (30Huang Z.H. Bates E.J. Ferrante J.V. Hii C.S. T Poulos A. Robinson B.S. Ferrante A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Second passage cells (0.25 × 106) were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and were used after 4 days. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing ErbB2 or ErbB3 were maintained as described previously (31Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). All cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salts solution (HBSS) 30 min before being incubated with 20:4ω6 or vehicle. Incubations were terminated by either removing the incubation medium and washing the cells once with HBSS (4 °C) (HUVEC) or adding an equal volume of cold (4 °C) HBSS into the incubation tubes followed immediately by centrifugation (3000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). The cells were lysed by incubation in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and benzamidine) for 2 h with constant mixing (4 °C) as described previously (20Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Edwards Y. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After lysis, cell debris was sedimented (12,000 × g, 30 s), and the protein content of the soluble fractions was determined by the Lowry method. For detection of Akt phosphorylation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins by Western blot analysis, the incubations were terminated by the removal of the incubation medium, and Laemmli buffer was added. The samples were boiled (5 min) and stored (−20 °C). Lysates containing equal amounts of protein (0.5–1 mg) were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (15 µl, 20 min, 4 °C) before being incubated with the anti-p85α subunit antibody or PY99 (3 µg/sample). After mixing for 2 h (4 °C), the immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (15 µl). The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 s) and washed once with buffer A (4 °C). For PI3K activity assays, samples that were immunoprecipitated with the anti-p85α subunit antibody were washed once with buffer A, followed by another wash with buffer B (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 µmNa2VO4), and resuspended in 50 µl of buffer B. For Western blot analyses, the samples that were immunoprecipitated with PY99 were mixed with Laemmli buffer and boiled (5 min). The activity of PI3K was assayed essentially as described previously (32Hii C.S.T. Marin L.A. Halliday D. Roberton D.M. Murray A.W. Ferrante A. Immunology. 2001; 102: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, MgCl2 (10 µl, stock concentration of 100 mm) and PtdIns (10 µl, stock concentration of 4 µg/ml sonicated in 10 mm Tris/HCl containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) were added to the above prepared samples, and the reaction was started by the addition of 15 µCi of [32P]ATP. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with constant mixing. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 µl of 8 m HCl and 320 µl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). After vigorous mixing and centrifugation the aqueous phase was removed, and the chloroform phase was washed (three times) with 500 µl of CH3OH/H2O (1:1). The lipid samples were applied to Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates that were developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/30% NH4OH (90:70:14.6:5.4 v/v) (32Hii C.S.T. Marin L.A. Halliday D. Roberton D.M. Murray A.W. Ferrante A. Immunology. 2001; 102: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The PtdIns 332P spots were located, and the radioactivity was determined using an Instant Imager (Packard Instruments). Equal amounts of denatured proteins per lane were separated on 12% (8% for the analysis of ErbB receptors) polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose (100 V, 1.5 h), and immunodetected as described previously (20Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Edwards Y. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immediately after transfer, the blots were stained with Ponceau S (0.1% in 5% acetic acid) to confirm the even transfer of proteins within all the lanes of the gels. The blots that showed dissimilar protein levels between the lanes were discarded. Anti-ERK2, ACTIVE ERK, p85α subunit, Akt, and phospho-Akt antibodies were used to detect ERK2, dual-phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2, the p85α subunit, Akt, and phosphorylated Akt, respectively. To detect ErbB receptor phosphorylation, samples that were immunoprecipitated with PY99 were Western blotted first with an anti-ErbB2 antibody. The blots were stripped using the Western blot recycling kit and reblotted with the anti-ErbB4 antibody, and the stripping and reprobing steps were repeated for the detection of ErbB3. To confirm that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins remained bound to the nitrocellulose, the blots were finally probed with the anti-p85α subunit antibody. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (20Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Edwards Y. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Superoxide production was measured by monitoring the chemiluminescence resulting from the oxidation of lucigenin (9,9′-bis-N-methyl-acridinium nitrate) (33Hii C.S.T. Stacey K. Moghaddami N. Murray A.W. Ferrante A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils (1 × 106 cells) were preincubated with wortmannin or Me2SO (0.1% v/v) for 10 min at 37 °C. 20:4ω6 (20 µm) and lucigenin, dissolved in HBSS (250 µm v/v), were added, and the resulting chemiluminescence (mV) was recorded using a luminometer (Model 1250 or 1251 with MultiUse software, Bio-Orbit Oy, Turku, Finland). The results are expressed as the maximum rate of superoxide production achieved (mV). Where appropriate, differences were analyzed by analysis of variance or unpaired Student's ttest and were considered significant at p < 0.05. The effect of 20:4ω6 on the activity of PI3K was investigated in cell types that had been shown previously to respond to this fatty acid (2Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T. Karnovsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12640-12643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Finstad H.S. Kolset S.O. Holme J.A. Wiger R. Farrants A.K. Blomhoff R. Drevon C.A.

Incubation of neutrophils (Fig.1 a), HL60 cells (Fig.1 b), and HUVECs (Fig. 1 c) with 20:4ω6 increased the activity of PI3K. Because the anti-p85α antibody that was used to immunoprecipitate the kinase cross-reacts with all the currently known forms of the regulatory subunit of class Ia PI3Ks, the data represent activation of class Ia PI3K. Although the effect of 20:4ω6 on kinase activity was transient in neutrophils and HL60 cells, peaking at 2 and 5 min, respectively, PI3K activity in HUVECs increased with time over the 10-min incubation period (Fig. 1). The stimulatory effect of 20:4ω6 on PI3K activity was detectable at 5 µm fatty acid (Fig. 2). Although PI3K activity in neutrophils increased in a dose-dependent manner, increasing the fatty acid concentration above 5 µm did not produce a greater effect on kinase activity in HL60 cells.Figure 2Dose-dependent stimulation of PI3K activity by 20:4ω6. Neutrophils (a) and HL60 cells (b) were incubated with 20:4ω6 at the concentrations indicated for 5 min and lysed. PI3K was immunoprecipitated, and kinase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are means ± S.E. of three (a) or mean ± range of two (b) separate experiments. Significance of difference (a):p < 0.05 by analysis of variance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Consistent with the above data, incubation of neutrophils with 20:4ω6 increased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85α subunit of PI3K (Fig. 3). The kinetics for this change in phosphorylation were similar to those found for the increase in kinase activity (Fig. 1 a). To confirm that tyrosine phosphorylation was required for the activation of PI3K by 20:4ω6, neutrophils and HUVECs were preincubated with lavendustin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The data in Fig. 3, b and c, show that pretreatment of HUVECs and neutrophils, respectively, with lavendustin A for 10 min caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the ability of 20:4ω6 to stimulate PI3K. Lavendustin B, a negative control for lavendustin A, did not affect the ability of 20:4ω6 to stimulate PI3K activity (data not shown). These data demonstrate that 20:4ω6 stimulated the activity of PI3K in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Lavendustin A was discovered as an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (34Onoda T. Iinuma H. Sasaki Y. Hamada M. Isshiki K. Naganawa H. Takeuchi T. Tatsuta K. Umezawa K. J. Nat. Prod. 1989; 52: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our previous studies in WB rat liver epithelial cells have demonstrated that 20:4ω6 caused the appearance of a major tyrosine-phosphorylated band that migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gels) with a molecular mass that was in excess of 138 kDa (20Hii C.S.T.

This protein was also strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells that were stimulated with either lysophosphatidic acid or EGF (20Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Edwards Y. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Analyzed on 8% SDS gels, lysates from 20:4ω6-stimulated HUVECs were found to contain two major proteins (molecular masses of 180–190 and 85 kDa) that exhibited enhanced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation compared with those from control cells (Fig. 4 a). Interestingly, in lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated COS and Vero cells (35Laffargue M. Raynal P. Yart A. Peres C. Wetzker R. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32835-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 170–180 kDa has been identified recently as the EGF receptor. It was found that transactivation of the EGF receptor was necessary for the stimulation of PI3K by lysophosphatidic acid (35Laffargue M. Raynal P. Yart A. Peres C. Wetzker R. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32835-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the 85-kDa protein (Fig. 4 a) was likely to be the p85α subunit of PI3K, the 180–190-kDa protein could be a member of the ErbB receptor family. This receptor family is composed of ErbB1 (the EGF receptor), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (36Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and HUVECs have been reported to express ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 but not ErbB1 (37Russell K.S. Stern D.F. Polverini P.J. Bender J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2205-H2211PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates from HUVECs therefore were subjected to immunoprecipitation with PY99 and Western blotting with an antibody against ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4. The data in Fig. 4 cdemonstrate that 20:4ω6 selectively enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4. This effect was partially reduced by AG-1478, an EGF receptor-specific inhibitor that also inhibits ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (38Egeblad M. Mortensen O.H. van Kempen L.C. Jaattela M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 20:4ω6 did not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 (Fig. 4 b) or ErbB3 (Fig. 4 d). The ability of the anti-ErbB2 and anti-ErbB3 antibodies to detect ErbB2 and ErbB3, respectively, was confirmed in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with ErbB2 or ErbB3 (31Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). To determine whether transactivation of ErbB4 was required for the stimulation of PI3K activity by 20:4ω6, HUVECs were pretreated with AG-1478. The data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that AG-1478 suppressed PI3K activation by 20:4ω6. In contrast, AG-1296, a specific platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor, did not affect the ability of 20:4ω6 to stimulate PI3K activity in HUVECs (data not shown). These data are consistent with transactivation of ErbB4 being required for the activation of PI3K in HUVECs by 20:4ω6. The data with lavendustin A (Fig. 3 c) suggest that a member of the ErbB receptor family could also be involved in the activation of PI3K by the fatty acid in neutrophils. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the ability of 20:4ω6 to stimulate the activity of p38 was not suppressed by inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases (22Hii C.S.T. Huang Z.H.

We first showed that osmotic shock by 1 m sucrose stimulated rapid release of neurotransmitters from intact PC12 cells, indicating that most of the vesicles were docked at the plasma membrane. Second, we further investigated the mechanism of rescue of botulinum neurotoxin E inhibition of release by recombinant SNAP-25 COOH-terminal coil, which is known to be required in the triggering stage. We confirmed here that Ca2+ was required simultaneously with the SNAP-25 peptide, with no significant increase in release if either the peptide or Ca2+ was present during the priming stage as well as the triggering, suggesting that SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) complex assembly was involved in the final Ca2+-triggered event. Using this rescue system, we also identified a series of acidic surface SNAP-25 residues that rescued better than wild-type when mutated, due to broadened Ca2+sensitivity, suggesting that this charged patch may interact electrostatically with a negative regulator of membrane fusion. Finally, we showed that the previously demonstrated stimulation of exocytosis in this system by calmodulin required calcium binding, since calmodulin mutants defective in Ca2+-binding were not able to enhance release.

Different populations of vesicles within cells exhibit distinct Ca2+ concentration requirements for the stimulation of exocytosis and undergo fusion with varying kinetics (1Kasai H. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 88-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This is partly attributable to the spatial Ca2+ concentration gradients originating from Ca2+ channels (2Neher E.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Ca2+ not only triggers the final step of transmitter release, but is also involved in many other events important for vesicle recycling, for example, movement of vesicles from the reserve pool to the immediately releasable pool, which may involve Ca2+-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements (5Neher E. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The norepinephrine-containing dense core vesicles in PC12 cells have been shown to be morphologically docked (6Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol.

Osmotic shock by applying high concentrations of sucrose has been used to estimate the size of the readily releasable pool in neurons (8Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F.

In the reconstituted exocytosis system using these cracked PC12 cells, Ca2+ concentration is controlled by buffered solution, and only docked dense core vesicles are assayed, thus the system eliminates Ca2+ concentration dynamics and provides a tool to analyze the late post-docking steps of vesicle fusion. The role of Ca2+ in the triggering of fusion with the plasma membrane of synaptic vesicles in neurons and large dense core vesicles in PC12 cells is likely in regulating the formation of SNARE1 (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) complexes (9Chen Y.A.

Full formation of the SNARE complex bridging the two membranes is believed to force the membranes into close proximity, helping to overcome the energy barrier of membrane fusion (9Chen Y.A.

Current models postulate that full SNARE complex formation is prevented by a Ca2+-sensing protein, which binds to one or more of the SNAREs (or a partial SNARE complex) until it is displaced by the arrival of Ca2+ ions that trigger exocytosis (14Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the proposed Ca2+ sensor and its precise binding site are still topics of debate (12Brunger A.T. Curr. Opin.

We previously established a system to study the role of SNAP-25 in large dense core vesicle exocytosis in cracked PC12 cells, in which the SNAP-25 COOH-terminal coil is inactivated by cleavage with botulinum neurotoxin E, and exocytosis of tritiated norepinephrine is rescued by addition of a recombinant SNAP-25 COOH-terminal coil (S25C; Ref. 9Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To investigate whether, as in chromaffin cells for example (5Neher E. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 20Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), calcium facilitates earlier steps than the final triggering of exocytosis from PC12 cells, we took advantage of the fact that the norepinephrine release assay can be split into two stages: MgATP-dependent priming, followed by Ca2+-dependent triggering (22Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We examine whether the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ and/or S25C during the priming step influences the kinetics of either rescue or regular exocytosis during subsequent triggering. Prior exposure to calcium did not detectably enhance the rate of release, suggesting that early calcium-dependent maturation steps likely occur prior to priming and confirming that SNARE complex assembly appears to be involved in the final Ca2+-triggered event. We further identify a series of charged surface residues in the COOH-terminal half of S25C, mutation of which results in enhanced rescue of exocytosis compared with wild-type S25C in our rescue assay. These mutants exhibit broadened tolerance to different Ca2+ concentrations, resulting in enhanced release at most of the Ca2+concentrations tested. We speculate that these residues might be involved in the binding of the Ca2+ sensor to the SNARE complexes, which normally suppresses exocytosis at suboptimal Ca2+ concentrations. A candidate calcium sensor for membrane fusion events is calmodulin, which is a ubiquitous calcium mediator in eukaryotic cells. All vertebrates have one identical calmodulin protein, encoded by multiple genes (23Friedberg F. Protein Seq. Data Anal. 1990; 3: 335-337PubMed Google Scholar). There has been substantial evidence implicating calmodulin in various membrane trafficking events (18Peters C. Mayer A.

Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Calmodulin binds Ca2+ via a structural motif called the EF-hand. Upon binding Ca2+ at each of its four EF-hands, calmodulin exposes a hydrophobic surface that is thought to be critical for interactions with its effector proteins (29Persechini A. Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mutation of one of the highly conserved Ca2+-coordinating aspartates to alanine in the EF-hand motif of the essential yeast calmodulin protein dramatically reduces its affinity for Ca2+ (30Geiser J.R. van Tuinen D. Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M. Davis T.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 949-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), but surprisingly has little effect on yeast growth (30Geiser J.R. van Tuinen D. Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M. Davis T.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 949-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), implying that calmodulin has important functions that do not require Ca2+ binding. We have previously identified calmodulin as an active component of the membrane EGTA extract from brain that stimulated exocytosis from cracked PC12 cells (31Chen Y.A. Duvvuri V. Schulman H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26469-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we show that mutations in the Ca2+-binding domain of calmodulin prevent its ability to stimulate release, demonstrating that Ca2+ binding is required for calmodulin's function in exocytosis. PC12 cells were maintained, loaded with [3H]norepinephrine, and cracked (mechanically permeabilized) as described previously (22Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 31Chen Y.A. Duvvuri V. Schulman H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26469-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After being incubated on ice in KGlu buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 105 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA) with 0.1% BSA and 9 mmadditional EGTA for ≥1 h, the cracked cells were washed in KGlu + 0.1% BSA buffer three times (800 × g centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C) before the final stimulation. A typical composite release reaction contains ∼106 cells, 2 mmMgATP, ∼0.7 mg/ml rat brain cytosol, and 1.6 mm total Ca2+ (∼1 µm free Ca2+, measured by fura-2 fluorescence as in Ref. 31Chen Y.A. Duvvuri V. Schulman H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26469-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in total of 200 µl of KGlu buffer. Release reactions were initiated by warming to 30 °C and terminated by chilling on ice. [3H]norepinephrine secretion was measured by centrifuging the cells for 30 min at 2500 × g at 4 °C and calculating the percentage of total radioactivity in the supernatant after scintillation counting. Results were plotted using Cricket Graph 1.5.2 software (Computer Associates International, Inc.). Where indicated, the composite release reaction was split into two stages: MgATP-dependent priming, followed by Ca2+-dependent triggering. In such cases, cells were first primed by incubation in KGlu/BSA buffer containing 2.6 mm MgATP and ∼0.65 mg/ml rat brain cytosol at 30 °C for 5 or 15 min prior to triggering for different lengths of time by addition of Ca2+ to 1.6 mm total. To investigate the effect of adding S25C or the full complement of Ca2+ during triggering, the indicated concentrations of S25C or Ca2+ were added during a 5-min priming reaction, followed by a time course of triggering with the appropriate amounts of extra S25C, Ca2+, MgATP, and cytosol to compensate for the volume increase. There were no washes between the priming and triggering stages. After EGTA extraction and one wash in KGlu/BSA buffer, the cells were treated with 30 nmrecombinant botulinum neurotoxin E light chain in the presence of 2 mm MgATP and ∼0.35 mg/ml rat brain cytosol for 6–10 min at 30 °C. Cells were then washed three times in KGlu/BSA buffer prior to rescue by addition to tubes containing S25C in addition to cytosol, MgATP, and Ca2+ as in the typical release reactions above. For the dose response curves, the purity and concentration of the S25C mutants (measured using the BCA assay (Pierce)) were verified by SDS-PAGE to ensure equivalent amounts were used in the assays. To determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of the S25C proteins, the cells were stimulated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of MgATP, cytosol, 40 µm of each S25C protein, and Ca2+ of different concentrations to achieve final total free concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 µm as indicated. Cracked cells were primed in KGlu buffer containing 0.7–1 mg/ml rat brain cytosol and 2 mm MgATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The primed cells were centrifuged, washed once with KGlu buffer, and distributed into triggering reactions containing ∼1 µm free Ca2+ and 1.5 µm recombinant calmodulin (in the absence of cytosol and MgATP) and stimulated for 6 min at 30 °C. The percentage of [3H]norepinephrine release achieved during S25C rescue or regular release, was calculated and the averages of the indicated number of independent experiments plotted versus time using DeltaGraph® 4.0.5 software. The curves were fitted with exponential curves given by y = a * (1 −e −bx) + c(r 2 is typically 0.99–0.999). The initial rate of release (initial slope of each time course curve),V 0, is the product of a andb. For the toxin-treated cells, theV 0 value in the absence of S25C (0 µm) represents the background leakage and so was subtracted from the V 0 values of the appropriate S25C curves. PC12 cells were labeled with [3H]norepinephrine as described previously (22Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), then washed three times in MBB (124 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 6 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). All cells, except for those stimulated with 5 mm Ca2+ and ionomycin, were treated with 50 µm EGTA-AM (a membrane-permeable methyl ester of EGTA) for 20 min at 37 °C to allow chelation of cytosolic Ca2+to ensure there was no free Ca2+ in the cells. Release was initiated by incubation at 30 °C for various amounts of time by either adding 5 mm calcium and 1 µg/ml ionomycin (in the absence of EGTA) or sucrose to the cells in MBB + 2 mmMgATP and terminated by chilling on ice. [3H]Norepinephrine release was quantitated as for the cracked cells (above). S25C (amino acids 142–206 of mouse SNAP-25) wild-type and mutant proteins, S25N (amino acids 1–82 of mouse SNAP-25), rat syntaxin 1a H3 domain (amino acids 191–266), and rat VAMP2 coil domain (amino acids 25–94) were expressed in bacteria with an NH2-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag that was removed by thrombin cleavage after purification on glutathione-agarose beads, as described previously (32Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (>95% pure), and the protein concentration was assayed using the BCA kit (Pierce). Proteins used in the cracked cell assay were all dialyzed into KGlu buffer and, if necessary, concentrated on the day of the experiment to prevent precipitation over time, and no aggregation was observed. S25C mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. CD analysis of fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration-purified S25N/S25C/VAMP2/Syntaxin 1a H3 complexes was performed as described previously (9Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). His-tagged botulinum neurotoxin E light chain was expressed in bacteria and purified on Ni2+ beads, according to procedures optimized by Heiner Niemann, and dialyzed into KGlu buffer for use in the cracked cell assay. The toxin concentration was estimated by SDS-PAGE, using BSA as a standard.

Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M. Davis T.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 949-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), were restriction-digested to generate a unique 367-base pair HincII/HindIII fragment that then replaced the equivalent wild-type fragment of calmodulin in the pCR2 vector (a pET23d-based construct from Novagen; Ref. 33Persechini A. Blumenthal D.K. Jarrett H.W. Klee C.B. Hardy D.O. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8052-8058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression constructs thus obtained were confirmed by sequencing. Mutant and wild-type vertebrate calmodulins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells using the pET system (Novagen). Bacteria were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA) and disrupted by French pressing, followed by DNase I (Sigma) treatment in 10 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C until no longer viscous. All further steps were performed at room temperature. The lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation, and EGTA was added to 1 mm prior to gravity loading onto a phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (10-ml column/liter of culture) equilibrated in PS I buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). After two passages through this column, CaCl2 to 10 mm was added to the flow-through, before loading onto a second phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (30-ml column/liter of culture) equilibrated in PS II buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2). The flow-through was passed through the column a second time, the column was washed with 10 volumes of PS II, and then calmodulin was eluted in 3 volumes of PS III buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm EGTA) with 3-ml fractions being collected. Fractions containing calmodulin were pooled and desalted on a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in KGlu buffer. The quadruple mutant calmodulin, CaM(D1,2,3,4A), was purified using a different protocol, as it does not bind phenyl-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The bacterial lysate was heated to 70 °C, chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was gradually brought to a final concentration of 1.5m (NH4)2SO4 at room temperature, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was brought to a saturating final concentration (∼5m) of (NH4)2SO4; the precipitate was pelleted, resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer. After clearing with a low speed spin, the dialysate was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl over 85 ml at 1 ml/min. CaM(D1,2,3,4A) eluted at ∼140 mm KCl, and fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in KGlu buffer. Protein concentrations of the calmodulins were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). In neurons, the application of 0.5 osmsucrose induces the fusion of docked synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and has been used as a tool to estimate the size of the readily releasable pool (8Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 34Lonart G. Janz R. Johnson K.M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the fusion of norepinephrine-containing dense core vesicles of PC12 cells can similarly be stimulated, we added various concentrations of sucrose to PC12 cells. As expected, sucrose did not stimulate fusion in cracked PC12 cells (data not shown), as the membrane needs to be intact to be affected by hypertonic stimuli. With intact PC12 cells, while 0.1 osm sucrose had little effect (data not shown), higher concentrations did elicit release (Fig.1, bars 8–16). At 1 osm sucrose, release was maximal (∼47%) within 1 min (bar 10), since longer incubation times (up to 5 min;bars 13 and 16) did not result in further secretion, while 0.5 osm sucrose resulted in slower, less extensive release (bars 8, 11, and14). By comparison, intact cells stimulated with the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin in the presence of high external [Ca2+] secreted slightly more slowly, perhaps due to delayed [Ca2+]i rise, but released slightly more over a 5-min time period, and by 10 min, over 60% of the total [3H]norepinephrine was secreted. In the absence of external Ca2+, ionomycin also elicited a small amount of release, likely due to release of Ca2+ from internal stores (bars 2–4). The fact that sucrose induced only slightly less norepinephrine release than ionomycin suggests that most of the dense core vesicles in intact PC12 cells are docked at the plasma membrane, constituting a readily releasable pool. In the cracked cells, the small percentage of the nondocked vesicle pool is likely to be further depleted due to cracking and washing, thus the exocytosis signal obtained in the cracked cell system should almost exclusively be from docked vesicles, as suggested previously (6Banerjee A.

Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is likely due to the removal of the cytosolic pool of norepinephrine that is not taken up into vesicles during loading (the results are expressed as a percentage of the total [3H]norepinephrine).Figure 4Several S25C surface mutations enhance rescue. A, typical dose response curves of botulinum neurotoxin E rescue by S25C bearing single mutations to alanine at the indicated positions. Cracked, toxin-treated PC12 cells were stimulated with cytosol, MgATP, and 1 µm Ca2+ in the presence of the indicated amounts of the mutant or wild-type S25C proteins, and [3H]norepinephrine release was quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With the exception of R176A, all the mutations resulted in enhanced rescue relative to wild-type S25C. The mean and S.E. of three independent experiments (after normalization for variations in background release) is shown.B, as in A except multiple surface mutations in S25C were analyzed. The double (D193A/D186A), triple (D193A/D186A/D179A), and quadruple mutants (D193A/D186A/D179A/D172A) formed from combinations of the single mutants shown in Aresulted in increased exocytosis compared with wild-type S25C (the highest rescuing single mutant from A, D179A, is shown again for comparison). The mean and S.E. of three to five independent experiments is plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In adrenal chromaffin cells, Ca2+ concentrations lower than those required to trigger fusion can assist cytoskeletal rearrangements and other upstream events in the maturation of vesicles into the readily releasable pool (5Neher E.

We therefore took advantage of the fact that exocytosis can be resolved into a MgATP-dependent, Ca2+-independent priming stage and a subsequent Ca2+-dependent (MgATP-independent) triggering of release (22Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to examine whether calcium is required at early, as well as late, steps in PC12 cell exocytosis. We investigated whether the rate of S25C-dependent rescue or regular norepinephrine release during triggering would increase if low concentrations of Ca2+ (<∼100 nm, i.e. less than the ∼1 µm normally added in triggering) were present during the priming step. Triggering was then initiated by addition of the remaining complement of Ca2+ (to ∼1 µmfinal) and S25C in the case of the toxin-treated cells, and the time course of release was followed. We were unable to resolve any differences in the initial rates of fusion following the different priming protocols (data not shown), suggesting that unlike in chromaffin cells, PC12 cell dense core vesicles have probably bypassed early Ca2+-dependent steps of maturation. We reported previously that S25C is required in the triggering but not in the priming step of rescue (9Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), leading us to conclude that Ca2+ triggers the final step of SNARE complex formation. This means that both Ca2+ and S25C are required to form fully zippered SNARE complexes and drive fusion. We wondered, however, whether S25C's presence in the priming reaction might affect the triggering reaction, for example its release kinetics, that we did not closely examine in the previous study. Thus, we conducted experiments to compare the time course of rescue after priming the cells with two different concentrations (one low and one high) of S25C in the absence of Ca2+ to that of cells primed with Ca2+ in the absence of S25C (Fig.2). The initial rate of release was calculated"

Science. 1981; 213: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) that release of extracellular proteases by the axonal growth cone may facilitate its movement by digesting cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts that block the path of the advancing growth cone. Over the past several years, it became evident that extracellular serine proteases, such as plasminogen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA),1urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (for review, see Ref. 4Seeds N.W.

They have been implicated in a variety of processes during neurogenesis, including cell migration, axon outgrowth, and synapse elimination (7Seeds N.W. Siconolfi L.B. Haffke S.P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Localization of plasmin activity to neuronal growth cones was initially demonstrated by digestion of a fibrin clot overlay (3Krystosek A. Seeds N.W. Science. 1981; 213: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that plasmin cleaves the ECM molecules: collagen, fibronectin (13McGuire P.G. Seeds N.W. Neuron. 1990; 4: 633-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and laminin (for review, see Ref. 4Seeds N.W. Friedman G. Hayden S. Thewke D. Haffke S. McGuire P. Krystosek A. Semin. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 405-412Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to cleaving ECM molecules directly, the extracellular serine proteases may act indirectly by releasing latent proteases and growth factors from the matrix. It was demonstrated that metalloproteases (14O'Grady R.L. Upfold L.I. Stephens R.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (15Mars W.M. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Am. J.

Pathol. 1993; 143: 949-958PubMed Google Scholar) are produced as matrix-attached latent proteins, subjected to cleavage and subsequently to activation by plasmin. F-spondin, a gene expressed in the floor plate, encodes a secreted, ECM-attached protein (19Klar A. Baldassare M. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It plays a dual role in patterning axonal trajectory in the spinal cord by promoting outgrowth of commissural axons (20Burstyn-Cohen T. Tzarfaty V. Frumkin A. Feinstein Y. Stoeckli E. Klar A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and inhibiting outgrowth of motor axons (21Tzarfati-Majar V. Burstyn-Cohen T. Klar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4722-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). F-spondin protein is processed in vivo to yield an amino half protein, which contains regions of homology to reelin and mindin, and a carboxyl half protein, which contains either six or four thrombospondin type I repeats (TSRs) (20Burstyn-Cohen T.

Klar A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8875-8885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F-spondin expression in the nervous system overlaps with expression of several serine proteases. In the floor plate, F-spondin is expressed together with tPA and uPA (19Klar A. Baldassare M. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 22Burstyn-Cohen T. Frumkin A. Xu Y.T. Scherer S.S. Klar A. J.

Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J. Development. 1992; 116: 625-637PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the hippocampus, F-spondin is coexpressed with tPA and neurotrypsin (6Gschwend T.P. Krueger S.R. Kozlov S.V. Wolfer D.P. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Feinstein Y. Borrell V. Garcia C. Burstyn-Cohen T. Tzarfaty V. Frumkin A. Nose A. Okamoto H. Higashijima S. Soriano A. Klar A. Development. 1999; 126: 3637-3648PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several tPA-expressing neurons extend axons toward or through an F-spondin-rich milieu. Embryonic motor neurons are exposed to the floor plate-derived F-spondin (21Tzarfati-Majar V. Burstyn-Cohen T. Klar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4722-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As motor axons emerge from the spinal cord and up-regulate the expression of tPA (26Carroll P.M. Tsirka S.E. Richards W.G. Frohman M.A. Strickland S. Development. 1994; 120: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they encounter the somite-derived F-spondin (27Debby-Brafman A. Burstyn-Cohen T. Klar A. Kalcheim C. Neuron. 1998; 22: 475-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar); subsequently, at the peripheral nerve, they are ensheathed by Schwann cell-expressing F-spondin (22Burstyn-Cohen T. Frumkin A. Xu Y.T. Scherer S.S. Klar A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8875-8885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, embryonic sensory neurons and sympathetic ganglia neurons expressing tPA are also surrounded by F-spondin-expressing cells in the ganglia and along their axonal path (22Burstyn-Cohen T. Frumkin A. Xu Y.T. Scherer S.S. Klar A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8875-8885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Carroll P.M. Tsirka S.E. Richards W.G. Frohman M.A. Strickland S.

Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In the current study we provide evidence demonstrating that F-spondin is a substrate for plasmin. Plasmin cleaves F-spondin at two sites, the first located between the fifth and sixth TSRs and the second at the fifth TSR. The cleavage sites are located between the extracellular matrix binding TSRs (repeats 5 and 6) and the nonbinding repeats (repeats 1–4). In accordance, treatment of F-spondin with plasmin yields a diffusible, ECM-free, TSR domain protein containing TSRs 1–4. DNA plasmids were constructed by PCR as indicated in Table I. Forward and backward primers were used for PCR using a “template plasmid.” The PCR products were subcloned into a suitable plasmid (cloning vector) into the restriction sites indicated in the table. The mutant plasmids PL1m, PL2m, and DM were generated as follows. Two PCRs were set up with two sets of primers (the upper and lower row of primers in the table). The PCR products of the two reactions were combined, and an additional PCR was performed with the forward primer of the upper row and the backward primer of the lower row. The PCR products were digested and subcloned as indicated in the table.Table IConstruction of DNA plasmids used in this paperNameTemplate plasmidForward primerBackward primerCloning vectorCloning sitesTS5aF-spondinGCAAGCTTGCGCTCGCTTTCTCGGATGCGTCTAGAGAACTGCTCTCCAT CTGPSecTagBHindIII-XbaITS0F-spondinGCAAGCTTGCGCTCGCTTTCTCGGATGGAGAGATCTAGGGGTGTCATCT TCATCPSecTagBHindIII-XbaITS1F-spondinGCAAGCTTGCGCTCGCTTTCTCGGATGCGTCTAGAGCCATCTTCATCGC TGCAGPSecTagBHindIII-XbaITS2F-spondinGCAAGCTTGCGCTCGCTTTCTCGGATGCGTCTAGAAGGAGAGCACTCCT CGTTGPSecTagBHindIII-XbaITS3F-spondinGCAAGCTTGCGCTCGCTTTCTCGGATGCGTCTAGAGGTATGGCACTCAG GCATCPSecTagBHindIII-XbaITS4F-spondinGCAAGCTTGCGCTCGCTTTCTCGGATGCGTCTAGAGGGGCACTCTGGCA GCATACPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR1–6F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCAGATCTAGACCCCTACTAACAA GGGTGCAPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR2–6F-spondinGAGAGATCTACCTGTACCATGTCGGACTGAGATCTAGACCCCTACTAACAA GGGTGCAPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR1–5 + 5F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGACTGGATCGATGGGC TGCGPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR1–5 + 10F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGACCTCCAGCGCAGCT TCTGPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR1–5 + 15F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGAGCTCTCTCGGGCCT CCCTPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR1–5 + 20F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGACTGCTCACTCCTCC TGCTPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR4 + 5F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGAGAGTTCGCAGTCAA TGGGPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR4 + 20F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGATTTCCCACAGGACT TGTTPSecTagBBamHI-XbaITSR4 + 30F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTAGACTTCAGCATGCGTT GCCGPSecTagBBamHI-XbaIPL1mF-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCGCTCTCTCGGGCCTCACTCCAT GGCAGCTTCTGGATCGAPSecTagBXbaI-SacIITCGATCCAGAAGCTGCCATGGAGTGAGGC CCGAGAGAGCCGTCTAGAGAACTGCTCTCCAT CTGPL2mF-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCTCGAATCATGTGACCTTCCCCA CAGGATCCGTTACATTCAG ACCAPSecTagBXbaI-SacIITGGTCTGAATGTAACGGATCCTGTGGGGA AGGTCACATGATTCGACGTCTAGAGAACTGCTCTCCAT CTGDMPL1mGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCTCGAATCATGTGACCTTCCCCA CAGGATCCGTTACATTCAG ACCAPSecTagBXbaI-SacIITGGTCTGAATGTAACGGATCCTGTGGGGA AGGTCACATGATTCGACGTCTAGAGAACTGCTCTCCAT CTGAP-TSR1TS1GAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCCGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR1–2TS2GAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCCGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR1–4TS4GAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCCGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR1–5TS5GAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCCGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR1–6F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGCATCTACTCCAACTGGTCAGATCTAGACCCCTACTAACAA GGGTGCApcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR5TS5GAGAGATCTATTGACTGCGAACTCAGTGACGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR6TS2–6GAGAGATCTCCAGGCTGTCGGATGCGCCCCGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIAP-TSR5–6TS2–6GAGAGATCTATTGACTGCGAACTCAGTGACGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIGST-TSR4TS4GCGGATCCATCCCGTGCTTGCTGTCTCGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpGST-2TKBamHI-XbaIGST-TSR5TS5GAGAGATCTATTGACTGCGAACTCAGTGACGGCTAGCTAGAAGGCACAGTC GAGGpGST-2TKBglII-XbaIAP-TSR4 & 5GST-TSR4GAGAGATCATCCCGTGCTTGCTGTCTCGCGTTGCACAGTCTCTGGGCAG TCCCCCAGCTCTGCCAGpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIGST-TSR5CTGGCAGAGCTGGGGGACTGCCCAGAGAC TGTGCAACGCGCGCTAGCCAAATAGGGGTTCC GCGCAP-TSR5 & 4GST-TSR4CAGTTTGGAGGTGCACCCTGTAATGAGGA TCTGGAGCAGGCGCTAGCCAAATAGGGGTTCC GCGCpcDNA3-APBglII-XbaIGST-TSR5GAGAGATCTATTGACTGCGAACTCAGTGACTGCTCCAGATCCTCATTACAG GGTGCACCTCCAAACTGTSR2–6F-spondinGAGAGATCTCTCCACCTGTACCATGTCGAGATCTAGACCCCTACTAACAA GGGTGCApSec4xmycBglII-XbaIpSec4x4F-spondinGAGAGATCTTGAAACCTGCATCTACTCCCGTCTAGAGGGGCACTCTGGCA GCATACApSec4xmycBglII-XbaITSR1–6Δ5F-spondinGCTCTAGAAGCCCATCGATCCAGAAGAGATCTAGACCCCTACTAACAA GGGTGCApSec4x4Xba-XbaDNA constructs were generated by PCR using template plasmids, forward and backward primers, and cloning vectors as indicated in the table.

HEK293 T cells were transfected with the various plasmids using the liposome-mediated transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche, Manheim, Germany), and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Conditioned medium was collected after 2–4 days and treated with the appropriate reagents at 37 °C for 1 h. For plasmin cleavage assays, conditioned medium was treated with plasmin (Chromogenix, Sweden) at the indicated concentrations and the chromogenic substrate specific for plasmin, S-2251 (Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide, Chromogenix) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 100 µl, in microtiter plates for 1 h at 37 °C. Plasmin activity was measured by monitoring the increase of absorbance at 405 nm, using a Thermomax thermostat plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). In other cases, plasmin was generated from its zymogen Glu-plasminogen, 10 µg/ml (Chromogenix), and activated by 100 pm recombinant single chain tPA (Actylase, Roche, Manheim) using 20 µg/ml fibrin (Chromogenix) as a cofactor. In some cases, an inhibitor to serine proteases, such as aprotinin (Sigma), was used at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml, or an inhibitor to metalloproteinases such as EGTA (Merck) at a final concentration of 20 mm was added to the reaction mixture. Bovine corneal endothelial cells (second to fifth passages) were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured as described above, except that 4% Dextran T-40 was included in the growth medium. Na235SO4 (25 µCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added on days 2 and 5 after seeding, and the cultures were incubated with the label without medium change. On day 12, the subendothelial ECM was exposed by dissolving the cell layer with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mm NH4OH followed by four washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The ECM remained intact, free of cellular debris and firmly attached to the entire area of the tissue culture dish. Nearly 80% of the ECM radioactivity was incorporated into heparin sulfate proteoglycans. ECM plates were prepared as described above. Conditioned medium of transfected HEK293 Τ cells was incubated on the ECM for 90 min at room temperature. The plates were washed for 5 min three times with HABA (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% NaN3, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0), 5 min twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 min with AP buffer (29Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bound alkaline phosphatase was detected by incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate for 2 h at room temperature. TSR2–6 conditioned medium was treated with 50 µg/ml plasmin for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 µg/ml aprotinin, then incubated in 96-wells plates covered with ECM, for 90 min. Wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated with 9E10 mAb overnight at 40c, followed by incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Proteins bound to the ECM were detected using the colorimetric reagent 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Chemicon). To test whether F-spondin is cleaved by tPA, we incubated conditioned medium of carboxyl-terminal Myc-tagged F-spondin (Fig.1A) together with elements of the tPA proteolysis complex. Incubation of F-spondin with plasmin (the tPA-activated plasminogen) (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) or with all of the proteolysis components: plasminogen, fibrin, and tPA (Fig. 1 B, lane 8), caused elimination of the 110-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Incubation with the isolated components: Fb (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), tPA (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), tPA and plasminogen (Fig. 1 B, lane 7), and tPA and fibrin (Fig. 1 B, lane 9), did not result in cleavage of F-spondin. On the other hand, a combination of plasminogen and fibrin was active in the processing (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). This activity is probably mediated by the tPA that is produced by HEK293 Τ cells (30Arrick B.A. Lopez A.R. Elfman F. Ebner R. Damsky C.H. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Kawakubo Y. Matsushita T. Funatsu K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 41: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the cleavage, the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and the metalloproteinase inhibitor EGTA were added. Addition of aprotinin abolished the plasmin-mediated cleavage of F-spondin (Fig.1 C, lanes 3 and 9), whereas addition of EGTA (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and 10) did not inhibit the degradation of F-spondin (compare with the non-inhibited plasmin-treated samples (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 8)). Thus, F-spondin is cleaved specifically by plasmin at its carboxyl terminus. To map the plasmin cleavage sites we generated nested deletion constructs. F-spondin expression constructs containing the reelin/spondin domain and the reelin/spondin plus nested TSRs (Fig.2A) were transfected into HEK293 Τ cells. The conditioned medium was subjected to plasmin proteolysis, and the protein products were analyzed by the anti-reelin domain antibody R8. Except for TSR5a, the size of all the plasmin-treated proteins was unchanged. TS5a protein, however, was reduced, and thus the treated protein migrated faster than its untreated counterpart. This suggests that the cleavage site is carboxyl to the fourth TSR. To visualize the two protein cleavage products, an anti-TSR domain antibody (R2) was used. Proteins containing TSRs 1–6 and TSRs 2–6 (Fig. 2 B) were subjected to plasmin treatment. The 55-kDa TSR1–6 protein yielded a 40-kDa protein and a 16-kDa protein. The 46-kDa TSR2–6 protein yielded a 28-kDa and a 16-kDa protein (Fig.2 B) The 16-kDa proteolytic protein migrated to the same extent in both proteins, suggesting that the cleavage site in these proteins is identical. It is difficult to ascertain the precise cleavage site by the molecular masses of the plasmin proteolytic fragments because an N-linked glycosylation site is present at amino acids 681–683, within the fifth TSR. To pinpoint the plasmin cleavage site, nested deletions of 5 amino acids each, covering the 30-amino acid region that interspaced repeats 5 and 6, were generated. All of the proteins were equipped with the Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus. The proteins were subjected to plasmin digestion and analyzed with anti-Myc mAb, to visualize the cleaved product, and anti-TSR antibody to detect the unprocessed and processed protein. TSR1–5+5 was resistant to 10 µg/ml plasmin, whereas TSR1–5+10, TSR1–5+15, and TSR1–5+20 were sensitive to plasmin (Fig. 3,A and B). Thus, a sensitive site (designated PL1) to plasmin is located carboxyl to the fifth TSR. It is plausible that another site is located amino to the PL1 site, within the fifth TSR. To test this hypothesis we incubated the TSR1–5+5 and TSR1–5+20 with increasing concentrations of plasmin. TSR1–5+20 was cleaved at 10 µg/ml, and TSR1–5+5 was fully cleaved at 50 µg/ml plasmin (Fig.3 C). The size products of the fully cleaved proteins were identical. Hence, it appears that a second site (PL2) is located amino to PL1. In the absence of PL1, the PL2 site is less sensitive to plasmin. We assume that an intermediate protein product appears with the TSR1–5+20 protein. Presumably, at 10 µg/ml plasmin, only the PL1 and not the PL2 site is digested. The fact that no intermediate size protein is detected suggests that the PL2 site renders high sensitivity after the PL1 site is cleaved. Plasmin cleaves after arginine or lysine. Two arginines are located at amino acids 730 and 732, between TSR1–5+5 and TSR1–5+10. Thus, these two arginines are potential cleavage sites for plasmin. The two arginines were mutated to proline and serine (Fig.4A). The mutated protein, designated PL1m, was analyzed with 9E10 and R2 antibodies (Fig. 4,A and B). The mutated protein was resistant to low concentrations of plasmin (Fig. 4 B). At higher concentrations, 50 µg/ml, a cleaved product was apparent (Fig. 4,C and D). The size of the cleaved product was identical to the size of the cleaved control protein TSR1–5a. Thus, mutating the arginines at positions 730–732 created a PL1-resistant protein. To locate the PL2 site, a similar approach was taken. Nested deletion proteins, of 5-amino acid intervals, in the fifth TSR, between TSR4+5 and TSR4+30 were generated. TSR4+5 (Fig.5A) TSR4+10 and TSR4+15 (data not shown) were resistant to plasmin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 µg/ml, as assessd by the anti-TSR antibody R2, and the anticarboxyl end 9E10. TSR1–4+30 (Fig. 5 B) and TSR1–4+20 (Fig. 5 C) were partially cleaved by 10 µg/ml and fully cleaved by 50–100 µg/ml. Thus, the PL2 site is located between TS4+15 and TS4+20. There are two lysines between the TSR1–4+15 and TSR1–4+20 at positions 682 and 686. The lysines were mutated to glycine and glutamic acid to generate PL2m (Fig.6A). A double mutant, DM, containing the PL1m and PL2m was also constructed. Analysis of the sensitivity of the proteins to plasmin with the 9E10 antibody, revealed that the carboxyl end of the wild type, TSR1–5a protein and the mutant PL2m protein were cleaved at low concentrations of plasmin. The PL1m and the DM were both resistant to low plasmin, with the DM protein being more resistant to higher concentrations of plasmin than PL1m (Fig. 6 B). The high sensitivity of PL2m, as judged by the elimination of the carboxyl end, is caused by the presence of a PL1-sensitive site in this protein. Analysis of the cleaved product with the R2 antibody revealed that there is a hierarchy in the appearance of the cleaved protein. The wild type protein is the most sensitive, followed by the PL2m, PL1m with the DM being the most resistant protein (Fig. 6, C and D). The super-resistance of the DM demonstrates that mutating the lysines at positions 682 and 686 reduced the plasmin sensitivity of F-spondin. Nevertheless, the DM protein is not completely resistant. There are two arginines at positions 693 and 695 (Fig. 6 A). Mutating those two sites did not change the plasmin sensitivity of F-spondin (data not shown). It is conceivable that mutating the 682 and 686 sites changed the conformation of the protein and exposed arginines 693 and 695 to plasmin.Figure 6A second plasmin cleavage site is located at lysines 682 and 686. Panel A, sequence of 40 amino acids of the fifth TSR. The lysines at position 682 and 686 (upper line, bold letters) were mutated to glycine and glutamic acid (second line, bold lowercaseletters).

PL2m and DM were constructed in the backbone of TSR1–5a; hence, they have the Myc epitope at the carboxyl end.Panel B, analysis of plasmin (Plm) digestion using the 9E10 antibody.

To examine whether the processing of F-spondin by plasmin modulates its interaction with the ECM, we tested the binding properties of the TSRs. Fusion proteins containing an alkaline phosphatase (AP) fused to various combinations of TSRs were generated (Fig.7A). The conditioned media of HEK293 Τ transfected cells were incubated with tissue culture plates coated with bovine corneal endothelial cell ECM. The amount of bound protein was measured by an AP colorimetric reaction. All of the fusion proteins that contained TSR 5 or 6 or both (AP-TSR1–6, AP-TSR1–5, AP-TSR5, AP-TSR6, and AP-TSR5–6) bound to the ECM (Fig.7 B). Proteins restricted to repeats 1–4 (AP-TSR1, AP-TSR1–2, AP-TSR1–4) did not bind to the ECM (Fig. 7 B). The fifth TSR is more adhesive than the sixth. The binding levels of AP-TSR1–5 and AP-TSR1–6 are lower than the isolated fifth and sixth TSRs. This suggests that repeats 1–4 might reduce the affinity of repeats 5 and 6 in the context of the nonprocessed protein. Nevertheless, even binding the entire TSR domain is significantly gre"

We investigated here the mechanisms of this inhibition. We used as experimental models wild-type mast cells, which constitutively express the stem cell factor receptor Kit and FcγRIIB, FcγRIIB-deficient mast cells reconstituted with wild-type or mutated FcγRIIB, and Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1)-deficient mast cells. We found that, upon coaggregation with Kit, FcγRIIB are tyrosyl-phosphorylated, recruit SHIP1, but not SHIP2, SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 or -2, abrogate Akt phosphorylation, shorten the duration of the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases of the Ras and Rac pathways, abrogate cyclin induction, prevent cells from entering the cell cycle, and block thymidine incorporation. FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of Kit-dependent cell proliferation was reduced in SHIP1-deficient mast cells, whereas inhibition of IgE-induced responses was abrogated. Cell proliferation was, however, inhibited by coaggregating Kit with FcγRIIB whose intracytoplasmic domain was replaced with the catalytic domain of SHIP1. These results demonstrate that FcγRIIB use SHIP1 to inhibit pathways shared by receptor tyrosine kinases and immunoreceptors to trigger cell proliferation and cell activation, respectively, but that, in the absence of SHIP1, FcγRIIB can use other effectors that specifically inhibit cell proliferation.

FcγRIIB isoforms are differentially expressed by lymphoid and myeloid cells; mouse B cells express FcγRIIB1 and -B1′ (2Latour S. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J.

When coaggregated on the same cell with receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs),1 murine and human FcγRIIB were shown to negatively regulate cell activation.

Invest. 1995; 95: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Long ago, B cell FcγR, which were later identified as FcγRIIB (9Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Choquet D. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were also shown to inhibit BCR-mediated B cell proliferation (6Phillips N.E. Parker D.C. J.

Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). Kit is a typical receptor tyrosine kinase for stem cell factor (SCF) that belongs to the colony-stimulating factor-1/platelet-derived growth factor receptor subfamily (11Qiu F. Ray P. Brown K. Baker P.E. Jhanwar S. Ruddle F.H. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and controls cell proliferation during gametogenesis, melanogenesis, and hematopoiesis (12Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. Reith A.D. Forrester L. Bernstein A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present work aimed at elucidating the mechanism(s) by which FcγRIIB could inhibit cell proliferation.Works published during the last 5 years documented the molecular mechanisms used by murine FcγRIIB to negatively regulate cell activation triggered by ITAM-bearing receptors. The inhibitory properties of FcγRIIB were found to depend on an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) present in the intracytoplasmic (IC) domain of all murine and human isoforms of FcγRIIB (3Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,13Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The coaggregation of FcγRIIB with activating receptors enables the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn to phosphorylate not only ITAMs but also the FcγRIIB ITIM (14Malbec O. Fong D. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J., C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosyl-phosphorylated ITIM recruits the SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphate 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) (15Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 16Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which inhibits two major signaling pathways triggered by ITAM-bearing receptors, the Ca2+ response and the Ras pathway. The preferred substrate of SHIP1 is indeed phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), generated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (17Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). PI(3,4,5)P3 mediates the membrane translocation of a subset of molecules containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Among these molecules is the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (18Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which is mandatory for phospholipase C-γ (19Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to be activated and to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, leading to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. SHIP1 was recently found to inhibit the activation of Erk1/2, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases of the Ras pathway, independently of its phosphatase activity. When recruited by FcγRIIB, SHIP1 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated and serves as an adapter protein. It recruits p62dok, which is in turn tyrosyl-phosphorylated and recruits RasGAP. RasGAP activates the autocatalytic GTPase activity of ras, thereby preventing the activation of the ras pathway. SHIP1 therefore appears as the major effector of FcγRIIB-dependent negative regulation of cell activation by acting at different steps of signal transduction via phosphatase activity-dependent and -independent mechanisms. As a consequence, the activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes that promote the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activation NF-AT is prevented, as well as MAP kinase-dependent downstream events. MAP kinase substrates are transcription factors that cooperate with NF-AT to induce the transcription of cytokine genes (20Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 21Jiang A. Craxton A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By recruiting SHIP1, FcγRIIB therefore arrest the intracellular propagation of activation signals triggered by ITAM-bearing receptors and subsequent cellular responses. These include exocytosis, in mast cells (3Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Daëron M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and cytokine secretion, in mast cells (8Daëron M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), B cells (7Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J. Choquet D. Hunziker W. Guillet J.G. Webster P. Sautès C. Mellman I. Fridman W.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and T cells (3Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Mechanisms used by FcγRIIB to inhibit cell proliferation are poorly understood. They are difficult to examine in B cells. Indeed, B cell activation and proliferation can both be triggered by the BCR, which is constitutively associated with several coreceptors whose respective roles in B cell activation and proliferation are not well known. Another reason is that most biochemical studies that unraveled the inhibitory mechanisms used by FcγRIIB were conducted in transformed cell lines whose proliferation became independent of the regulatory mechanisms that control the growth of normal cells. By contrast with B cells, the activation and proliferation of mast cells can be triggered independently by FcεRI and by Kit, respectively (22Ogawa M. Matsuzaki Y. Nishikawa S. Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Sudo T. Kina T. Nakauchi H. Nishikawa S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Evidence that FcγRIIB can negatively regulate the proliferation of Kit-induced mast cell proliferation originated from our observation that anti-Kit antibodies could induce the proliferation of primary mast cells derivedin vitro from mouse bone marrow (BMMCs) provided that their Fc portions could not bind to FcγRIIB that are constitutively expressed by these cells. Comparable proliferative responses were induced by F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Kit antibodies in wt mast cells, by intact anti-Kit antibodies in FcγRIIB−/−mast cells, or by intact anti-Kit antibodies in wt mast cells whose FcγRIIB were blocked with anti-FcγRIIB antibodies. No proliferation was observed if anti-Kit antibodies were allowed to coaggregate Kit with FcγRIIB on wt mast cells (10Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). FcγRIIB therefore inhibit mouse mast cell proliferation when coaggregated with Kit, and BMMCs provide an appropriate model to study the effects of FcγRIIB on signal transduction pathways leading to cell proliferation.When dimerized by SCF, Kit autophosphorylates and recruits several kinases including PI3K. By generating PI(3,4,5)P3, PI3K enables the membrane translocation of the protein kinase Akt and the exchange factor Vav via their PH domain. These molecules, altogether, prevent cell death and activate the Rac pathway whose terminal effectors are the MAP kinases p38 and JNK (23Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Kit also recruits Shc, which, when phosphorylated, recruits the adapter protein Grb2. Grb2 recruits the exchange factor Sos, which activates the Ras pathway, whose terminal effectors are the MAP kinases Erk1/2 (24Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Powson T. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Rac and Ras MAP kinases shuttle into the nucleus, and they cooperate to activate transcription factors that control the expression of cyclin genes (25Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cyclins are the positive regulatory subunits of a class of protein kinases collectively called cyclin-dependent kinases. These phosphorylate proteins of the retinoblastoma family, leading to the release of the transcription factors E2F, which control the coordinated expression of proteins required for the stepwise progression through the cell cycle (26Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that, when coaggregated with Kit, FcγRIIB selectively recruit SHIP1, inhibit the Ras and the Rac pathways, and prevent cells from entering into the cell cycle by blocking the transcription of cyclin genes. The inhibitory effects of FcγRIIB were partially suppressed in SHIP1−/− mast cells and could be mimicked by FcγRIIB, whose IC domain was replaced with the catalytic domain of SHIP1.DISCUSSIONThe present work aimed at investigating the mechanism by which FcγRIIB negatively regulate cell proliferation. We used, as an experimental model, Kit-dependent mast cell proliferation that we previously found to be negatively regulated by FcγRIIB (10Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that SHIP1 is selectively recruited by tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB and plays a critical but not exclusive role in inhibiting transduction pathways that lead to the transcription of cyclin genes and the progression of cells through the cell cycle.We observed previously a dual effect of IgG anti-Kit antibodies, they can activate cell proliferation by aggregating Kit via their Fab portions, and they can inhibit cell proliferation by coaggregating Kit with FcγRIIB via their Fab and Fc portions (10Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used anti-Kit antibodies to analyze the mechanism of FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of Kit-induced proliferation. Beforehand, we checked that anti-Kit antibodies triggered the same intracellular signals as SCF. When dimerized by SCF, Kit is probably under an optimal spatial configuration on the cell membrane but possibly not when aggregated by anti-Kit antibodies. We found no qualitative difference between signals examined upon stimulation of BMMCs with SCF and with anti-Kit antibodies, but we did find quantitative differences. Antibodies were indeed less efficient than SCF, and apparently, late signals were more attenuated than early signals following stimulation with antibodies. Whatever the reason of these differences, these preliminary results validated the use of anti-Kit antibodies for studying FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of signals generated by Kit and leading to mast cell proliferation.Inhibition of thymidine incorporation correlated with the tyrosyl phosphorylation of FcγRIIB induced upon coaggregation with Kit. Inhibition observed in FcγRIIB−/− BMMCs reconstituted with wt FcγRIIB1 was not seen in FcγRIIB−/− BMMCs reconstituted with an IC domain-deleted FcγRIIB. Inhibition is therefore not a consequence of steric hindrance between extracellular domains and ligands but requires the IC domain of FcγRIIB. Four tyrosines are contained in this domain, one being within the ITIM (3Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,13Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), which when tyrosyl-phosphorylated, has been shown to mediate the recruitment of SHIP1 in mast cells and B cells (3Daëron M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6327-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), following coaggregation of FcγRIIB with ITAM-bearing receptors. When coaggregated with Kit, tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB was found to recruit SHIP1, but not SHIP2, SHP-1, or SHP-2, as assessed by coprecipitation. Early events associated with FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of Kit-induced mast cell proliferation therefore resemble early events associated with FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of FcεRI-induced mast cell activation (15Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 16Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Akt phosphorylation induced by Kit aggregation was inhibited following coaggregation of Kit with FcγRIIB. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was not observed when Kit was coaggregated with an IC domain-deleted FcγRIIB, suggesting that this inhibition is a consequence of the recruitment of SHIP1 by tyrosyl-phosphorylated IC sequences of FcγRIIB. Indeed, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation did not occur in SHIP1−/− cells. Interestingly, both SCF-induced and anti-Kit-induced Akt phosphorylation were more intense, particularly at later time points, in SHIP1−/− BMMCs than in SHIP1+/+ BMMCs, and FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation seen in SHIP1+/+ cells was more pronounced at the same late time points. When activated, Kit recruits and activates PI3K (23Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which generates PI(3,4,5)P3, enabling the membrane translocation of proteins bearing a PH domain including Akt. Akt phosphorylation, which requires the membrane recruitment of Akt, is a reflection of PI3K activation, and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation is a likely reflection of the catalytic activity of SHIP1, whose preferred substrate is PI(3,4,5)P3. Similar observations were made in B cells following coaggregation of FcγRIIB with BCR (45Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 46Carver D.J. Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, the terminal effector MAP kinases of the Rac pathway, was inhibited following coaggregation of Kit with FcγRIIB. This inhibition is also likely due to the recruitment of SHIP1 and the subsequent degradation of PI(3,4,5)P3, which mediates the membrane recruitment of Vav.Erk1/2 phosphorylation observed following Kit aggregation was of a shorter duration following the coaggregation of Kit with FcγRIIB. This effect was not observed when Kit was coaggregated with an IC domain-deleted FcγRIIB. Inhibition of Erk phosphorylation is also a likely consequence of the recruitment of SHIP1 by tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB, because it was prevented in SHIP1−/− BMMCs. Like Akt phosphorylation, both SCF-induced and anti-Kit-induced Erk phosphorylation lasted longer in SHIP1−/− BMMCs than in SHIP1+/+ BMMCs, and FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of Erk phosphorylation seen in SHIP1+/+ cells was more pronounced at late time points. Several mechanisms were proposed to explain how SHIP1 could inhibit immunoreceptor-induced Erk activation. One leads to a decreased production of molecules that activate Ras. Thus, by preventing the Bruton's tyrosine kinase-dependent full activation of phospholipase C-γ, SHIP1 may decrease the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, which activates Ras. Another mechanism consists in the sequestration of molecules that are necessary for the activation of Ras. SHIP1 was indeed reported to compete with Gbr2 for binding Shc, thereby preventing the constitution of the complex of adapters that connect immunoreceptors to the Ras pathway (47Tridandapani S. Chacko G.W. Van Brocklyn J.R. Coggeshall L.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1125-1132PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, SHIP1 has recently been shown to inhibit Erk activation by functioning as an adapter molecule. When recruited by FcγRIIB in B cells, SHIP1 is indeed a substrate of Lyn, and when tyrosyl phosphorylated, it recruits Dok via its phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Dok is itself phosphorylated by Lyn and recruits RasGAP via its SH2 domain. RasGAP antagonizes with Sos by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP into GDP on Ras (48Tamir I. Stolpa J.C. Helgason C.D. Nakamura K. Bruhns P. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Kit also recruits adapter proteins that, via the exchange factor Sos, activate the Ras pathway, whose ultimate effectors are the MAP kinases Erk1/2 (24Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Powson T. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Whether one or several of these nonexclusive mechanisms account(s) for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of Kit-dependent activation of Erk1/2 remains to be investigated.The induction of cyclins D2, D3 (we found no cyclin D1 in BMMCs), and A observed following Kit aggregation was inhibited when Kit was coaggregated with FcγRIIB. This effect was not observed in FcγRIIB−/− BMMCs. This inhibition likely results from the inhibition of MAP kinase activation. MAP kinases were indeed shown to control the transcription of cyclin genes (25Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cyclin D3 induction was, however, reduced but not suppressed in SHIP1−/− BMMCs, although inhibition of MAP kinase activation was abolished. This result suggests that, among the mechanisms that control cyclin D3 expression and that are inhibited by FcγRIIB, one can distinguish mechanisms whose inhibition by FcγRIIB is SHIP1-dependent and mechanisms whose inhibition by FcγRIIB is SHIP1-independent.As a consequence of the inhibition of cyclin induction, the increased proportion of cells entering the S phase observed following Kit aggregation was not seen following the coaggregation of Kit with FcγRIIB. This correlates with inhibition of thymidine incorporation. Expectedly, FcγRIIB-induced inhibition of thymidine incorporation was reduced in SHIP1−/− BMMCs, but unexpectedly, it was not abolished. This partial inhibition is consistent with the partial inhibition of cyclin D3 induction in the absence of SHIP1. In contrast, FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of FcεRI-dependent serotonin release and TNFα secretion was abrogated in SHIP1−/− BMMCs. Incidentally, this is the first demonstration of the mandatory role of SHIP1 in FcγRIIB-mediated negative regulation of IgE-dependent mast cell activation. The differential effect of SHIP1 deletion on inhibition of FcεRI-induced mast cell activation and of Kit-induced mast cell proliferation suggests that FcγRIIB utilize SHIP1 to inhibit pathways shared by FcεRI and Kit such as GTP-binding protein-dependent MAP kinase activation but that FcγRIIB can also inhibit Kit-specific pathways in the absence of SHIP1. SHIP1 has been reported to prevent cell death by acting as an antiapoptotic factor in B cells (41Pearse R.N. Kawabe T. Bolland S. Guinamard R. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1999; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The residual inhibition of thymidine incorporation seen in SHIP1−/− BMMCs, however, could not be explained by a decreased cell viability. Residual inhibition could be accounted for by mechanisms that complement SHIP1-dependent mechanisms in wt cells or by mechanisms that compensate SHIP1-dependent mechanisms in the absence of SHIP1 but are not operating in wt cells. Whatever they are, SHIP1-independent mechanisms are not sufficient to abolish cell proliferation, because inhibition of proliferation was only reduced in SHIP1−/− cells. To determine whether SHIP1-dependent mechanisms may suffice to abolish cell proliferation, we constructed a chimeric molecule, the IC domain of which was constituted by the catalytic domain of SHIP1. This chimera inhibited thymidine incorporation as efficiently as FcγRIIB1, when coaggregated with Kit. This result indicates that the enzymatic activity of SHIP1 is sufficient for inhibiting Kit-dependent mast cell proliferation.In conclusion, we used here anti-Kit antibodies as analytical tools to study the mechanism of FcγRIIB-dependent negative regulation of cell proliferation. We found that this regulation depends primarily on the recruitment of SHIP1 by tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB when these receptors are coaggregated with Kit by anti-Kit antibodies. Under these conditions, SHIP1 was found to extinguish Kit-induced signals depending on the recruitment of molecules that have a PH domain to the membrane and downstream signals, as well as the activation of the Ras pathway. Noticeably, signaling pathways triggered by Kit, but not by FcεRI and therefore possibly-specific for cell proliferation, could be inhibited by FcγRIIB in the absence of SHIP1. However, although FcγRIIB could inhibit not only pathways shared by cell activation and cell proliferation, but also pathways specific for cell proliferation, the inhibition of common pathways, by SHIP1, was sufficient to prevent cell proliferation. Our work also provides information on the mechanisms by which SHIP1 negatively regulates signals triggered by Kit. Hematopoietic progenitors from SHIP1−/− mice were indeed reported to be hyper-responsive to several growth factors including SCF (39Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and we show here that Akt and Erk phosphorylation were more intense and lasted longer in SHIP1−/− BMMCs than in SHIP1+/+ BMMCs, in response to both anti-Kit antibodies and SCF stimulation. Whether triggered by SCF or by anti-Kit antibodies, Kit-derived signals are under the control of SHIP1 through the inhibit"
https://openalex.org/W2139207569,"Rho GTPases are members of the Ras superfamily and are involved in signal transduction pathways, including maintenance of cell morphology and motility, cell cycle progression, and transcription activation. We report the molecular identification in trypanosomatids (Trypanosoma cruzi) of the first member of the Rho family. The cloned Rho protein, TcRho1, shares ∼40% homology with other members of the Rho family. Southern blot analysis revealed that TcRHO1 is a single copy gene per haploid genome, and Northern blot assays showed a transcript of 1200 nucleotides in length. Mapping the 5′-untranslated region ofTcRHO1 transcripts revealed at least five different transcripts derived from differential trans-splicing. Three of the five transcripts contain the trans-splicing site within the coding region of the TcRHO1 gene. TcRho1 also contains the C-terminal sequence CQLF (CAAX motif), which is predicted to direct post-translation prenylation of the cysteine residue. A synthetic peptide containing this C-terminal motif, when tested against Q-Sepharose chromatography fractions from T. cruzi cytosol, was shown to be efficiently farnesylated, but not geranylgeranylated, despite the fact that the CAAX motif withX = Phe specifies geranylgeranylation by mammalian protein geranylgeranyltransferase I. Furthermore, immunoblot analyses of epimastigote protein with anti-S-farnesylcysteine methyl ester and anti-TcRho1 antisera strongly suggested that TcRho1 is farnesylated in vivo.

Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221PubMed Google Scholar). The Ras superfamily of small GTPases encompasses several related protein families whose members are involved in regulation of a diverse set of cellular events (2Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily are ubiquitously found in all branches of eukaryotic lineage. The Rho family of small GTPases is being intensely studied in mammalian cells due to the critical role of these proteins in maintaining cellular morphology by coordinating the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5229) Google Scholar). Other cellular processes under Rho family control are signaling pathways that lead to activation of some transcription factors (4Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5Alberts A.S. Treisman R.

Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rho proteins have been found in animals (8Chavrier P. Simons K. Zerial M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), plants (9Winge P. Brembu T. Bones A.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), fungi (10Tanaka K. Takai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and protozoa including Entamoeba histolytica (11Godbold G.D. Mann B.J. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, proteins belonging to this family have not yet been described in deeper lineages of lower eukaryotes. Amino acid sequences of Ras superfamily GTPases contain five conserved blocks (named G1 to G5) that are essential for GTP binding and hydrolysis (12Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). These regions are brought together in the globular tertiary structure, forming a cleft where GTP binds (12Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins have a hypervariable C terminus that extends away from the globular core and terminates in a so-called CAAX box (where C is cysteine, A is usually but not necessarily an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a variety of different amino acids). The CAAX box serves as a signal for a series of post-translational modifications: 1) farnesylation or geranylgeranylation of the cysteine sulfhydryl group, 2) endoproteolytic removal of AAX, and 3) methylation of the α-carboxyl group of the prenylated cysteine residue. The hydrophobic C termini of Ras superfamily GTPases are thought to be important for anchoring these proteins to cellular membranes (13Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, farnesylation of CAAX (where X = serine, methionine, and other residues) is carried out by protein farnesyltransferase (PFT),1whereas protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (PGGT-I) geranylgeranylates CAAX when X is leucine or phenylalanine (14Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The family Trypanosomatidae is composed of obligate protozoan parasites, some of pivotal medical and economic interest.Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which affects ∼17 million people in the American continent (15Johnston D.A. Blaxter M.L. Degrave W.M. Foster J. Ivens A.C. Melville S.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Development of new drugs against pathogenic trypanosomatids is needed, thus requiring the characterization of novel potential drug targets. Among them, compounds that impair the function of GTPases, such as PFT inhibitors, are very promising therapeutic alternatives (16Yokoyama K. Trobridge P. Buckner F.S. Scholten J. Stuart K.D. Van Voorhis W.C. Gelb M.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). T. cruzi has a digenetic life cycle involving insect and vertebrate hosts. During this cycle, parasites undergo morphological and physiological changes due to different microenvironment stimuli that occur in the insect digestive tract and in the vertebrate host (17de Souza W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1984; 86: 197-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The regulation of such cellular events, which involve cell division, differentiation, and host cell invasion, is not well understood. Identifying key molecular regulators in T. cruziis critical for the development of new approaches to control and treat Chagas' disease. Some Ras superfamily proteins have been described in trypanosomatids (18Field M.C. Ali B.R. Field H. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and functional studies of Rab GTPases in Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi have revealed similarities between their roles in vesicle trafficking of lower and higher eukaryotes (19Cappai R.

Studies in T. brucei have also revealed an ancestral Ras family protein, which seems to fit in an intermediate position between the Ras and Rap subfamilies (26Leal S.T. Araripe J.R. Urmeny T.P. Cross G.A. Rondinelli E. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 96: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other GTPases from the Ran and Arf families have been found in trypanosomes andLeishmania species (18Field M.C. Ali B.R. Field H. Parasitol.

As far as we know, this is the most ancestral Rho family sequence found in the eukaryotic lineage. We have recently shown that inhibitors of trypanosomatid PFTs are much more cytotoxic to T. brucei, T. cruzi, andLeishmania mexicana amazonensis than to mammalian cells (16Yokoyama K. Trobridge P. Buckner F.S. Scholten J. Stuart K.D. Van Voorhis W.C. Gelb M.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,32Yokoyama K. Trobridge P. Buckner F.S. Van Voorhis W.C. Stuart K.D. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26497-26505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this difference is not known. We have purified T. brucei PFT and cloned its α- and β-subunits (32Yokoyama K. Trobridge P. Buckner F.S. Van Voorhis W.C. Stuart K.D. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26497-26505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Buckner F.S. Yokoyama K. Nguyen L. Grewal A. Erdjumen-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strickland C.L. Xiao L.

However, no significant PGGT-I activity was detected when T. brucei lysate was submitted to ion-exchange chromatography and fractions were assayed using typical mammalian PGGT-I substrates. PFT and PGGT-I share a common α-subunit, but have distinct β-subunits. We have not been able to detect the β-subunit of PGGT-I by TBLASTN searching of trypanosomatid genomic data bases even though the shotgun coverage of the T. brucei genome is currently at 1.5×. These results suggest that proteins that are modified by a single geranylgeranyl chain in mammalian cells may be farnesylated in trypanosomatids. This could explain the selective toxicity of PFT inhibitors to these parasites. Thus, in this study, we also report our results on the prenylation of TcRho1 by protein prenyltransferase present in T. cruzi lysates. T. cruzi epimastigotes, clone Dm28c and strain Tulahuen, were kindly provided by Dr. S. Goldenberg (Fiocruz, Brazil) and Dr. S. Reed (Infectious Diseases Research Institute, Seattle, WA), respectively. Cells were maintained at 28 °C in liver infusion Tryptone medium (34Camargo E.P. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 1964; 6: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.025 µg/ml hemin (Sigma). Metacyclogenesis and purification of Dm28c metacyclic trypomastigotes were performed in TAU-3AAG medium as described (35Contreras V.T. Salles J.M. Thomas N. Morel C.M. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared from 109 Dm28c epimastigotes. Cells were collected by centrifugation and incubated in 0.5% SDS, 20 µg/ml RNase A, and 100 µg/ml proteinase K at 56 °C for 2 h. DNA was extracted using the phenol/chloroform extraction method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Five micrograms of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, BamHI,SalI, HindIII, and PstI (New England Biolabs Inc.). The digested samples were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, DNA was denatured in 0.5 nNaOH, neutralized, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by capillarity through a 20× SSC solution (3 m NaCl and 0.3m sodium citrate), and UV-cross-linked (120,000 µJ/cm2) using a UV cross-linker chamber (Ultralum). Total RNA was prepared from ∼109 cells (99% epimastigotes) according to the methodology described by Perry et al. (37Perry R.P. La Torre J. Kelley D.E. Greenberg J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 262: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA by oligo(dT) chromatography using the QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Twenty micrograms of total RNA and 200 ng of poly(A)+ RNA were separated on a formaldehyde-containing 1.5% agarose gel, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane by capillary transfer, and UV-cross-linked as described above for Southern blotting. Before hybridization, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 3 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (1% (w/v) Ficoll, 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Probes were radiolabeled by the random priming DNA labeling method (38Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar) using either [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 42 °C in the blocking solution containing 106 cpm/ml denatured probe. After hybridization, membranes were washed three times with 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 55 °C and autoradiographed. An λEMBL3 Dm28c genomic library was kindly provided by Dr. W. Degrave (Fiocruz, Brazil) and propagated in Escherichia coli strain KW252. Approximately 60,000 independent recombinant phages were screened with the [α-32P]dATP-labeled pTcrho probe (described under “Results”). We used two membrane replicates for each hybridization, and plugs containing positive plaques in both of them were selected and submitted to secondary and tertiary screens. After three rounds of selection, three phage clones giving positive hybridization signals were selected. One of them, named λTcRHO1, was selected for a characterization of TcRho1. TheλTcRHO1 clone was amplified in E. coli strain LE392. DNA from this clone was extracted and purified as described (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and was submitted to Southern blot analysis as described above. A 4.0-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment was selected as an initial target for cloning. Ligation ofEcoRI-digested genomic cloned DNA withEcoRI-digested and 5′-dephosphorylated pBluescript KS-II+ (Stratagene) followed by transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue generated several recombinant clones. Plasmid DNA from these clones was extracted as described (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); those containing cloned fragments in the range of 4.0 kilobase pairs were selected, and their 5′- and 3′-ends were sequenced. As the TcRHO1coding region was not fully contained in the EcoRI fragment, we further subcloned a 300-bp KpnI fragment fromλTcRHO1 containing part of the 3′-coding region of TcRHO1. This clone was radiolabeled and used as a probe to clone a 1.3-kilobase pair EcoRI/PstI fragment from λTcRHO1 encompassing the remaining TcRho1 sequence. Subcloned fragments in pBluescript KS-II+ were sequenced with different primers by the dideoxy chain termination method (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52767) Google Scholar) using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We used the commercially available T3 and T7 sequencing primers and also three sequencing primers based on the TcRho1 sequence (G2, 5′-CGGAATTCCCGGTACCCCGCC-3′; G4, 5′-GCGTGGGATGACCC-3′; and G5, 5′-GCGTTGGTAACATGCAGC-3′). For mapping theTcRHO1 5′-UTR and for locating the trans-splicing acceptor sites, we carried out mini-exon, semi-nested RT-PCR against T. cruzi RNA. One primer was directed to the mini-exon sequence (ME, 5′-GGATGGAATTCAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′; kindly provided by Dr. T. Urmeni, Instituto de Biofı́sica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro), and the other two primers were directed to sequences within the TcRHO1 coding region (G2 (see above) and G3, 5′-AACTGCAGAACCGCCAACCCCTTCATTGC-3′). Initially, 5 µg of total epimastigote RNA was submitted to first strand cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript II preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.), performed with random hexamers as primers, according to the manufacturer's suggested procedures. The first PCR was carried out in the presence of 0.5 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 µm each primer, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). To avoid problems derived from differences in primer melting temperatures, a touch-down PCR program was used by decreasing the annealing temperature from 75 to 57 °C in 1 °C steps. Then, 20 additional cycles were performed at 93 °C for denaturing, at 55 °C for annealing, and at 72 °C for extension, followed by a 10-min extension step. One-tenth of this first reaction was used as template in the second reaction under same conditions, but with a conventional thermocycler program (30 cycles consisting of 93 °C for denaturing, 55 °C for annealing, and 72 °C for extension, followed by a 10-min extension step). Products of both reactions were resolved on a 2.5% agarose gel. Sites for EcoRI were present in the mini-exon and G2 primers to allow ligation of products from the second reaction into pBluescript KS-II+. Ligated products were introduced in E. coli XL1-Blue, amplified, and sequenced, allowing an accurate mapping of TcRHO1 trans-splicing acceptor sites. The coding region of TcRHO1was amplified by PCR using 100 ng of total T. cruzi DNA using the primers Tcrhostart (5′-CGGGATCCTCACAATGGAGGAGACACTG-3′) and Tcrhoend (5′-CGGGATCCATCAAAAAAGTTGACAGCTCTGTC-3′), both containingBamHI cloning sites. The PCR program consisted of 30 conventional cycles (93 °C for denaturing, 55 °C for annealing, and 72 °C for extension), followed by a 10-min extension step. The 850-bp amplified fragment was cloned in frame with the glutathioneS-transferase gene in the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resulting construct was used to transform E. coli strain BL21. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm after cultures reachedA 600 ∼ 0.8. Cultures were then maintained for 1 h; cells were pelleted and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline; and the cells were lysed by sonication with a Branson sonicator (ten 10-s pulses interrupted by cooling on ice). The fusion protein was recovered from inclusion bodies using the urea solubilization protocol previous described for the Ras protein (40Campbel-Burk S.L. Carpenter J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purification of the fusion protein was accomplished by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's suggested procedure. The purified protein was cleaved with factor Xa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 10 units/mg of fusion protein to release TcRho1 protein from the glutathione S-transferase tag. Protein yield was measured by the Bradford quantification method (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217509) Google Scholar). Preparations were analyzed for purity by 12% SDS-PAGE. As described under “Results,” we desired a strain of T. cruzi that overexpresses TcRho1 mutant that cannot be prenylated. We had available a mutant of TcRho1 in which the C-terminal CQLF sequence was replaced with FNFFDFA, and this mutant DNA fragment was used to construct the vector for overexpression of mutant TcRho1 in T. cruzi. Overexpression was performed using the T. cruzi expression vector pBS:IL2-CnFc (42LaFlumme A.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The interleukin 2-encoding insert was excised from the vector with BamHI and replaced with theTcRHO1 open reading frame flanked by BamHI sites. A clone with a properly oriented insert was identified, and 5 µg of supercoiled DNA was electroporated into Tulahuen epimastigotes as previously described (42LaFlumme A.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected and expanded in 500 µg/ml G418. Antiserum to TcRho1 was raised in a rabbit against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide NDNGVVDTSNKQSIEL, present in the C-terminal hypervariable region. Antiserum was submitted to affinity purification using the resin prepared by reacting the same peptide used for immunization with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gel was sequentially washed with 10 volumes of the following buffers: 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5); 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5); 10 mm Tris (pH 8.8); and freshly prepared 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.5). Finally, the gel was washed with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) until the pH reached 7.5. Antiserum was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and passed through the column four times. The column was washed with 20 volumes of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), followed by 500 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) until theA 280 reached a minimum. Antibodies were eluted with 10 volumes of 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and neutralizing with 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). The material was dialyzed against 5 mm NaCl and lyophilized. Tulahuen strain epimastigote cells (log phase) were pelleted in a microcentrifuge tube. The supernatant was removed; the cell pellet was treated with Laemmli sample buffer at 42 °C for 30 min; and a sample from 107 cells was loaded onto a single lane of a 12.5% Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20. The blot was incubated for 2 h either with affinity-purified anti-TcRho1 antiserum (1:2000) or with anti-S-farnesylcysteine methyl ester antiserum (1:2000) (43Baron R. Fourcade E. Lajoie-Mazenc I.

After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T. cruziTulahuen epimastigotes from a 1-liter culture (5 × 109 cells) were collected; washed once with phosphate-buffered saline; and suspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 30 µm each tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone and tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; and 10 µg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). The cells were lysed by sonication with a Branson sonicator (ten 5-s pulses interrupted by cooling on ice). The lysate was diluted to 26 ml and supplemented with the following components at the indicated concentrations: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 5 µm ZnCl2. This mixture was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 80 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (containing 0.854 mg/ml protein, measured by the Bradford assay) was subjected to protein precipitation with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate at 0 °C. Proteins were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was dialyzed against ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C (three exchanges of 2 liters each). The resultant protein solution was loaded onto a column (1 × 8 cm) of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 80 min, and then a gradient of buffer A and buffer B (same as buffer A, but containing 1 m NaCl) was applied as follows: 0–4 min, 0–15% buffer B; 4–124 min, 15–55% buffer B; 124–128 min, 55–100% buffer B; and 128–152 min, 100% buffer B. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the protein elution profile was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Assay of prenyltransferase activity was carried out by incubating 4 µl of Q-Sepharose fractions at 30 °C for 30 min with 5 µm biotin-QSCQLF (C-terminal peptide of TcRho1, prepared by United Biochemical Research) and 1 µm[3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (0.3 µCi) or 1 µm [3H]GGPP (0.3 µCi) (both from American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 20 µl of buffer (30 mmpotassium phosphate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 µm ZnCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.7)). The amount of radiolabeled prenylated peptide was quantified using the avidin-agarose method as described (44Yokoyama K. Goodwin G.W. Ghomashchi F. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5302-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fractions were also assayed for PFT activity with 5 µm recombinant RAS-CVIM (a generous gift from Dr. C. Omer, Merck) and for PGGT-I activity with 5 µm Ras-CVLL (a generous gift from Prof. G. James, University of Texas) using the glass-fiber method (45Pompliano D.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Omer C.A. Shafer J.A. Gibbs J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8341-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For radiolabeling studies, 107 T. cruzi epimastigotes (Tulahuen strain) were cultured for 24 h in 1 ml of liver infusion Tryptone medium containing 100 µCi of [3H]mevalonolactone (1.6 µm; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and 300 µm simvastatin. Cellular protein was delipidated and submitted to SDS-PAGE as described (16Yokoyama K. Trobridge P. Buckner F.S. Scholten J. Stuart K.D. Van Voorhis W.C. Gelb M.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the PFT inhibitor JJ23 was present. We have characterized several cloned RT-PCR fragments amplified from T. cruzi RNA that share homology in their predicted peptide sequences with several Ras superfamily genes. These products were obtained by degenerated RT-PCR using a primer directed to the mini-exon sequence and a degenerated primer directed to the G3 conserved GTPase domain (DTAGQE). One of the obtained fragments, named pTcrho, shares ∼40% similarity with several members of the Rho family of proteins. We used pTcrho as a homologous probe to characterizeTcRHO1, a Rho family gene from T. cruzi. Genomic DNA from Dm28c epimastigotes was digested with"

Muscle type-specific expression of TM isoforms is generated from different genes and by alternative splicing. β-TM isoforms in chicken skeletal and smooth muscles are encoded by a single gene and transcribed from the same promoter. We previously reported a smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype-dependent change in β-TM expression (Kashiwada, K., Nishida, W., Hayashi, K., Ozawa, K., Yamanaka, Y., Saga, H., Yamashita, T., Tohyama, M., Shimada, S., Sato, K., and Sobue, K.

Promoter and gel mobility shift analyses revealed an obligatory role for serum response factor and its interaction with the CArG box sequence in the SMC-specific transcription of the β-TM gene in differentiated SMCs. We further isolated a novel homologue of the Barx homeoprotein family, Barx1b, from chicken gizzard. Barx1b was exclusively localized to SMCs of the upper digestive organs and their attached arteries and to craniofacial structures. Serum response factor and Barx1b bound each other directly, coordinately transactivated the β-TM gene in differentiated SMCs and heterologous cells, and formed a ternary complex with a CArG probe. Taken together, these results suggest that SRF and Barx1b are coordinately involved in the SMC-specific transcription of the β-TM gene in the upper digestive organs and their attached arteries.AB044371AB054298 Tropomyosin (TM) is a regulatory protein of actomyosin system.

The molecular basis for muscle contraction is the actomyosin system, which converts the chemical energy of ATP into mechanochemical force (1Ebashi S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the actomyosin system is differentially regulated depending on the presence of different contractile proteins (2Buckingham M.E. Essays Biochem. 1985; 20: 77-109PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whose expression patterns are muscle-type dependent. Therefore, these contractile proteins are considered to be muscle-specific molecular markers. Despite intensive study in this area, only one general concept concerning the transcription of muscle-specific marker gene has been agreed upon. Serum response factor (SRF)1 and its DNA binding sequence, CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG), are thought to comprise one of the core machineries for the muscle-specific transcription of the skeletal α-actin (5Lee T.C.

Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). It is expressed at high levels in all three muscles (16Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and at a far lower level in non-muscle cells (15Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). A recent study using SRF-deficient mice revealed the misformation of mesoderm leading to fetal death at around embryonic day 12.5; no skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle α-actin transcripts were detected in these mice (17Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possible involvement of co-activators in the SRF and CArG interaction that confer the muscle specificity on the transactivation of muscle-specific marker genes. One set of candidates for such co-activators includes members of the homeoprotein family. Grueneberg et al. (18Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) first reported a pairedclass homeoprotein, Phox1, which enhances the DNA binding ability of SRF (18Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition, two NK family homeoproteins have been reported as co-activators of SRF. Nkx-2.5/Csx and SRF activate thecardiac α-actin transcription (7Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Carsonet al. (19Carson J.A. Fillmore R.A. Schwartz R.J. Zimmer W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39061-39072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that Nkx-3.1 potentiates the transcription of the smooth muscle γ-actin gene with SRF. Tropomyosin (TM), which is a regulatory protein of the actomyosin system, has several isoforms that are generated from different genes and by alternative splicing in a muscle-specific context (reviewed in Ref. 20Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Three distinct chicken TM genes, α-TM, β-TM, and cardiac-TM, have been identified (20Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In chicken smooth muscle cells (SMCs), TM forms an α/β heterodimer. We reported previously that α-TM exhibits a change in its isoform from a smooth muscle-type (α-TMsm) to a fibroblast one (α-TM-F1 and α-TM-F2), and that the expression of smooth muscle-type β-TM is down-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels during the de-differentiation of vascular and visceral SMCs. Consequently, α- and β-TMs are also regarded as SMC-differentiation molecular markers (21Kashiwada K. Nishida W. Hayashi K. Ozawa K. Yamanaka Y. Saga H. Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Sato K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15396-15404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The chicken β-TM gene contains muscle and non-muscle promoters, and both smooth (β-TMsm) and skeletal (β-TMsk) muscle isoforms are transcribed from the same muscle promoter (22Forry-Schaudies S. Maihle N.J. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-TMsm and β-TMsk are generated by alternative splicing and contain exons 6a/9d and exons 6b/9a, respectively (20Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Toutant et al. (23Toutant M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fiszman M.Y. Lemonnier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported the E, C, and CArG boxes as putative cis-elements of the β-TM muscle promoter in skeletal myoblasts. However, there are no other reports concerning the tissue-specific transcription of the β-TM gene. Here, we investigated the SMC-specific transcription of the β-TM gene and demonstrated that CArG box, but not other cis-elements, is critically involved in the SMC-specific transcription. We further cloned a novel homologue of Barx1 homeoprotein family,Barx1b, as a partner of SRF. Barx1b is predominantly expressed in the SMC layer of the upper digestive organs, their attached arteries, and in craniofacial structures. In visceral SMCs and heterologous cells, SRF and Barx1b coordinately transactivated the β-TM gene. Gel mobility shift analysis showed a ternary complex between the SRF/CArG probe and Barx1b, and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a DNA-independent interaction between SRF with Barx1b in vivo. Promoter region of the β-TM gene was cloned from a chicken genomic library, then sequenced and subcloned into pGL3 basic luciferase plasmid (Promega) (BTM1272). A series of promoter constructs (BTM785, 230, 192, 117, and 81) containing deletions was then generated from BTM1272. Mutations were introduced into the E (GGTGCCTCGAGCCGG), C (CCGAGGATCCCGTCC), and CArG (TGTCCCTAAGCTTTG) boxes of BTM230. The chickenbarx1b, gax, and hox cluster genes were cloned from a chicken gizzard cDNA library using degenerative oligoprobes encoding the consensus sequence of the third helix of the homeodomain (QVKIWFQNRRMK) (24Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Human SRF and SRF mutant (SRFpm), which lacks CArG binding ability, were introduced FLAG tag at their COOH termini and were expressed as described previously (25Momiyama T. Hayashi K. Obata H. Chimori Y. Nishida T. Ito T. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GST-SRF derivatives were constructed in a pGEX 6P-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A series of Barx1b constructs, wild type (wt; amino acids 1–247), NH2 terminus deletion (ΔN; amino acids 135–247), COOH terminus deletion (ΔC; amino acids 1–194), 31 residues of NH2-terminal arm plus the homeodomain (31+HD; amino acids 104–194), 11 residues of NH2-terminal arm plus the homeodomain (11+HD; amino acids 124–194), the homeodomain alone (HD; amino acids 135–194), and with the homeodomain deleted (ΔHD; amino acids 1–134 and 195–247), were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and subcloned into pGEX6P-1, pCS2+MT, or pcDNA3.1 FLAG vector. The coding region of chicken mhox was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from chicken gizzard total RNA. Full-length of gax and mhox were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 FLAG vector. An anti-Barx1b antibody was purified from anti-GST-Barx1b-C (amino acids 195–247) rabbit serum by the sequential application of GST and GST-Barx1b-C affinity columns. Anti-human SRF polyclonal, anti-GST polyclonal, and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma. Differentiated chicken gizzard SMCs were cultured as described previously (26Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Kimura K. Nishida W. Saga H. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were transfected for 48 h with 1 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid and 1.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid with or without SRF/Barx1b expression vectors using TransIT LT1 lipofection reagent (Pan Vera Corp.). The cell lysates were measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The transfection efficiencies were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. GST-SRF or GST-Barx1b derivatives were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Protein expression was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed with a French pressure cell press (SIM-AMINCO). The recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B gels. The purity and quantity of the recombinant proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie blue staining. A series of GST-SRF proteins were purified and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B gels. Barx1b derivatives were translated in vitro using TNT-quick coupled transcription and translation system kit with [35S]methionine (Promega). The binding reaction was carried out with 2 μg of GST-SRF and 10 μl of in vitro translated Barx1b in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C for 2 h. GST-SRF bound Sepharose was washed three times, treated with 2% SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotide probes were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) and excised byBamHI and HindIII digestion. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP and purified with QIA quick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Nuclear extracts from chicken gizzards at embryonic day 15 (E15) were prepared by the method of de Jonqet al. (27de Jong R. van der Heijden J. Meijlink F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4711-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chicken gizzard nuclear extracts and the labeled β-TM CArG probe were incubated in 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 25 μg/ml herring sperm DNA). Purified fusion protein(s) and the labeled β-TM CArG probe were incubated in 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml herring sperm DNA) at room temperature for 20 min, then the mixtures were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out under constant current of 10 mA in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Whole chicken embryos or gizzards at E15 were embedded with Tissue-Tek (SAKURA) and cut into 12–15-μm thick by cryostat (Bright, Huntingdon, United Kingdom). The sections were fixed and hybridized with cRNA probes as described previously (8Obata H. Hayashi K. Nishida W. Momiyama T. Uchida A. Ochi T. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26643-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fluorescent signal was detected using the TSA Plus DNP AP system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.) and HNPP/Fast Red TR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. A β-TM cRNA probe encoding exons 1a and 2, which are common to both the smooth and skeletal muscle isoforms, was used. 10T1/2 cells were seeded at a density of 9 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate, and transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1-wt-SRF-FLAG and 2 μg of pCS2+MT-wt-Barx1b. Transfected cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 600 μl of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were incubated with 200 μg/ml DNase I and 10 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 26 °C, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (250 μl) was rocked with 2.5 μg of anti-Barx1b polyclonal or 2 μg of anti-SRF polyclonal antibody for 12 h at 4 °C, then protein A-Sepharose gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added. After 6 h incubation, the gels were washed three times and treated with 2% SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with mouse anti-FLAG M2 or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Target proteins were detected with peroxidase linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Supersignal West reagent (Pierce). To elucidate the essentialcis-elements of the β-TM gene, we cloned the chicken β-TM promoter region, and analyzed its promoter activity in differentiated gizzard SMCs (Fig.1 A). A series of deleted reporter genes (BTM1272-BTM117) showed only a slight reduction in their promoter activities, even when the E and C boxes were deleted (BTM117). In contrast, loss of the CArG box (BTM81) resulted in a marked decrease in the promoter activity. Mutation of the CArG box (CArG box MUT), but not the E and C boxes (E box MUT and C box MUT), in BTM230 also markedly decreased the promoter activity. Gel mobility shit analysis was then performed using nuclear extracts prepared from differentiated gizzard SMCs and 32P-labeled β-TM CArG probe (Fig.1 B). The labeled CArG probe and nuclear protein complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), which was displaced by an excess amount of unlabeled probe (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), was supershifted with anti-SRF antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). These results suggested that CArG box is the critical cis-element of the β-TM gene in visceral SMCs, and that SRF serves as a trans-factor of the CArG box. To elucidate the mechanism of SMC-specific transcription, we screened the homeobox genes from a gizzard SMC cDNA library and cloned the gax, hox cluster (hoxA5 andhoxB3-B5), and a novel clone of Barx family genes. This clone was 1,170 base pairs in length and encoded a single open reading frame of 247 amino acids (Fig.2 A). Barx1 cDNAs have been recently isolated from mouse (28Tissier-Seta J.P. Mucchielli M.L. Mark M. Mattei M.G. Goridis C. Brunet J.F. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), human (29Gould D.B. Walter M.A. Genomics. 2000; 68: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and chicken (30Barlow A.J. Bogardi J.P. Ladher R. Francis-West P.H. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The novel clone shows 82–84% total identity with known Barx1 homologues. The homeodomain of this clone is completely identical with that of other Barx1 family members, including unique Thr and Tyr residues in the third helix. It also shares four leucine repeats and a Barx-specific domain at the COOH terminus (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, the novel clone has a long NH2-terminal sequence and shows a substitution of 13 amino acids in the NH2 terminus (amino acids 102–130) and 10 amino acids in the COOH terminus (amino acids 228–247) compared with other Barx1 family members. Based on these findings, we called this novel homologue chicken barx1b. In addition, we noticed that there is a sequence similarity between the Barx1b and Nkx-2.5 families (see “Discussion”). They share the consensus sequence of the FIL domain (31Saito T. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Anderson D.J. Mikoshiba K. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) at their NH2 terminus, and contain basic residue-rich sequence around the NH2-terminal boundary of the homeodomain (Fig. 2, B and C). The expression patterns of the cloned homeobox genes, includingbarx1b in E15 chicken embryos, were compared with those of β-TM and SRF by in situ hybridization. The Barx1b mRNA was exclusively expressed in upper digestive tissues such as the esophagus, crop, and gizzard, and in craniofacial structures (Fig.3 C). gax was expressed in all muscle lineages, and hox genes were ubiquitously expressed (data not shown). The β-TM mRNA was seen in all smooth and skeletal muscle tissues, but was faint in cardiac muscle (Fig. 3 A). The SRF mRNA was ubiquitous but prominent in all three muscle types (Fig. 3 B). The β-TM, SRF, and Barx1b mRNAs in gizzard were then precisely localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The β-TM and Barx1b mRNAs were only seen in the SMC layer of the gizzard (Fig. 3,D and F), but the SRF mRNA was detected from the glandular to the SMC layers (Fig. 3 E). Signals of all three transcripts were also seen in the adjacent arteries (Fig. 3,D-F). As a control, we performed the same analysis using sense probes, and found no signals in the E15 whole embryo (data not shown). Northern blotting revealed that the expressions of Barx1b and SRF mRNAs in gizzards preceded that of β-TM mRNA and were most prominent at E10–13. In addition, the expression patterns of Barx1b, SRF, and β-TM were sustained after hatching. The β-TM mRNA was up-regulated during development of the gizzard (data not shown). We next investigated the possible involvement of Barx1b in the SRF-dependent activation of the β-TM promoter. The β-TM reporter gene (BTM117), which contains a CArG box, was co-transfected with SRF and/or Barx1b expression vectors in differentiated gizzard SMCs (Fig. 4). When SRF or Barx1b was transfected alone, the activation rates of the reporter gene were doubled. However, co-transfection with Barx1b and SRF showed an approximately 5-fold increase. The co-transfection of other homeoproteins, Gax or MHox, with SRF, which was done as a control, failed to show the coordinated activation of the reporter gene. When a mutation was introduced into the CArG box of the reporter gene (CArG MUT), no significant activation was observed even in the presence of SRF and Barx1b (Fig. 4, right four columns). Taken together, these results indicate that SRF and Barx1b coordinately transactivate the β-TM gene through the CArG box in differentiated SMCs. The interacting domains of SRF and Barx1b were mapped by a pull-down assay.35S-Labeled Barx1b derivatives were incubated with GST-SRF immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose gels (Fig.5 A). Wild-type Barx1b (wt) and its COOH terminus deletion (ΔC) bound to SRF, but its NH2terminus deletion (ΔN) did not. Interestingly, deletion mutants composed 31 or 11 residues of the NH2-terminal arm plus the homeodomain (31+HD or 11+HD) retained their binding activity with SRF, but the homeodomain (HD) alone or the homeodomain deletion (ΔHD) lacked the activity. These results suggest the critical involvement of 11 residues of the NH2-terminal arm plus the homeodomain of Barx1b in its interaction with SRF. An essential domain of SRF required for Barx1b binding was also determined (Fig. 5 B). SRF derivatives fused with GST were incubated with the35S-labeled minimum binding domain of Barx1b (11+HD). Wild-type (wt) and the MADS domain (MADS) of SRF interacted with Barx1b, but the NH2 (N) and COOH (C) termini of SRF did not. Thus, the domains of Barx1b and SRF essential for their physical interaction were mapped to 11 residues of the NH2-terminal arm plus the homeodomain of Barx1b and the MADS domain of SRF. To confirm the direct interaction between SRF and Barx1b in vivo, FLAG-tagged SRF and Myc-tagged Barx1b were co-expressed in 10T1/2 cells and immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5 C). The proteins precipitated with anti-SRF or anti-Barx1b antibodies were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1–4) or anti-Myc (Fig. 5 C, lanes 5–8) antibodies. FLAG-SRF and Myc-Barx1b were successfully co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Barx1b and anti-SRF antibodies, respectively (Fig. 5 C, lanes 4 and7). We then examined whether the minimum interaction domain of SRF and Barx1b are actually involved in β-TM transcription in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (Fig. 5 D). Expression of wt-Barx1b or SRF alone showed a 2- or 5-fold increase in the promoter activity, respectively. Co-expression of SRF and wt-Barx1b, however, showed a striking increase in activity about 17-fold. Consistent with the results of pull-down assays (Fig. 5, A and B), SRF and Barx1b-ΔC or Barx1b-11+HD, which directly binds to SRF, coordinately activated the β-TM promoter by 16- or 13-fold, respectively. Barx1b-ΔN, Barx1b-HD, or Barx1b-ΔHD, which lack SRF binding activity, failed to potentiate the promoter activity, even when SRF was present. This coordinated activation was not seen with an SRF mutant (SRFpm) that lacks DNA binding ability. To study the interaction of SRF and Barx1b with the β-TMcis-element, gel mobility shift analysis was performed using32P-labeled putative cis-elements. In this experiment, we used Barx1b-ΔC, which fully retained the SRF binding ability and the β-TM transcription activity with SRF. To reveal the binding site(s) in the β-TM promoter region for Barx1b, we examined the interactions of putative homeoprotein binding AT-rich sequences (−1272 to −1242, −1270 to −1040, −431 to −401, and −437 to −417) with Barx1b (24Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). None of these 32P-labeled AT-rich probes, however, bound to GST-Barx1b-ΔC. The same result was obtained using GST-Barx1b-wt (data not shown). This finding was consistent with promoter analyses, which showed that no deletions of AT-rich sequences (BTM1013, BTM785, and BTM230) affected the β-TM promoter activity (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, mutation of the CArG box efficiently abolished the transactivation of the β-TM gene with SRF and/or Barx1b (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Barx1b acts as a DNA-independent co-activator of SRF, and that it requires the SRF and CArG interaction as a base foothold. Finally, we examined the interaction between SRF, the 32P-labeled CArG probe, and Barx1b (Fig.6). SRF bound to the labeled CArG probe in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6 and7, arrowhead) and the SRF-DNA complex was supershifted with anti-SRF antibody (Fig. 6 A, lane 9, two asterisks). In contrast, GST-Barx1b-ΔC alone did not bind to the labeled CArG probe (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2–5). The same result was obtained using GST-Barx1b-wt (data not shown). When both SRF and GST-Barx1b-ΔC were incubated with the labeled CArG probe, a band shift was observed (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4, arrow). Because this slowly migrating band was supershifted with anti-GST or anti-SRF antibodies (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5 and6, two asterisks), the band was identified as a ternary complex between SRF, CArG probe, and Barx1b. In addition, as GST-Barx1b-ΔC amounts were increased, free probes were gradually reduced (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4, asterisk). No ternary complex was observed, when GST was incubated with SRF and CArG probe (data not shown). Here, we demonstrated the SMC-specific transcription of the β-TM gene. Promoter analyses using a series of deleted and mutated β-TM reporter genes and gel mobility shift assays revealed an obligatory role of the SRF and CArG interaction for β-TM expression in SMCs (Fig. 1). We also isolated a novel homologue of the Barx family, Barx1b, and found it to act as a co-activator of SRF (Figs. 2 and 4). Barx1b was exclusively localized to the SMC layer of the upper digestive organs and its attached arteries and in craniofacial structures (Fig. 3). We further demonstrated that SRF and Barx1b, which directly bound each other, coordinately transactivated the β-TM gene (Figs. 4 and 5), and formed a ternary complex with a CArG probe (Fig.6). Although the transcription of muscle-specific genes has been extensively studied, no general mechanism explaining muscle-specific transcription has been revealed except for the SRF and CArG box interaction. SRF is dominantly expressed in all three muscle types, which are derived from mesoderm (Fig. 3 B and Ref. 16Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and is involved in muscle-specific gene transcription. However, SRF also plays a vital role in the expression of immediate-early genes (32Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). These diverse roles of SRF might be regulated by different co-activators for different genes. In fact, ternary complex factor recruits SRF and potentiates the transactivation of the c-fos gene (32Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1"

In this study, we report a variant of CooA, M124R, that is active in transcriptional activation in a redox-dependent manner. Where wild-type CooA is active only in the FeII + CO form, M124R CooA is active in both FeII + CO and FeIII forms. Analysis of the pH dependence of the activity of FeIII M124R CooA demonstrated that the activity was also coordination state-dependent with a five-coordinate, high-spin species identified as the active form and Cys75 as the retained ligand. In contrast, the active FeII + CO forms of both wild-type and M124R CooA are six-coordinate and low-spin with a protein ligand other than Cys75, so that WT and FeIII M124R CooA are apparently achieving an active conformation despite two different heme coordination and ligation states. A hypothesis to explain these results is proposed. This study demonstrates the utility of CooA as a model system for the isolation of functionally interesting heme proteins.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). For the sensing of NO, soluble guanylyl cyclase serves as the receptor and has been investigated extensively (3Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 4Burstyn J.N., Yu, A.E. Dierks E.A. Hawkins B.K. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5896-5903Google Scholar). Soluble guanylyl cyclase is mildly activated upon binding CO (∼5% compared with NO; Ref. 4Burstyn J.N., Yu, A.E. Dierks E.A. Hawkins B.K. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5896-5903Google Scholar), although this activity can be increased by the presence of the indazole derivative YC-1 (5Friebe A. Russwurm M. Mergia E. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15253-15257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 255-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Combined with recent in vivo studies (7Schmidt K. Schrammel A. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8McLaughlin B.E. Chretien M.L. Choi C. Brien J.F. Nakatsu K. Marks G.S. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2000; 78: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a common view is that soluble guanylyl cyclase does indeed sense and become activated by CO but only under conditions where a physiological co-effector is present. However, the identity of a specific CO-sensing protein in eukaryotic systems has yet to be demonstrated conclusively. Oxygen sensors include FixL, which is involved in anaerobic control of nitrogen fixation inRhizobium meliloti (9Gilles-Gonzales M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 10Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the Escherichia coli protein named “direct oxygen sensor” (DOS) the function of which remains unclear (11Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Finally, CooA, a transcriptional activator in the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, is the first protein described that has a specific physiological role in CO-sensing and CO-mediated signal transduction (12Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the above gas-sensing proteins have in common a heme b prosthetic group that is directly involved in binding the effector, which leads to a conformational change in the protein that affects activity. Upon binding CO, the homodimeric CooA undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to its cognate promoters in the cooregulon (13He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The coo regulon contains two transcriptional operons whose polypeptide products are required for R. rubrum to anaerobically oxidize CO to CO2 with concomitant H+ reduction to H2 (14Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CooA belongs to a family of transcriptional activators that include the cAMP receptor protein (CRP1; Ref.15Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the fumarate and nitrate reductase activator protein (FNR; Ref.16Spiro S. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently the three-dimensional structure of the effector (CO)-free form of CooA has been solved (17Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and its comparison to the three-dimensional structure of the effector (cAMP)-bound form of CRP (18Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) has indicated the conformational changes that take place upon effector-driven activation in this protein family. In addition, the structure of CooA indicated an unprecedented ligation arrangement for a heme protein wherein the N-terminal proline (Pro2, from the opposite subunit) and His77 serve as the heme-axial ligands in the FeII form. Interestingly a redox-mediated ligand exchange occurs in CooA (from Cys75 in the FeIII form to His77 in the FeIIform; Fig. 1) upon reduction of the heme iron (19Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, CooA functions as both a CO sensor and a redox sensor because only the FeII form is competent to bind CO. The heme of WT CooA is hexacoordinate and low-spin in all oxidation and ligation states (21Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that incoming CO must displace one of the internal protein ligands. Picosecond time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy (22Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and NMR studies (23Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have indicated that His77 is the retained ligand in the FeII + CO form of CooA. A study of CooA variants showed that alteration of Pro2 did not significantly affect CooA activity; this is also consistent with the hypothesis of the retention of His77 in the FeII + CO form (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar to that of effector-bound CRP, the structure of effector-free CooA indicated that a single α-helix (designated the C-helix) in each monomer serves to create the intersubunit dimerization domain (18Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In CRP and FNR, alterations of particular amino acids in the center of this helix have a variety of effects on activity (25Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 705-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified CooA variants altered in the C-helix that have a perturbed ligation structure in the oxidized (FeIII) form. The FeIII form of one of these variants can also bind specific target DNA and is competent in transcriptional activation. This novel activity can be modulated by the redox state of the heme iron, demonstrating the ability of CooA to serve as a model system for engineering unique sensing capabilities in heme proteins. The construction of strains bearing WT CooA and CooA variants in an E. coli overexpression system and in a β-galactosidase reporter system (19Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y.

Variants randomized in their amino acid sequences at selected locations in CooA were generated as described previously (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P.

Because of poor accumulation in the E. coliexpression system, M124R CooA was purified to ∼80% homogeneity. We also isolated M124R CooA under anaerobic conditions in the presence of sodium dithionite as described by Shelver et al. (19Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) but observed little improvement in the yield of heme-containing CooA. When necessary, aliquots of the reduced anaerobically isolated M124R CooA were chemically oxidized with a slight excess of potassium ferricyanide, which was then removed by G-25 gel filtration. The heme content of CooA preparations was quantified using the reduced pyridine-hemochromogen assay (29DeDuve C. Acta Chem. Scand. 1948; 2: 264-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein content was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce).

Anaerobic cultures were then incubated at 30 °C with gentle lateral shaking for ∼12 h to mid to late log phase. Whole-cell β-galactosidase assays were then performed as described previously (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The influence of pH dependence on activity of our CooA preparations was measured in a solution consisting of CaCl2 (6 mm), KCl (50 mm), glycerol (5% (v/v)), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and different buffering components (pH 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0; 20 mm Tris-HCl and pH 9.5, 10.0, and 10.5; 20 mm glycine/NaOH). The pK a of the activity transition (see “Results”) was calculated by fitting the pH titration data to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation assuming a single ionization. Different preparations of the labeled PcooF showed slightly different baseline values (no protein added) in the polarization assay, although the total change in polarization at saturation (∼0.030–0.035 anisotropy units) was roughly constant. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy of CooA samples was performed at room temperature in quartz cuvettes sealed with rubber septa using a Shimadzu UV-PC2100 spectrophotometer (slit width = 0.5 nm). pH titrations of isolated M124R CooA were performed in the following buffers (100 mmand containing 5% glycerol) at these pH values: pH 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0, Tris-HCl; pH 9.5, 10.0, and 10.5, glycine/NaOH. The pK a of the spectral transition was calculated by fitting the titration data to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation assuming a single ionization. Isolated M124R FeIII CooA was first concentrated to ∼200 µm (in heme) using ultrafiltration under nitrogen gas pressure in an Amicon cell fitted with a Diaflo YM-10 membrane. The protein (200 µl) was then mixed with 50 µl of 500 mmbuffer (pH 7.5, MOPS and pH 10.5, glycine/NaOH) to provide a final buffer concentration equal to 100 mm and a heme concentration of ∼160 µm. Samples were then quickly degassed on an argon manifold to remove dissolved oxygen, frozen, and stored at 77 K. The EPR spectra were then recorded as described previously (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of theoretical g values was performed using a rhombogram computer program (Rhombo Version 1.0; see Appendix in Ref. 32Pierik A.J. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following random mutagenesis of that portion of cooA encoding the Ser122-Cys123-Met124residues, mutagenized clones were screened in a strain ofE. coli in which CooA regulates lacZ expression (19Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Some clones were noted that expressed β-galactosidase under aerobic growth conditions; this was not a property of clones expressing WT CooA. Similar to WT, however, these clones also showed activity under anaerobic conditions only when CO was present. Upon sequencing, these clones contained sequences that created M124R or M124K substitutions. The results with colonies were supported by quantitative β-galactosidase activity assays. Cells with WT CooA have ∼1–3% activity under aerobic or anaerobic conditions compared with anaerobic conditions in the presence of CO. Cells with M124R CooA have activity similar to that of WT CooA when grown anaerobically in the presence of CO but substantially higher activity aerobically (∼30%) and anaerobically (∼13%). Cells with M124K CooA displayed aerobic effector-independent activity severalfold lower than did cells with M124R CooA, and cells with M124L, M124A, and M124I CooA were indistinguishable from those with WT CooA aerobically with slight differences anaerobically in the presence of CO (data not shown). To test whether M124R CooA was unique in its substantial activity under aerobic conditions, we mutagenically randomized the 124 position as we have done previously (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and screened for aerobic expression of β-galactosidase. Variants M124R, M124K, and M124I were repeatedly isolated, although quantitative analysis of strains with M124K and M124I showed only low activity aerobically indicating that only the Arg substitution at position 124 has a substantial effect. Interestingly, P2Y and P2H CooA, which have similar spectral features in the FeIII form to that of M124R CooA (see below), showed no aerobic activity and only slightly perturbed activity in the presence of CO (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is important to note that CooA is in large excess in these in vivo assays, so that levels of specific activity below that of WT can allow maximal reporter activity. The in vitro characterization (see below) allows the manipulation of CooA levels. To understand the biochemical basis for the “aerobically active” phenotype, we isolated M124R and M124K CooA using the procedures described above. Because M124R CooA consistently showed a higher amount of aerobic activity when compared with that of M124K CooA, we chose to extensively characterize M124R CooA. Neither M124R nor M124K CooA accumulated well in the E. coliexpression system (∼5–10% of WT CooA). Although the isolated material was ∼80% pure, the BCA protein assay combined with the heme assay revealed that our M124R CooA preparations contained only 0.2 hemes/dimer compared with 1.6 hemes/dimer for the isolated WT protein (21Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). M124R CooA was also unstable in dilute solutions but was stabilized by addition of glycerol to 5–10% (v/v). Diluting stock FeIII M124R CooA into a solution at pH 7.0 caused instantaneous precipitation, which is not seen in WT CooA. Therefore, all manipulations were carried out at pH 8.0 in the presence of 5% glycerol. Although we were still unable to isolate M124R CooA containing greater than 0.2 hemes/dimer, we will demonstrate in this study that the ability of M124R CooA to bind DNA is both redox- and CO-specific, which is consistent with heme dependence. To determine whether the FeIII M124R CooA activity was detectable in vitro, we tested isolated M124R and WT CooA in different redox states using the fluorescence polarization assay for CooA-DNA interactions. At saturating (40 µg/ml protein; 800 nm heme) concentrations of protein, FeIII WT CooA showed a basal value of anisotropy in this particular experiment (Fig. 2). Dithionite reduction to the FeII form had no effect in anisotropy, whereas addition of CO to the FeII WT CooA generated a large increase in the value of anisotropy as a result of CooA-DNA interaction. When an equivalent protein concentration (40 µg/ml protein; 80 nmheme) of FeIII M124R CooA in the FeIII form was added to the system, a large increase in the value of anisotropy was evident compared with FeIII WT CooA, indicating FeIII M124R CooA-DNA interaction. However, upon dithionite reduction to the FeII form, M124R CooA less effectively interacted with the DNA target. Finally, when CO was added to the sample, M124R CooA had an in vitro activity similar to that of WT CooA, indicating that with both FeII + CO samples the level of functional CooA had saturated the target DNA. These results indicate both a redox-dependent activity and a CO-dependent activity in M124R CooA. To address the heme concentration dependence of M124R CooA-DNA interactions, we measured the fluorescence polarization of samples that contained increasing amounts of M124R CooA on a heme basis (Fig.3). When based on heme-containing M124R CooA, FeIII M124R CooA (at pH 8.0) showed an increase in anisotropy reflecting a K D of ∼90 nm. This value is approximately 5 times greater than theK D for FeII + CO M124R CooA, which was ∼20 nm. In comparison, FeII + CO WT CooA has a K D of ∼10 nm (Fig. 3), which is a value similar to that found in a previous study (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CO-specific DNA binding of WT and M124R CooA to target DNA is roughly similar. The anisotropy value for FeII proteins was near baseline in this particular experiment but tended to increase at the higher concentrations used in this assay (data not shown) indicating the presence of nonspecific interactions at moderately high protein levels (for WT CooA, >500 nm heme = 25 µg/ml protein). To determine whether the active phenotype of M124R CooA is correlated with structural perturbations near the heme center, we examined isolated M124R CooA using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 4 A shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of FeIII M124R CooA compared with that of FeIII WT CooA. Significant spectral changes were observed in FeIII M124R CooA (Soret ∼387 nm with a strong ligand-to-metal charge transfer band ∼640 nm) when compared with that of FeIII WT CooA (Soret ∼424 nm with a very weak ligand-to-metal charge transfer band ∼650 nm) and are consistent with a high-spin, five-coordinate heme in FeIIIM124R CooA. In contrast, the spectra of the FeII (Fig.4 B) and FeII + CO (Fig. 4 C) forms of M124R CooA were indistinguishable from those of the FeIIand FeII + CO forms of WT CooA, indicating that only the FeIII form of M124R CooA is significantly perturbed by this substitution. The five-coordinate, high-spin spectral signature of FeIII M124R CooA was similar to that observed for FeIII P2Y CooA (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, at pH 7.4, there was a higher percentage of the five-coordinate form in FeIII M124R CooA than that observed in FeIII P2Y CooA (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that their heme environments are somewhat different at identical pH. In FeIII M124R CooA, the five-coordinate heme indicates that an open coordination should exist for exogenous ligands to bind. However, addition of cyanide, azide, or imidazole to ∼1000-fold molar excess produced no significant changes in the UV-visible absorption spectrum of FeIII M124R CooA (data not shown), suggesting either electrostatic repulsion of these ligands or a relatively inaccessible heme iron. This result is in contrast to that of FeIII P2Y CooA, which is also five-coordinate and high-spin yet binds imidazole albeit with a relatively low affinity (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The differential ability of FeIII M124R CooA and FeIII P2Y CooA to bind exogenous ligands implies significant differences in their respective heme environments (see below). Because the UV-visible absorption spectrum of FeIII P2Y CooA, which contains a fraction of five-coordinate, high-spin heme, exhibited a pH dependence (24Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we examined whether FeIII M124R CooA had similar behavior. The UV-visible absorption spectra of FeIII M124R CooA as a function of buffer pH are shown in Fig.5 A. At pH 8.0, FeIII M124R CooA exhibited spectral features that indicated a spin mix of the five-coordinate, high-spin form (Soret peak at 387 nm) and a shoulder at 423 nm, indicating the presence of the six-coordinate, low-spin form (contrast with Fig. 4 A at pH 7.4). Increasing the pH of the solution increased the fraction of the six-coordinate, low-spin form with a clear isosbestic point at ∼410 nm (Fig. 5 A). At pH 10.5, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of FeIII M124R CooA was essentially identical to that of FeIII WT CooA at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4 A). Fitting the ABS387 nm (the Soret maximum of the five-coordinate, high-spin form) to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation and assuming a single ionization gave a pK a of ∼9.0 (Fig.5 B). This result suggests that hydroxide may be the sixth ligand in six-coordinate, low-spin FeIII M124R CooA at strongly basic pH. Because FeIII M124R CooA undergoes a spectral transition with pH, we explored the possibility that the redox-mediated activity might also be influenced by pH. Fig. 5 B shows the change in anisotropy as a function of pH and indicates that at a more basic pH FeIII M124R CooA becomes less active and is essentially incapable of binding target DNA at pH 10.5. This result indicates that not only is the DNA-binding ability of FeIII M124R CooA redox-dependent, but it also exhibits a coordination-state correlation as well. The pK a of the transition for DNA binding activity was ∼8.9, which is essentially identical to that found in the spectral transition (Fig. 5 B). This result indicates that a five-coordinate, high-spin fraction of FeIII M124R CooA represents the species that is active in binding DNA. No pH-dependent effects (pH 8.0–10.5) were observed in the FeII M124R CooA (inactive) and FeII + CO M124R CooA (active) samples tested (data not shown). Under the same varied pH conditions, there was a slight decrease (∼10%) in the in vitro activity of FeII + CO WT CooA at the higher pH range (data not shown). EPR spectroscopy of FeIII M124R CooA corroborated the results of the UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. An increase in the pH of the solution resulted in a dramatic decrease in the intensity of high-spin forms of FeIII M124 R CooA and a concomitant increase in the intensity of the low-spin form (Fig.6). Inspection of the low-field region of the spectrum of FeIII M124R CooA revealed the presence of two distinct S = 5/2 systems. For the first spin system, analysis of the g values using a rhombogram computer program (32Pierik A.J. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for an S = 5/2 system with g = 2 indicates that the spectrum is composed of a system with theoretical g values of gz = 1.84 (assumed; see below), gy = 4.30, and gx = 7.53 (TableI) and are similar to those that are found in FeIII five-coordinate, high-spin thiolate-ligated hemes such as P-450cam (33Matsui T.S.

To clarify the mechanism of substrate recognition for the unique structure of the pyrrolidone ring, x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis were applied. The crystal structure of pyroglutamyl-peptidase bound to a transition state analog inhibitor (Inh), pyroglutaminal, was determined. Two hydrogen bonds were located between the main chain of the enzyme and the inhibitor (71:O···H-N:Inh and Gln71:N-H···OE:Inh), and the pyrrolidone ring of the inhibitor was inserted into the hydrophobic pocket composed of Phe-10, Phe-13, Thr-45, Ile-92, Phe-142, and Val-143. To study in detail the hydrophobic pocket, Phe-10, Phe-13, and Phe-142 were selected for mutation experiments. The<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> value of the F10Y mutant decreased, but the two phenylalanine mutants F13Y and F142Y did not exhibit significant changes in kinetic parameters compared with the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic efficiencies (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) for the F13A and F142A mutants were less than 1000-fold that of the wild-type enzyme. The x-ray crystallographic study of the F142A mutant showed no significant change except for a minor one in the hydrophobic pocket compared with the wild type. These findings indicate that the molecular recognition of pyroglutamic acid is achieved through two hydrogen bonds and an insertion in the hydrophobic pocket. In the pocket, Phe-10 is more important to the hydrophobic interaction than is Phe-142, and furthermore Phe-13 serves as an ""induced fit"" mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2083986322,"Despite the importance of the topoisomerase II DNA cleavage/rejoining cycle to genomic integrity, the mechanistic details of religation are poorly understood. Topoisomerase II utilizes covalent protein-DNA interactions to align the 5′-termini of cleaved DNA for religation. However, because the enzyme does not form covalent bonds with the 3′-DNA termini, the basis for the alignment of the 3′-ends is less clear. Three major possibilities exist. The 3′-termini may be positioned for religation (i) by base pairing to their complementary DNA strands, (ii) by base stacking to the adjacent residues, or (iii) by noncovalent interactions with topoisomerase II. To distinguish between these possibilities, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to religate a series of oligonucleotides with altered base pairing or base stacking at their 3′-termini was determined. Substrates containing modifications that disrupted terminal base pairing or base stacking with-out affecting the 3′-terminal base were resealed at wild-type rates. In contrast, substrates that lacked the terminal base (or contained an altered base) displayed very low rates of religation. On the basis of these results, we propose that topoisomerase II positions the 3′-DNA termini for religation through noncovalent protein-DNA contacts.

The ability to ligate DNA chains is essential to all forms of life (1Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 251-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Tomkinson A.E.

This activity is indispensable for nearly every process that the genetic material undergoes in the cell, including replication, recombination, and repair. Although not ligases in the “classic” sense, topoisomerases routinely join DNA chains as part of their fundamental cellular activities (4Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 5Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 6Osheroff, N. (ed) (1998) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1400.Google Scholar). To interconvert different topological states of DNA, type II topoisomerases pass a double helix through a transient double-stranded break that is generated in a separate nucleic acid segment (7Berger J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys.

If these enzymes do not successfully rejoin the double-stranded break, a number of deleterious events can occur including chromosomal insertions, deletions, and translocations (8Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar,10Baguley B.C. Ferguson L.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Because of the sensitivity of cells to the accumulation of these DNA breaks, the religation activity of topoisomerase II has been exploited as a target for cancer chemotherapy (8Burden D.A.

Despite the importance of the DNA religation reaction of topoisomerase II to the critical cellular functions and chemotherapeutic potential of the enzyme, the mechanistic details of this process are not completely understood. In contrast to ligases, topoisomerase II carries out its religation reaction within a covalent enzyme-DNA complex, known as the cleavage complex (see Fig. 1; Refs. 7Berger J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 9Wang J.C. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This complex is formed during the cleavage event so that the enzyme can maintain the integrity of the genetic material throughout the strand passage process. The bonds that link topoisomerase II to the DNA are established between active site tyrosyl residues on each subunit of the homodimeric enzyme and the 5′-terminal phosphates of the newly cleaved DNA strands (18Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the points of topoisomerase II-mediated scission on the two strands are staggered by four base pairs, each cleaved chain within the cleavage complex contains a four base single-stranded cohesive end at its 5′-terminus (see Fig. 1). In most cases, ligases rely heavily on base pairing to correctly position the DNA termini for ligation (21Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 22Prichard C.E. Southern E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the covalent attachment of topoisomerase II to the 5′-termini of its ligation substrate obviates the need for base pairing. In fact, human topoisomerase IIα is able to efficiently religate substrates that contain four consecutive abasic sites within the terminal cohesive ends (thus eliminating all base pairing) (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On this basis, it was proposed that the type II enzyme correctly positions the 5′-DNA termini for religation through covalent protein-DNA interactions (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The role of base pairing in the positioning of the 3′-DNA termini for religation is less clear. In contrast to the 5′-ends, the 3′-terminal residues remain base paired to their complementary strand following cleavage (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, type II topoisomerases do not form covalent attachments with the 3′-DNA ends (18Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, it is not obvious whether the 3′-termini are positioned for religation through base pairing. Alternatively, they may be aligned by base stacking interactions with adjacent residues or through specific noncovalent contacts with the enzyme. If the DNA cleavage/religation cycle of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases is to be fully understood, it is critical to determine how the enzyme positions the DNA termini for resealing. This issue takes on further importance because it is believed that many anticancer drugs that act by inhibiting topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation do so by displacing the 3′-DNA termini within the cleavage complex (24Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Freudenreich C.H. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, to address the mechanism by which the enzyme positions the 3′-DNA termini, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to religate a series of substrates with altered base pairing or base stacking at their 3′-termini was determined. Results indicate that enzyme-mediated DNA religation requires the presence of a 3′-terminal base, but does not require either terminal base pairing or base stacking. These findings suggest that topoisomerase II positions the 3′-DNA termini for religation through noncovalent protein-DNA contacts.

The sequences of the top and bottom strands were 5′-TGAAATCTAACAATG↓CGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGGTGCCGAGGATGACGATG↓AGCGCATTGTTAGATTTCA-3′, respectively. A second 40-base single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to residues 1072–1111 of the MLL oncogene (28Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A.

Points of topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage in both sequences are denoted by arrows. Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing a tetrahydrofuran abasic site analog or a deoxyuridine residue were prepared in a similar manner utilizing corresponding phosphoramidites obtained from Glen Research Corp. (Sterling, VA). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [32P]phosphate on their 5′-termini with T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified by electrophoresis in a 7 murea, 14% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by UV shadowing, excised, and eluted using the Qiagen extraction protocol. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by incubating equimolar amounts of each at 70 °C for 10 min and cooling to 25 °C (29Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Human topoisomerase IIα was expressed and purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (29Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). DNA cleavage was monitored as described previously (29Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 100 nm oligonucleotide in 19 μl of cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 2.5% glycerol) that contained 5 mmMgCl2. Cleavage was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of human topoisomerase IIα (225 nm final concentration). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min (unless stated otherwise) and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1.5 μl of 250 mm EDTA. DNA cleavage products were digested with proteinase K, precipitated with ethanol, and resolved by electrophoresis in 7 m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gels. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Levels of DNA cleavage were calculated relative to that obtained with the wild-type substrate. DNA religation assays were carried out using a modification of the procedure of Kingma and Osheroff (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described above in cleavage buffer containing 5 mmCaCl2. Kinetically competent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 6 mm). NaCl was added (final concentration, 500 mm) to prevent recleavage. Religation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (final concentration, 0.2 mm) and terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS at times up to 60 s. Alternatively, DNA cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described in the previous section in cleavage buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, and religation was initiated by transferring samples to 0 °C. Reactions were terminated as above. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis and analyzed as described above. The rate of DNA re-ligation was determined by quantifying the loss of cleaved DNA. Given the importance of topoisomerase II-generated DNA breaks to the physiological and pharmacological functions of the enzyme, it is critical to understand the mechanism by which topoisomerase II reseals these breaks. During its scission event, the enzyme forms covalent bonds with the newly generated 5′-DNA termini (18Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II utilizes these covalent interactions to align the 5′-termini of the breaks for religation (Fig. 1) (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme does not form covalent bonds with the 3′-DNA termini, the basis for the alignment of the 3′-ends within the cleavage complex is not apparent. Three major possibilities exist (Fig. 1). First, the 3′-termini may be positioned for religation by base pairing to their complementary DNA strands. In support of this possibility, the 3′-terminal residues are located within the duplex portion of the cleaved helix following scission (18Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the 3′-termini may be positioned for religation by base stacking to their adjacent residues. In some cases, the energies of base stacking interactions approach those of base pairing (31Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 137-140Google Scholar). Third, the 3′-termini may be positioned by noncovalent interactions with topoisomerase II. This possibility is consistent with modeling studies (based on the crystal structure of yeast topoisomerase II) and mutagenesis experiments, which suggest that there are interactions between specific amino acids and the 3′-termini generated by cleavage (32Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 33Liu Q. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the above, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to religate a series of oligonucleotide substrates with altered base pairing or base stacking at their 3′-DNA termini was determined. The strategy underlying these religation experiments is as follows. If the 3′-DNA termini are positioned primarily by base pairing or base stacking, any modification that disrupts these interactions should significantly decrease the rate of religation mediated by topoisomerase II. In contrast, if the 3′-DNA termini are positioned primarily by noncovalent interactions between the enzyme and the terminal base, only modifications that remove or alter this base should inhibit religation. Modifications that disrupt base pairing or base stacking without affecting the 3′-terminal base should have marginal, if any, effects. The initial sequence utilized for cleavage and religation studies was a double-stranded 40-mer derived from plasmid pBR322 (18Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence contained a single strong cleavage site for topoisomerase II. The central portion of the oligonucleotide (with points of cleavage denoted by arrows) is shown in Fig.2. The nucleotide at the −1 position relative to the point of cleavage becomes the 3′-terminal residue following scission. The nucleotide at the +5 position on the opposite strand is the residue that base pairs with the 3′-terminal base. To disrupt base pairing of the 3′-terminus without precluding protein interactions with the terminal base, an abasic site or a mismatched base was placed at the +5 position of the oligonucleotide. To disrupt both base pairing and potential protein interactions with the 3′-terminal base, an abasic site or a mismatched base was placed at the −1 position. As a prelude to religation studies, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cleave the modified oligonucleotide substrates was examined (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous studies (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the incorporation of an abasic site or a base mismatch immediately outside the points of DNA cleavage decreased equilibrium levels of scission (Fig. 2). However, even in the most dramatic case (−1 AP), levels of scission were still high enough to reproducibly monitor rates of religation. Fig. 3 depicts religation mediated by human topoisomerase IIα for the top and bottom strands (left and right panels, respectively) of the pBR322 oligonucleotide substrate. Similar results were obtained for both strands. In all cases, rates of religation for oligonucleotides modified at the +5 position (either abasic sites or uracil mismatches) were comparable to or faster than that of wild-type. This finding indicates that base pairing is not used to align the 3′-termini for religation. In marked contrast to the results observed with the +5 modifications, the placement of an abasic site at the −1 position dramatically decreased the rate of religation. The presence of a uracil at the −1 position (which still allows base stacking (35SantaLucia Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 36Xia T. SantaLucia Jr., J. Burkard M.E. Kierzek R. Schroeder S.J. Jiao X. Cox C. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14719-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) but has the potential to alter protein-DNA interactions) also diminished the religation rate, albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with substrates that lacked a −1 base. Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of the base at the −1 position is critical to the alignment of the 3′-DNA termini. However, they cannot distinguish whether the termini are positioned by base stacking interactions or by noncovalent topoisomerase II-DNA interactions. The experiments described above have one potential caveat. Because the initial amount of scission observed with the −1 abasic site oligonucleotides was low (∼10% of that for the wild-type substrate), it is possible that religation of these modified oligonucleotides does not completely reflect the capabilities of the type II enzyme. Therefore, a second abasic site was incorporated into the pBR322 substrate to increase the starting level of DNA cleavage. This second lesion was located within the 4-base cleavage overhang at the +2 position (Fig. 4). Previous work indicates that the incorporation of abasic sites between the points of cleavage stimulates topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission without affecting rates of religation (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4, following the inclusion of a +2 lesion in the top strand, levels of cleavage of the −1 abasic site oligonucleotide approached that of wild-type. Cleavage of a comparable +5,+2 bottom strand abasic substrate exceeded that of the unmodified substrate. Similar to results obtained with the single lesion substrates, the oligonucleotide that eliminated base pairing without removing the 3′-terminal base (i.e. the +5,+2 abasic substrate) displayed wild-type rates of religation (Fig.4). 1For all oligonucleotides that contained dual abasic lesions, rates of religation were determined for corresponding substrates that contained single +2 abasic sites (pBR322 sequences) or +4 abasic sites (MLL sequences). In all cases, rates were comparable with those of the wild-type oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the ability of topoisomerase II to religate the oligonucleotide that eliminated potential base stacking or protein interactions with the 3′-terminal base (i.e. the −1,+2 substrate) was severely inhibited (Fig. 4). 2The DNA religation assays used for these experiments were based on trapping a kinetically competent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex formed in the presence of CaCl2. Comparable results were obtained in parallel experiments that established DNA cleavage/re-ligation equilibria in the presence of MgCl2 and induced religation by lowering the reaction temperature to 0 °C. To confirm the results found with the pBR322 substrate, cleavage and religation of a second oligonucleotide was characterized (Fig.5). This second substrate was derived from a region of the MLL oncogene located proximal to a leukemic breakpoint at chromosomal band 11q23 (28Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Once again, oligonucleotides included two abasic sites to avoid potential problems associated with the poor cleavage of single lesion substrates. Cleavage levels of both the +5,+2 and −1,+4 dual abasic oligonucleotides exceeded that of wild-type (Fig. 5). As above, religation of the 3′-DNA terminus appeared to be unaffected by the loss of base pairing in the +5,+2 abasic substrate. However, religation was drastically impaired when the 3′-base was absent in the −1,+4 abasic substrate (Fig. 5). Similar results were observed for the top strand 3′-terminus when corresponding +5,+2 and −1,+4 oligonucleotides were employed (not shown). The above experiments provide strong evidence that the 3′-terminal base is important for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation. However, the poor rates of religation observed for substrates that lacked this base were determined under conditions in which topoisomerase II catalyzed a unidirectional rejoining event. Therefore, an “approach to equilibrium” experiment was carried out to determine whether the lack of a 3′-terminal base also impairs religation under conditions in which topoisomerase II catalyzes a complete DNA cleavage/religation cycle. The time required for topoisomerase II to reach its cleavage/religation equilibrium reflects both the rates of cleavage and religation. Under normal conditions, the rate of religation appears to be limiting (37Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the loss of the 3′-terminal base inhibits DNA religation, the time it takes for the enzyme to establish a DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium should be considerably longer than required for the comparable wild-type substrate. As seen in Fig.6, human topoisomerase IIα establishes an equilibrium with the wild-type pBR322 oligonucleotide within 2 min. A similar time to establish equilibrium was observed for the +5,+2 abasic pBR322 oligonucleotide, which disrupts base pairing without removing the 3′-terminal base and displays wild-type rates of religation (Fig. 4). In contrast, when the −1,+2 abasic oligonucleotide (which eliminates the 3′-terminal base and displays dramatically lower rates of religation (Fig. 4)) was employed, the enzyme had yet to reach equilibrium by 20 min. This finding supports the conclusion that the elimination of the 3′-terminal base impairs the religation activity of topoisomerase II. The above results establish the importance of the 3′-terminal base in topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation and rule out the requirement for terminal base pairing in this process. However, they do not address the potential contributions of base stacking or protein-DNA interactions in aligning the 3′-terminal residue for religation. A prominent role for base stacking seems unlikely, because all of the cleavage substrates used in the present study contain terminal thymine-guanine sequences. Of the possible nearest neighbors in DNA, thymine-guanine steps exhibit one of the weaker base stacking energies (31Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 137-140Google Scholar, 35SantaLucia Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). The above notwithstanding, an additional religation experiment was carried out to determine directly whether the 3′-DNA terminus is aligned for topoisomerase II-mediated re-ligation by base stacking interactions. This experiment utilized an oligonucleotide substrate that replaced the thymine at the −2 position with an abasic site. This substitution eliminates base stacking between the 3′-terminal residue and its nearest neighbor, but preserves terminal base pairing and potential interactions with the enzyme. As seen in Fig. 7, human topoisomerase IIα cleaved the −2 abasic substrate with an efficiency that was similar to that of wild-type. Rates of DNA religation observed for the abasic oligonucleotide also were comparable with the unmodified sequence. This finding argues strongly against an important role for base stacking in aligning the 3′-DNA termini for religation. In conclusion, the DNA religation activity of topoisomerase II is critical to its physiological functions and its role as a target for anticancer agents (4Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 5Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 6Osheroff, N.

Yet, the mechanism of this process is not completely understood. A previous study demonstrated that the enzyme utilizes covalent protein-DNA interactions to align the 5′-DNA termini for religation (23Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, because topoisomerase II does not form covalent bonds with the 3′-termini, it was not clear how these unattached ends are positioned correctly for DNA religation. The present work indicates that efficient religation requires the presence of the 3′-terminal base. The proper alignment of this base does not depend on either interstrand base pairing or intrastrand base stacking interactions. Based on these findings, we propose that the 3′-termini are properly positioned for DNA religation by noncovalent contacts between topoisomerase II and the terminal base. We thank to Dr. P. S. Kingma for helpful discussions and to Dr. J. M. Fortune and K. D. Bromberg for critical reading of the manuscript."

The majority of bacterial monoaminopeptidases are intracellular or membrane-bound metalloenzymes (1Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on substrate specificity, bacterial monoaminopeptidases can be divided into two basic categories, specific aminopeptidases, which release only a limited number of amino acids, and those that are able to liberate a relatively broad spectrum of N-terminal amino acid residues (1Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proline and glycine are among the most difficult residues for aminopeptidases to hydrolyze because of their unique structures. Proline is unusual because of its cyclic structure, and glycine is identified by the lack of a side chain. Nature has developed a family of enzymes that recognize proline exclusively (4Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A monoaminopeptidase that preferentially releases glycine with high efficiency has not yet been described and thus would be of high interest. In this report we describe a novel extracellular monoaminopeptidase from Sphingomonas capsulata. This enzyme has a clear preference for N-terminal glycine and alanine. Because of this characteristic, this monoaminopeptidase has the potential to significantly enhance the degree of protein hydrolysis (5Adler-Nissen J. Enzymic hydrolysis of food proteins.

Finally, the concentrated sample was loaded onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech phenyl Superose 5/5 pre-packed 7 × 50-mm column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4. Protein with aminopeptidase activity was then eluted with a 30-ml gradient from 0.5 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Fractions containing aminopeptidase activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then pooled. A culture broth was grown in a 500-ml shake flask under the conditions described above. A sample was centrifuged, and the whole cells were separated from the supernatant. The harvested cells were then resuspended in 40 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, which contained 1 mg/ml of lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100, and stirred for 2 h. The resulting sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transblotting were performed according to the Novex instruction manual. Stained protein bands were excised and sequenced following the instruction manual from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Data were collected and analyzed on a Macintosh IIsi using Applied Biosystems 610 Data Analysis Software. To generate peptide fragments of the enzyme to obtain internal sequences, the protein was cleaved with cyanogen bromide by reconstituting a dried sample of the purified protein in 70% formic acid with a few crystals of cyanogen bromide and incubating for 18 h at room temperature in the dark. The peptide fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a 10–20% Novex Tricine gel and sequenced as described above. To generate additional peptide fragments, the purified aminopeptidase was digested using endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease). A 200-μg sample of purified aminopeptidase was equilibrated in 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, to a final volume of 60 μl, and 7.5 μl of 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, containing 2.5% w/v of SDS was added. The sample was boiled for 2 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Then 10 μl of a 400 μg/ml solution of endoproteinase Glu-C was added, and the resulting sample was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. To this solution, 45 μl of Novex 2× Tricine sample buffer was added. The peptide fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a 10–20% Novex Tricine gel and sequenced as described above. The metal content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with an HGA-400 graphite furnace. Each measurement was performed in triplicate. The concentration was determined by running a standard curve of known metal concentration. Aminopeptidase activity was monitored using Ala-pNA as the substrate. A stock solution of 100 mg/ml Ala-pNA in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The reaction of the aminopeptidase with the para-nitroanilide was initiated when a 10–50-μl aliquot of the enzyme solution was added to 200 μl of the substrate solution in a microtiter plate well. Initial rates of hydrolysis of thepara-nitroanilide were monitored at 405 nm at room temperature using a THERMOmax microplate reader. Stock solutions of para-nitroanilides of various amino acids in dimethyl sulfoxide (100 mg/ml) were diluted with 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, to concentrations of 2 mg/ml. Where the substrates were incompletely soluble, their suspensions were used. The reaction of theS. capsulata aminopeptidase with eachpara-nitroanilide was initiated when an aliquot (10-μl) of the enzyme solution in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, was added to 190 μl of a substrate solution in a 96-well microtiter plate. Hydrolysis of the para-nitroanilides was monitored at 405 nm and 25 °C. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pentapeptides (see structures in Table II) was performed at pH 7.5 in 50 mm MOPS buffer at 21 °C. Concentrations of the peptides in the incubation mixtures were between 1.10 and 1.14 mm. To stop the reactions, 50-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture were mixed with 50 μl of 0.1 mHCl. The resulting samples were analyzed for free amino acids by reverse-phase HPLC (6Heinrikson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the peptide solutions were determined using an extinction coefficient of 1440m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for the tyrosine residue.Table IISubstrate specificity of recombinant S. capsulata aminopeptidase expressed in Bacillus subtilis toward XAPYK-amide pentapeptidesX ofXAPYK-amideTurnoveraTurnover was calculated based on an initial velocity of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the pentapeptides and is not equivalent to kcat in this case.

Open table in a new tab For conditions, see “Experimental Procedures”. The aminopeptidase was incubated for 2.5 h in 50 mmMOPS buffer, pH 7.5, that contained no inhibitor, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm o-phenanthroline, or 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following the incubation, the enzyme samples were assayed using Ala-pNA as described above. An aliquot (20-μl) of a stock solution of Ala-pNA in dimethyl sulfoxide (100 mg/ml) was diluted with 980-μl aliquots of sodium acetate-Tris-HCl buffer (0.125 m) that had different pH values between 5.0 and 8.5. The resulting pH value of the substrate solutions was measured. A stock solution (0.05 mg/ml)of the aminopeptidase in 50 mm phosphate buffer was diluted 5-fold by 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture contained 200 μl of the substrate solution and 10 μl of an enzyme solution at room temperature. An aliquot (970-μl) of 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, was incubated for 15 min at the chosen temperature, which was maintained using a thermojacket (Shimadzu cell positioner CPS-240A) of the spectrophotometer. Then, 30 μl of 100 mg/ml Ala-pNA in Me2SO was added. The reaction was initiated by adding 7 μl of enzyme solution. Initial velocities were monitored over a 2-min period at 405 nm. An enzyme aliquot (10-μl) was added to 190 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, which had been preincubated for 30 min at the chosen temperature. The sample was placed on ice after a 20-min incubation. The samples were then assayed at room temperature following the protocol shown above. Leucine enkephalin was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Enzymatic hydrolysis was initiated by 8.3 μg of S. capsulata aminopeptidase. After incubation at room temperature (21 °C), aliquots of the incubation mixture were added to 0.1n HCl to terminate the reaction. The free amino acids of the sample were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (6Heinrikson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from S. capsulata IFO 12533 using a Qiagen Tip-500 column as per the manufacturer's instructions (7Sloma, A. P., Outtrup, H., Dambmann, C., and Aaslyng, D. (April 22, 1997) U. S. Patent 5622850.Google Scholar). The library was constructed by ligating Sau 3A partially digested (5–7-kilobase) S. capsulata IFO 12533 chromosomal DNA into the BamHI sites of the vector pSJ1678 (8Sloma, A. P., Sternberg, D. C., Adams, L. F., and Brown, S. H. (September 28, 1999) U. S. Patent 5958728.Google Scholar) (Fig.1) and transformed into Escherichia coli XL1 Blue MR supercompetent cells (Stratagene, Inc.). The following primers were synthesized based on amino acid sequence data obtained from peptide fragments obtained following cyanogen bromide and V8 protease digestion of the purified aminopeptidase. Forward primer, 5′-GCRTCRTANGCRTCNCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACYTTYTCRTCYTTRTC-3′ (R = A or G, Y= C or T, N = A or G or C or T). Amplification reactions were prepared in a 50-μl volume with 50 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 1 μg of S. capsulata IFO 12533 chromosomal DNA as template, 1× polymerase chain reaction buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 200 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 0.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were incubated in a Stratagene Robocycler 40 (Stratagene) programmed for 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles each at 95 °C for 1 min, 44 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting product of ∼190 base pairs was cloned into vector pCR2.1/TOPO as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Inc.). The genomicS. capsulata IFO 12533 library was screened by colony hybridization using a polymerase chain reaction-generated probe with the Genius chemiluminescent system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing of two aminopeptidase-containing clones, pMRT004.1–7 and pMRT004.1–14, was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) on both strands using (a) the Primer Island Transposition method (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions and (b) the primer walking technique using dye-terminator chemistry (9Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequencing primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. The aminopeptidase was obtained from the supernatant of S. capsulata IFO 12533. Periplasmic extraction of the whole cells was also performed, but the enzyme was not present in the extract. It is evident from this result that the S. capsulataaminopeptidase is a secreted enzyme. The purification led to a protein that migrated as a single band of 66 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2) A specific activity of 105 units/mg was determined for Ala-pNA under the condition described above, assuming that the A280 of a 1 mg/ml solution of the aminopeptidase is 1.89. The theoretical extinction coefficient of the enzyme was calculated based on the deduced protein sequence (10Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). We were able to determine the kinetic parameters for Ala-pNA (kcat = 7600 ± 850 min−1, andKm = 14 ± 2 mm) and alanine β-naphthylamide (kcat = 860 ± 90 min−1, and Km = 6.7 ± 1.1 mm). However, the kinetic parameters for the other amino acid para-nitroanilides and β-naphthylamides could not be accurately measured. This can be attributed to a combination of largeKm values, as well as poor solubility of the synthetic substrates. In terms of relative activity, the S. capsulata aminopeptidase preferably hydrolyzes alaninepara-nitroanilide. It also demonstrates high efficacy onpara-nitroanilides of leucine, methionine, glycine, and aspartic and glutamic acids (TableI).Table IRelative activity of the aminopeptidase with para-nitroanilides of different amino acidsAmino acidpara-nitroanilideRelative activity%Ala100Leu27Met24Gly14Asp14GluaSolubility ofpara-nitroanilides of glutamate and phenylalanine is lower than 7.7 mm.

The lower estimation of turnover numbers of the S. capsulataaminopeptidase on a series of pentapeptide amides with different N-terminal amino acids are shown in TableII. The enzyme exhibited the highest “turnover” on the pentapeptide amide with N-terminal glycine, followed by alanine, leucine, glutamate, and proline. A study of the hydrolysis of several natural peptides, catalyzed by theS. capsulata aminopeptidase, revealed that the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing a variety of peptide bonds. Among the bonds most readily hydrolyzed was a Gly-Gly bond (TableIII). This is very unusual. The Gly-Gly bond is extremely resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis, probably because of a lack of side chain groups on both the N-terminal and penultimate amino acids. The S. capsulata aminopeptidase also hydrolyzed the peptides YAGFL and EALELARGAIFQA-amide with obvious “bottlenecks” at phenylalanine (data not shown). It is important to stress that it also releases N-terminal proline (Table II). This aminopeptidase, meanwhile, does not split off N-terminal amino acids with a penultimate proline and thus possesses no proline aminopeptidase activity.Table IIITime release of N-terminal amino acids from leucine enkephalin (2.50 nmol) by recombinant S. capsulata aminopeptidase expressed in B. subtilisSubstrateReleased amino acidAmount of released amino acid (nmol) after incubation00.51.03.0hLeucine enkephalinaThe sequence of leucine enkephalin is Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu.Tyr02.462.462.46Gly04.045.104.70Phe00.080.100.47Leu00.110.090.43For the specific conditions, see “Physicochemical Characterization.”a The sequence of leucine enkephalin is Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu. Open table in a new tab For the specific conditions, see “Physicochemical Characterization.” Only o-phenanthroline demonstrated an inhibitory effect among the class-specific inhibitors tested. In this case, the residual activity was found to be 4% of the initial. Neither EDTA nor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride influenced the performance of the enzyme. Certain inorganic anions that form salts with zinc of low solubility were found to have inhibitory properties. Among the compounds examined were phosphate, ferrocyanide, and iodate. The Kivalues for these ions were determined to be 3.0, 4.2, and 11 mm, respectively. There is a direct correlation between theKi value and the solubility product of the particular anion with zinc. A plot of the relative activity of S. capsulataaminopeptidase in the hydrolysis of Ala-pNA gave a typical bell-shaped pH dependence with a sharp optimum at pH 7.2–7.4. An incubation of the enzyme for 20 min at 45 and 50 °C led to losses of 40 and 100% activity, respectively. The optimal temperature for the activity was determined to be 43 °C. The N-terminal sequence of the 66-kDa homogeneous protein was determined to be blocked. Digestion of the protein with cyanogen bromide resulted in fragments with molecular masses of 42, 30, 17, 15, 10, 6, and 4 kDa. The N-terminal sequence of the 10-kDa fragment was determined to be AVNGDAYDADKLKGAITNAKTGNPGAGRPI. The N-terminal sequences of the other bands were inconclusive. The digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C resulted in the generation of peptides with molecular masses of 40, 30, 25, 22, 20, 17, 10, 6, 5, and 4 kDa. The sequence FKDEPNPYDKARMADAKVLSLFNSLGVTLDKDGKV was obtained from the 22- and 17-kDa peptide fragments. The other bands were either not sequenced, or the results were inconclusive. The obtained protein sequences did not demonstrate homology to any known aminopeptidases. Screening of the S. capsulata IFO 12533 genomic library produced five colonies that exhibited strong hybridization signals with the probe. Two plasmids carrying the aminopeptidase gene were sequenced, and one was confirmed to contain the entire aminopeptidase gene. Sequence analysis of the plasmid containing the aminopeptidase gene revealed an open reading frame of 2010 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 670 amino acids. The G+C content of this open reading frame was 65%. Based on the rules of von Heijne (11von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), the first 32 amino acids likely comprise a secretory signal peptide that directs the nascent polypeptide into the periplasm. The calculated molecular mass of the primary translation product determined from the deduced amino acid sequence of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase was 70.6 kDa, which is consistent with the estimation of 66 kDa based on the mobility of the purified protein on SDS-PAGE. The zinc binding motif HEXXH, which is present in a number of metallopeptidase families (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), was identified in the primary sequence (Fig. 3). A BLAST search of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase against known data bases (EBI, Swiss-Prot, GenBankTM, and GENESEQ) revealed no significant homology to any known aminopeptidases. The highest percent identity (23%) was observed with a hypothetical 67-kDa protein fromSynechocystis sp. The presence of one atom of zinc per enzyme molecule was detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy. This method also indicated four iron atoms per enzyme molecule in a homogeneous preparation of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase. There were no detectable levels of cobalt or calcium. Bacteria hydrolyze different proteins to acquire essential amino acids from the pool of free amino acids and peptides. Certain organisms, such as the nutritionally fastidious Lactococcus lactis, apply a non-direct mechanism and employ a cascade of endo- and exopeptidases to release N-terminal glycine (1Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tan P.S.T. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Others, such as Xanthomonas citri, have developed a more rational method, producing aminopeptidases with broad substrate specificity (14Osada H. Isono K. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that S. capsulata secretes a unique enzyme that preferably liberates N-terminal glycine. Because of a combination of large Km values for bothpara-nitroanilides and β-naphthylamides coinciding with low solubilities for these compounds, it is impossible to carry out a comprehensive study of the substrate specificity of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase utilizing kinetic data for these artificial substrates. Nonetheless, a few remarks can be made. This enzyme apparently discriminates similar amino acids effectively releasing leucine but not isoleucine or valine (Table I); results for alanine para-nitroanilide and β-naphthylamide unequivocally show that the structure of the leaving group for a substrate affects both kcat andKm. Taking this into account and expecting that the substrate preference of an aminopeptidase toward derivatives of amino acids, such as para-nitroanilides, and natural peptides can be substantially different (15Blinkovsky A.M. Byun T. Brown K.M. Golightly E.J. Klotz A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the study of the hydrolysis of non-protected peptides catalyzed by the S. capsulataaminopeptidase was warranted. Comparative analysis of the Pro-pNA and Pro-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Lys-amide highlights the misleading role of thepara-nitroanilide group. Apparently, it hinders the binding of at least some amino acid residues, for example proline, by the enzyme. More importantly, the S. capsulata aminopeptidase demonstrates an unusual substrate pattern with the order of preference Gly > Ala > Leu in terms of relative activity (Table II). A plausible explanation for these features could be a catalytic pocket that is not deep and exhibits very limited flexibility. Leucine aminopeptidases are widely distributed in bacteria (1Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normally they are completely passive toward glycine (16Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are a few bacterial aminopeptidases described in the literature that demonstrate a reasonable ability to release alanine. The alanine-specific aminopeptidase N from E. coli (17Chappelet-Tordo D. Lazdunski C. Murgier M. Lazdunski A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 299-305Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was not shown to release N-terminal glycine. The bimolecular constant for the thiol aminopeptidase from X. citri was almost 40-fold greater for alanine β-naphthylamide in comparison to glycine β-naphthylamide (14Osada H. Isono K. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is highly unlikely that this enzyme is capable of cleaving a Gly-Gly bond. Aminopeptidase from S. capsulata occupies a unique niche among bacterial proteases. This is the first reported enzyme that hydrolyzes natural peptides with bimolecular constant values that are similar for glycine and alanine or probably even higher for glycine. This extraordinary substrate preference is undoubtedly exhibited in the hydrolysis of leucine enkephalin catalyzed by the S. capsulata aminopeptidase (Table III). A quick and complete release of tyrosine and both glycine residues from this peptide was observed after a 1-h reaction, yet the Phe-Leu bond was nearly untouched. This clearly demonstrates the substantially higher catalytic efficacy of this enzyme for amino acids with small, rather than large, side chains. A high kcat value, at least 5400 min−1, for releasing glycine is also uncommon. Another interesting feature of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase is that, for an unknown reason, it is able to distinguish between similar amino acid residues, like tyrosine and phenylalanine, in the case of non-protected peptides (Table III). Metalloaminopeptidases are predominant in bacteria (1Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are several indirect indications that this is a zinc metalloenzyme. First, effective inhibition of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase byo-phenanthroline, but not by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, was observed. The enzyme is also inhibited by certain anions, whose zinc salts have low solubility product value. We assume that EDTA, another strong chelator of transition metals, shows practically no inhibitory effect because of its voluminous structure and polyanionic nature resulting in its inability to penetrate close enough to the zinc of the catalytic site. A neutral pH optimum (18Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Feeman and Company, New York1985: 405Google Scholar) for the S. capsulataaminopeptidase and a putative zinc binding domain HEXXH (15Blinkovsky A.M. Byun T. Brown K.M. Golightly E.J. Klotz A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in its amino acid sequence are both indications of a zinc metalloenzyme. Atomic absorption spectroscopy confirms the presence of one atom of zinc per molecule of enzyme. In addition, four atoms of iron were also detected. A plausible explanation might be nonspecific binding of this metal to the protein molecule. The results that have been presented prove the scientific novelty of the S. capsulata aminopeptidase. We believe that this enzyme will receive significant attention from the food industry, as well. It has an “industrial” pH optimum, high specific activity, and great performance in releasing alanine and glycine, two amino acids that give considerably strong sweetness (19Nishimura T. Kato H. Food Rev. Int. 1988; 4: 175-194Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar), in natural peptides. We thank Amy Palmer from the Department of Chemistry, Stanford University for providing atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2117064983,"The human TR2 orphan receptor (TR2), initially isolated from testis and prostate cDNA libraries, is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily. TR2 can regulate several target genes via binding to a consensus response element (AGGTCA) in direct repeat orientation (AGGTCA<i>X</i> <sub>(n)</sub>AGGTCA, n=0–6). Here we show that TR2 is able to induce the expression of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) genes via binding to a DR4 response element in the long control region of HPV-16. Additionally, one of the HPV-16 gene products, the E6 oncogene, regulates TR2 gene expression. A likely mechanism for this regulation involves E6-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, a protein known to suppress TR2 expression. Together our data provide evidence for feedback regulation between TR2 and HPV-16, which represents a novel regulatory pathway involving a member of the steroid receptor superfamily and the HPV-16 DNA tumor virus."
