https://openalex.org/W1987584970,"CURRENT views on the structure of keratin, myosin and related proteins are based on chemical analyses and on X-ray diffraction data. The X-ray evidence (Astbury and Street1 ) shows that these proteins may exist in either of two forms, α and β, each of which shows a characteristic X-ray diffraction photograph. The most intense meridian reflexion corresponds to a chain spacing in the α-form Of about 5·1 A., while in the β-form the chain spacing is about 3·3 A. Since it is possible, after suitable softening treatment, to change a natural protein in the α-form to the β-form by stretching or squeezing, it is generally assumed that the poly-pentide chains in the α-form are folded in some way, whereas the β-form corresponds to the extended chain. Astbury2 has proposed a particular form of folding for α-keratin ; Huggins3, Wrinch4, and Wrinch and Jordan Lloyd5 have suggested a number of other possibilities. In an interesting recent paper by Astbury, Dalgleish, Darmon and Sutherland6 the properties of some synthetic polypeptides and natural proteins have been discussed, both from the point of view of X-ray diffraction and infra-red absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2065823001,"THE adsorption of a water-soluble surface-active agent at a solution – air interface has been measured by taking unique advantage of the soft beta radiation from the radioactive isotope of sulphur, S35. The method depends upon the fact that, because of 'self-absorption' of the radiation by the solution, the amount of radiation escaping from a solution of a compound containing this isotope comes principally from that fraction of the sulphur which is near the surface. Since the molecules of a surface-active agent are preferentially adsorbed at the interface, the radioactivity above a solution containing such an agent labelled with radiosulphur should be higher than the activity from a solution (for example, of sodium sulphate) in which no surface adsorption occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1968446719,"THE intensely toxic action of the rat poison sodium fluoroacetate (CH2F.COONa) upon the central nervous system and heart is of special interest because of the stability of the carbon – fluorine link. Bartlett and Barron1 have suggested that it competes with acetate ion in intermediary metabolism, and Saunders2 and colleagues that larger chain compounds of this type must be convertible to CH2F.CO to show toxicity. Recently Liébecq and Peters3,4, using centrifuged guinea pig kidney homogenates, have found that the oxidation of citrate formed from fumarate is inhibited by fluoroacetate. They have proposed the further hypothesis that this poison is metabolized like acetate and enters the tricarboxylic cycle, eventually 'jamming' this and causing accumulation of citrate."

So far, however, the use of pulsed sources of high-energy electrons for generating neutrons through the (γ, n) reaction has not been reported. Experiments reported in the following letter show that the X-rays from a 3- or 4-MeV. linear accelerator will produce useful intensities of neutrons from a beryllium target."

https://openalex.org/W2002621797,"Khamsavi and Donaldson1 have described an interferometric method for the measurement of the apparent thicknesses of thin metallic films (200–700 A. in thickness). The method described was essentially that due to Wiener2, modified to bring in the advantages of the sharp interference fringes obtained when multiple-beam interferometry is used3. An opaque reflecting layer is deposited over the edge of the film to be measured, and the step in this layer is measured by using it as one surface of an interferometer, and viewing this in reflexion using either fringes of equal thickness or fringes of equal chromatic order. By combining these thickness measurements with colorimetric determinations of the mass deposited upon a given area, they showed that the density of the film appeared to remain constant and equal to that of the bulk metal (silver) down to quite small thicknesses (122 A.)."

https://openalex.org/W1979499561,"IF, in a dust sample intended for microscopic examination, the number of particles per unit area were too large, some of the particles would overlap. Such 'clumps' would be counted as single particles instead of two, three or more, and the total count would be too low. The following analysis gives an indication of the magnitude of this effect. We shall assume that the particles may be regarded as circular laminæ of diameter d, and that their centres are distributed randomly over an area A . If the particles were of highly irregular shape and size, the present results might be invalid."

https://openalex.org/W2063941231,"THE inelastic scattering of protons by some light elements has been investigated experimentally, using 4·5-MeV. Protons from the Cambridge cyclotron. The enengy spectrum of the scattered protons was determined by using a proportional counter in conjunction with absorbing foils. The experimental arrangement was similar to that used by Dicke and Marshall1, except that provision was made for observation of the scattered protons at angles betwafen 20° and 160° at 10° intervals. Only proton groups corresponding to excited states less than 2·9 MeV. above the ground-state were able to reach the counter. The resolving power was improved by a factor of four over that obtained by Dicke and Marshall by the simple expedient of rotating the scattering foil through 90° from the position adopted by them, which minimizes the effect of target thickness. Under these conditions the resolving power was about 250 keV. for inelastic groups of equal amplitude."

https://openalex.org/W2054034634,"AT temperatures above 300° C. the reaction of oxygen with methane or ethylene shows the induction period and exponential development of the reaction rate with time, which are two of the characteristics of chain reactions that proceed by degenerate branching, that is, reactions in which the chains are initiated by the subsequent reaction of a fairly stable intermediate produced in the primary reaction process. To substantiate this hypothesis, it is clearly important to discover the nature of the intermediate by which the chains characteristic of degenerate branching are initiated."
https://openalex.org/W2076332171,"IN nematode parasites the anaerobic breakdown of glycogen to pyruvate and lactate with a consequent formation of adenosine triphosphate follows a course similar to that in vertebrate muscle1. Since it appears that aerobic mechanisms may play an important part in the metabolism of certain nematode parasites2, studies on the carbohydrate metabolism of the parasites have been extended to include some aspects of the oxidative utilization of pyruvate. The organisms used were Ascaridia galli from the chicken small intestine and Nematodirus spathiger and N. filicollis from the sheep small intestine. Some experiments were also carried out with Neoaplectana glaseri, a parasite of the Japanese beetle, which, however, was grown in vitro for the present experiments. Owing to its relatively large size and its position in the host, A. galli may not have an active aerobic metabolism in vivo. However, it has been shown that Nematodirus spp. probably respire actively in vivo, and oxygen is essential for the survival in vitro of Neoaplectana glaseri."

Recently, Larionow and Brumberg1 suggested, on the basis of ultra-violet light photomicrographic studies, that desoxyribonucleic acid, as it exists in the nuclei of living cells, does not absorb ultra-violet light of wave-lengths near 2600 A. These investigators contended that absorption develops as a result of injury or death of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2075586759,"SINCE the introduction of Fisher's theory and notation1 of the Rh blood-group system, the tendency has been to express phenotypes in terms of the probable genotype. This method is most convenient for European populations, where every common phenotype consists very largely of a single genotype ; but its extension to non-European populations usually involves serious ambiguities. In this and other connexions, there is an undoubted need for an unambiguous and generally understood phenotype notation expressed in Fisher's symbols, which would be available to supplement current practices. Several attempts have been made to express phenotypes with the use of these symbols, probably the earliest being that of Bushby2. The present proposals closely resemble those of Bushby ; but allowance is here made for the fact that the six typing sera (anti-C, D, E, c, d, e) are not usually all available as Bushby tacitly assumes. No originality is claimed for these proposals ; it is probable that other workers have thought of and used them independently ; and, in fact, when recently I was discussing an Rh problem with Dr. M. Bessis of Paris, we found that we had both for some time been using this system in working out Rh problems."

https://openalex.org/W2078948866,"THE slow combustion of hydrocarbons in general takes place by a kinetic process which Semenov1 described as a chain reaction showing 'degenerate branching'. According to this conception, the hydrocarbon is first oxidized to a moderately stable intermediate, which itself oxidized to the final products, namely, carbon monoxide, water, etc. Thus a stationary concentration of the intermediate is built up during the reaction, which reaches a maximum at the time of maximum velocity. According to Semenov's conception, the intermediate is responsible for the starting of new chains by an alternative reaction with oxygen, and a delayed or degenerate branching results."

https://openalex.org/W2057531666,"THAT spermine and streptomycin ""do not affect the respiration of yeast and thus have no direct bactericidal activity"", as stated by Massart1, is a conclusion with which many will not agree. Apart from the dangers inherent in applying to bacteria results which have been obtained with yeast, there are few grounds for supposing that the facility with which a drug can impair bacterial respiration bears any simple relation to its growth-inhibiting properties. Indeed, Ferguson and Thorne2 have shown that the order in which six aminoacridines repress the respiration of B. coli (when the substrates were glucose, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, asparagin or oleic acid) bears no obvious relation to the order of their activity in retarding the growth of this bacterium."

https://openalex.org/W1998367886,"IN a study of the effects of ions on the rat diaphragm, it has been found that denervated preparations are much more sensitive to potassium than the normal diaphragm stimulated through its nerve. A dose of potassium, for example, exposure to a concentration of 0·08 per cent in Krebs's solution, which has no depressant action on normal muscle, may completely depress the response of denervated muscle to electrical stimuli while its response to acetylcholine remains. Observations have now been made on diaphragms denervated functionally by curare, which prevents the action of acetylcholine, or by lack of glucose, which prevents its synthesis or release. The effect is the same in both cases. If now, however, the experiment is reversed and the potassium added first, it is found that after curare, or through lack of glucose, which abolish neuromuscular transmission, the muscle has become inexcitable. The exact cause of this somewhat dramatic finding is not certain."

There exist, how-ever, wide variations in the results obtained by different workers using the oil-drop method, even when the ratios, e2/3/n2 3, which are independent of the absolute value of the viscosity, are compared.
