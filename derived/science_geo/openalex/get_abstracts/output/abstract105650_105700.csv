https://openalex.org/W1984017573,"The Pto gene in tomato confers resistance to races of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato that carry the avirulence gene avrPto. A yeast artificial chromosome clone that spans the Pto region was identified and used to probe a leaf complementary DNA (cDNA) library. A cDNA clone was isolated that represents a gene family, at least six members of which genetically cosegregate with Pto. When susceptible tomato plants were transformed with a cDNA from this family, they were resistant to the pathogen. Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed similarity to serine-threonine protein kinases, suggesting a role for Pto in a signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2061517625,"Protection induced by vaccination depends on the capacity of the vaccine to elicit an appropriate immune response. In leishmaniasis, protection requires leishmanial-specific CD4+ T helper (TH) cells. Vaccination of BALB/c mice with leishmanial antigens and interleukin-12 (IL-12) promoted the development of leishmanial-specific CD4+ TH1 cells. These mice were resistant to subsequent infection with Leishmania major. Thus, IL-12 is an effective adjuvant for the initiation of protective cell-mediated immunity against leishmaniasis and may be an important component in other vaccines that need to induce cell-mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2137075959,"The Hoxa-2 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. Homozygous mutant mice died at birth. Defects were found in the branchial region of the head, which corresponds to the Hoxa-2 rostral expression domain. While rhombomeric and neural crest cell (NCC) segmentation was not affected, mesenchymal NCC derivatives of the second arch were lacking, and second arch mesenchymal NCC identity was changed to first arch identity, resulting in homeotic transformation of second to first arch skeletal elements. These results reveal the existence of a skeletogenic ground pattern program common to at least the mesenchymal NCC that originated from rhombomeres 2 and 4. The appearance of an atavistic reptilian pterygoquadrate element in Hoxa-2 mutants suggests that this ground pattern is intermediate between reptiles and mammals. The ground pattern program appears to be modified in the mouse first arch by a Hox-independent process, whereas Hoxa-2 acts as a selector gene in the second arch."

https://openalex.org/W2054486613,"Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of the Hoxa-2 (Hox 1.11) gene are born with cleft palates and die within 24 hr of birth. Analysis of stained skeletons revealed that homozygous mutant animals contained multiple cranial skeletal defects, including a duplication of the ossification centers of the bones of the middle ear. Histological analysis suggested that this duplication resulted from the transformation of skeletal elements derived from the second branchial arch into more anterior structures, resulting in a duplication of Meckel's cartilage adjacent to the otic capsule. Skeletal elements normally derived from the second arch were absent in the mutants. These data provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of a branchial Hox code."
https://openalex.org/W2055614967,"The zinc finger gene Krox-20 is transcribed in two alternate segments (rhombomeres) of the developing hindbrain. To investigate its function, we have used homologous recombination to generate mice carrying an in-frame insertion of the E. coli lacZ gene within Krox-20. Analysis of the beta-galactosidase pattern in heterozygous embryos confirmed the known profile with expression restricted to rhombomeres (r) 3 and 5. Mice homozygous for the mutation die during the first two weeks after birth. Anatomical analysis of the hindbrain and of the cranial nerves during embryogenesis, combined with the determination of the expression patterns of rhombomere-specific genes, demonstrated that Krox-20 inactivation results in a marked reduction or elimination of r3 and r5. We conclude that Krox-20, although not required for the initial delimitation of r3 and r5, plays an important role in the process of segmentation governing hindbrain development."

https://openalex.org/W1531734841,"The effects of the nitric oxide (NO) donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) on the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) were examined in frog ventricular myocytes under basal and phosphorylated conditions. SIN-1 was found to exert insignificant effects on basal ICa but to induce a biphasic action on stimulated ICa. Indeed, in the nanomolar range of concentrations (0.1-10 nM), SIN-1 induced a pronounced (approximately 40%) stimulation of ICa elevated by a non-maximal concentration of forskolin (0.3 microM). However, the stimulatory effects of SIN-1 on ICa were not additive with those of maximal concentrations (10 microM) of forskolin or intracellular cAMP. In contrast, at higher concentrations (100 nM to 1 mM), SIN-1 strongly reduced ICa (by up to 85%) which had been previously stimulated by cAMP, forskolin, or isoprenaline. All the effects of SIN-1 appeared to be mediated by the liberation of NO since they were suppressed by methylene blue and LY83583 and were not mimicked by SIN-1C, a metabolite of SIN-1. The stimulatory or inhibitory effects of SIN-1 were absent, respectively, in the presence of milrinone (10 microM) or when the hydrolysis-resistant cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP was used instead of cAMP to stimulate ICa. In addition to its effects on ICa, SIN-1 induced a dose-dependent stimulation of guanylyl cyclase activity in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of frog ventricle. The membrane form of guanylyl cyclase displayed a higher sensitivity to SIN-1 than the cytosolic form, which correlated with SIN-1 sensitivity of ICa. Our data suggest that the activatory and inhibitory effects of NO donors on ICa result from an inhibition of the cGMP-inhibited cAMP-phosphodiesterase and an activation of the cGMP-stimulated cAMP-phosphodiesterase, respectively, both linked to the activation of guanylyl cyclase, possibly a membrane form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2023914649,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from many asymptomatic individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV) are unresponsive as measured by in vitro T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production to influenza virus and synthetic peptides of HIV envelope (Env). Strong influenza virus- and Env-stimulated IL-2 responses and T cell proliferation were restored when cultures were stimulated in the presence of IL-12. Interferon-gamma production by PBMCs from HIV seropositive (HIV+) patients was also restored with IL-12. Furthermore, in vitro antigen-specific production of IL-2 and proliferation of PBMCs from HIV- donors were suppressed by antibody to IL-12, but were not enhanced by addition of exogenous IL-12. Thus, IL-12 may be limiting in PBMCs from HIV+ but not HIV- individuals. These findings demonstrate that IL-12 can restore HIV-specific cell-mediated immunity in vitro in HIV-infected individuals and suggest a potential use of IL-12 in augmenting the diminished immunologic functions associated with HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2168148516,"The Polycomb group (Pc-G) proteins are responsible for keeping developmental regulators, like homeotic genes, stably and inheritably repressed during Drosophila development. Several similarities to a protein class involved in heterochromatin formation suggest that the Pc-G exerts its function at the higher order chromatin level. Here we have mapped the distribution of the Pc protein in the homeotic bithorax complex (BX-C) of Drosophila tissue culture cells. We have elaborated a method, based on the in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking technique, that allows a substantial enrichment for Pc-interacting sites by immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked chromatin with anti-Pc antibodies. We find that the Pc protein quantitatively covers large regulatory regions of repressed BX-C genes. Conversely, we find that the Abdominal-B gene is active in these cells and the region devoid of any bound Pc protein."

https://openalex.org/W1526833570,"Human IMP dehydrogenase, a target for anticancer and immunosuppressive chemotherapy, exists as two isoforms, types I and II. Nonfusion sequences of each isoform were overexpressed in an IMP dehydrogenase-deficient strain of Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Both recombinant isoforms were tetramers, which was in agreement with the subunit structure of the native mammalian enzyme. The results of initial velocity and product inhibition studies were consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism for both isoforms. Substrate affinities were similar for types I and II with Km values of 18 and 9.3 microM, respectively, for IMP, and 46 and 32 microM, respectively, for NAD.kcat values were 1.5 and 1.3 s-1 at 37 degrees C for types I and II, respectively. Xanthosine 5'-monophosphate and NADH inhibited the two isoforms with identical inhibition patterns and inhibition constants. Mycophenolic acid, however, inhibited the type II enzyme with a 4.8-fold lower K than the type I. Selective inhibitors of the inducible type II isoform may mitigate toxicity caused by inhibition of the constitutively expressed type I isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1491108164,"High affinity sodium- and potassium-coupled L-glutamate transport into presynaptic nerve terminals and fine glial processes removes the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft, thereby terminating glutamergic transmission. This report describes that the purified L-glutamate transporter from pig brain is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, predominantly at serine residues. Upon exposure of C6 cells, a cell line of glial origin, to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, about a 2-fold stimulation of L-glutamate transport is observed within 30 min. Concomitantly, the level of phosphorylation increases with similar kinetics. The phorbol ester also stimulates L-glutamate transport in HeLa cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase and transfected with pT7-GLT-1. The latter is a recently cloned rat brain glutamate transporter of glial origin. Mutation of serine 113 to asparagine does not affect the levels of expressed transport but abolishes its stimulation by the phorbol ester. To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of the regulation of a neurotransmitter transporter by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2062567403,"Subsets of CD4 T cells are defined by the cytokines that they produce; these cytokines determine the effector function of these cells. Cloned CD4 T cells fall into two subsets, producing either interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) in combination with other cytokines, and are called Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. The lineage relationship between naive T cells and effector Th1- and Th2-type cells is unclear. We generated transgenic mice in which IL-4-producing cells express herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase and are eliminated by ganciclovir (GANC). Activation of transgenic T cells in the presence of GANC eliminates IL-4 and IFN gamma production, showing that IL-4- and IFN gamma-producing cells express or have expressed IL-4. These results show that effector cells producing either IL-4 or IFN gamma have a common precursor, which expresses the IL-4 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1538325952,"Reduced arterial oxygen tension (i.e. hypoxia) is a powerful physiological stimulus that induces synthesis and release of dopamine from O2-sensitive (type I) cells in the mammalian carotid bodies. We reported recently that hypoxia stimulates gene expression for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis in type I cells of the carotid body. Efforts to identify the mechanisms regulating TH gene expression in O2-sensitive cells during hypoxia have been hampered by the lack of an appropriate model cell culture system. Here we report that TH gene expression in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) is regulated during hypoxia in a manner similar to that measured in carotid body type I cells. PC12 cells might therefore be useful as an experimental model for identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate TH gene expression during hypoxia. Nuclear runoff assays revealed that transcription of the wild type TH gene was enhanced during exposures to hypoxia lasting 12 h. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays with constructs that contained different fragments of TH promoter revealed that the regulatory sequences that mediate the hypoxia-induced increase in transcription are located between bases -272 and +27 of the TH gene. Findings from experiments in which transcription was inhibited either with actinomycin D or 5,6-dichloro-1-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, as well as pulse-chase experiments using 4-thiouridine showed that the half-life of TH mRNA was substantially increased during hypoxia. Thus, in the present paper we show that TH gene expression in PC12 cells during hypoxia is regulated by increases in both the rate of TH gene transcription and TH mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1486774900,"D-Amino acids administered to animals are absorbed by the intestine and transported through the blood-stream to solid tissues where they are oxidized in vivo by D-amino acid oxidase and D-aspartate oxidase to produce the same compounds they do in vitro; i.e. NH3, H2O2, and the keto acid corresponding to the amino acid ingested. In the liver and kidneys of the animals, an inverse relationship exists between the occurrence of D-amino acids and these oxidative enzymes. For example, younger animals have lower amounts of these oxidases and consequently higher concentrations of free D-amino acids compared to adult animals. If the ingested D-amino acids are not metabolized by these enzymes, they will accumulate in the tissues and may provoke serious damage, e.g. suppression of the synthesis of other essential enzymes and inhibition of the growth rate of the animals. A specific enzyme induction for these D-amino acid oxidases exists in young rats following ingestion of free D-amino acids by the mother. Specifically, when a mother rat ingests D-Ala or D-Asp during pregnancy and suckling, an increase in D-amino acid oxidase or D-aspartate oxidase is observed in the liver and kidneys of the baby rats. These results suggest that the in vivo biological role of these oxidases in animals is to act as detoxifying agents to metabolize D-amino acids which may have accumulated during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2068768450,"The CD4 molecule is essential for binding HIV particles, but is not sufficient for efficient viral entry and infection. The cofactor was shown to be dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), also known as CD26. This serine protease cleaves its substrates at specific motifs; such motifs area also highly conserved in the V3 loops of HIV-1, HIV-2, and related simian isolates. Entry of HIV-1 or HIV-2 into T lymphoblastoid and monocytoid cell lines was inhibited by a specific monoclonal antibody against DPP IV or specific peptide inhibitors of this protease. Coexpression of human CD4 and CD26 in murine NIH 3T3 cells rendered them permissive to infection by HIV-1 and HIV-2. These observations could provide the basis for developing simple and specific inhibitors of HIV and open a possibility for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2070476244,"Although proliferation is fundamental to the generation of neuronal populations, little is known about the function of trophic mechanisms during neurogenesis. We now describe a novel role for neurotrophin-3 (NT-3): the neurotrophin stimulates proliferation of sympathetic neuroblasts through trophic mechanisms. NT-3 promotes survival of the dividing precursors, but does not directly stimulate mitosis. NT-3 trophic effects differ markedly from those of the sympathetic mitogen, insulin. Furthermore, whereas NT-3 exhibits trophic activity for dividing neuroblasts, nerve growth factor characteristically promotes survival of postnatal sympathetic neurons. The stage-specific activity of NT-3 and nerve growth factor in culture parallels the sequence of trkC and trkA receptor gene expression detected in vivo. Thus, neurotrophins apparently serve as trophic factors during ontogeny, acting sequentially during establishment of individual populations."
https://openalex.org/W1581978506,"Escherichia coli responds to an increase in medium osmolarity by accumulating K+ and glutamate. At low osmolarity a large fraction of cytoplasmic K+ serves to balance charge on macromolecular anions. That fraction of K+ is here referred to as bound, as distinguished from K+ that serves to balance charge of small anions. At higher osmolarity where cytoplasmic K+ increases markedly, the bound fraction decreases but the absolute amount of bound K+ expressed per unit of dry weight increases. The increase in bound K+ can be explained largely by the reduction of cytoplasmic putrescine at high osmolarity. At high osmolarity, glutamate is the major cytoplasmic anion, equal to at least 70% of free cytoplasmic K+. A sudden increase in the osmolarity of the medium stimulates glutamate synthesis with a lag of only about a minute; glutamate synthesis is almost totally dependent on K+ uptake. The high rate of flow of nitrogen through the glutamate pool under control conditions of growth at low osmolarity indicates that glutamate accumulation immediately after shift to high osmolarity must be due to inhibition of utilization of glutamate in the synthesis of other nitrogen-containing compounds rather than stimulation of glutamate synthesis. In agreement with this reasoning we find the kinetics of glutamate accumulation to be independent of the specific path of synthesis, whether by glutamate dehydrogenase or by glutamate synthase. Synthesis of glutamate appears to be required to attain normal values of the electrical membrane potential after shift to high osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W1508560627,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) catalyzes the formation of native disulfides of peptide chains from either the reduced form or randomly joined disulfides. So that thiols situated at distant parts of the polypeptide chain can be joined together to form the native disulfides, the polypeptide chain has to be folded, at least to some extent, into the native conformation. It is suggested that PDI promotes folding of the chains as well as formation of the disulfides and plays a role similar to the chaperones in the folding process. PDI is known to be a multifunctional protein and capable of nonspecific peptide binding. These properties are closely connected to its possible function as a chaperone. Thioredoxin, which has an active site sequence similar to that of PDI but lacks the property of peptide binding, is much less efficient as a disulfide isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W2038228771,"A novel type of hormone-responsive element (HRE) is described. Unlike classical HREs, this element, RSV-T3RE (found in Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat), mediates strong activation by the c-ErbAα thyroid hormone (T3) receptor in the absence of T3, and addition of T3 reverses this response. Whereas both c-ErbAα and v-ErbA are potent ligand-independent activators through the RSV-T3RE, c-ErbAβ is not. The RSV-T3RE is recognized and activated by either c-ErbAα homodimers or c-ErbAα/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers. Ligand-independent activation by c-ErbAα depends on a unique N-terminal activation domain, while the C-terminal activation domain is not absolutely required. Ligand-dependent activation, on the other hand, requires the C-terminal but not the N-terminal activation domain. Upon binding to the RSV-T3RE, c-ErbAα assumes a different conformation than when bound to a classical T3RE. c-ErbAα is therefore capable of selective deployment of activation domains, dictated both by the HRE with which it interacts and by T3 binding."
https://openalex.org/W1558700892,"We have previously isolated a cDNA clone for a unique mouse lung glutathione S-transferase, mGSTA4-4 (GST 5.7) (Zimniak, P., Eckles, M. A., Saxena, M., and Awasthi, Y. C. (1992) FEBS Lett. 313, 173-176). By genomic Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism analysis we have now demonstrated the presence of at least two mGSTA4-related genes in the mouse. The heterogeneity of mGSTA4-4 was further examined by comparing the structural and kinetic properties of mGSTA4-4 isolated from mouse lung with those of recombinant rec-mGSTA4-4 expressed in Escherichia coli. Except for the isoelectric point, the physical properties of the two proteins were indistinguishable. Western blots using antibodies against rec-mGSTA4-4 have shown selective expression of the enzyme in mouse tissues. Even though the substrate specificity profiles of the tissue-isolated and recombinant enzymes, which point to a role of mGSTA4-4 in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation products, were generally similar, significant differences were observed with selected substrates. The existence of functionally distinct forms of mGSTA4-4 and the presence of more than one gene strongly suggest that the previously observed differences in properties of mGSTA4-4 isolated from various mouse tissues (Awasthi, S., Singhal, S. S., Srivastava, S. K., and Awasthi, Y. C. (1993) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 301, 143-150) may be due to tissue-specific expression of mGSTA4-related genes."

https://openalex.org/W1511025654,"Homeodomain-containing proteins are believed to function as sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, regulating gene expression. Specificity of sequence recognition is conferred by the homeodomain acting either alone or in conjunction with other conserved DNA binding domains as is the case for Pou domain and Paired domain proteins. The recent isolation of cDNAs encoding mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Cut homeodomain protein has revealed that the 72-amino acid Cut Repeats are conserved in evolution. We have investigated the biochemical activity of human Cut Repeats by expressing fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase linked to various combinations of Cut Repeats and Cut homeodomain. We show by gel retardation and DNase footprinting assays that Cut Repeats can function as DNA binding domains, either independently or in cooperation with the homeodomain. The binding affinity (KD) to a specific recognition site was estimated to be 8 x 10(-9) M for Cut Repeat 3 and 4 x 10(-10) M for Cut Repeat 1. When both Cut Repeat 3 and the Cut homeodomain were present in the fusion protein, the binding affinity was increased to 4 x 10(-11) M. These results define a novel class of proteins that contain in addition to the homeodomain a second conserved protein domain, the Cut Repeats, that also function as a DNA binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1564476874,"It has been shown recently that heterologous expression of human MDR-1 gene, which is responsible for multidrug resistance during cancer therapy, causes appearance of volume-sensitive Cl- currents, thus suggesting that the product of the MDR-1 gene (the P-glycoprotein) has a Cl- channel activity (Valverde, M. A., Diaz, M., Sepulveda, M. A., Gill, D. R., Hyde, S. C., and Higgins, C. F. (1992) Nature 355, 830-833). In the present work, we have tested four epithelial cell lines both for the expression of MDR-1 gene and for the presence of volume-sensitive Cl- currents. LoVo/H and LoVo/Dx cells derive from a human colon adenocarcinoma, the latter cell line being resistant to high concentrations of the antitumoral drug doxorubicin. 9HTEo- cells were obtained by transformation of human tracheal epithelium. The 9HTEo-/Dx cell line was established from these cells by selection in doxorubicin. As expected, higher levels of P-glycoprotein expression were detected in LoVo/Dx and 9HTEo-/Dx by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique, indirect immunofluorescence, and Western immunoblot assays. In contrast with these data, the size of swelling-induced Cl- current was the same in the sensitive cell line and in its drug-resistant counterpart. Actually, the Cl- conductance of 9HTEo- and 9HTEo-/Dx was 4-fold higher than that of either LoVo/H or LoVo/Dx cells. This indicates that the amplitude of this conductance is not directly related to the expression of the MDR-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1597750467,"The pattern of expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) genes and gene products in AtT-20 cells was characterized in an attempt to explain the SST-28 binding selectivity that typifies these cells. AtT-20 cells expressed multiple SSTR mRNAs. Paradoxically, this included mRNA for three of the four SST-14 selective receptors: SSTR2 ( +), SSTR1 (+), SSTR4 (+). The SST-28 selective SSTR5 was expressed as a 3.8-kilobase (kb) transcript of relatively low abundance (+) in contrast to normal mouse pituitary which displayed high levels ( ) of a 2.4-kb SSTR5 mRNA. Immunoblot analysis of solubilized membranes with an antipeptide SSTR2 antibody revealed a single SSTR2 protein of 72 +/- 2 kDa. Preincubation of AtT-20 cell membranes with SSTR2 antibody reduced 125I-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25]SST-28 binding sites by 38%. Residual binding sites exhibited a 4.9-fold increase in affinity for SST-28, a 2.6-fold decrease in affinity for SST-14, and an SST-28:SST-14 potency ratio of 40:1 compared with a potency ratio of 3.5:1 in control membranes. These results demonstrate the expression of four SSTR genes in AtT-20 cells of which SSTR2 predominates. Blockade of SSTR2 with antibody exposes high affinity SST-28 selective sites with comparable binding characteristics to those reported for cloned SSTR5. These SST-28 binding sites may arise from a SSTR5 variant encoded by a high molecular weight 3.8-kb transcript or more likely from another as yet undiscovered member of the SST-28 selective SSTR subfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1826817242,"We reported recently that mevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.1.36; ATP:mevalonate 5-phosphotransferase) that was isolated from rat liver and believed to be a cytosolic protein was localized in rat liver peroxisomes. In addition, we found that the mevalonate kinase monoclonal antibody used in the study also reacted with several other proteins present in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. These findings raised the prospect of the presence of several isoenzymes of mevalonate kinase localized in different compartments of the cell. In the current study we produced four new polyclonal antibodies against different epitopes of mevalonate kinase to investigate the subcellular localization of the protein by several different approaches: (i) by analytical subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting of mevalonate kinase in the isolated subcellular fractions with the monospecific antibodies; (ii) by immunocryoelectron microscopy techniques; and (iii) by expressing the cDNA encoding mevalonate kinase in mammalian cells. The data obtained demonstrate that there is only one mevalonate kinase protein that is predominantly localized in peroxisomes. We also illustrate that the protein is targeted to and imported into peroxisomes. In addition, we show that in cells and tissues obtained from patients with peroxisomal deficiency diseases mevalonate kinase protein and its activity are severely reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1600783018,"Hereditary deficiency of myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a common disorder but its genetic basis is unknown. We have reported that neutrophils from individuals with MPO deficiency lack enzymatic and immunochemical evidence for mature MPO but have a 90-kDa precursor protein. We have thus hypothesized that hereditary MPO deficiency reflects a defect in processing of a mutated primary translation product. Genomic DNA's from normal subjects digested with BglII and probed with radiolabeled cDNA for MPO have a 2.6-kilobase (kb) band. Previously we described the presence of an aberrant 2.1-kb fragment in BglII digests from most individuals with either partial or complete MPO deficiency. We describe here the responsible mutation. The substitution of thymidine for cytosine in exon 10 at nucleotide 8,089 of the genomic sequence results in generation of a recognition site for BglII not present normally and converts the normal 2.6-kb BglII fragment to the 2.1-kb fragment associated with MPO deficiency. At the amino acid level this mutation would replace arginine at codon 569 with tryptophan. Six of seven patients with complete MPO deficiency had this mutation. One subject was homozygous for this mutation whereas five others were heterozygous at this locus. The seventh patient was the only completely deficient subject without this mutation. Thus, at least two mutations and three genotypes can produce the phenotype of MPO deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1981597576,"As changes in synaptic strength are thought to be critical for learning and memory, it would be useful to monitor the activity of individual identified synapses on mammalian central neurons. Calcium imaging of cortical neurons grown in primary culture was used to visualize the activation of individual postsynaptic elements by miniature excitatory synaptic currents elicited by spontaneous quantal release. This approach revealed that the probability of spontaneous activity differed among synapses on the same dendrite. Furthermore, synapses that undergo changes in activity induced by glutamate or phorbol ester treatment were identified."
https://openalex.org/W1568851476,"Three highly purified endosomal fractions from rat liver were used to purify and characterize a major protein of endosomal membranes. Intravenously injected ligands, which are taken up via receptor-mediated endocytosis, accumulate first in the fraction of intermediate density, the compartment of uncoupling of receptors and ligands. The high density membranous fraction is highly enriched in a receptor recycling compartment. The endosomal fraction of lowest density is composed of multivesicular bodies, which appear to be the immediate prelysosomal compartment. The most prominent membrane protein of these endosomes is one of 68 kDa, as revealed by silver and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-gel electrophoretograms. This protein dominates profiles obtained from purified membranes of the compartment of uncoupling of receptors and ligands, multivesicular bodies, and receptor recycling compartment, but is greatly reduced in those obtained from plasma membranes and lysosomes. The 68-kDa protein was purified from endosomes and digested with trypsin, and cleavage products were analyzed by protein sequencing. The tryptic fragments of the endosomal 68-kDa protein share 96% identity with corresponding sequences of mouse annexin VI and 91% identity with sequences of human annexin VI. Using immunoblots, high concentrations of annexin VI with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa were detected in endosomal membranes by specific antiserum to annexin VI. Significant amounts of annexin VI were also detected in Golgi membranes. Yet, the concentration was substantially lower than that of the three endosomal fractions. The association of annexin VI with endosomal membranes is calcium-dependent, as revealed by the complete solubilization from endosomal membranes by EGTA. Incubation of intact endosomes with Pronase leads to a complete degradation of annexin VI without any detectable disintegration of proteins localized on the luminal surface of endosomal membranes. Evidently, annexin VI is localized on the cytoplasmatic leaflet of the membrane of endosomes and may be of significance for their intracellular trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1545712107,"To evaluate the role of P-glycoprotein in steroid secretion in adrenal cells, we have used gene targeting to introduce a null mutation into one allele of the mdr1b gene in mouse Y1 adrenal cells. Characterization of both the wild-type and the mutant cell lines revealed the following. 1) The expression of mdr1b is enhanced by steroid hormones, in a feedback regulatory mechanism. Inhibition of steroid biosynthesis by 2-aminoglutethimide blocks the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-induced increase in mdr1b mRNA levels. 2) ACTH-stimulated steroid secretion is markedly decreased in the mutant cell line. This decreased steroid secretion in the mutant cells occurs despite an increase in the levels of mdr1b mRNA and P-glycoprotein. Kinetic analyses of vinblastine and daunomycin accumulation in both the wild-type and the mutant cell lines during ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis show that in the mutant cells both drugs accumulated to higher levels than in Y1 cells, suggesting that the remaining mdr1b allele in the mutant cells is relatively inactive as an exporter of steroids, or that the targeted disruption of the mdr1b allele is associated with other changes in the mutant cells which block ACTH-stimulated steroid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1589391283,"Since a nitric oxide-sensitive form of guanylyl cyclase exists as a heterodimer, mutations disrupting catalysis but not heterodimer formation could serve as dominant negative mutations. Two mutations within the catalytic region of the alpha subunit (alpha 1D513A, alpha 1D529A) caused complete losses of basal and sodium nitroprusside-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity; however, the mutant alpha subunits continued to form heterodimers with wild-type beta-subunit. Rat insulinoma cells, which contain the alpha 1 beta 1 form of guanylyl cyclase, were stably transfected with alpha 1D513A or alpha 1D529A. The response to sodium nitroprusside, which exceeded 200-fold in the presence of wild-type alpha 1, was markedly reduced by the expression of either mutant subunit. In contrast, the mutant subunits failed to inhibit heat-stable enterotoxin-induced cGMP elevations; the bacterial peptide elevated insulinoma cell cGMP approximately 100-fold. The two point mutations, therefore, result in dominant negative proteins that can effectively and specifically block the NO/cGMP signaling pathway. These are also the first studies to show that, although both the alpha and beta subunits contain regions homologous to putative cyclase catalytic regions, a point mutation in just one of the subunits can completely inhibit cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1550520517,"The murine homeobox gene Cdx-1 is postulated to play an important role in the process of cellular commitment in the intestinal epithelium based upon its graded, tissue-specific expression pattern in the adult animal. We have isolated and sequenced both cDNA and genomic clones in order to understand how this expression pattern is regulated and to determine the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Our studies show that the Cdx-1 gene contains 3 exons and 2 introns and encodes a 268-amino acid protein which is translated from a 1.7-1.8-kilobase mRNA. Transcription of the Cdx-1 gene initiates some 30 base pairs downstream from a typical TATA box which, together with the 5' end of the gene, is located within a CpG island. Transient transfection experiments have shown three regions which regulate Cdx-1 gene expression. These include a typical silencer element at -589 to -380, an element at -887 to -1040 which blocks the effect of the silencer and a positive element at -47 to +66; the only one which shows epithelial cell specificity. Using gel shift and footprinting assays we have detected proteins in nuclear extracts prepared from colonic epithelial cells which bind to the silencer element. These initial results suggest that Cdx-1 gene expression is regulated by multiple positive and negative transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1583563138,"Lactoferrin inhibits the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants, and we showed earlier that arginine residues of lactoferrin are involved. In this study, lactoferrin was treated with aminopeptidase M (APM), which resulted in removal of 14 N-terminal amino acids, including 4 clustered arginine residues at positions 2-5 (APM-lactoferrin). After intravenous injection into rats, 125I-labeled APM-lactoferrin was cleared within 10 min by the liver parenchymal cells (74.7% of the dose). In contrast to native lactoferrin, APM-lactoferrin was rapidly internalized after liver association (> 80% of the liver-associated radioactivity was internalized within 10 min). Binding of APM-lactoferrin to isolated parenchymal liver cells was saturable with a Kd of 186 nM (750,000 sites/cell). This is in striking contrast to the binding of native lactoferrin (Kd 10 microM; 20 x 10(6) sites/cell). Preinjection of rats with 20 mg of APM-lactoferrin/kg of body weight reduced the liver association of beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) by 50%, whereas lactoferrin had no effect at this dose. With isolated parenchymal liver cells, APM-lactoferrin was a more effective competitor for beta-VLDL binding than native lactoferrin (50% inhibition at 0.5 mg/ml versus 8.0 mg/ml). Selective modification of the arginines of APM-lactoferrin with 1,2-cyclohexanedione reduced the liver association by approximately 60% and abolished the capacity of APM-lactoferrin to inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL in vitro. In conclusion, our data indicate that the four-arginine cluster of lactoferrin at positions 2-5 is involved in its massive, low affinity association of lactoferrin with the liver, possibly to proteoglycans, but is not essential for the inhibition of lipoprotein remnant uptake. The Arg-Lys sequence at positions 25-31, which resembles the binding site of apolipoprotein E, may mediate the high affinity binding of lactoferrin and block the binding of beta-VLDL to the remnant receptor with high efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2164910981,"A polyclonal antibody against myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) of chicken gizzard recognized a 130 kd peptide of bullfrog sympathetic ganglia as MLCK. MLCK immunoreactivity was confined to the neuronal cell body. A synthetic peptide corresponding to an inhibitory domain of MLCK (Ala783-Gly884)) was applied intracellularly to isolated sympathetic neurons during whole-cell recordings of ionic currents. The peptide inhibitor reversibly decreased M-type potassium current (IM) while not affecting A-type or delayed rectifier-type potassium currents. Intracellular application of an active fragment of MLCK enhanced IM, whereas application of an inactive MLCK fragment did not. The results suggest that IM can be modulated by MLCK-catalyzed phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1639257495,"After fibrin polymerizes to form a clot, the transglutaminase Factor XIIIa cross-links the gamma and alpha chains to stabilize the clot. There has been conflicting evidence on whether the gamma chain isopeptide bonds occur between molecules that are interacting in a longitudinal (end-to-end) manner or transverse (half-staggered) manner between the two strands of the protofibril. Since the topology of the cross-links has important consequences for fibrin structure, as well as for its stability and susceptibility to and pattern of fibrinolysis, cross-linked fibrin fragments were examined by electron microscopy to distinguish between these two possibilities for the arrangement of the ligated molecules. Cross-linked fibrin clots were produced by prolonged incubation of fibrinogen with thrombin and Factor XIII, and then digested with plasmin. The resulting soluble cross-linked fibrin complexes were rotary-shadowed with tungsten and examined by electron microscopy, revealing protofibril-like structures consisting of clusters of globular domains with a repeat of 22.5 nm. Longer plasmin digestion times yielded increasingly shorter structures. Rotary-shadowed cross-linked fibrin fragments, produced by dilution of the complexes into 0.125% acetic acid at pH 3.5 to dissociate all non-covalently linked fragments, showed uniformly single-stranded structures with a characteristic spacing of nodules, consistent with longitudinal cross-linking. Long, thin strands were seen at short digestion times, while shorter strands appeared with longer digestion. The smallest structures observed included two nodules together, and two such nodules with another nodule at a short distance from one or both ends, compatible with fragments DD, DY, and YY. Longer strands had the appearance of fibrin molecules that were linked end-to-end, usually with a fragment D or Y at each end. In conclusion, these results are consistent with previously proposed structures of these derivatives and clearly demonstrate that the interactions between cross-linked gamma chains are longitudinal (end-to-end) and not transverse."
https://openalex.org/W1820869110,"Synergism in transcription is said to occur when the combined response from two DNA elements for the binding of trans-acting factors is greater than the sum of the responses from each element in isolation. The synergism of steroid receptors with themselves or with other trans-acting factors at saturating concentrations of steroid has proved to be an important component of steroid-regulated gene transcription. We have recently described a glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene that, in conjunction with a trans-acting factor, modulates the transcriptional activity of receptor-glucocorticoid and -antiglucocorticoid complexes with homologous and heterologous genes and promoters (Oshima, H., and Simons, S. S., Jr. (1992) Mol. Endocrinol. 6, 416-428). We now report that, under certain circumstances, the GME displays synergistic activity with a glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE). However, several properties of GME action are different from those previously observed for synergism. The effects of the GME were marked at subsaturating or physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids but insignificant at saturating concentrations, which are the established conditions for synergism. The GME was found to increase the agonist activity of partial antiglucocorticoids, while synergism involving antisteroids has yet to be reported. Furthermore, the GRE was active in conjunction with two tandem repeats of a GRE, which was a combination that did not support conventional synergism. Most importantly, the effects of the GME were greater than with any other trans-acting factor binding element tested, indicative of a sequence-selective activity. The efficacy of the GME was also insensitive to the spacing between elements. Thus, the GME provides a mechanism for selective transcriptional modulation by physiological concentrations of steroid, and by antisteroids, of a common class of genes that are under the control of two or more GREs."
https://openalex.org/W1494432049,"v-erbA, a viral oncogenic homolog of thyroid hormone receptor (TR), blocks the effect of T3 in TR-mediated transcription. The mechanism(s) for this dominant negative effect by v-erbA on TRs is unknown but may involve competition between v-erbA and TR-containing complexes for binding to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) and/or protein-protein interactions between v-erbA and TR. To investigate these potential mechanisms, we used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay to compare in vitro translated v-erbA and TR alpha binding to two TREs-chick lysozyme TRE (F2) and direct repeat TRE (DR4). v-erbA bound as a homodimer to these TREs, whereas TR alpha bound as a homodimer and monomer. T3 decreased TR alpha homodimer binding to the TREs as we reported previously; however, surprisingly, high concentrations of T3 (10(-6) M) also decreased v-erbA homodimer binding to the TREs. Additionally, v-erbA formed heterodimers with nuclear proteins such as retinoid X receptor and T3 receptor auxiliary protein as well as with TR alpha. These dimers remained bound to DNA in the presence of T3. Finally, v-erbA could not mediate ligand-dependent transcriptional activation even at 10(-6) M T3 but could block ligand-dependent TR-mediated transactivation in co-transfection experiments. v-erbA also exhibited differential dominant negative activity on F2 and DR4 suggesting that half-site sequence and/or orientation may influence v-erbA-dominant negative activity. In sum, there are multiple v-erbA complexes that bind to TREs in the presence of T3, which all may contribute to v-erbA's dominant negative effect on TR-mediated transcription by competing with TR-containing complexes for binding to TREs."
https://openalex.org/W1569883356,"The bovine lens protein beta A3-crystallin has recently been shown to be an amine-donor (Lys) substrate for tissue-type transglutaminase, using a newly developed amine-acceptor hexapeptide as a probe (Groenen, P.J.T.A., Seccia, M., Smulders, R.H.P.H., Gravela, E., Cheeseman, K.H., Bloemendal, H., and de Jong, W.W. (1993) Biochem. J. 295, 399-404). In the present study, the reactive amine-donor site has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis of the putative substrate lysine. The mutation Lys-17-->Arg abolishes the substrate capacity. This residue, located in the N-terminal extension of the polypeptide, thus acts as the sole amine-donor substrate in beta A3-crystallin. Our finding reinforces the notion that, in the crystallins, all amine-donor as well as amine-acceptor substrate sites reside in the N- or C-terminal arms. Transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of beta A3-crystallin also gives rise to a beta A3 dimer, presumably due to the fact that Lys-17 can be cross-linked to the previously established Gln-7 or Gln-8 amine-acceptor site."
https://openalex.org/W1489230283,"The three-dimensional structure of lipase II of Geotrichum candidum strain ATCC34614 (GCL II) has provided insights with respect to the nature of the catalytic machinery of lipases. To support these structural observations, we have carried out an analysis of GCL II by mutagenesis. The gene encoding lipase II of Geotrichum candidum strain ATCC34614 (GCL II) was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. The intronless lipase gene was expressed and secreted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at approximately 5 mg/liter of culture. Recombinant GCL II was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and characterized using a combination of substrates and independent analytical methods. The recombinant enzyme and the enzyme isolated from its natural source have comparable specific activities against triolein of about 1000 mumol of oleic acid released/min/mg of protein. The putative catalytic triad Ser217-His463-Glu354 was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The substitution of Ser217 by either Cys or Thr and of His463 by Ala led to a complete elimination of the activity against both triolein and tributyrin. Substitution of Glu354 by either Ser, Ala or Gln renders the enzyme inactive and also perturbs the enzyme stability. However, the enzyme with the conservative replacement Glu354 Asp is stable and displays only a small decrease of triolein activity but a 10-fold decrease in activity against tributyrin. There was no appreciable difference in esterase activity between the native, recombinant wild type, and Glu354 Asp mutant. These results confirm that the triad formed by Ser217-Glu354-His463 is essential for catalytic activity. They also show that the active site of GCL II is more tolerant to a conservative change of the carboxylic side chain within the triad than are other hydrolases with similar catalytic triads."
https://openalex.org/W1588219013,"The multidrug resistance (MDR) P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an active transporter associated with chemoresistance of tumor cells. A fundamental aspect not yet entirely clarified is the physiological role of MDR-P-gp in normal mammalian tissues. In this paper we report that multidrug (chemo)resistance is already present in mouse oocytes and early cleavage embryos. Expression of MDR-specific P-gp is detectable by antibody (C219) staining from the primary oocyte onward to the eight-cell embryo. MDR-mRNA is demonstrated in mature oocytes using an MJr1-specific cDNA probe. Functional activity of P-gp is shown by the efficacy of MDR reversers (verapamil or quinidine) in enhancement of: 1) drug accumulation (daunomycin) in all stages investigated, 2) drug cytotoxicity (daunomycin or mitomycin C-induced developmental impairment) in two-cell embryos cultured for 24 h, and 3) drug cytokinesis-blocking activity (cytochalasin D; our recent findings demonstrate cytochalasins to be substrates for P-gp and to indicate the presence of MDR by their microfilament-disrupting action on cycling cells) in four- and eight-cell embryos cultured for 24 h. Furthermore, functional involvement of P-gp in vivo is demonstrated. Concurrent administration of verapamil increases doxorubicin-induced developmental impairment in the zygote stage during the first cleavage cycle in pregnant females. Results provide evidence that MDR-P-gp has an efficient protective function in early reproduction.— Elbling, L., Berger, W., Rehberger, A., Waldhör, T., Micksche, M.

https://openalex.org/W1599169047,"A carboxyl group of Asp-285 is essential for tetracycline/H+ antiport mediated by the transposon Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (TetA) of Escherichia coli (Yamaguchi, A., Akasaka, T., Ono, N., Someya, Y., Nakatani, M., and Sawai, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7490-7498). Spontaneous tetracycline resistance revertants were isolated from E. coli cells carrying the Asn-285 mutant tetA gene. All of the revertants were due to the second-site mutation at codon 220 of GCG (Ala) to GAG (Glu). The Km value of the tetracycline transport mediated by the revertant TetA protein was about 4-fold higher than that of the wild-type, indicating that the revertant is a low affinity mutant. A Glu-220 and Asn-285 double mutant constructed by site-directed mutagenesis showed the same properties as the revertants, confirming that the mutation of Ala-220 is solely responsible for the suppression. The Asp-220 mutation of the Asn-285 mutant resulted in a lower level of restoration of the tetracycline resistance and the transport activity than in the case of the Glu-220 mutation. A single mutation replacing Ala-220 with Glu or Asp caused about a 2-4-fold decrease in the tetracycline resistance, but no crucial change in the transport activity. It is not likely that Glu-220 is required for a charge-neutralizing salt bridge because an unpaired negative charge in a Glu-220 or Asp-220 single mutant did not cause a serious change in the activity. An alternative explanation is reasonable; Asp-285 directly contributes to the binding of a cationic substrate, metal-tetracycline chelation complex, or proton, and an acidic residue at position 220 can take over the role of Asp-285."
https://openalex.org/W1513724643,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DDD) is a type II plasma membrane protein. Replacement of its transmembrane domain with that of another surface protein, aminopeptidase N, resulted in accumulation in the Golgi apparatus of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and a delayed Golgi to surface transport in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The compartment of retardation was identified as post medial-Golgi, most likely to be the trans-Golgi/trans Golgi network (TGN). Compared to native DDD, the rate of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport for the chimera was largely unchanged in both cell types. On the other hand, Golgi to surface transport was delayed by more than 2 h in CHO cells and essentially undetectable up to 22 h of chase in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The decrease in the rate of Golgi to surface transport in CHO cells resulted in a significant accumulation of the fusion protein in the trans-Golgi/TGN. This phenomena is very unlikely to be due to any drastic conformational changes, as neither the enzyme activity nor the dimerization of the constructed molecule was affected. The findings of this study indicate that the transmembrane domain, in the context of its flanking sequences, is important for efficient Golgi to cell surface transport."
https://openalex.org/W1602947198,"Two distinct GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), i.e. rho GAPs of 28 kDa (GAP2) and of 190 kDa (p190), stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of the rho protein. The rho GAP activity of p190 resides in its C-terminal domain (p190C). Neither GAP2 nor p190C activates the ras GTPase. We replaced Asp65 and Asp67 residues of rho GTPase with the corresponding ras residues and examined whether the domain containing them is involved in its activation by rho GAPs. Mutation of either Asp65 to Glu or Asp67 to Ser did not change the Kd value for GTP gamma S of the rho protein. The Ser67 mutation reduced the intrinsic GTPase activity of the rho protein, while no change was observed with the Glu65 mutation. Both mutations abolished activation of rho GTPase by GAP2. The GAP2-dependent activation of rho GTPase was inhibited by the addition of GTP gamma S-bound wild type rho but not by either GTP gamma S-bound Glu65- or Ser67-rho, indicating that both Asp65 and Asp67 are essential for interaction of rho protein with GAP2. On the contrary, p190C activated both Glu65- and Ser67-rho GTPases to the extent and in a dose dependence to those seen in the wild GTPase. These results suggest that GAP2 and p190 interact with different residues or domains of the rho GTPase for their activation."
https://openalex.org/W1514603115,"Abstract We used hydrostatic pressure in the range of 1 to 2 kbar, coupled with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, to investigate the properties of monomers of dimeric ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. At temperatures below -5 degrees C or pressures above 1.5 kbar, only a diffuse band with low electrophoretic mobility was observed, which is assigned to a denatured monomer. In gels run at 1.0 kbar and temperatures above 0 degree C, both the wild type and a mutant in which a positively charged Lys at the dimer interface is replaced by a negatively charged glutamic acid displayed several discrete bands with retardation coefficients larger than that of the dimer. Cross-linking due to oxidation of cysteines was not the reason for the multiplicity of bands, which in addition were independent on the length of the electrophoretic run in the range of 1-3 h. Binding of 1,1'-bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid to the pressure dissociated monomers stabilized the unfolded conformations. We propose that the dissociated monomers adopt various expanded conformations, which, under the experimental conditions, are stabilized to the extent necessary to be considered as distinct chemical species. Gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography analysis of bands eluted from nonstained gels run at 1 kbar (15 degrees C) and 1.5 kbar (-5 degrees C), respectively, was performed. In both cases the dimeric structure was fully recovered, along with the spectroscopic properties and catalytic activity characteristic of the native dimer, indicating that the unresolved unfolded conformers that appear at -5 degrees C, as well as the set of discrete conformers obtained at 15 degrees C, are able to reconstitute a single active conformation on reassociation."

https://openalex.org/W1564866058,"The actin-activated ATPase activities of subfragment 1 (S1) produced from gizzard myosin by papain or Staphylococcus aureus protease are different. The activity of the latter is lower, in spite of the presence of intact 20,000-dalton light chains. To study this difference, the S. aureus protease S1 was subjected to further proteolysis by papain. This second stage of proteolysis markedly increased actin-activated ATPase, due to a decrease in K(actin) with no change in Vm and increased the affinity of S1 for actin in the presence of ATP. Treatment with papain caused degradation of the 20-kDa light chain, a decrease in the 26-kDa C-terminal domain of S1 and the 68-kDa fragment containing the N-terminal and central domains, and in the appearance and progressive increase of a 94-kDa fragment. The increase in actin-activated ATPase activity was due to the production of the 94-kDa fragment but not due to light chain degradation. Analyses of N-terminal sequences following papain digestion showed that the 94-kDa fragment was formed from a combination of the 68- and 26-kDa fragments. The bond formed probably involved the N-terminal residue of the 26-kDa fragment (Ser-643) and a side chain carboxyl (Glu-642) or amine (Glu-636). From the sequence data site A was identified as Glu-642-Ser-643. These results confirm the importance of site A in actin-binding of gizzard myosin. It is suggested that the sequence Ser-643 and Val-659, as well as the 3 lysine residues, are important for actin binding."
