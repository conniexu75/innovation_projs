https://openalex.org/W2160796815,"Modern computing technology is based on writing, storing and retrieving information encoded as magnetic bits. Although the giant magnetoresistance effect has improved the electrical read out of memory elements, magnetic writing remains the object of major research efforts1. Despite several reports of methods to reverse the polarity of nanosized magnets by means of local electric fields2,3 and currents4,5,6, the simple reversal of a high-coercivity, single-layer ferromagnet remains a challenge. Materials with large coercivity and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy represent the mainstay of data storage media, owing to their ability to retain a stable magnetization state over long periods of time and their amenability to miniaturization7. However, the same anisotropy properties that make a material attractive for storage also make it hard to write to8. Here we demonstrate switching of a perpendicularly magnetized cobalt dot driven by in-plane current injection at room temperature. Our device is composed of a thin cobalt layer with strong perpendicular anisotropy and Rashba interaction induced by asymmetric platinum and AlO x interface layers9,10. The effective switching field is orthogonal to the direction of the magnetization and to the Rashba field. The symmetry of the switching field is consistent with the spin accumulation induced by the Rashba interaction and the spin-dependent mobility observed in non-magnetic semiconductors11,12, as well as with the torque induced by the spin Hall effect in the platinum layer13,14. Our measurements indicate that the switching efficiency increases with the magnetic anisotropy of the cobalt layer and the oxidation of the aluminium layer, which is uppermost, suggesting that the Rashba interaction has a key role in the reversal mechanism. To prove the potential of in-plane current switching for spintronic applications, we construct a reprogrammable magnetic switch that can be integrated into non-volatile memory and logic architectures. This device is simple, scalable and compatible with present-day magnetic recording technology."

https://openalex.org/W1988848002,"Intestinal immune homeostasis depends on a tightly regulated cross talk between commensal bacteria, mucosal immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Epithelial barrier disruption is considered to be a potential cause of inflammatory bowel disease; however, the mechanisms regulating intestinal epithelial integrity are poorly understood. Here we show that mice with IEC-specific knockout of FADD (FADD(IEC-KO)), an adaptor protein required for death-receptor-induced apoptosis, spontaneously developed epithelial cell necrosis, loss of Paneth cells, enteritis and severe erosive colitis. Genetic deficiency in RIP3, a critical regulator of programmed necrosis, prevented the development of spontaneous pathology in both the small intestine and colon of FADD(IEC-KO) mice, demonstrating that intestinal inflammation is triggered by RIP3-dependent death of FADD-deficient IECs. Epithelial-specific inhibition of CYLD, a deubiquitinase that regulates cellular necrosis, prevented colitis development in FADD(IEC-KO) but not in NEMO(IEC-KO) mice, showing that different mechanisms mediated death of colonic epithelial cells in these two models. In FADD(IEC-KO) mice, TNF deficiency ameliorated colon inflammation, whereas MYD88 deficiency and also elimination of the microbiota prevented colon inflammation, indicating that bacteria-mediated Toll-like-receptor signalling drives colitis by inducing the expression of TNF and other cytokines. However, neither CYLD, TNF or MYD88 deficiency nor elimination of the microbiota could prevent Paneth cell loss and enteritis in FADD(IEC-KO) mice, showing that different mechanisms drive RIP3-dependent necrosis of FADD-deficient IECs in the small and large bowel. Therefore, by inhibiting RIP3-mediated IEC necrosis, FADD preserves epithelial barrier integrity and antibacterial defence, maintains homeostasis and prevents chronic intestinal inflammation. Collectively, these results show that mechanisms preventing RIP3-mediated epithelial cell death are critical for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and indicate that programmed necrosis of IECs might be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, in which Paneth cell and barrier defects are thought to contribute to intestinal inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2021009075,"The phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway is activated in cancer by genetic or epigenetic events and efforts are under way to develop targeted therapies. phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor is the major brake of the pathway and a common target for inactivation in glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive and therapy-resistant cancers. To achieve potent inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway in glioblastoma, we need to understand its mechanism of activation by investigating the interplay between its regulators. We show here that PTEN modulates the PI3K-Akt pathway in glioblastoma within a tumor suppressor network that includes Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) and pleckstrin-homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 (PHLPP1). The NHERF1 adaptor, previously characterized by our group as a PTEN ligand and regulator, shows also PTEN-independent Akt-modulating effects that led us to identify the PHLPP1/PHLPP2 Akt phosphatases as NHERF1 ligands. NHERF1 interacts via its PDZ domains with PHLPP1/PHLPP2 and scaffolds heterotrimeric complexes with PTEN. Functionally, PHLPP1 requires NHERF1 for membrane localization and growth-suppressive effects. PHLPP1 loss boosts Akt phosphorylation only in PTEN-negative cells and cooperates with PTEN loss for tumor growth. In a panel of low-grade and high-grade glioma patient samples, we show for the first time a significant disruption of all three members of the PTEN-NHERF1-PHLPP1 tumor suppressor network in high-grade tumors, correlating with Akt activation and patient's abysmal survival. We thus propose a PTEN-NHERF1-PHLPP PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitory network that relies on molecular interactions and can undergo parallel synergistic hits in glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2017191372,"Marine and ice-core records show that the Earth has experienced a succession of glacials and interglacials during the Quaternary (last ∼2.6 million years), although it is often difficult to correlate fragmentary terrestrial records with specific cycles. Aminostratigraphy is a method potentially able to link terrestrial sequences to the marine isotope stages (MIS) of the deep-sea record. We have used new methods of extraction and analysis of amino acids, preserved within the calcitic opercula of the freshwater gastropod Bithynia, to provide the most comprehensive data set for the British Pleistocene based on a single dating technique. A total of 470 opercula from 74 sites spanning the entire Quaternary are ranked in order of relative age based on the extent of protein degradation, using aspartic acid/asparagine (Asx), glutamic acid/glutamine (Glx), serine (Ser), alanine (Ala) and valine (Val). This new aminostratigraphy is consistent with the stratigraphical relationships of stratotypes, sites with independent geochronology, biostratigraphy and terrace stratigraphy. The method corroborates the existence of four interglacial stages between the Anglian (MIS 12) and the Holocene in the terrestrial succession. It establishes human occupation of Britain in most interglacial stages after MIS 15, but supports the notion of human absence during the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e). Suspicions that the treeless 'optimum of the Upton Warren interstadial' at Isleworth pre-dates MIS 3 are confirmed. This new aminostratigraphy provides a robust framework against which climatic, biostratigraphical and archaeological models can be tested."
https://openalex.org/W2039476205,"Post-translational modifications of histone proteins play a crucial role in responding to environmental stresses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of an acetyl group from histones and are generally believed to be a transcriptional repressor. In this paper, we report that cold treatment highly induces the up-regulation of HDACs, leading to global deacetylation of histones H3 and H4. Treatment of maize with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) under cold stress conditions strongly inhibits induction of the maize cold-responsive genes ZmDREB1 and ZmCOR413. However, up-regulation of the ZmICE1 gene in response to cold stress is less affected. The expression of drought and salt induced genes, ZmDBF1 and rab17, is almost unaffected by TSA treatment. Thus, these observations show that HDACs may selectively activate transcription. The time course of TSA effects on the expression of ZmDREB1 and ZmCOR413 genes indicates that HDACs appear to directly activate the ZmDREB1 gene, which in turn modulates ZmCOR413 expression. After cold treatment, histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation occurs in the ICE1 binding region, accompanied by an increase in accessibility to micrococcal nuclease (MNase). The two regions adjacent to the ICE1 binding site remain hypoacetylated and methylated. However, during cold acclimation, TSA treatment increases the acetylation status and accessibility of MNase and decreases DNA methylation at these two regions. However, TSA treatment does not affect histone hyperacetylation and DNA methylation levels at the ICE1 binding regions of the ZmDREB1 gene. Altogether, our findings indicate that HDACs positively regulate the expression of the cold-induced ZmDREB1 gene through histone modification and chromatin conformational changes and that this activation is both gene and site selective."
https://openalex.org/W1964588690,"The stromal microenvironment has key roles in prostate development and cancer, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) stimulate tumourigenesis via several mechanisms including the expression of pro-tumourigenic factors. Mesenchyme (embryonic stroma) controls prostate organogenesis, and in some circumstances can re-differentiate prostate tumours. We have applied next-generation Tag profiling to fetal human prostate, normal human prostate fibroblasts (NPFs) and CAFs to identify molecules expressed in prostatic stroma. Comparison of gene expression profiles of a patient-matched pair of NPFs vs CAFs identified 671 transcripts that were enriched in CAFs and 356 transcripts whose levels were decreased, relative to NPFs. Gene ontology analysis revealed that CAF-enriched transcripts were associated with prostate morphogenesis and CAF-depleted transcripts were associated with cell cycle. We selected mRNAs to follow-up by comparison of our data sets with published prostate cancer fibroblast microarray profiles as well as by focusing on transcripts encoding secreted and peripheral membrane proteins, as well as mesenchymal transcripts identified in a previous study from our group. We confirmed differential transcript expression between CAFs and NPFs using QrtPCR, and defined protein localization using immunohistochemistry in fetal prostate, adult prostate and prostate cancer. We demonstrated that ASPN, CAV1, CFH, CTSK, DCN, FBLN1, FHL1, FN, NKTR, OGN, PARVA, S100A6, SPARC, STC1 and ZEB1 proteins showed specific and varied expression patterns in fetal human prostate and in prostate cancer. Colocalization studies suggested that some stromally expressed molecules were also expressed in subsets of tumour epithelia, indicating that they may be novel markers of EMT. Additionally, two molecules (ASPN and STC1) marked overlapping and distinct subregions of stroma associated with tumour epithelia and may represent new CAF markers."
https://openalex.org/W2037590349,"In filamentous fungi, several lines of experimental evidence indicate that secondary metabolism is triggered by oxidative stress; however, the functional and molecular mechanisms that mediate this association are unclear. The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor AtfB, a member of the bZIP/CREB family, helps regulate conidial tolerance to oxidative stress. In this work, we investigated the role of AtfB in the connection between oxidative stress response and secondary metabolism in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus. This well characterized model organism synthesizes the secondary metabolite and carcinogen aflatoxin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with specific anti-AtfB demonstrated AtfB binding at promoters of seven genes in the aflatoxin gene cluster that carry CREs. Promoters lacking CREs did not show AtfB binding. The binding of AtfB to the promoters occurred under aflatoxin-inducing but not under aflatoxin-noninducing conditions and correlated with activation of transcription of the aflatoxin genes. Deletion of veA, a global regulator of secondary metabolism and development, nearly eliminated this binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that AtfB binds to the nor-1 (an early aflatoxin gene) promoter at a composite regulatory element that consists of highly similar, adjacent CRE1 and AP-1-like binding sites. The five nucleotides immediately upstream from CRE1, AGCC(G/C), are highly conserved in five aflatoxin promoters that demonstrate AtfB binding. We propose that AtfB is a key player in the regulatory circuit that integrates secondary metabolism and cellular response to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2078470010,"Many human diseases result from the influence of the nutritional environment on gene expression. The environment interacts with the genome by altering the epigenome, including covalent modification of nucleosomal histones. Here, we report a novel and dramatic influence of diet on the phenotype and survival of mice in which histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) is deleted postnatally in heart and skeletal muscle. Although embryonic deletion of myocardial Hdac3 causes major cardiomyopathy that reduces survival, we found that excision of Hdac3 in heart and muscle later in development leads to a much milder phenotype and does not reduce survival when mice are fed normal chow. Remarkably, upon switching to a high fat diet, the mice begin to die within weeks and display signs of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Down-regulation of myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic genes, specifically those involved in lipid metabolism, precedes the full development of cardiomyopathy, suggesting that HDAC3 is important in maintaining proper mitochondrial function. These data suggest that loss of the epigenomic modifier HDAC3 causes dietary lethality by compromising the ability of cardiac mitochondria to respond to changes of nutritional environment.

Metabolism of dietary lipids and carbohydrates is executed by metabolic enzymes that are subject to regulation by environmental factors at the transcriptional level through chromatin remodeling (6Desvergne B.

Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation is governed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), 2The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylaseMCKmuscle creatine kinaseMHCmyosin heavy chainHFDhigh fat dietANPatrial natriuretic peptideBNPB-type natriuretic peptideERRestrogen-related receptor. which are recruited to specific genomic locations by DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (9Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). In general, histone acetylation is associated with active gene expression, and many transcriptional coactivators contain histone acetyltransferase activity. Conversely, histone deacetylation is associated with gene repression (10Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 11Eberharter A.

Class I HDACs exist in multiprotein nuclear corepressor complexes.

Seto E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). HDAC3, another class I HDAC, exists in a different set of complexes that contain NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and/or SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid receptors), which function as activating subunits of the HDAC3 enzyme (14Guenther M.G.

Class II HDACs are dynamic in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and are regulated by several kinase signaling pathways (12Yang X.J. Seto E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Sirtuins are HDACs that are dependent upon NAD (13Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). HDACs have critical roles in cardiac development and function, as revealed by many genetic animal models. For example, mice lacking HDAC5 and HDAC9, class II HDACs, are sensitized to cardiac stress signals and develop severe cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload (18Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A.

Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Deficiency of sirtuin 1, sirtuin 3, or sirtuin 7 also results in specific cardiac defects (21Finkel T. Deng C.X. Mostoslavsky R.

Inactivation of HDAC2 results in resistance to cardiac hypertrophy, whereas transgenic overexpression of HDAC2 induces cardiac hypertrophy (20Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T.

In addition, deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 together in heart results in cardiac embryonic defects and lethality (23Montgomery R.L. Davis C.A. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Fielitz J. Qi X. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1790-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). A specific function for HDAC3 in cardiac development and function has been suggested by studies in which mid-gestational cardiac-specific deletion resulted in severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lethality by the age of 4 months (24Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S. Humphries K.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3588-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Embryonic gene inactivation in these studies, however, prevents the discrimination of gestational versus postnatal functions of HDAC3 and obscures the potential contributions of gene-environment interactions. Given the availability of many small molecules that can regulate HDAC enzyme activity and their potential value in treating various diseases, including cancer and heart disease, it is of interest and importance to define how postnatal manipulation of individual HDACs would affect the pathogenesis of diseases (25Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar, 26Drummond D.C. Noble C.O. Kirpotin D.B. Guo Z. Scott G.K. Benz C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 495-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Here, we report that mice in which HDAC3 is inactivated postnatally in both cardiac and skeletal muscle survive for over a year without obvious cardiac dysfunction when fed normal chow. However, these mice are exquisitely sensitive to their nutritive environment and exhibit severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure leading to death within weeks after switching to a high fat diet. Our work provides a mouse model for diet-inducible heart failure and suggests that HDAC3 is required for maintaining cardiac metabolic balance under lipid overload conditions. To generate mice with conditional HDAC3 null allele, LoxP sites were inserted into Hdac3 gene to flank exons 4–7, which encode a large region required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The targeting vector was based on BAC clone from C57BL/6 background, and homologous recombination was performed in C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells. Efficient recombination was confirmed. 3S. E. Mullican, C. A. Gaddis, T. Alenghat, M. G. Nair, P. R. Giacomin, L. Everett, D. Feng, D. J. Steger, J. Schug, and M. A. Lazar, submitted for publication. The HDAC3fl/fl mice were cross-bred with MCK-Cre mice (from the Jackson Laboratory) to generate HDAC3fl/fl/MCK-Cre mice that were referred to as MCH3-KO in this study. The control mice were HDAC3fl/fl that were referred to as wild-type (WT) in this study. Mice were housed under the 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycles (lights on at 7 a.m., lights off at 7 p.m.). All mice used in this study were males. High fat diet (HFD) containing 60 kcal % fat was purchased from Research Diets Inc. (D12492i). For fasting studies, fasting was started before the dark cycle. All the animal care and use procedures followed the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. For Western blot, tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 0.5 mm DTT. Lysates containing 80 μg of total protein were resolved by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with anti-HDAC3 antibody (AbCAM) and anti-HSP90 antibody (Cell Signaling). For tissue triglyceride assay, heart samples were homogenized in tissue lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris and 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) first by Tissuemiser (Fisher) and then by TissueLyser (Qiagen) with steel beads. Triglyceride concentration in the lysates was then quantified using LiquiColor triglyceride assay kit (StanBio). Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) and High Pure RNA tissue kit (Roche Applied Science). Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR was performed with High Capacity reverse transcription kit, Power SYBR Green PCR MasterMix, and the PRISM 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using absolute quantification method with standard curves. 36B4 (Arbp) was used as the housekeeping control. Primer sequences were as follows: HDAC3, TTGGTATCCTGGAGCTGCTT and GACCCGGTCAGTGAGGTAGA; ANP, GCTTCCAGGCCATATTGGAGCAAA and TGACCTCATCTTCTACCGGCATCT; BNP, AATGGCCCAGAGACAGCTCTTGAA and CTTGTGCCCAAAGCAGCTTGAGAT; and 36B4, CTGGGACGATGAATGAGGAT and AGCAGCTGGCACCTAAACAG. For microarray (GEO accession number GSE31251), hearts were harvested from four MCH3-KO mice and four control mice at the age of 6 weeks. The total of eight RNA samples was individually processed with the Ambion WT expression kit and GeneChip WT terminal labeling and controls kit (Affymetrix) and hybridized to the Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix). The array was then read by GCS3000 laser scanner (Affymetrix), and microarray image analysis was carried out by Penn Microarray Core using Partek Genomics Suite software. Subsequent analysis was carried out using BioConductor. Data from the eight samples were subjected to background subtraction, quantile normalization, log2 transformation, and probe set summarization using the Robust Multichip Average algorithm (27Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8307) Google Scholar). Only the probe sets that interrogate genes were retained, and those meant for quality control and normalization purposes were excluded from further analysis. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays procedure (28Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar) was then used to obtain multiple test corrected q values for differential expression of genes between the hearts from MCH3-KO mice and control. Genes up-regulated or down-regulated in MCH3-KO hearts were selected with a maximum q value of 0.05 and a minimum absolute fold-change of 1.2. Gene ontology analysis was performed in David Informatics Resources 6.7 with GO BP-FAT (29Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24210) Google Scholar). For Oil Red O staining, 5-μm frozen sections were prepared from snap-frozen heart tissues and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 3 min. The sections were then stained in 0.5% Oil Red O in propylene glycerol and then in hematoxylin for nucleus for 5 s. The procedures were performed by the Morphology Core in the Pennsylvania Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases. For H&E and trichrome staining, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for overnight, dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded, and 5-μm sections were prepared. Staining was performed according to standard procedures by Histology and Gene Expression Core in the Pennsylvania Cardiovascular Institute. Wheat germ agglutinin staining was performed on paraffin-embedded cross-sections of ventricles, using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (20 μg/ml in PBS) (Sigma L5226). Quantification of myocyte diameter was performed in a blinded manner using ImageJ software. Myocyte diameter for each heart was calculated based on six random ×20 fields of view. The average diameter of the group was calculated from three WT and five KO hearts. The muscle strength in the forelimbs was measured with a grip meter (TSE; Bad Hamburg, Germany). Briefly, mice were trained to grasp a horizontal metal bar while being pulled by their tail, and the force was detected by a sensor. Ten measurements were determined for each mouse and averaged. The procedure was performed by Mouse Phenotyping, Physiology, and Metabolism Core in the Pennsylvania Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. The Vevo 770 ultrasound system (VisualSonics Inc) was used with an attached Integrated Rail System III for imaging acquisition. Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane mixed with 100% oxygen through an inhalation tube. Core body temperature of the mouse was monitored by a rectal temperature probe and maintained at 37–38 °C by a tensor lamp throughout the procedure. The chest area was depilated to improve contact for the ultrasound transducer. The electrocardiographic signal was obtained from the electrode platform. Two-dimensional images were obtained at 180 frames/s using a 30-MHz probe (RMV 707B, Visual Sonics) in the parasternal long and short axis views to guide M-mode analysis at the midventricular level. Left ventricular fractional shortening, ejection fraction, and wall dimensions were computed from M-mode measurements using the Vevo 770 standard measurement package. Image measurement and analysis were performed by researchers who were blinded to the mouse genotype. For all the analysis except microarray, Student's t test was performed to determine significance of differences between two groups with each containing multiple samples from different individual mice. A previous study utilized myosin heavy chain α (MHCα)-Cre to delete cardiac HDAC3 at approximately embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) (24Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S.

This resulted in efficient deletion of HDAC3 from both heart and skeletal muscle of adult mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with a previous report (34He Y. Hakvoort T.B. Köhler S.E.

To distinguish these mice from the mice in which HDAC3 was deleted using MHCα-Cre (24Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S. Humphries K.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R.

MCH3-KO mice were born in Mendelian ratios and exhibited no obvious abnormalities when fed normal chow. They survived in equal numbers with control littermates to at least the age of 14 months and had normal body weight (Fig. 2, A and B). This is in contrast to mice in which HDAC3 was deleted from the heart in mid-gestation, which resulted in lethality by the age of 4 months (24Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S. Humphries K.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3588-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Indeed, at 4 months of age, MCH3-KO hearts did not show obvious abnormalities by gross appearance (Fig. 2C), although heart weight to tibia length ratios were modestly increased, suggesting mild cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 2D). Cardiac expression of ANP and BNP, markers of heart failure, were unchanged relative to control HDAC3fl/fl mice (Fig. 2E). Histology of MCH3-KO hearts appeared normal at the age of 4 months (supplemental Fig. S1A) and electrocardiography (ECG) revealed no evidence of arrhythmia (supplemental Fig. S1B). By 8 months of age, MCH3-KO hearts exhibited only very mild fatty infiltration (Fig. 2F). To functionally characterize hearts of the MCH3-KO mice, echocardiography was performed on 4-month-old mice. MCH3-KO hearts showed thickening of ventricular walls and interventricular septae, as well as enlarged atria, but cardiac contractile function was preserved (Fig. 3A). MCH3-KO hearts exhibited slightly enhanced systolic function, as evidenced by increased fraction shortening and ejection fraction (Fig. 3B). In addition, skeletal muscle from MCH3-KO mice had normal grip strength and weight (Fig. 4, A and B), with no overt histological abnormalities at 8 months (Fig. 4C). Thus, postnatal muscle-specific deletion of HDAC3 did not reduce survival when mice were fed normal chow. Cardiac contractile function was preserved with only mild cardiohypertrophy, and skeletal muscles show no obvious alterations.FIGURE 4No significant alteration of function or morphology of HDAC3-deficient skeletal muscles.

Gene ontology analysis showed that genes down-regulated in MCH3-KO myocardium were substantially enriched in mitochondrial bioenergetic processes and lipid metabolism, whereas genes up-regulated in MCH3-KO myocardium were enriched in immune responses (supplemental Fig. S3). Further pathway analysis showed that many differentially expressed genes encode enzymes that are involved in mitochondrial electron transport, ATP synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, glycerolipid, and phospholipid metabolism (Table 1). Myocardial triglycerides were significantly elevated in the MCH3-KO hearts after 24 h of fasting (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with abnormal lipid metabolism and bioenergetics in the HDAC3-deficient myocardium.TABLE 1Genes differentially expressed in KO versus WT myocardiumProcessGeneGene nameFold-change KO vs. WTq valueElectron transport chain and ATP synthesisAtp5g1ATP synthase, H+-transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit C1−1.550.022Atp5g2ATP synthase, H+-transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit C2−1.310.036Atp5lATP synthase, H+-transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit g−1.280.025Atp5sATP synthase, H+-transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit s−1.210.044Cox15COX15 homolog, cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (yeast)−1.300.024Cox19COX19 cytochrome c oxidase assembly homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)−1.250.030Ndufs1NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 1−1.300.021Ndufaf4NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1α subcomplex, af 4−1.260.027Ndufs2NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 2−1.240.025Ndufs8NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 8−1.230.029Ndufv1NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 1−1.200.040TCA cycleAco1Aconitase 1−1.310.022Fh1Fumarate hydratase 1−1.310.021Idh1Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble−1.210.042Mdh2Malate dehydrogenase 2, NAD (mitochondrial)−1.290.024OgdhlOxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like−3.670.019Pdha1Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α1−1.210.027SdhbSuccinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit B, iron sulfur (Ip)−1.200.027SdhaSuccinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein (Fp)−1.190.029Fatty acid metabolismCpt1bCarnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b, muscle−1.490.020EhhadhEnoyl-coenzyme A, hydratase−1.260.039AcadsAcyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, short chain−1.550.020Acad8Acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase family, member 8−1.360.021CrotCarnitine O-octanoyltransferase−1.330.023PeciPeroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-coenzyme A isomerase−1.270.026Acss1Acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 1−1.380.021Acsl5acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 5+1.340.026Acot2Acyl-CoA thioesterase 2−1.550.020Glycerolipid metabolismAgpat91-Acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 9−1.340.022Akr1b10Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B10 (aldose reductase)−2.200.019Dgat1Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1−1.580.020GykGlycerol kinase−1.390.020Other metabolic processUcp2Uncoupling protein 2 (mitochondrial, proton carrier)+2.060.019Ucp3Uncoupling protein 3 (mitochondrial, proton carrier)+1.960.020G6pdxGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase X-linked+1.410.022Me3Malic enzyme 3, NADP(+)-dependent, mitochondrial−1.190.033Pdk1Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 1−1.260.027Pfkfb16-Phosphofructo-2-kinase−2.060.019Transcription regulationPpargc1bPeroxisome proliferative-activated receptor, γ, coactivator 1β−1.260.044MlxiplMLX interacting protein-like−1.530.020Ireb2Iron-responsive element-binding protein 2−1.210.029 Open table in a new tab The altered gene expression profiles of MCH3-KO hearts led us to test the hypothesis that MCH3-KO mice might be susceptible to cardiomyopathy when fed a HFD. Remarkably, when placed on a diet containing 60% fat by kilocalorie at 1 month of age, MCH3-KO mice began to die within weeks, with most dying between 3 and 4 months on the HFD and none surviving beyond the age of 6 months (Fig. 6A). By contrast, 100% of control HDAC3fl/fl mice were alive on the same dietary regimen (Fig. 6A). Until shortly before death, MCH3-KO and control HDAC3fl/fl mice gained similar amounts of weight (Fig. 6B and data not shown). We next characterized cardiac morphology, architecture, and function of 4-month-old mice fed for 3 months on HFD. Hearts from HFD-fed MCH3-KO hearts were enlarged with significantly elevated heart weight to tibia length ratios when compared with control HDAC3fl/fl mice (Fig. 6, C and D). Myocardial expression of ANP and BNP was significantly elevated, suggesting the existence of heart failure (Fig. 6E). Moreover, cardiac histology and trichrome staining revealed widespread fibrosis throughout the ventricles (Fig. 6F). Wheat germ agglutinin staining of cross-sections of ventricles showed significantly increased cardiomyocyte diameter in MCH3-KO hearts, suggesting that myocyte hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia, underlies the cardiohypertrophy (Fig. 6G). Echocardiography demonstrated severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with marked thickening of left and right ventricular walls and the interventricular septum (Fig. 7, A and C). MCH3-KO hearts at 4 months after HFD exhibited significant ventricular systolic dysfunction, as evidenced by impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction (Fig. 7, B and C). Increased isovolumic relaxation time and the markedly enlarged left atrium suggest that diastolic function of the left ventricle was also substantially impaired (Fig. 7, A and B). Short axis echocardiographic video clips showed obvious motion abnormality of the ventricle wall (supplemental video clips A and B). Taken together, loss of cardiac HDAC3 in the presence of lipid overload and obesity caused severe cardiac contractile dysfunction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that lead to heart failure and lethality. We have shown that MCH3-KO mice, with postnatal cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific deletion of HDAC3, do not exhibit significant myocardial dysfunction on normal chow, but develop severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, fibrosis, and heart failure leading to death when fed a high fat diet. These findings underscore the importance of gene-diet interactions that can powerfully impact cardiovascular health. It is of great interest to compare our results with the report of Montgomery et al. (24Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S. Humphries K.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R.

https://openalex.org/W2003730569,"The approval of histone deacetylase inhibitors for treatment of lymphoma subtypes has positioned histone modifications as potential targets for the development of new classes of anticancer drugs. Histones also undergo phosphorylation events, and Haspin is a protein kinase the only known target of which is phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 residue (H3T3ph), which is necessary for mitosis progression. Mitotic kinases can be blocked by small drugs and several clinical trials are underway with these agents. As occurs with Aurora kinase inhibitors, Haspin might be an optimal candidate for the pharmacological development of these compounds. A high-throughput screening for Haspin inhibitors identified the CHR-6494 compound as being one promising such agent. We demonstrate that CHR-6494 reduces H3T3ph levels in a dose-dependent manner and causes a mitotic catastrophe characterized by metaphase misalignment, spindle abnormalities and centrosome amplification. From the cellular standpoint, the identified small-molecule Haspin inhibitor causes arrest in G2/M and subsequently apoptosis. Importantly, ex vivo assays also demonstrate its anti-angiogenetic features; in vivo, it shows antitumor potential in xenografted nude mice without any observed toxicity. Thus, CHR-6494 is a first-in-class Haspin inhibitor with a wide spectrum of anticancer effects that merits further preclinical research as a new member of the family of mitotic kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2049368749,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease characterized by late diagnosis and treatment resistance. Recurrent genetic alterations in defined genes in association with perturbations of developmental cell signaling pathways have been associated with PDAC development and progression. Here, we show that GATA6 contributes to pancreatic carcinogenesis during the temporal progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia by virtue of Wnt pathway activation. GATA6 is recurrently amplified by both quantitative-PCR and fluorescent in-situ hybridization in human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and in PDAC tissues, and GATA6 copy number is significantly correlated with overall patient survival. Forced overexpression of GATA6 in cancer cell lines enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in vitro and growth in vivo, as well as increased Wnt signaling. By contrast siRNA mediated knockdown of GATA6 led to corresponding decreases in these same parameters. The effects of GATA6 were found to be due to its ability to bind DNA, as forced overexpression of a DNA-binding mutant of GATA6 had no effects on cell growth in vitro or in vivo, nor did they affect Wnt signaling levels in these same cells. A microarray analysis revealed the Wnt antagonist Dickopf-1 (DKK1) as a dysregulated gene in association with GATA6 knockdown, and direct binding of GATA6 to the DKK1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transient transfection of GATA6, but not mutant GATA6, into cancer cell lines led to decreased DKK1 mRNA expression and secretion of DKK1 protein into culture media. Forced overexpression of DKK1 antagonized the effects of GATA6 on Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. These findings illustrate that one mechanism by which GATA6 promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis is by virtue of its activation of canonical Wnt signaling via regulation of DKK1."
https://openalex.org/W2050788001,"The active site of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase centre, catalyses two reactions, namely, peptide bond formation between peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA as well as the release-factor-dependent hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA. Unlike peptide bond formation, peptide release is strongly impaired by mutations of nucleotides within the active site, in particular by base exchanges at position A2602 (refs 1, 2). The 2'-OH group of A76 of the peptidyl-tRNA substrate seems to have a key role in peptide release. According to computational analysis, the 2'-OH may take part in a concerted 'proton shuttle' by which the leaving group is protonated, in analogy to similar current models of peptide bond formation. Here we report kinetic solvent isotope effects and proton inventories (reaction rates measured in buffers with increasing content of deuterated water, D(2)O) of the two reactions catalysed by the active site of the Escherichia coli ribosome. The transition state of the release factor 2 (RF2)-dependent hydrolysis reaction is characterized by the rate-limiting formation of a single strong hydrogen bond. This finding argues against a concerted proton shuttle in the transition state of the hydrolysis reaction. In comparison, the proton inventory for peptide bond formation indicates the rate-limiting formation of three hydrogen bonds with about equal contributions, consistent with a concerted eight-membered proton shuttle in the transition state. Thus, the ribosome supports different rate-limiting transition states for the two reactions that take place in the peptidyl transferase centre."
https://openalex.org/W2003075078,"Activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor II (BMPRII) promotes pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) survival, proliferation, and migration. Mutations to BMPRII are associated with the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Endothelial dysfunction, including decreased endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and loss of bioactive nitric oxide (NO), plays a prominent role in the development of PAH. We hypothesized that stimulation of BMPRII promotes normal PAEC function by activating eNOS. We report that BMPRII ligands, BMP2 and BMP4, (i) stimulate eNOS phosphorylation at a critical regulatory site, (ii) increase eNOS activity, and (iii) result in canonical changes in eNOS protein-protein interactions. The stimulation of eNOS activity by BMPRII ligands was largely dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) activation, as demonstrated using the PKA inhibitors H89 and myristoylated PKI(6-22) amide. PAEC migration stimulated by BMP2 and BMP4 was inhibited by the NOS inhibitor l-nitroarginine methyl ester, providing functional evidence of eNOS activation. Furthermore, BMP2 and BMP4 failed to stimulate eNOS phosphorylation when BMPRII was knocked down by siRNA. Most important to the pathophysiology of the disease, BMP2 and BMP4 failed to stimulate eNOS phosphorylation in PAECs isolated from patients with mutations in the BMPR2 gene. These data demonstrate a new action of BMPs/BMPRII in the pulmonary endothelium and provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2071282917,"Cutaneous nerves are increased in atopic dermatitis, and itch is a prominent symptom. We studied the functional interactions between eosinophils and nerves in human and mouse skin and in culture. We demonstrated that human atopic dermatitis skin has eosinophil granule proteins present in the same region as increased nerves. Transgenic mice in which interleukin-5 (IL-5) expression is driven by a keratin-14 (K14) promoter had many eosinophils in the epidermis, and the number of nerves was also significantly increased in the epidermis. In co-cultures, eosinophils dramatically increased branching of sensory neurons isolated from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice. This effect did not occur in DRG neurons co-cultured with mast cells or with dead eosinophils. Physical contact of the eosinophils with the neurons was not required, and the effect was not blocked by an antibody to nerve growth factor. DRG neurons express eotaxin-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which may be important in the recruitment, binding, and activation of eosinophils in the region of cutaneous nerves. These data indicate a pathophysiological role for eosinophils in cutaneous nerve growth in atopic dermatitis, and suggest they may present a therapeutic target in atopic dermatitis and other eosinophilic skin conditions with neuronal symptoms such as itch."
https://openalex.org/W2161861711,"The unique properties of engineered nanoparticles (ENs) that make their industrial applications so attractive simultaneously raise questions regarding their environmental safety. ENs exhibit behaviors different from bulk materials with identical chemical compositions. Though the nanotoxicity of ENs has been studied intensively, their unintended environmental impacts remain largely unknown. Herein we report experimental results of EN interactions with exopolymeric substances (EPS) from three marine phytoplankton species: Amphora sp., Ankistrodesmus angustus and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. EPS are polysaccharide-rich anionic colloid polymers released by various microorganisms that can assemble into microgels, possibly by means of hydrophobic and ionic mechanisms. Polystyrene nanoparticles (23 nm) were used in our study as model ENs. The effects of ENs on EPS assembly were monitored with dynamic laser scattering (DLS). We found that ENs can induce significant acceleration in Amphora sp. EPS assembly; after 72 hours EN-EPS aggregation reached equilibrium, forming microscopic gels of ∼4-6 µm in size. In contrast, ENs only cause moderate assembly kinetic acceleration for A. angustus and P. tricornutum EPS samples. Our results indicate that the effects of ENs on EPS assembly kinetics mainly depend on the hydrophobic interactions of ENs with EPS polymers. The cycling mechanism of EPS is complex. Nonetheless, the change of EPS assembly kinetics induced by ENs can be considered as one potential disturbance to the marine carbon cycle."

However, many aspects of tumor-promoting activity of VEGF-C and consequences of its downregulation for tumor progression remain poorly understood. To clarify these points, we created a set of VEGF receptor 3-positive lung carcinoma A549 and colon carcinoma HCT116 cell sublines with stable repression of VEGF-C synthesis. Analysis of the behavior of these cells revealed multiple effects of VEGF-C downregulation, which, in addition to deceleration of cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and inhibition of lymphangiogenesis in tumor and surrounding tissues observed earlier, included previously undescribed effects, in particular, partial restoration of epithelial phenotype, reduction in the percentage of tumor-initiating cells (cancer stem cells) in the cell population and inhibition of metastasis of orthotopic lung cancer xenografts to other lung lobes. These results are consistent with the idea of high potentiality of VEGF-C as a cancer drug target."
https://openalex.org/W1981943058,"Secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma is the result of malignant transformation of a pre-existing osteochondroma, the most common benign bone tumor. Osteochondromas are caused by genetic abnormalities in EXT1 or EXT2: homozygous deletion of EXT1 characterizes sporadic osteochondromas (non-familial/solitary), and germline mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 combined with loss of heterozygosity define hereditary multiple osteochondromas. While cells with homozygous inactivation of EXT and wild-type cells shape osteochondromas, the cellular composition of secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas and the role of EXT in their formation have remained unclear. We report using a targeted-tiling-resolution oligo-array-CGH (array comparative genomic hybridization) that homozygous deletions of EXT1 or EXT2 are much less frequently detected (2/17, 12%) in sporadic secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas than expected based on the assumption that they originate in sporadic osteochondromas, in which homozygous inactivation of EXT1 is found in ∼80% of our cases. FISH with an EXT1 probe confirmed that, unlike sporadic osteochondromas, cells from sporadic secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas predominantly retained one (hemizygous deleted loci) or both copies (wild-type) of the EXT1 locus. By immunohistochemistry, we confirm the presence of cells with dysfunctional EXT1 in sporadic osteochondromas and show cells with functional EXT1 in sporadic secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. These immuno results were verified in osteochondromas and secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas in the setting of hereditary multiple osteochondromas. Our data therefore point to a model of oncogenesis in which the osteochondroma creates a niche in which wild-type cells with functional EXT are predisposed to acquire other mutations giving rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, indicating that EXT-independent mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma."

TREX1 mutations at amino acid positions Asp-18 and Asp-200 in familial chilblain lupus and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome elicit dominant immune dysfunction phenotypes. Failure to appropriately disassemble genomic DNA during normal cell death processes could lead to persistent DNA signals that trigger the innate immune response and autoimmunity. We tested this concept using dsDNA plasmid and chromatin and show that the TREX1 exonuclease locates 3′ termini generated by endonucleases and degrades the nicked DNA polynucleotide. A competition assay was designed using TREX1 dominant mutants and variants to demonstrate that an intact DNA binding process, coupled with dysfunctional chemistry in the active sites, explains the dominant phenotypes in TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H alleles.

IntroductionDeoxyribonucleases are essential enzymes acting to degrade DNA polynucleotides in the orchestrated processes of dismantling dying cells and in defense from invading pathogens. Failure to efficiently degrade superfluous DNA macromolecules can result in persistent nucleic acids that activate the mammalian immune system (1Crow Y.J. Rehwinkel J. Hum. Mol.

TREX1 is a 314-amino acid polypeptide containing a robust 3′-exonuclease that degrades ssDNA and dsDNA and is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells (2Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J.

The catalytic core of TREX1 is contained in the N-terminal 242 amino acids, and the C-terminal 72 amino acids contain a hydrophobic region that localizes TREX1 to the endoplasmic reticulum in the perinuclear space of cells (5Chowdhury D.

The disease phenotypes in dominant FCL and AGS patients correlate best with the dsDNA degradation activities measured in the TREX1 D18N and D200N enzymes and not with the ssDNA degradation activities (23Lehtinen D.A.

We have proposed that the inability to perform chemistry of phosphodiester bond cleavage resulting from the D18N or D200N mutation might trap the TREX1 mutant enzyme onto the dsDNA in a nonproductive enzyme-DNA complex at the site of the nick. These data support the proposal that TREX1 degrades dsDNA by acting at 3′ termini generated by the NM23-H1 endonuclease during cell death (5Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P. Zhang D. Sung J.S. Demple B. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The studies presented here show that the dsDNA degradation activities of TREX1 enzymes containing the FCL and AGS dominant D18N, D200N, and D200H mutations are defective and that these mutants inhibit the dsDNA degradation activity of TREX1WT enzyme, likely present in cells of these patients. The dominant effect of these TREX1 mutant enzymes is dependent upon the functional DNA binding by residues Arg-174 and Lys-175 positioned adjacent to the active sites and the Arg-128 positioned in the catalytic cores (see Fig. 1). In addition, metal-dependent DNA binding in the active sites of the catalytically inactive dominant TREX1 mutants contributes to DNA retention and precludes access to the DNA 3′ termini of nicked dsDNA by the TREX1WT enzyme.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe TREX1 exonuclease degrades ssDNA and dsDNA polynucleotide substrates containing available 3′ termini. Structural studies of the TREX1-DNA complex provide direct evidence for ssDNA binding of at least four nucleotides in length in the active sites (Fig. 1) (21de Silva U. Choudhury S. Bailey S.L. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues Asp-18 and Asp-200 are two of the divalent metal ion Mg2+-coordinating aspartates in the TREX1 active site that contribute to DNA binding and are required for catalysis. Residues Arg-174 and Lys-175 located on a flexible loop adjacent to the active sites and Arg-128 in the catalytic core are positioned appropriately to function in DNA binding to locate available 3′ termini and generate ssDNA for entry into the active sites.The TREX1 ssDNA Exonuclease Activities of Dominant MutantsThe dominant TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H de novo and inherited mutations have been identified in FCL and AGS (12Lee-Kirsch M.A. Chowdhury D.

Lee-Kirsch M.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 1469-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The dominant phenotypes caused by these TREX1 alleles and the metal binding functions of these residues suggest a common mechanism of dysfunction. TREX1 is a homodimer, so TREX1 dimers in cells of these heterozygous individuals could be TREX1MUT/MUT and TREX1WT/WT homodimers and TREX1WT/MUT heterodimers. Therefore, the TREX1D200H/D200H and TREX1WT/WT homodimers and TREX1WT/D200H heterodimers were prepared, and the ssDNA degradation activities of these enzymes were compared with the activities of the TREX1 D18N and D200N mutants that we had previously determined (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The ssDNA exonuclease activities of the dominant TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H homodimers were reduced by more than 104-fold when compared with TREX1WT. The activities of the TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H heterodimers are reduced by only 1.5-, 2.6-, and 1.5-fold when compared with TREX1WT (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The ∼2-fold loss in activity of the TREX1 heterodimers indicates that the TREX1WT protomer within the dimer retains fully functional ssDNA degradation activity. This ∼50% reduction in ssDNA degradation activity has been demonstrated in patient cells carrying the D200N allele (14Rice G. Newman W.G. Dean J. Patrick T. Parmar R. Flintoff K. Robins P. Harvey S.

The ssDNA degradation activities of the TREX1 dominant mutants suggest that TREX1 protomers within the dimer can act independently during the degradation of small ssDNA substrates.TABLE 1Relative ssDNA exonuclease activities of TREX1WT and dominant variantsTREX1Relative activityaActivities were derived from reactions in Fig. 2 or as previously reported.

Open table in a new tab The TREX1 dsDNA Exonuclease Activities of Dominant MutantsThe dominant negative effects of the TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H alleles are apparent upon examination of the dsDNA degradation activities. The TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H protomers within the heterodimers exhibit a dominant inhibitory effect on the dsDNA degradation activities of the TREX1WT protomer. Incubation of nicked plasmid dsDNA with TREX1WT homodimer results in the degradation of the nicked polynucleotide strand and the accumulation of the un-nicked ssDNA strand (Fig. 3A, lane 2). In contrast, the TREX1WT/D18N, TREX1WT/D200H, and TREX1WT/D200N heterodimers do not degrade the nicked dsDNA plasmid (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–5). Additions of up to 10-fold higher concentrations of the TREX1 mutant heterodimers resulted in no detectable dsDNA degradation (Ref. 23Lehtinen D.A. Harvey S. Mulcahy M.J. Hollis T. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31649-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and data not shown). These data indicate that the dominant TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H heterodimers exhibit at least a 200-fold decreased level of dsDNA degradation activity relative to TREX1WT in contrast to the modest ∼2-fold level of reduced ssDNA degradation activity by these mutant heterodimers (Table 1).The TREX1 Dominant Mutants Inhibit the TREX1WT dsDNA Degradation ActivityThe TREX1 D200H protomers in the TREX1D200H/D200H homodimers and TREX1WT/D200H heterodimers exhibit a dominant inhibitory effect on the dsDNA degradation activity of TREX1WT. The TREX1WT enzyme was mixed with increased amounts of the TREX1D200H/D200H and TREX1WT/D200H enzymes and incubated with the nicked dsDNA plasmid (Fig. 3B). In these reactions, the TREX1WT competes with the mutant TREX1 enzyme to degrade the nicked dsDNA plasmid. The amount of TREX1WT (76 nm) added in these reactions is 10-fold higher than the amount required to degrade the nicked polynucleotide of the dsDNA (23Lehtinen D.A. Harvey S. Mulcahy M.J. Hollis T. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31649-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The presence of increased amounts of the TREX1D200H/D200H (Fig. 3B, lanes 8–12) and TREX1WT/D200H (Fig. 3B, lanes 13–17) results in decreased dsDNA degradation activity by the TREX1WT enzyme as evidenced by the increased amount of remaining nicked dsDNA. The inhibition of TREX1WT dsDNA degradation activity by the TREX1D200H/D200H and TREX1WT/D200H enzymes is similar to that previously demonstrated with the TREX1 D18N and D200N mutations (23Lehtinen D.A. Harvey S. Mulcahy M.J. Hollis T. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31649-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The potent inhibition of TREX1WT dsDNA degradation activity exhibited by TREX1 dimers containing D18N, D200N, and D200H protomers could explain the dominant phenotypes exhibited by these TREX1 mutant alleles described in FCL and AGS (12Lee-Kirsch M.A. Chowdhury D.

These data suggest that FCL and AGS TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H heterozygote patients likely have varying mixtures of TREX1 WT and mutant homo- and heterodimers. The TREX1 D18N-, D200N-, and D200H-containing dimers would likely inhibit the TREX1WT dsDNA degradation activity in these cells.Identification of TREX1 Residues Contributing to DNA BindingThe TREX1 Arg-174, Lys-175, and Arg-128 residues are positioned within the enzyme to participate in DNA binding. To measure the contribution of these residues in the TREX1-catalyzed reaction, a series of variant enzymes was generated in which each of these residues was changed to alanine individually or in combinations. The TREX1 and variant proteins were tested to confirm the presence of nuclease activity using a 30-mer oligonucleotide and to establish the relative ssDNA excision activities (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The TREX1R174A and TREX1K175A exhibit no loss of activity, and the TREX1R174A,K175A shows a modest ∼3-fold reduced excision activity relative to the TREX1WT. These data indicate some contribution to ssDNA binding by the Arg-174 and Lys-175 that is satisfied by the presence of one of these residues on the flexible loop. The TREX1R128A exhibits an ∼2-fold reduced excision activity relative to the TREX1WT, also indicating a modest contribution to ssDNA binding by the Arg-128 located in the catalytic core. The TREX1R128A,R174A and TREX1R128,K175A double mutants exhibit ∼3-fold reduced excision activities, consistent with the requirement for one of the positively charged flexible loop residues (Arg-174 or Lys-175) and Arg-128 in the core for full ssDNA exonuclease activity. The TREX1R128A,R174A,K175A triple mutant exhibits an ∼30-fold reduced excision activity, further demonstrating the requirement for a single positively charged residue positioned on the flexible loop and the Arg-128 within the catalytic core for full ssDNA degradation activity. Also, a steady-state kinetic analysis indicated an ∼35-fold higher Km value for the TREX1R128A,R174A,K175A when compared with the TREX1WT protein and similar kcat values, confirming the structural integrity of the mutant enzyme and further supporting the diminished DNA binding potential (data not shown). However, the ∼3-fold magnitude in loss of TREX1 catalytic function upon mutation of the flexible loop Arg-174 and Lys-175 residues contrasts sharply with the ∼200-fold loss of TREX2 catalytic function upon mutation of the comparable Arg-163, Arg-165, and Arg-167 flexible loop residues (Refs. 28Perrino F.W. de Silva U.

Their interconversion between active, GTP-bound states and inactive, GDP-bound states is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins. The substrates for most Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are unknown. Rab9A and its effectors regulate transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. We show here that RUTBC1 is a Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 domain-containing protein that binds to Rab9A-GTP both in vitro and in cultured cells, but is not a GTPase-activating protein for Rab9A. Biochemical screening of RUTBC1 Rab protein substrates revealed highest in vitro GTP hydrolysis-activating activity with Rab32 and Rab33B. Catalysis required Arg-803 of RUTBC1, and RUTBC1 could activate a catalytically inhibited Rab33B mutant (Q92A), in support of a dual finger mechanism for RUTBC1 action. Rab9A binding did not influence GAP activity of bead-bound RUTBC1 protein. In cells and cell extracts, RUTBC1 influenced the ability of Rab32 to bind its effector protein, Varp, consistent with a physiological role for RUTBC1 in regulating Rab32. In contrast, binding of Rab33B to its effector protein, Atg16L1, was not influenced by RUTBC1 in cells or extracts. The identification of a protein that binds Rab9A and inactivates Rab32 supports a model in which Rab9A and Rab32 act in adjacent pathways at the boundary between late endosomes and the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles."

We demonstrated that overexpressed HO-1 promotes the survival of renal cancer cells by inhibiting cellular apoptosis; we also showed that the proto-oncogene H-Ras becomes activated in these cells under stress following treatment with immunosuppressive agents. However, it is not known if there is an association between Ras activation and HO-1 overexpression. Here, we examined if the activation of H-Ras pathway could induce HO-1, and promote the survival of renal cancer cells (786-0 and Caki-1). In co-transfection assays, using HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct, we found that the activated H-Ras, H-Ras(12V), promoted HO-1 transcriptional activation. The inhibition of endogenous H-Ras by specific dominant-negative mutant/siRNA markedly ablated the HO-1 promoter activity. Active H-Ras increased HO-1 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, transfection with effector domain mutant constructs of active H-Ras showed that H-Ras-induced HO-1 overexpression was primarily mediated through the Raf signaling pathway. Using pharmacological inhibitor, we observed that ERK is a critical intermediary molecule for Ras-Raf-induced HO-1 expression. Activation of H-Ras and ERK promoted nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 for its binding to the specific sequence of HO-1 promoter. The knockdown of Nrf2 significantly inhibited H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcription. Finally, by FACS analysis using Annexin-V staining, we demonstrated that the H-Ras-ERK-induced and HO-1-mediated pathway could protect renal cancer cells from apoptosis.

The dominant element in the E1 and E2 regions is the anti-oxidant response element (ARE)/stress-responsive element (StRE), which mediates transcriptional activation through the binding of transcription factors in response to most of the HO-1 inducers (18Kivelä A.M.

However, the intricate signaling mechanism(s) for the induction of HO-1 transcription, particularly in cancer cells, is not well defined. The ras family of proto-oncogenes encodes small proteins that transduce mitogenic signals from tyrosine kinase receptors (23Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem.

Ras proteins act as molecular switches that cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms (25Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A.

The three isoforms of Ras, H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells (28Omerovic J. Hammond D.E. Clague M.J. Prior I.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hyperactive Ras can promote the growth and development of cancer cells even without being mutated, where it may be activated by persistent upstream signaling events (29Datta D. Flaxenburg J.A.

Upon activation, Ras transmits signals to a cascade of protein kinases that have MAP kinase kinase (MEK) as substrate, such as MEK kinase, c-Raf-1, and B-Raf, culminating in the activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) (32Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Ras may function primarily to promote the translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where subsequent Ras-independent events trigger Raf-1 kinase activation (33Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). However, despite the evidence that Raf-1 is a critical downstream effector of Ras function, there is increasing evidence that Ras may also mediate its action through Raf-independent pathways, including Rho- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (34Khosravi-Far R.

We have recently demonstrated that H-Ras becomes activated in human renal cancer cells under stress following treatment with immunosuppressive agents, and the activated H-Ras induces tumorigenic pathways (37Datta D.

We have also observed that the expression of HO-1 is significantly up-regulated in renal cancer tissues, and the overexpressed HO-1 can inhibit tumor cell apoptosis (38Datta D. Banerjee P. Gasser M.

In the present study, we show that activated H-Ras promotes the transcriptional activation of HO-1 in human renal cancer cells; and H-Ras-induced HO-1 overexpression is mediated primarily through the Raf-MAPK signaling pathway involving the transcription factor Nrf2, which leads to the survival of renal cancer cells. Cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) was obtained from Frontier Scientific. The gene-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for H-Ras, Raf-1, Nrf2, HO-1, and their respective controls were purchased from Qiagen. The transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

The human renal cancer cell lines (786–0 and Caki-1) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. 786-0 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, and Caki-1 cells were grown in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) were purchased from Clonetics and cultured in complete epithelial medium (REGM BulletKit). Tissue samples of human renal cell cancer (RCC) were obtained from surgical specimens of patients who underwent surgery at the University Hospital (Wurzburg, Germany). The protocol to obtain tissue samples was approved by the review board of the hospital. Normal renal tissues were obtained from normal parts of the surgical specimens, and the normalcy of these tissues was confirmed by histology. A human HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct was obtained as a gift from J. Alam of Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, LA (20Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S.

The plasmid phHO4luc was constructed by cloning the promoter fragment from the human HO-1 gene (bp −4067 to +70 relative to transcription start site) into the luciferase reporter gene vector pSKluc. All Ras expression constructs encode mutant versions of the transforming human H-Ras(12V), and were obtained as generous gifts from Roya Khosravi-Far (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). The pDCR-ras(12V), pDCR-ras(12V, 35S), pDCR-ras(12V,37G), and pDCR-ras(12V,40C) mammalian constructs encode effector domain mutants of H-Ras(12V) in which expression is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (34Khosravi-Far R.

The Ras(17N) and RhoA(19N) dominant-negative plasmids inhibit the function of endogenous Ras (27Khosravi-Far R. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Solski P.A. Eva A. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using cloned AMV first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). To analyze mRNA expression, we performed real-time PCR using the Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression product (TaqMan, Mammalian Gene Collection probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). As an internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was amplified and analyzed under identical conditions. Gene-specific primer-probe sets for human HO-1/GAPDH were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Ct value (the cycle number at which emitted fluorescence exceeded an automatically determined threshold) for gene of interest was corrected by the Ct value for GAPDH and expressed as ΔCt. The fold change of mRNA amount was calculated as follows: (fold changes) = 2X (where X = ΔCt for control group - ΔCt for experimental group). 786-0 or Caki-1 (2.5 × 105 cells) were transfected with the Ras expression plasmids or the HO-1 promoter-luciferase plasmid using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was normalized using a control empty expression vector. For luciferase assay, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a standard assay kit (Promega) in a luminometer. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, the cells were co-transfected with β-galactosidase gene under control of cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using standard assay system (Promega); luciferase activity measurement was corrected for the transfection efficiency by calculating the ratio of luciferase units to β-galactosidase units, represented as the relative luciferase counts. Protein samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation). The membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-Ras (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-HO-1 (R & D systems); anti-H-Ras, anti-Raf-1, anti-Lamin A, and anti-Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-β-actin and anti-GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were subsequently incubated with peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and the reactive bands were detected by using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections of human renal cell cancer (RCC) tissues and normal renal tissues. Briefly, acetone-fixed sections were incubated first with anti-human Nrf2 (Abcam), and second with a species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Specimens were washed thoroughly in between incubations, developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (BioGenex), and counterstained in Meyer's Hemalaun using standard techniques. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using a Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif). The purities of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were confirmed by checking the expression of a cytoplasmic protein GAPDH and a nuclear protein Lamin A. The binding of the activated transcription factor Nrf2 to the specific DNA sequence was measured by using TransAM Nrf2 ELISA kit (Active Motif). Briefly, the kit contains stripwell plate to which multiple copies of specific double-stranded oligonucleotide for Nrf2 consensus-binding site (ARE) has been immobilized. When nuclear extract is added to each well, the activated Nrf2 binds specifically to this plate-bound oligonucleotide. Nrf2-specific primary antibody is then added followed by subsequent incubation with secondary antibody and developing solution. Quantitative analysis is performed by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. Cellular apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining using Annexin-V FITC/APC Apoptosis Detection Kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following staining, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur. Statistical evaluation for data analysis was determined by Student's t test. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We have recently demonstrated that the activation of H-Ras plays a crucial role in the accelerated growth of human renal tumors under stress following treatment with immunosuppressive agents (37Datta D. Contreras A.G. Basu A. Dormond O. Flynn E. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 8902-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); we have also observed that HO-1 is markedly overexpressed in renal cancer tissues, and the overexpressed HO-1 can mediate anti-apoptotic signals in renal cancer cells (38Datta D. Banerjee P. Gasser M. Waaga-Gasser A.M. Pal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36842-36848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, both H-Ras and HO-1 may induce pro-tumorigenic pathways in human renal cancer cells to promote rapid growth of the tumors. However, we did not examine if there is any association between H-Ras activation and HO-1 overexpression in human renal cancer. Here, we first wished to evaluate if the activation of H-Ras can regulate HO-1 promoter activity in human renal cancer cell lines (Caki-1 and 786–0). Both the cells express H-Ras, and its expression is higher in cancer cells compared with normal renal epithelial cells (supplemental Fig. S1). The cells were co-transfected with the HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct and either the plasmid expressing activated form of H-Ras, H-Ras(12V), or the empty expression vector (control). The effect of H-Ras on HO-1 promoter activation was assessed by the measurement of luciferase activity in cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the activation of H-Ras significantly increased HO-1 promoter activity in both the cell lines compared with vector controls. The expression of H-Ras(12V) plasmid in the transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom panels). Next, to check whether the inhibition of endogenous H-Ras can block HO-1 transcription, we first used a dominant-negative plasmid construct of Ras, Ras(17N). 786-0 cells were co-transfected with the HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct and either Ras(17N) or the empty expression vector. We observed that transfection with Ras(17N) significantly inhibited HO-1 promoter activity compared with vector controls (Fig. 1C). The expression of Ras(17N) plasmid in the transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). We also found that the knockdown of endogenous H-Ras in 786-0 cells by siRNA transfection significantly down-regulated HO-1 promoter activity compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). The knockdown of H-Ras was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). It has been reported that the growth factor PDGF can induce Ras pathway through the tyrosine kinase receptor PDGFR (39Ekman S. Thuresson E.R. Heldin C.H. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), known to be expressed in renal cancer cells (40Xu L. Tong R. Cochran D.M. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5711-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we also tested if PDGF treatment can promote HO-1 transcriptional activation in renal cancer cells. We observed that the treatment with PDGF indeed increased HO-1 promoter activity in Caki-1 cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). Together, these observations suggest that activation of H-Ras promotes the transcriptional activation of HO-1 in human renal cancer cells. Here, we examined if the activation of H-Ras could increase mRNA and protein expression of HO-1 in 786-0 and Caki-1 cells. The cells were transfected with either H-Ras(12V) or the empty expression vector. Through real-time PCR, we found that in both the cell lines, transfection of active H-Ras significantly increased the expression of HO-1 mRNA compared with vector controls (Fig. 2, A and B). We next checked the expression level of HO-1 protein following H-Ras activation. Through Western blot analysis, we observed that active H-Ras markedly induced HO-1 protein expression compared with vector controls (Fig. 2, C and D); however, there was no significant change (data not shown) in the expression of HO-2, which is the non-inducible and constitutive isoform of the enzyme. Thus, the activation of H-Ras in renal cancer cells promotes HO-1 overexpression at both mRNA and protein levels. It is established that the activation of Ras can trigger several associated signaling molecules, including Raf, Rho, and PI3K (34Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A.

Here, we wanted to evaluate which effector molecule(s) is involved in channeling H-Ras-induced signals for HO-1 transcriptional activation. To this end, we made use of three effector loop mutant constructs of H-Ras; H-Ras(12V,35S) retains full-length Raf-1 binding activity, H-Ras(12V,37G) retains Rho binding activity, and H-Ras(12V,40C) retains PI3K binding activity (34Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). 786-0 and Caki-1 cells were transfected with the HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct, and either one of the H-Ras effector domain mutants or the empty expression vector; and luciferase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, we observed that in both the cell lines, there was significant increase in HO-1 promoter activity following transfection with H-Ras(12V,35S) compared with vector controls. The mutant H-Ras(12V,37G) also induced HO-1 promoter activity, however, the effect was less compared with H-Ras(12V,35S). In contrast, the mutant H-Ras(12V,40C) failed to induce HO-1 promoter activity in both the cell lines. The protein expression of the H-Ras effector loop mutant constructs in the transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, A and B, right panels). Also, we confirmed that only H-Ras(12V,35S) can induce the phosphorylation of ERK (p44), while H-Ras(12V,40C) can induce the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3A, right panels). Together, these observations suggest that the Raf signaling pathway is primarily involved in channeling H-Ras-induced signals for HO-1 transcriptional activation in renal cancer cells; also, the PI3K pathway may not be involved in H-Ras-induced activation of the HO-1 promoter. Our previous experiment suggested a role of the Raf signaling pathway in H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcription. To confirm the role of Raf-1 kinase in this process, we co-transfected our cells (786-0 and Caki-1) with the HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct and the H-Ras(12V) plasmid in absence or presence of Raf-1 kinase inhibitor (RKI); and luciferase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the activation of H-Ras significantly increased HO-1 promoter activity compared with empty vector controls; and the inhibition of Raf-1 with pharmacological inhibitor markedly decreased H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcriptional activation compared with vehicle-treated controls. We also confirmed that the knockdown of Raf-1 in 786-0 cells using siRNA significantly down-regulated H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcriptional activation (Fig. 4C). In addition, the knockdown of Raf-1 was associated with a significant decrease in HO-1 protein expression as observed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C, right panel). We also found that the knockdown of Raf-1 inhibited PDGF-induced (known to activate the Ras pathway) HO-1 transcriptional activation (supplemental Fig. S2B). Our earlier experiments suggested that although the Raf signaling pathway is primarily involved in channeling H-Ras-induced signals for HO-1 transcription, the Rho pathway may also play some role. Here, we used a dominant-negative plasmid of RhoA [RhoA(19N)] to check if it can downregulate H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcriptional activation. We observed that with the transfection of RhoA(19N), there was a partial, but not significant inhibition of H-Ras-induced HO-1 promoter activity (supplemental Fig. S3). It is established that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a critical downstream effector molecule of the Ras-Raf signaling cascade (32Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 34Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Thus, we next examined if ERK plays a role in H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcription. 786–0 cells were co-transfected with the HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct and H-Ras(12V) in the absence or presence of MEK inhibitor PD98059 (known to inhibit ERK), and luciferase assay was performed. We found that in presence of PD98059, there was a significant decrease in H-Ras-induced HO-1 promoter activity compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4D). Together, our findings suggest that Raf and ERK are critical intermediary signaling molecules i"

Drosophila melanogaster has two homologs of NADPH oxidase, dNox and dDuox, with functions that remain unclear in vivo. To clarify these functions, two independent transgenic fly lines expressing dsRNA targeted for different portions of dDuox mRNA were used. In both flies, en-GAL4> UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 and en-GAL4> UAS-dDuoxIR370–518, in which dDuox was knocked down selectively in the posterior area of the wing disc, the posterior compartment of the adult wings became paler and more fragile with wing veins that were indistinct by comparison with the anterior one. Fluorescence staining of the en-GAL4> UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 adult wings revealed that the ROS concentration in the posterior compartment was significantly lower than that in the anterior compartment. Moreover, in these flies, the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal disc showed a greater number of apoptotic cells detected by immunostaining with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody than those in the anterior compartment. Respective knockdown of tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase showed paler wing blades in the posterior compartment similar to the phenotype of dDuox-knockdown files. Along with this observation, analysis of the catecholic and dityrosine components in the wings of adult flies proved that dDuox plays important roles in the stabilization of the cuticle structure of the wings via tyrosine cross-linking, the sclerotization and melanization processes possibly through ROS production. These dDuox-knockdown fly lines would be useful tools for further studying dDuox functions during the development of Drosophila. NADPH oxidase produces reactive oxygen species (ROS).

During the 1990s, many lines of evidence demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesROSreactive oxygen spiecesUASupstream activating sequenceIRinverted repeatscDNAcomplementary DNACM-H2DCFDA5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetatedsRNAdouble-strand RNADopa3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. were intentionally generated in diverse tissues by several members of NADPH oxidases identified in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals, nematodes, fruit flies, green plants, fungi, and slime molds (1Kawahara T. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These enzymes contain a conserved Nox domain, including the NADPH-binding site at the COOH terminus, the FAD-binding site, six conserved transmembrane domains, and 4 highly conserved heme-binding histidines (2Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar, 3Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar). One special group of this family is named Duox (dual oxidase) for containing an additional peroxidase-like domain (4Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends. Biochem.

In humans, dual oxidases, hDuox1 and hDuox2, originally described as thyroid oxidases, were first discovered in the thyroid gland. A combination of several analytical methods showed that hDuox enzymes are also expressed in airway epithelial cells, although the mucosal surface of the trachea and the bronchi preferentially express hDuox1 (6Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). hDuox2 is located mainly at the apical membrane of enterocytes and in the brush border of the cecum and sigmoidal colon in the intestinal tract (7El Hassani R.A.

Besides, these enzymes are present in a wide variety of tissues such as brain, cerebellum, mammary gland, muscle, nerve, placenta, and testis (8Ris-Stalpers C. Antioxid.

The NADPH oxidase family produces ROS that play important roles in many biological processes. When the phagocyte respiratory burst was discovered, Nox2-derived ROS were found to have a key role in host defense (2Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar). However, under the control of a signaling network, dual oxidases produce ROS essential for killing microbes in normal host survival (6Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 9Ha E.M. Oh C.T. Bae Y.S. Lee W.J. Science. 2005; 310: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 10Ha E.M. Lee K.A. Seo Y.Y. Kim S.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Kim J. Lee W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ROS also inhibit phosphatases, activate kinases, and regulate ion channels and Ca2+ signaling (2Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar). Protein oxidation by ROS provides a general form of signal that is used by many signaling pathways (3Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar). In humans, Duox proteins produce hydrogen peroxide required for the oxidation step of iodide in thyroid hormone production (8Ris-Stalpers C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Moreno J.C. Bikker H. Kempers M.J. van Trotsenburg A.S. Baas F. de Vijlder J.J. Vulsma T. Ris-Stalpers C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Additionally, Duox catalyzes the cross-linking of tyrosine residues in extracellular matrix modification (12Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 13Wong J.L. Créton R. Wessel G.M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 801-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Despite the increasing importance of NADPH oxidase and ROS, their functions are not fully understood, especially those of Duox. Because of the wide distribution and high conservation across many organisms, the function of NADPH oxidase enzymes and ROS can be studied using simpler model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster. Only two NADPH oxidases, dNox and dDuox, exist in Drosophila. Both are highly homologous, but dDuox has an additional peroxidase domain that can produce H2O2. Both enzymes are expressed widely in various tissues such as head, eye, midgut, crop, heart, and ovary. Particularly, dDuox is abundantly expressed in the larval hindgut, trachea, and adult ovary (14Chintapalli V.R. Wang J. Dow J.A. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). dNox was found to regulate agonist-induced calcium flux and smooth muscle contraction in ovarian tissue. Depletion of dNox resulted in a marked deficit in female egg-laying caused by a defect in ovulation (15Ritsick D.R. Edens W.A. Finnerty V. Lambeth J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, a signaling network composed of complex positive and negative mechanisms that control the expression and activity of dDuox to produce ROS was required for normal host survival in response to colonization of commensal or infectious microbes (9Ha E.M. Oh C.T. Bae Y.S. Lee W.J. Science. 2005; 310: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 10Ha E.M. Lee K.A. Seo Y.Y. Kim S.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Kim J. Lee W.J. Nat.

Cell. 2009; 16: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the present study, the function of dDuox was further examined by selective knockdown of the dDuox gene in Drosophila by the GAL4-UAS expression system in combination with RNA interference. GAL4, a yeast transcriptional activator, can activate the transcription of any gene if the gene is preceded by a GAL4 upstream activating sequence (UAS) that consists of five optimized GAL4 binding sites (17Phelps C.B. Brand A.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The GAL4 driver line of Drosophila contains the GAL4 gene downstream of the tissue-specific promoter. By crossing the GAL4 driver line with the fly line carrying the UAS-dDuoxIR gene, GAL4 proteins were expressed in specific cells and tissues of the progenies, which then activated the expression of the hairpin double-strand RNA of dDuox that led to the knockdown of the dDuox gene. The present work clarified that dDuox, possibly through ROS production, is required for normal wing development in Drosophila, particularly for the stabilization of the cuticle structure of the wings via the sclerotization, melanization, and tyrosine cross-linking processes. Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C on standard food. The Canton S fly was used as the wild-type strain. The UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 fly line was kindly provided by Dr. Won-Jae Lee, of Ewha Womans University (South Korea) (9Ha E.M. Oh C.T. Bae Y.S. Lee W.J. Science. 2005; 310: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). RNAi stocks 3308 and 3330 carrying inverted repeats of tyrosine hydroxylase (UAS-paleIR) and the dopa-decarboxylase gene (UAS-ddcIR), respectively, were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center. All other lines used in the present study, including GAL4 driver lines, were obtained from the stock center in Bloomington, Indiana. The following primers were used for constructing the UAS-dDuoxIR370–518 fly lines: dDuoxIR-F, 5′-AGTGGCTAGCATCCGGTTCTCTGTTCAGATGTGCand dDuoxIR-R, 5′-CGCTGCTAGCATCCGTGCTGTTCACTATGATGTC. NheI sites are underlined. To obtain and clone an extracellular region of dDuox into pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare), the following PCR primers were synthesized chemically: dDuox-F, 5′- GCGTAAGATCTGTACTAATGGGCTTGGCTTCGC and dDuox-R, 5′-CCAGTCTCGAGTCAGAACACATCCTTTTGGATCTCCTCC. BglII and XhoI sites are underlined and double-underlined, respectively. To avoid the potential off-target effect of dDuox double-strand RNA (dsRNA), two independent UAS-dDuoxIR fly lines containing the inverted repeats (IR) targeted to two non-overlapped regions of the dDuox gene were required. One of them, the UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 fly line, of which the targeted region was from amino acids 976 to 1145, was kindly provided by Dr. Won-Jae Lee. Another second-independent UAS-dDuoxIR369–518 fly line, of which the targeted region was from amino acids 369 to 518 selected by E-RNAi web application (22Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Agapite J. White K. Steller H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1694-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), was constructed by the following cloning steps. mRNAs of Canton S flies were extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for amplifying the dDuox cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1106–1554) by using the SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum® TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) with primer oligonucleotides dDuoxIR-F and dDuoxIR-R. Then, the PCR product was digested with NheI and inserted into the NheI site downstream of the UAS sequence of the pWIZ vector to generate the pWIZ-dDuox370–518 vector (18Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Methods. 2003; 30: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Afterward, the PCR product digested with NheI was inserted again into the AvrII site of the pWIZ- dDuox370–518 vector to make a pWIZ-dDuoxIR370–518 vector containing an inverted repeat. The cDNA corresponding to the extracellular region of dDuox protein-encoding amino acids 418–591 was amplified from mRNAs of Canton S flies by using the SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum® TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers dDuoxF and dDuoxR. Then, the PCR product was digested with BglII and XhoI and inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6P1 vector (GE Healthcare). Next, the obtained pGEX-dDuox was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 to express GST-dDuox fusion proteins. Lysates of the E. coli BL21 cells were prepared by sonication in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min and applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The adsorbed GST-dDuox fusion proteins were treated with Precision protease (GE Healthcare) for 16 h at 4 °C, and then dDuox protein was eluted with PBS. The purified dDuox protein was used to elicit polyclonal antibody production in guinea pigs. Polyclonal antibodies reacting with dDuox were affinity-purified from the anti-serum of guinea pigs using HiTrap NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide)-activated HP (GE Healthcare) coupled with GST-dDuox fusion protein after passage through GST-conjugated Sepharose HP. P element-mediated germ line transformation was carried out by microinjection of the pWIZ-dDuoxIR370–518 vector into fertilized eggs as described in a previous study (19Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F1 transformants were selected on the basis of white eye color rescue (19Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This group has established seven independent transgenic lines carrying UAS-dDuoxIR370–518. Although essentially, the same results were obtained with these lines, line 14 carrying UAS-dDuoxIR370–518 on the third chromosome was used to double-check the phenotype of dDuox-knockdown flies. UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 transgenic flies were crossed with several GAL4 driver lines as listed in Table 1 and reared at 28 °C. The en-GAL4/CyO;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 line was maintained and used for further testing. The second UAS-dDuoxIR370–518 transgenic flies were crossed with the en-GAL4 driver line to confirm the dDuox knockdown phenotype and exclude the potential off-target effects of dDuox dsRNA. The tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase gene was knocked down by crossing UAS-paleIR or UAS-ddcIR with the en-GAL4 driver, respectively.TABLE 1Summary of phenotypes induced by knockdown of dDuox with various GAL4 driver linesGAL4 lineExpression of GAL4 (knockdown of dDuox)Phenotype with UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145Act5CAll tissueLethalTubPAll tissueLethalEyEye discNo detectable phenotypeGMRCells behind the morphogenetic furrow of eye discDark circlec179Embryonic mesoderm, larval muscles and wing imaginal discsPupa lethal5053AEmbryonic longitudinal muscles, some cells in gutNo detectable phenotypeEnPosterior area of wing discsHeld-out wings, indistinct wing veins, paler and fragile posterior compartmentsVeWing disc, follicle cell, central nervous system and othersNo detectable phenotypeMS1096Dorsal wing discHeld-out and fragile wings Open table in a new tab The dDuox gene was knocked down by leaky expression of the Hs-GAL4 driver at 25 °C. Whole extracts from third-instar larvae were electrophoretically separated on 6% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare) in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol for 4 h at 4 °C. Blotted membranes were blocked with TBS solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h at 25 °C. Then, membranes were incubated with guinea pig anti-dDuox antibodies produced in the present study at 1:1000 dilution, or mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies at 1:1000 dilution (Sigma) at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) or anti-mouse IgG (BioSource) at a 1:10,000 dilution for 2 h at 25 °C. Detections were performed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The images were analyzed by Lumivision ProHSII image analyzer (Aisin Seiki, Aichi, Japan). Third-instar larvae were dissected in PBS, and wing discs were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C. After washing with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST), samples were blocked for 30 min at 25 °C with 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Samples were then incubated with rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100 dilution at 4 °C for 16 h. After extensive washing with PBST, the samples were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa FluorTM 488 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at a 1:400 dilution for 2 h at 25 °C, further washed with PBST and PBS, and then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Preparations were examined under a fluorescence BX-50 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan). Adult wings from newly hatched en-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/+ flies were dissected in PBS and then incubated with 10 μm 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 5 min. After washing three times with PBS, samples were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Preparations were examined under a fluorescence BX-50 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan). Wings of 3-day-old flies were hydrolyzed by 6 m HCl in evacuated test-tubes at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolytic products from 5 adult wings were dried and dissolved in 300 μl of amino acid analyzer buffers (pH 2.2). 50 μl of these samples were analyzed for amino acid composition and concentrations using an amino acid analyzer (Hitachi, model L-8500A, Tokyo, Japan). The experiments were repeated three times. Wings of 3-day-old flies were hydrolyzed under the same conditions described in the preceding paragraph. The hydrolysate of 15 adult wings were dried and dissolved in 1200 μl of PBS. Then, 100 μl samples were coated on wells and left overnight at 4 °C. After coating and washing with PBS solution containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TPBS), the plate was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C and then incubated with a monoclonal antibody against dityrosine, which was kindly provided by Dr. Yoji Kato (University of Hyogo), at 1:200 dilution (5 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at 25 °C (20Kato Y. Wu X. Naito M. Nomura H. Kitamoto N. Osawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After washing five times with TPBS, the wells were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (BioSource) at 1:5000 dilution for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Color development was performed by reaction of the conjugated peroxidase with 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and H2O2 (Wako). Absorbance at 492 nm was measured by a microplate reader (MTP-120, Corona Electric). Wells without a coating step were used as a negative control. The experiment was repeated three times. Hydrolytic products from 40 adult wings were dissolved in 200 μl of 1 n HCl, 50 μl of which was analyzed for catechols by reacting with ammonium-iron citrate and 1,10-phenanthroline (21Rioux C. Jordan D.C. Rattray J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of the reagent solutions were prepared daily. The total volume of the assay was decreased to 250 μl for application to a microplate scale. 200 μm l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-Dopa) in 0.1 n H2SO4 was used as a positive control. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured using a microplate reader (MTP-120, Corona Electric, Japan). The experiment was performed in triplicate each time and repeated three times. The results are expressed as means ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences was evaluated using a t test for two samples assuming either equal or unequal variances. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. The present study crossed the UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 fly line with several GAL4 driver lines that express GAL4 selectively in various tissues to investigate the function of dDuox. As summarized in Table 1, knockdown of dDuox in the whole bodies of the flies by Act5C-GAL4 and Tub-GAL4 or in the mesoderm, muscles, and wing discs by c179-GAL4 caused lethal effects suggesting that the dDuox gene is essential to the normal development of Drosophila. The abnormal phenotype on the wings was observed in adults by knockdown of the dDuox gene with en-GAL4 and MS1096-GAL4 drivers. The compound eyes of flies in which the dDuox gene was knocked down by the GMR-GAL4 driver exhibited dark circles inside ommatidia (Fig. S1). However, a knockdown of dDuox by ey-GAL4, 5053-GAL4, and ve-GAL4 drivers showed no detectable phenotypes. This is possibly because of a low level of GAL4 protein expressed under the control of these promoters, which led to the insufficient expression of dDuox dsRNA in these flies. Because the phenotype was easily recognizable, the present study focused on the wing phenotype of dDuox-knockdown flies by the en-GAL4 driver for further experiments. The flies carrying a single copy of both the en-GAL4 driver and UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 (en-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/+) showed the held-out wings phenotype with an indistinct wing veins in the posterior compartments (Fig. 1, b and b′) compared with those of the control flies containing one copy of en-GAL4 only (en-GAL4/+;+, Fig. 1, a and a′). Moreover, the colors of the posterior compartments of these flies were paler than the anterior ones, probably due to less pigmentation in the posterior area. These effects may be caused by the disruption of some developmental processes of the wings, including wing pigmentation. A BLAST search was used to verify that the dsRNA of the dDuox RNAi gene in UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 had no significant perfect matches in 19–21 nucleotides of other sequences in the fly genome, thereby eliminating potential problems with cross-silencing (9Ha E.M. Oh C.T. Bae Y.S. Lee W.J. Science. 2005; 310: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). To further exclude possible off-target affects, the UAS-dDuoxIR370–518 line, into which the RNAi gene corresponding to amino acids from 370 to 518 was introduced, was constructed. The second-independent dDuox-knockdown flies were established by crossing with the en-GAL4 driver. The phenotype of flies en-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR370–518/+ was essentially the same as that of the flies carrying a single copy of both the en-GAL4 driver and UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 (en-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/+) (Fig. 1, c and c′) indicating that the effects were truly caused by specific knockdown of the dDuox gene. The age-dependant change of wing morphology was examined for 20 flies from each group: the control (en-GAL4; +) and dDuox-knockdown flies (en-GAL4; UAS-dDuoxIR976–11). In flies containing two copies of both en-GAL4 and UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145, the posterior area of wings appeared lightly crinkled and damaged around 3 days after hatching (Fig. 2, b and b′). After 6 days, the damage had increased in severity (Figs. 2c and c′). The crinkled and damaged areas indicated by the dashed circles in Fig. 2 were observed for all dDuox-knockdown flies examined at 6 days after hatching. Conversely, in the control group containing two copies of en-GAL4 alone, no damage was observed 6 days after hatching (Fig. 2, d and d′). These results indicate that the dDuox-knockdown wings are more fragile and that the knockdown effects are age-dependent. To confirm that dsRNA976–1145 silenced the expression of the dDuox gene, the dDuox protein level was analyzed by Western immunoblot using anti-dDuox polyclonal antibody produced in guinea pigs. Anti-α-tubulin antibody detected bands at ∼55 kDa confirming the equivalent protein loading between the extracts of Canton S (wild-type) and the leaky knockdown strain (Hs-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/+ flies) (Fig. 3). With anti-dDuox antibody, the expected 180 kDa band was detected in the larval extracts from Canton S as a single band. The band was significantly decreased by 72% in extracts from Hs-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/+, indicating that dsRNA976–1145 had successfully silenced the expression of the dDuox gene. The results also indicated the high specificity of anti-dDuox antibody. It is known that Duox has an important role in producing ROS, especially H2O2 (6Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the activity of dDuox enzyme in knockdown flies, adult wings of en-GAL4/+;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/+ were reacted with a non-fluorescent substrate, CM-H2DCFDA, which can be oxidized by ROS to generate an intracellular green fluorescent product. The ROS signal was quite strong in the anterior compartment of the adult wing, whereas there was no detectable signal in the posterior compartment in which dDuox dsRNA was specifically expressed (Fig. 4, b and b′). In contrast, adult wings of the control flies (en-GAL4/+; +) showed strong fluorescent signals in both the posterior and anterior compartments (Fig. 4, a and a′). These results suggested that dDuox functions to produce ROS in wings, and ROS production was suppressed by dDuox-knockdown. The observation that dDuox-knockdown flies had fragile wing blades suggested the possible involvement of an apoptosis process. Therefore, the third instar larval wing discs of the control and the dDuox-knockdown flies were immunostained with anti-cleaved caspase-3 IgG to detect caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 5, d and e). The posterior compartment of the wing imaginal disc in which dDuox was knocked down by the en-GAL4 driver exhibited increased apoptotic cells compared with those of control flies. As shown in Fig. 5g, the difference in apoptotic cell number in the posterior areas between dDuox-knockdown flies and control flies was statistically significant (p < 0.05, Student's t test), whereas that in the anterior areas was not. These results indicated that knockdown of dDuox in the wing disc induced apoptosis. In Drosophila, three positive regulators of apoptosis have been identified. These genes, reaper (rpr), head involution defective (hid), and grim, all lie at the locus 75C1-2 (22Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Agapite J. White K. Steller H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1694-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The dDuox-knockdown flies en-GAL4/CyO;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145 were crossed with the chromosome deficiency line Df(3L)H99 in which these three genes had been deleted. The dDuox-knockdown wing phenotype in heterozygous progenies (Fig. 1, d and d′) were suppressed effectively and showed nearly the same phenotype as the control flies (Fig. 1, a and a′). In the posterior compartment of the imaginal wing discs in heterozygous progenies, apoptotic cells were clearly reduced (Fig. 5f) compared with those of the knockdown flies (en-GAL4/CyO;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145, Fig. 5e). As shown in Fig. 5g, the difference in apoptotic cell number in posterior areas between dDuox-knockdown flies and en-GAL4/CyO;UAS-dDuoxIR976–1145/H99 flies was statistically significant (p < 0."
https://openalex.org/W2150539937,"The causes, modes, biological role and prospective significance of cell death in preimplantation development in humans and other mammals are still poorly understood. Early bovine embryos represent a very attractive experimental model for the investigation of this fundamental and important issue.To obtain reference data on the temporal and spatial occurrence of cell death in early bovine embryogenesis, three-dimensionally preserved embryos of different ages and stages of development up to hatched blastocysts were examined in toto by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In parallel, transcript abundance profiles for selected apoptosis-related genes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our study documents that in vitro as well as in vivo, the first four cleavage cycles are prone to a high failure rate including different types of permanent cell cycle arrest and subsequent non-apoptotic blastomere death. In vitro produced and in vivo derived blastocysts showed a significant incidence of cell death in the inner cell mass (ICM), but only in part with morphological features of apoptosis. Importantly, transcripts for CASP3, CASP9, CASP8 and FAS/FASLG were not detectable or found at very low abundances.In vitro and in vivo, errors and failures of the first and the next three cleavage divisions frequently cause immediate embryo death or lead to aberrant subsequent development, and are the main source of developmental heterogeneity. A substantial occurrence of cell death in the ICM even in fast developing blastocysts strongly suggests a regular developmentally controlled elimination of cells, while the nature and mechanisms of ICM cell death are unclear. Morphological findings as well as transcript levels measured for important apoptosis-related genes are in conflict with the view that classical caspase-mediated apoptosis is the major cause of cell death in early bovine development."

However, under normal physiological conditions, the encapsulation of Hb inside red blood cells (RBCs) significantly retards NO scavenging, permitting NO to reach the smooth muscle. The rate-limiting factors (diffusion of NO to the RBC surface, through the RBC membrane or inside of the RBC) responsible for this retardation have been the subject of much debate. Knowing the relative contribution of each of these factors is important for several reasons including optimization of the development of blood substitutes where Hb is contained within phospholipid vesicles. We have thus performed experiments of NO uptake by erythrocytes and microparticles derived from erythrocytes and conducted simulations of these data as well as that of others. We have included extracellular diffusion (that is, diffusion of the NO to the membrane) and membrane permeability, in addition to intracellular diffusion of NO, in our computational models. We find that all these mechanisms may modulate NO uptake by membrane-encapsulated Hb and that extracellular diffusion is the main rate-limiting factor for phospholipid vesicles and erythrocytes. In the case of red cell microparticles, we find a major role for membrane permeability. These results are consistent with prior studies indicating that extracellular diffusion of several gas ligands is also rate-limiting for erythrocytes, with some contribution of a low membrane permeability.

The reasons for the reduction of the rate of NO scavenging by red cell-encapsulated versus cell-free Hb have been extensively investigated and yet this remains a debated subject. The difference in the scavenging rates has been attributed to four possible factors: 1) a red blood cell (RBC)-free zone adjacent to the endothelium due to the velocity gradient in laminar flow (2Butler A.R.

The vesicles are large enough to avoid extravasation into the endothelium and could potentially be affected by the radial pressure gradient within blood vessels so that NO consumption would be limited. Investigating the reaction kinetics of these vesicles with NO is therefore important to validate their functionality in place of red blood cells. Phospholipid vesicles of differing sizes and concentrations of intracellular hemoglobin may be made (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Measuring the dependence of their uptake rates of NO on size and hemoglobin concentration may also provide insight into the relative importance of factors intrinsic to the erythrocyte that influence its scavenging rate of NO. To elucidate the relative importance of factors that are intrinsic to red blood cells and phospholipid vesicles in their reactions with NO, another group of investigators (Sakai et al. (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) performed stopped-flow experiments of the reaction of NO with vesicles of various sizes and with a number of different hemoglobin concentrations under anaerobic conditions. One great advantage of the elegant system developed by these authors is that it allows for modeling of well characterized systems. The authors performed computer simulations of their experiments and also simulated reactions with smaller and larger vesicle diameters, from 50 nm up to that of a red cell (8000 nm). In their simulations the authors did not include either extracellular diffusion of NO (i.e. extravesicular, or diffusion to a vesicle through the bulk fluid up to (but not through) the membrane) or membrane permeability to NO (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Only the diffusion of NO inside of a vesicle was simulated. The results obtained both experimentally and computationally showed that the bimolecular binding rate constant of NO decreases as intracellular hemoglobin concentration and vesicle diameter increase. The authors attributed these results to increasing viscosities of hemoglobin solutions and to increased diffusional distances of NO inside vesicles of larger diameters. This led them to conclude that the diffusion of NO inside a phospholipid vesicle is the rate-limiting factor in the reaction and that this may also be the case for NO scavenging by red blood cells. In contrast, we hypothesize that rapid mixing of NO and phospholipid vesicles does not eliminate rate limitations due to extracellular diffusion. Performing our own computer simulations of the stopped-flow experiments with vesicles and NO, we show that the effective diffusion distance of NO through this extracellular space is not reduced sufficiently by the rapid mixing in stopped-flow. In fact, it is the rate-limiting factor in the reaction. In support of our simulations, we conducted stopped-flow absorption measurements of NO uptake by red blood cells under oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions. To explore the role of external diffusion, we employed a viscous and nonviscous buffer. We found that the viscosity of the buffer had a substantial effect on external diffusion, supporting our computational simulations and previous reports that demonstrate the importance of external diffusion in limiting oxygen uptake by red blood cells (6Coin J.T.

In addition, we have simulated our own kinetics measurements of NO uptake by microparticles derived from aged red blood cells under aerobic conditions (50Donadee C. Raat N.J.H. Kanias T. Tejero J. Lee J.S. Kelley E.E. Zhao X. Liu C. Reynolds H. Azarov I. Frizzell S. Meyer M. Donnenberg A.D. Qu L. Triulzi D. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Gladwin M.T. Circulation. 2011; 124: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Unlike phospholipid vesicles, these microparticles still have lipid raft proteins and other components characteristic of red cells in their membrane (56Kriebardis A.G. Antonelou M.H. Stamoulis K.E. Economou-Petersen E. Margaritis L.H. Papassideri I.S. Transfusion. 2008; 48: 1943-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our simulations show that, in our fast time-resolved kinetic measurements of NO scavenging by red cell microparticles under aerobic conditions, membrane permeability mostly likely limits the reaction rate. We also performed competition experiments that support the notion that in the case of these red cell microparticles, membrane permeability plays a substantial role in limiting NO uptake. These results support our previous data, showing that NO uptake by oxygenated red blood cells is mostly limited by extracellular diffusion, with a smaller contribution of reduced membrane permeability under aerobic conditions (14Azarov I.

We have constructed a three-dimensional model to simulate stopped-flow experiments of the anaerobic reaction between phospholipid vesicle-encapsulated hemoglobin and NO within the software package COMSOL Multiphysics (Comsol Inc., Burlington, MA, version 3.5), a partial differential equation-based finite element modeling environment. In these experiments deoxygenated hemoglobin within vesicles binds NO to form a ferrous heme-NO complex (FeII-NO). We have assumed that vesicles are distributed homogeneously within the reaction volume. The reaction may then be simulated with a spherically symmetric model consisting of two spheres. The inner sphere represents a vesicle and the outer sphere represents the reaction volume, such that the difference between its radius and the radius of the vesicle is an average half-distance between any two vesicles in a real experiment (Fig. 1A). To sufficiently resolve both the reaction volume and vesicles with enough finite elements we exploited the spherical symmetry of our model. The reaction was simulated solely over a 20 × 20 degree square cone cut out of the two-sphere system (Fig. 1A). This reduced the number of degrees of freedom that had to be solved to between 20,000 and 30,000, allowing a sufficient number of finite elements (Fig. 1B). The general mass-transport equation governing the reaction was as follows. ∂C∂t+∇⋅(-D∇C)=S-R(Eq. 1) Here C represents the concentration of NO or hemoglobin. The extra terms S and R refer to the rate of reactant production and consumption, respectively. In our case neither reactant was being produced so S was zero, and inside a vesicle, R=kHb[Hb][NO](Eq. 2) where [NO] and [Hb] are time-dependent concentrations and kHb is the known bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of cell-free deoxygenated hemoglobin with NO (20Huang K.T.

J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (2.7 × 107 m−1 s−1, Table 1). D is the diffusion rate constant of the particular diffusing species described by the equation (NO outside or inside or hemoglobin inside of a vesicle, Table 1). The boundary condition employed on the surface of the outer sphere was,TABLE 1Simulation parameters for phospholipid vesicles Open table in a new tab -n∘⋅(-D∇C)=0(Eq. 3) and at the surface of the vesicle, the inward flux of NO was defined as, -n∘⋅(-D∇C)=Pm(Cex-Cin)(Eq. 4) Here Cex and Cin represent the concentrations of NO on the outside (extracellular region) and inside (intracellular region) of the vesicle, respectively, n is the unit vector normal to the sphere surface pointing in the radial direction and Pm is the lipid membrane permeability coefficient of NO (Table 1). Each reaction was simulated until half of the intracellular hemoglobin had reacted with NO and this time was taken as the half-life (t½) of the reaction. Fig. 1C shows an example of simulated concentration profiles of unreacted hemoglobin inside a vesicle and NO outside of the vesicle at the half-life of the reaction. The apparent bimolecular reaction rate constant was calculated at 5 ms of reaction time, as in the recent publication on vesicles, from the following formula, ln([Hb](t)[Hb](0))=-kon'[NO](0)×t(Eq. 5) which assumes pseudo first-order initial kinetics with a constant concentration of NO equal to the initial concentration. The model parameters we used in our simulations are summarized in Table 1. To properly simulate the stopped-flow experiment we included physiological values for the diffusion of NO in the extracellular region (Dex, 3300 μm2 s−1) and the lipid membrane permeability of NO (Pm, 9 × 105 μm s−1), which we have previously used (20Huang K.T. Huang Z. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 16: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 59Jeffers A. Gladwin M.T. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the intracellular region we have used the diffusion constants for both NO and hemoglobin cited in the work on phospholipid vesicles (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which increase with decreasing concentration of hemoglobin inside a vesicle. The total hemoglobin (in heme) used in our simulations was 1.5 μm and the initial concentration of NO in the whole reaction volume was 1.9 μm, as in the publication on vesicles (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To assess whether extra- or intracellular diffusion of NO or the membrane permeability of NO is rate-limiting we have performed simulations where each of these parameters was varied over a range of 15 different values by multiplying the physiological value of a parameter by 15 different factors (from as small as 10−5 to as large as 105, Table 1, bottom row) while maintaining the other parameter constants at either physiological values (data not shown) or at very high values. The very high values were selected to make the corresponding parameters effectively infinite so that they would not contribute to the reaction rate (Table 1, bottom row). These simulations were performed for intracellular hemoglobin concentrations of 0.62, 12.4, and 21.7 mm and for vesicle radii of 50, 500, and 8000 nm (Table 1). For simulations where intracellular diffusion was varied while extracellular diffusion and membrane permeability were constant the NO and hemoglobin diffusion coefficients were both multiplied by the same factor. Because these two parameters were always varied synchronously together they are both referred to by the same symbol, Din (intracellular or intravesicular diffusion). To fit all of the experimental and computational data presented in the recent work on phospholipid vesicles (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we have also performed some simulations with vesicle diameters of 100, 200, 250, 1000, and 2000 nm. The experimental and simulated data in the recent work on phospholipid vesicles by Sakai et al. (21Sakai H. Sato A. Masuda K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1508-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have been obtained by precisely estimating the values from the graphs of their publication to compare it to our own. Some values explicitly given in the publication were also estimated from the graphs and these deviated by a maximum of 1.4% from the exact values. Several approaches were taken to confirm the validity of our computational approach. Normally the mesh of our three-dimensional model had been created with a fine setting and further refined twice in the extracellular domain and five times in the intracellular (vesicle) domain (Fig. 1B). Comparing these to simulations performed with a coarser mesh, we have identified that models with the largest vesicle diameter and the highest concentration of intracellular hemoglobin need the most number of mesh refinements to be properly resolved. To make sure that our chosen number of mesh refinements provided a sufficient number of finite elements the simulations requiring the most number of refinements were also performed with three and six refinements for the intra- and extracellular domains, respectively. The average percent difference from simulations with lower, normally used, number of mesh refinements at physiological parameter values (Table 1) was 0.16 ± 0.19% for the apparent rate constants and 18 ± 4% for the reaction half-lives (n = 2). When parameter values one-tenth of physiological values and higher were included the percent difference was 1.65 ± 4.45% for initial rates and 12 ± 8% for half-lives (n = 26). All of the simulations performed in three dimensions have also been performed in one dimension in spherical coordinates with only a radial dependence (data not shown). It was determined that to appropriately simulate apparent bimolecular rate constants for the smallest values of extra and intracellular diffusion used (10−5 × Dex and 10−5 × Din, Table 1) the number of mesh refinements in one dimension had to be increased to 10 for the extracellular space and 12 for the intracellular space, so that our three-dimensional model was not resolved enough at low diffusion rates (below one-tenth of physiological values presented in Table 1). However, the simulated half-lives had little dependence on th"

These include improved signal selectivity and a possibility to correlate cells labeled with fluorine-rich particles with conventional anatomic proton (1H) imaging. While the optimization of the cellular labeling method is clearly important, the impact of labeling on cellular dynamics should be kept in mind. We show by 19F MR spectroscopy (MRS) that the efficiency in labeling cells of the murine immune system (dendritic cells) by perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) particles increases with increasing particle size (560>365>245>130 nm). Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells and with respect to impact of PFCE particles on DC function, we observed that markers of maturation for these cells (CD80, CD86) were also significantly elevated following labeling with larger PFCE particles (560 nm). When labeled with these larger particles that also gave an optimal signal in MRS, DC presented whole antigen more robustly to CD8+ T cells than control cells. Our data suggest that increasing particle size is one important feature for optimizing cell labeling by PFCE particles, but may also present possible pitfalls such as alteration of the immunological status of these cells. Therefore depending on the clinical scenario in which the 19F-labeled cellular vaccines will be applied (cancer, autoimmune disease, transplantation), it will be interesting to monitor the fate of these cells in vivo in the relevant preclinical mouse models."

The results demonstrated that, in all observed embryo samples, a non imprinted gene expression pattern up to the 16-cell stage of development was common for most genes. This was true for all classes of embryo, regardless of parental-origins and the direction of imprint. However, several differentially expressed genes (H19, IGF2, XIST and PEG10) were detected amongst the classes at the blastocyst stage of development. Most interestingly and despite the fact that maternally and paternally expressed genes should not be expressed in androgenones and parthenogenones, respectively, both uniparental embryos expressed these genes when tested for in this study. In order to account for this phenomenon, we compared the expression patterns of eight imprinted genes along with the methylation status of the IGF2/H19 DMR3 in haploid and diploid parthenogenetic embryos. Our findings revealed that IGF2, NNAT and PEG10 were silenced in haploid but not diploid parthenogenetic blastocysts and differential methylation of the IGF2/H19 DMR3 was consistently observed between haploid and diploid parthenogenetic blastocysts. These results appear to suggest that there exists a process to adjust the expression status of imprinted genes in diploid parthenogenetic embryos and that this phenomenon may be associated with altered methylation at an imprinting control region. In addition we believe that imprinted expression occurs in at least four genes, namely H19, IGF2, XIST and PEG10 in porcine blastocyst stage embryos."

Recently, AIM2 was found to act as a DNA sensor in innate immunity. In addition, we and others have previously demonstrated a high frequency of AIM2-alterations in microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) tumors. To further elucidate AIM2 function in colorectal tumors, we here addressed AIM2-responsive target genes by microarray based gene expression profiling of 22 244 human genes. A total of 111 transcripts were significantly upregulated, whereas 80 transcripts turned out to be significantly downregulated in HCT116 cells, constitutively expressing AIM2, compared with AIM2-negative cells. Among the upregulated genes that were validated by quantitative PCR and western blotting we recognized several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs: IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI6, IRF7, ISG15, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, TLR3 and CIITA), as well as genes involved in intercellular adhesion and matrix remodeling. Expression of ISGs correlated with expression of AIM2 in 10 different IFN-γ treated colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of AIM2 resulted in reduced expression of HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB and CIITA in IFN-γ-treated cells. IFN-γ independent induction of HLA-DR genes and their encoded proteins was also demonstrated upon doxycyclin-regulated transient induction of AIM2. Luciferase reporter assays revealed induction of the HLA-DR promoter upon AIM2 transfection in different cell lines. STAT-signaling was not involved in IFN-γ independent induction of ISGs, arguing against participation of cytokines released in an autostimulating manner. Our data indicate that AIM2 mediates both IFN-γ dependent and independent induction of several ISGs, including genes encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens HLA-DR-α and -β.

Both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] and cytoplasmic ATP have been proposed to be important for maintaining TRPV6 activity. To evaluate whether PtdIns(4,5)P2 and ATP affect channel activity directly or indirectly, we have used a dual approach, examining channel activity in excised patches and planar lipid bilayers. In excised inside-out patch-clamp measurements, ATP reactivated the human TRPV6 channels after current rundown only in the presence of Mg2+. The effect of MgATP was inhibited by 3 structurally different compounds that inhibit type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks). PtdIns(4,5)P2 also activated TRPV6 in excised patches, while its precursor PtdIns(4)P had only minimal effect. These data demonstrate that MgATP provides substrate for lipid kinases, allowing the resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2. To determine whether PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a direct activator of TRPV6, we purified and reconstituted the channel protein in planar lipid bilayers. The reconstituted channel showed high activity in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2, while PtdIns(4)P induced only minimal activity.

https://openalex.org/W1971318332,"The malignant phenotype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is due to the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, which signals several downstream cell survival pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In patients with CML, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used to suppress the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, resulting in impressive response rates. However, resistance can occur, especially in acute-phase CML, through various mechanisms. Here, we show that the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) modulates imatinib and dasatinib resistance and suppresses tumor growth by inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2)/AKT signaling pathway. In mouse and human models, GILZ binds to mTORC2, but not to mTORC1, inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT (at Ser473) and activating FoxO3a-mediated transcription of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim; these results demonstrate that GILZ is a key inhibitor of the mTORC2 pathway. Furthermore, CD34+ stem cells isolated from relapsing CML patients underwent apoptosis and showed inhibition of mTORC2 after incubation with glucocorticoids and imatinib. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the role of mTORC2 in BCR-ABL+ cells and indicate that regulation by GILZ may influence TKI sensitivity."

However, its actual function in most tissues remains unresolved, and its role in cellular fatty acid uptake is still controversial. To characterize Fatp4 functions in adipocytes in vivo, we generated a mouse line with adipocyte-specific inactivation of the Fatp4 gene (Fatp4(A-/-)). Under standard conditions mutant mice showed no phenotypical aberrance. Uptake of radiolabeled palmitic and lignoceric acid into adipose tissue of Fatp4(A-/-) mice was unchanged. When exposed to a diet enriched in long chain fatty acids, Fatp4(A-/-) mice gained more body weight compared with control mice, although they were not consuming more food. Pronounced obesity was accompanied by a thicker layer of subcutaneous fat and greater adipocyte circumference, although expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis was not changed. However, the increase in total fat mass was contrasted by a significant decrease in various phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesteryl esters in adipocytes. Livers of Fatp4-deficient animals under a high fat diet exhibited a higher degree of fatty degeneration. Nonetheless, no evidence for changes in insulin sensitivity and adipose inflammation was found. In summary, the results of this study confirm that Fatp4 is not crucial for fatty acid uptake into adipocytes. Instead, under the condition of a diet enriched in long chain fatty acids, adipocyte-specific Fatp4 deficiency results in adipose hypertrophy and profound alterations in the metabolism of complex lipids."

To better understand how checkpoint proficiency relates to cancer development, we investigated the effects of genetic ablation of Chk1 in the mouse skin on tumors induced by chemical carcinogens. We found that homozygous deletion of Chk1 immediately before carcinogen exposure strongly suppressed benign tumor (papilloma) formation, and that the few, small lesions that formed in the ablated skin always retained Chk1 expression. Remarkably, Chk1 deletion rapidly triggered spontaneous cell proliferation, γ-H2AX staining and apoptosis within the hair follicle, a principal site of origin for carcinogen-induced tumors. At later times, the ablated skin was progressively repopulated by non-recombined Chk1-expressing cells and ultimately normal sensitivity to tumor induction was restored when carcinogen treatment was delayed. In marked contrast, papillomas formed normally in Chk1 hemizygous skin but showed an increased propensity to progress to carcinoma. Thus, complete loss of Chk1 is incompatible with epithelial tumorigenesis, whereas partial loss of function (haploinsufficiency) fosters benign malignant tumor progression."

Part of the methylated domain serves as nuclear localization signal, binding the import receptor transportin. Here we report that arginine methylation weakens the affinity of PABPN1 for transportin. Recombinant, unmethylated PABPN1 binds more strongly to transportin than its methylated counterpart from mammalian tissue, and in vitro methylation reduces the affinity. Transportin and RNA compete for binding to PABPN1. Methylation favors RNA binding. Transportin also inhibits in vitro methylation of the protein. Finally, a peptide corresponding to the nuclear localization signal of PABPN1 competes with transportin-dependent nuclear import of the protein in a permeabilized cell assay and does so less efficiently when it is methylated. We hypothesize that transportin binding might delay methylation of PABPN1 until after nuclear import. In the nucleus, arginine methylation may favor the transition of PABPN1 to the competing ligand RNA and serve to reduce the risk of the protein being reexported to the cytoplasm by transportin.

Here, we use murine CD4+/CD8+ S49 lymphoma cells and isolated thymocytes to assess this mechanism. In WT S49 cells, cAMP acts via protein kinase A (PKA) to induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Treatment of WT and cAMP-Deathless (D-) S49 cells, which lack cAMP-promoted apoptosis, with the PKA agonist 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) differentially regulates transcripts for numerous proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. In contrast, kin-S49 cells (which lack PKA) show no cAMP-promoted changes in transcript expression. In this study, we use knockdown and overexpression approaches to define the role in cAMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis of the proapoptotic factor BIM (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death), whose expression prominently increases in response to CPT-cAMP treatment of WT but not D- or kin- S49 cells. Conditional expression of BimL, one of the three major forms of Bim, increases apoptosis of WT, D-, and kin-S49 cells, whereas inhibition of cAMP-mediated induction of Bim isoforms by shRNAi attenuates CPT-cAMP-mediated apoptosis of WT S49 cells. Bim protein levels increase in subpopulations of CPT-cAMP-treated cells that undergo apoptosis. Thymic CD4+/CD8+ cells isolated from Bim−/− mice corroborated the requirement of Bim expression for cAMP-promoted apoptosis. Thus, up-regulation of Bim appears to be an important determinant of cAMP/PKA-mediated apoptosis in immature T cells and may be a mechanism for such apoptosis in other cell types as well.

https://openalex.org/W1974743319,"The evolution of gastric carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. We established two gastric carcinogenesis models in New-World nonhuman primates. In the first model, ACP03 gastric cancer cell line was inoculated in 18 animals. In the second model, we treated 6 animals with N-methyl-nitrosourea (MNU). Animals with gastric cancer were also treated with Canova immunomodulator. Clinical, hematologic, and biochemical, including C-reactive protein, folic acid, and homocysteine, analyses were performed in this study. MYC expression and copy number was also evaluated. We observed that all animals inoculated with ACP03 developed gastric cancer on the 9(th) day though on the 14(th) day presented total tumor remission. In the second model, all animals developed pre-neoplastic lesions and five died of drug intoxication before the development of cancer. The last surviving MNU-treated animal developed intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma observed by endoscopy on the 940(th) day. The level of C-reactive protein level and homocysteine concentration increased while the level of folic acid decreased with the presence of tumors in ACP03-inoculated animals and MNU treatment. ACP03 inoculation also led to anemia and leukocytosis. The hematologic and biochemical results corroborate those observed in patients with gastric cancer, supporting that our in vivo models are potentially useful to study this neoplasia. In cell line inoculated animals, we detected MYC immunoreactivity, mRNA overexpression, and amplification, as previously observed in vitro. In MNU-treated animals, mRNA expression and MYC copy number increased during the sequential steps of intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis and immunoreactivity was only observed in intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer. Thus, MYC deregulation supports the gastric carcinogenesis process. Canova immunomodulator restored several hematologic measurements and therefore, can be applied during/after chemotherapy to increase the tolerability and duration of anticancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2054798799,"High levels of insecticide treated bednet (ITN) use reduce malaria burden in countries with intense transmission such as Malawi. Since 2007 Malawi has implemented free health facility-based ITN distribution for pregnant women and children <5 years old (under-5s). We evaluated the progress of this targeted approach toward achieving universal ITN coverage.We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in eight districts in April 2009. We assessed household ITN possession, ITN use by all household members, and P. falciparum asexual parasitemia and anemia (hemoglobin <11 grams/deciliter) in under-5s.We surveyed 7,407 households containing 29,806 persons. Fifty-nine percent of all households (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 56-62), 67% (95% CI: 64-70) of eligible households (i.e., households with pregnant women or under-5s), and 40% (95% CI: 36-45) of ineligible households owned an ITN. In households with at least one ITN, 76% (95% CI: 74-78) of all household members, 88% (95% CI: 87-90) of under-5s and 90% (95% CI: 85-94) of pregnant women used an ITN the previous night. Of 6,677 ITNs, 92% (95% CI: 90-94) were used the previous night with a mean of 2.4 persons sleeping under each ITN. In multivariable models adjusting for district, socioeconomic status and indoor residual spraying use, ITN use by under-5s was associated with a significant reduction in asexual parasitemia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64-0.98; p-value 0.03) and anemia (aOR 0.79; 95% CI 0.62-0.99; p-value 0.04). Of potential targeted and non-targeted mass distribution strategies, a campaign distributing 1 ITN per household might increase coverage to 2.1 household members per ITN, and thus achieve near universal coverage often defined as 2 household members per ITN.Malawi has substantially increased ITN coverage using health facility-based distribution targeting pregnant women and under-5s, but needs to supplement these activities with non-targeted mass distribution campaigns to achieve universal coverage and maximum public health impact."
https://openalex.org/W2036282810,"Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is thought to be an early event in tumorigenesis. Many studies have reported the methylation status of individual genes with known involvement in cancer, but an unbiased assessment of the biological function of the collective of hypermethylated genes has not been conducted so far. Based on the observation that a variety of human cancers recapitulate developmental gene expression patterns (that is activate genes normally expressed in early development and suppress late developmental genes), we hypothesized that the silencing of differentiation-associated genes in cancer could be attributed in part to DNA hypermethylation. To this end, we investigated the developmental expression patterns of genes with hypermethylated CpG islands in primary human lung carcinomas and lung cancer cell lines. We found that DNA hypermethylation primarily affects genes that are expressed in late stages of murine lung development. Gene ontology characterization of these genes shows that they are almost exclusively involved in morphogenetic differentiation processes. Our results indicate that DNA hypermethylation in cancer functions as a selective silencing mechanism of genes that are required for the maintenance of a differentiated state. The process of cellular de-differentiation that is evident on both the microscopic and transcriptional level in cancer might at least partly be mediated by these epigenetic events. Our observations provide a mechanistic explanation for induction of differentiation upon treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2048024430,"This article introduces a discrete reaction-diffusion-mechanics (dRDM) model to study the effects of deformation on reaction-diffusion (RD) processes. The dRDM framework employs a FitzHugh-Nagumo type RD model coupled to a mass-lattice model, that undergoes finite deformations. The dRDM model describes a material whose elastic properties are described by a generalized Hooke's law for finite deformations (Seth material). Numerically, the dRDM approach combines a finite difference approach for the RD equations with a Verlet integration scheme for the equations of the mass-lattice system. Using this framework results were reproduced on self-organized pacemaking activity that have been previously found with a continuous RD mechanics model. Mechanisms that determine the period of pacemakers and its dependency on the medium size are identified. Finally it is shown how the drift direction of pacemakers in RDM systems is related to the spatial distribution of deformation and curvature effects."
https://openalex.org/W2058301804,"Several studies suggest that some bark beetle like to attack large trees. The invasive red turpentine beetle (RTB), Dendroctonus valens LeConte, one of the most destructive forest pests in China, is known to exhibit this behavior. Our previous study demonstrated that RTBs preferred to attack large-diameter trees (diameter at breast height, DBH ≥30 cm) over small-diameter trees (DBH ≤10 cm) in the field. In the current study, we studied the attacking behavior and the underlying mechanisms in the laboratory. Behavioral assays showed that RTBs preferred the bark of large-DBH trees and had a higher attack rate on the bolts of these trees. Y-tube assays showed that RTBs preferred the volatiles released by large-DBH trees to those released by small-DBH trees. Subsequent analysis revealed that both large- and small-DBH trees had the same composition of monoterpenes, but the concentration of each component differed; thus it appeared that the concentrations acted as cues for RTBs to locate the right-sized host which was confirmed by further behavioral assays. Moreover, large-DBH pine trees provided more spacious habitat and contained more nutrients, such as nitrogen, than did small-DBH pine trees, which benefited RTBs' fecundity and larval development. RTBs seem to have evolved mechanisms to locate those large hosts that will allow them to maximize their fitness. Monoterpene variation mediated attack preference implies the potential for the management of RTB."
https://openalex.org/W1965786353,"ETV6-NTRK3 (EN), a chimeric tyrosine kinase generated by t(12;15) translocations, is a dominantly acting oncoprotein in diverse tumor types. We previously showed that insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is essential for EN-mediated oncogenesis and that insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and bound by EN in transformed cells. Given that IRS1 is also an adapter for IGF1R, we hypothesized that IRS1 might localize EN to IGF1R at the membrane to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, which is critical for EN oncogenesis. In this study, we examined EN/IRS1/IGF1R complexes in detail. We find that both IRS1 and kinase active IGF1R are required for EN transformation, that tyrosine phosphorylated IRS1 is present in high molecular weight complexes with EN and IGF1R, and that EN colocalizes with IGF1R at the plasma membrane. Both IGF1R kinase activity and an intact cytoplasmic Y950 residue, the IRS1-docking site of IGF1R, are required, confirming the importance of the IGF1R/IRS1 interaction for EN oncogenesis. The dual specificity IGF1R and insulin receptor (INSR) inhibitor, BMS-536924, blocks EN transformation activity, cell survival and its interaction with IRS proteins, and induces a striking shift of EN proteins to smaller sized molecular complexes. We conclude that a tripartite complex of EN, IRS1 and IGF1R localizes EN to the membrane and that this is essential for EN-mediated transformation. These findings provide an explanation for the observed IGF1R dependency of EN transformation. Blocking IGF1R kinase activity may, therefore, provide a tractable therapeutic strategy for the many tumor types driven by the EN oncoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1966216660,"The asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), is central to the oxygen-sensing pathway that controls the activity of HIF. Factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) also catalyzes the hydroxylation of a large set of proteins that share a structural motif termed the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD). In vitro studies have defined kinetic properties of FIH with respect to different substrates and have suggested FIH binds more tightly to certain ARD proteins than HIF and that ARD hydroxylation may have a lower K(m) value for oxygen than HIF hydroxylation. However, regulation of asparaginyl hydroxylation on ARD substrates has not been systematically studied in cells. To address these questions, we employed isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry to monitor the accrual, inhibition, and decay of hydroxylation under defined conditions. Under the conditions examined, hydroxylation was not reversed but increased as the protein aged. The extent of hydroxylation on ARD proteins was increased by addition of ascorbate, whereas iron and 2-oxoglutarate supplementation had no significant effect. Despite preferential binding of FIH to ARD substrates in vitro, when expressed as fusion proteins in cells, hydroxylation was found to be more complete on HIF polypeptides compared with sites within the ARD. Furthermore, comparative studies of hydroxylation in graded hypoxia revealed ARD hydroxylation was suppressed in a site-specific manner and was as sensitive as HIF to hypoxic inhibition. These findings suggest that asparaginyl hydroxylation of HIF-1 and ARD proteins is regulated by oxygen over a similar range, potentially tuning the HIF transcriptional response through competition between the two types of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2022828425,"Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a nuclear encoded and mitochondrial matrix-localized redox enzyme that is known to regulate the cellular redox environment. Cellular redox environment changes during transitions between quiescent and proliferative cycles. Human MnSOD has two poly(A) sites resulting in two transcripts: 1.5 and 4.2 kb. The present study investigates if the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of MnSOD regulates its expression during transitions between quiescent and proliferating cycles, and in response to radiation. A preferential increase in the levels of the 1.5-kb MnSOD transcript was observed in quiescent cells, whereas the abundance of the longer transcript showed a direct correlation with the percentage of S-phase cells. The log-transformed expression ratio of the longer to the shorter transcript was also higher in proliferating normal and cancer cells. Deletion and reporter assays showed a significant decrease in reporter activity in constructs carrying multiple AU-rich sequence that are present in the 3'-UTR of the longer MnSOD transcript. Overexpression of the MnSOD 3'-UTR representing the longer transcript enhanced endogenous MnSOD mRNA levels, which was associated with an increase in MnSOD protein levels and a decrease in the percentage of S-phase cells. Irradiation increases the mRNA levels of the 1.5-kb MnSOD transcript, which was consistent with a significant increase in the reporter activity of the construct carrying the 3'-UTR of the shorter transcript. We conclude that the 3'-UTR of MnSOD regulates MnSOD expression in response to different growth states and radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1975401110,"Background Genetic studies of the Arabidopsis mutant lsd1 highlight the important role of LSD1 in the negative regulation of plant programmed cell death (PCD). Arabidopsis thaliana LSD1 (AtLSD1) contains three LSD1-type zinc finger motifs, which are involved in the protein–protein interaction. Methodology/Principal Findings To further understand the function of LSD1, we have analyzed cellular localization and functional localization domains of Pisum sativa LSD1 (PsLSD1), which is a homolog of AtLSD1. Subcellular localization analysis of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PsLSD1 indicates that PsLSD1 is localized in the nucleus. Using a series of GFP-tagged PsLSD1 deletion mutants, we found that the three LSD1-type zinc finger motifs of PsLSD1 alone can target GFP to the nucleus, whereas deletion of the three zinc finger motifs or any individual zinc finger motif causes PsLSD1 to lose its nuclear localization, indicating that the three zinc finger motifs are necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis analysis of GFP-tagged PsLSD1 indicates that tertiary structure and basic amino acids of each zinc finger motif are necessary for PsLSD1 nuclear localization. In addition, yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and BiFC assays demonstrate that the three zinc finger motifs of PsLSD1 directly bind to importin α in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate that the LSD1-type zinc finger motifs of PsLSD1 are a novel nuclear localization signal and directly bind to importin α, and suggest that the nuclear import of LSD1 may rely on the interaction between its zinc finger motifs and importin α. Moreover, the nuclear localization of PsLSD1 suggests that LSD1 may function as a transcription regulator involved in negatively regulating PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2047276314,"Communication and learning from each other are part of the success of animal societies. Social insects invest considerable effort into signalling to their nestmates the locations of the most profitable resources in their environment. Growing evidence also indicates that insects glean such information through cues inadvertently provided by their conspecifics. Here, we investigate social information use in the foraging decisions by gregarious cockroaches (Blattella germanica L.). Individual cockroaches given a simultaneous choice in a Y-olfactometer between the odour of feeding conspecifics and the mixed odour of food plus non-feeding conspecifics showed a preference for the arm scented with the odour of feeding conspecifics. Social information (the presence of feeding conspecifics) was produced by cockroaches of all age classes and perceived at short distance in the olfactometer arms, suggesting the use of inadvertently provided cues rather than signals. We discuss the nature of these cues and the role of local enhancement (the selection of a location based on cues associated with the presence of conspecifics) in the formation of feeding aggregations in B. germanica. Similar cue-mediated recruitments could underpin a wide range of collective behaviours in group-living insects."
https://openalex.org/W2065496703,"Paclitaxel (Taxol) is one of the most effective treatment options for patients suffering from a variety of cancers. A major side effect seen in a high percentage of patients treated with paclitaxel is irreversible peripheral neuropathy. We previously reported that prolonged treatment with paclitaxel activates a calcium-dependent enzyme, calpain, which degrades neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) and subsequent loss of intracellular calcium signaling. Because it appears that activation of calpain is an early step in this destructive cascade, we proposed that inhibition of calpain will protect against the unwanted side effects of paclitaxel treatment. First, NCS-1 levels and intracellular calcium signaling were found to be protected by the presence of lactacystin, a protesome inhibitor. To reinforce the role of calpain in this process, we showed that increased concentrations of calpastatin, a naturally occurring calpain inhibitor, were protective. Next, we tested two mutated versions of NCS-1 developed with point mutations at the P2 position of the calpain cleavage site of NCS-1 to decrease the likelihood of NCS-1 degradation. One mutant was cleaved more favorably by calpain compared with NCS-1 WT, whereas the other mutant was less favorably cleaved. Expression of either mutated version of NCS-1 in neuroblastoma cells protected intracellular calcium signals from paclitaxel-induced changes. These results support our hypothesis that it is possible to protect cells from paclitaxel-induced degradation of NCS-1 by inhibiting calpain activity."
https://openalex.org/W1989527677,"The specific inhibition of the biosynthesis of target proteins is a relatively novel strategy in pharmacology and is based mainly on antisense approaches (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides or RNA interference). Recently, a novel class of substances was described acting at a later step of protein biosynthesis. The cyclic heptadepsipeptides CAM741 and cotransin were shown to inhibit selectively the biosynthesis of a small subset of secretory proteins by preventing stable insertion of the nascent chains into the Sec61 translocon complex at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Besemer, J., Harant, H., Wang, S., Oberhauser, B., Marquardt, K., Foster, C. A., Schreiner, E. P., de Vries, J. E., Dascher-Nadel, C., and Lindley, I. J. (2005) Nature 436, 290-293; Garrison, J. L., Kunkel, E. J., Hegde, R. S., and Taunton, J. (2005) Nature 436, 285-289). These peptides act in a signal sequence-discriminatory manner, which explains their selectivity. Here, we have analyzed the cotransin sensitivity of various G protein-coupled receptors in transfected HEK 293 cells. We show that the biosynthesis of the human endothelin B receptor (ET(B)R) is highly sensitive to cotransin, in contrast to that of the other G protein-coupled receptors analyzed. Using a novel biosynthesis assay based on fusions with the photoconvertible Kaede protein, we show that the IC(50) value of cotransin action on ET(B)R biosynthesis is 5.4 μm and that ET(B)R signaling could be completely blocked by treating cells with 30 μm cotransin. Taken together, our data add an integral membrane protein, namely the ET(B)R, to the small group of cotransin-sensitive proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2157285232,"Background Epithelial surfaces such as the gastrointestinal mucosa depend on expression of antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin for immune defence against pathogens. The mechanisms behind mucosal cathelicidin regulation are incompletely understood. Methods Cathelicidin expression was analysed in duodenal, antral and corpus/fundic mucosal biopsies from African and German patients. Additionally, cathelicidin expression was correlated with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and the inflammatory status of the mucosa. Results High cathelicidin transcript abundance was detected in duodenal biopsies from African subjects. On the contrary, cathelicidin mRNA expression was either undetectable or very low in tissue specimens from German patients. Also, in the antrum and corpus/fundus regions of the stomach significantly higher cathelicidin transcript levels were measured in Tanzanian compared to German patients. In gastric biopsies from African patients cathelicidin expression was increased in HP positive compared to HP negative subjects. Additionally, the inflammatory status measured by IL-8 expression correlated well with the HP infection status. Conclusions A higher duodenal and gastric cathelicidin expression in African (compared with European) individuals may be due to upregulation by antigenic stimulation and may confer a higher resistance against enteric infections."
