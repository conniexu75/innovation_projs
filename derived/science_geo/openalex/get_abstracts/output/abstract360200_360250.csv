https://openalex.org/W1977943782,"To equalize X-chromosome dosages between the sexes, the female mammal inactivates one of her two X chromosomes. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated by expression of Xist , a 17-kb noncoding RNA (ncRNA) that accumulates on the X in cis. Because interacting factors have not been isolated, the mechanism by which Xist induces silencing remains unknown. We discovered a 1.6-kilobase ncRNA (RepA) within Xist and identified the Polycomb complex, PRC2, as its direct target. PRC2 is initially recruited to the X by RepA RNA, with Ezh2 serving as the RNA binding subunit. The antisense Tsix RNA inhibits this interaction. RepA depletion abolishes full-length Xist induction and trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 of the X. Likewise, PRC2 deficiency compromises Xist up-regulation. Therefore, RepA, together with PRC2, is required for the initiation and spread of XCI. We conclude that a ncRNA cofactor recruits Polycomb complexes to their target locus."
https://openalex.org/W2075519966,"Wolbachia pipientis bacteria are common endosymbionts of insects that are best known for their ability to increase their prevalence in populations by manipulating host reproductive systems. However, there are examples of Wolbachia that exist in nature that seem to induce no reproductive parasitism trait and yet are able to invade populations. We demonstrate a fitness benefit for Wolbachia-infected insects that may explain this paradox. Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with Wolbachia are less susceptible to mortality induced by a range of RNA viruses. The antiviral protection associated with Wolbachia infection might be exploited in future strategies to reduce transmission of pathogens by insects."
https://openalex.org/W2169687789,"White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a condition associated with an unprecedented bat mortality event in the northeastern United States. Since the winter of 2006*2007, bat declines exceeding 75% have been observed at surveyed hibernacula. Affected bats often present with visually striking white fungal growth on their muzzles, ears, and/or wing membranes. Direct microscopy and culture analyses demonstrated that the skin of WNS-affected bats is colonized by a psychro-philic fungus that is phylogenetically related to Geomyces spp. but with a conidial morphology distinct from characterized members of this genus. This report characterizes the cutaneous fungal infection associated with WNS."
https://openalex.org/W2074548008,"Aneuploidy, an incorrect number of chromosomes, is the leading cause of miscarriages and mental retardation in humans and is a hallmark of cancer. We examined the effects of aneuploidy on primary mouse cells by generating a series of cell lines that carry an extra copy of one of four mouse chromosomes. In all four trisomic lines, proliferation was impaired and metabolic properties were altered. Immortalization, the acquisition of the ability to proliferate indefinitely, was also affected by the presence of an additional copy of certain chromosomes. Our data indicate that aneuploidy decreases not only organismal but also cellular fitness and elicits traits that are shared between different aneuploid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026586824,"Molecular electronic states energetically below the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) should contribute to laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG), but this behavior has not been observed previously. Our measurements of the HHG spectrum of N2 molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization showed a maximum at the rotational half-revival. This feature indicates the influence of electrons occupying the orbital just below the N2 HOMO, referred to as the HOMO-1. Such observations of lower-lying orbitals are essential to understanding subfemtosecond/subangstrom electronic motion in laser-excited molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2022645001,"The gene transient receptor potential-melastatin-like 7 ( Trpm7 ) encodes a protein that functions as an ion channel and a kinase. TRPM7 has been proposed to be required for cellular Mg 2+ homeostasis in vertebrates. Deletion of mouse Trpm7 revealed that it is essential for embryonic development. Tissue-specific deletion of Trpm7 in the T cell lineage disrupted thymopoiesis, which led to a developmental block of thymocytes at the double-negative stage and a progressive depletion of thymic medullary cells. However, deletion of Trpm7 in T cells did not affect acute uptake of Mg 2+ or the maintenance of total cellular Mg 2+ . Trpm7 -deficient thymocytes exhibited dysregulated synthesis of many growth factors that are necessary for the differentiation and maintenance of thymic epithelial cells. The thymic medullary cells lost signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activity, which accounts for their depletion when Trpm7 is disrupted in thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2064917327,"The attosecond time-scale electron-recollision process that underlies high harmonic generation has uncovered extremely rapid electronic dynamics in atoms and diatomics. We showed that high harmonic generation can reveal coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics in polyatomic molecules. By exciting large amplitude vibrations in dinitrogen tetraoxide, we showed that tunnel ionization accesses the ground state of the ion at the outer turning point of the vibration but populates the first excited state at the inner turning point. This state-switching mechanism is manifested as bursts of high harmonic light that is emitted mostly at the outer turning point. Theoretical calculations attribute the large modulation to suppressed emission from the first excited state of the ion. More broadly, these results show that high harmonic generation and strong-field ionization in polyatomic molecules undergoing bonding or configurational changes involve the participation of multiple molecular orbitals."
https://openalex.org/W2076651284,"Fundamental to our understanding of erosional and transport phenomena in earth-surface dynamics and engineering is knowledge of the conditions under which sediment motion will begin when subjected to turbulent flow. The onset criterion currently in use emphasizes the time-averaged boundary shear stress and therefore is incapable of accounting for the fluctuating forces encountered in turbulent flows. We have validated through laboratory experiments and analytical formulation of the problem a criterion based upon the impulse imparted to a sediment grain. We demonstrate that in addition to the magnitude of the instantaneous turbulent forces applied on a sediment grain, the duration of these turbulent forces is also important in determining the sediment grain's threshold of motion, and that their product, or impulse, is better suited for specifying such conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2098347389,"Spatial self-organization is the main theoretical explanation for the global occurrence of regular or otherwise coherent spatial patterns in ecosystems. Using mussel beds as a model ecosystem, we provide an experimental demonstration of spatial self-organization. Under homogeneous laboratory conditions, mussels developed regular patterns, similar to those in the field. An individual-based model derived from our experiments showed that interactions between individuals explained the observed patterns. Furthermore, a field study showed that pattern formation affected ecosystem-level processes in terms of improved growth and resistance to wave action. Our results imply that spatial self-organization is an important determinant of the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and it needs to be considered in their conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2081723065,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. These massive assemblies comprise an eightfold symmetric scaffold of architectural proteins and central-channel phenylalanine-glycine-repeat proteins forming the transport barrier. We determined the nucleoporin 85 (Nup85)⚫Seh1 structure, a module in the heptameric Nup84 complex, at 3.5 angstroms resolution. Structural, biochemical, and genetic analyses position the Nup84 complex in two peripheral NPC rings. We establish a conserved tripartite element, the ancestral coatomer element ACE1, that reoccurs in several nucleoporins and vesicle coat proteins, providing structural evidence of coevolution from a common ancestor. We identified interactions that define the organization of the Nup84 complex on the basis of comparison with vesicle coats and confirmed the sites by mutagenesis. We propose that the NPC scaffold, like vesicle coats, is composed of polygons with vertices and edges forming a membrane-proximal lattice that provides docking sites for additional nucleoporins."

https://openalex.org/W2036118084,"Atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx =NO+ NO2) play a pivotal role in the cycling of reactive nitrogen (ultimately deposited as nitrate) and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. Combined measurements of nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of nitrate collected in the Arctic atmosphere were used to infer the origin and fate of NOx and nitrate on a seasonal basis. In spring, photochemically driven emissions of reactive nitrogen from the snowpack into the atmosphere make local oxidation of NOx by bromine oxide the major contributor to the nitrate budget. The comprehensive isotopic composition of nitrate provides strong constraints on the relative importance of the key atmospheric oxidants in the present atmosphere, with the potential for extension into the past using ice cores."
https://openalex.org/W2093560688,"Sensory organs are composed of neurons, which convert environmental stimuli to electrical signals, and glia-like cells, whose functions are not well understood. To decipher glial roles in sensory organs, we ablated the sheath glial cell of the major sensory organ of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that glia-ablated animals exhibit profound sensory deficits and that glia provide activities that affect neuronal morphology, behavior generation, and neuronal uptake of lipophilic dyes. To understand the molecular bases of these activities, we identified 298 genes whose messenger RNAs are glia-enriched. One gene, fig-1, encodes a labile protein with conserved thrombospondin TSP1 domains. FIG-1 protein functions extracellularly, is essential for neuronal dye uptake, and also affects behavior. Our results suggest that glia are required for multiple aspects of sensory organ function."
https://openalex.org/W2092293039,"All organisms face the problem of how to fuel ontogenetic growth. We present a model, empirically grounded in data from birds and mammals, that correctly predicts how growing animals allocate food energy between synthesis of new biomass and maintenance of existing biomass. Previous energy budget models have typically had their bases in rates of either food consumption or metabolic energy expenditure. Our model provides a framework that reconciles these two approaches and highlights the fundamental principles that determine rates of food assimilation and rates of energy allocation to maintenance, biosynthesis, activity, and storage. The model predicts that growth and assimilation rates for all animals should cluster closely around two universal curves. Data for mammals and birds of diverse body sizes and taxa support these predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2080781368,"DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) participate in a broad range of biological processes including transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin dynamics. Mutations in the HepA-related protein (HARP) ATPase are responsible for Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), but the function of the protein is unknown. We found that HARP is an ATP-dependent annealing helicase that rewinds single-stranded DNA bubbles that are stably bound by replication protein A. Other related ATPases, including the DNA translocase Rad54, did not exhibit annealing helicase activity. Analysis of mutant HARP proteins suggests that SIOD is caused by a deficiency in annealing helicase activity. Moreover, the pleiotropy of HARP mutations is consistent with the function of HARP as an annealing helicase that acts throughout the genome to oppose the action of DNA-unwinding activities in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2083763727,"Studies relating the magnesium (Mg) content of calcified skeletons to temperature often report unexplained deviations from the signature expected for inorganically grown calcite. These “vital effects” are believed to have biological origins, but mechanistic bases for measured offsets remain unclear. We show that a simple hydrophilic peptide, with the same carboxyl-rich character as that of macromolecules isolated from sites of calcification, increases calcite Mg content by up to 3 mole percent. Comparisons to previous studies correlating Mg content of carbonate minerals with temperature show that the Mg enhancement due to peptides results in offsets equivalent to 7° to 14°C. The insights also provide a physical basis for anecdotal evidence that organic chemistry modulates the mineralization of inorganic carbonates and suggest an approach to tuning impurity levels in controlled materials synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2118309199,"The Birt–Hogg–Dubé (BHD) disease is a genetic cancer syndrome. The responsible gene, BHD, has been identified by positional cloning and thought to be a novel tumor suppressor gene. BHD mutations cause many types of diseases including renal cell carcinomas, fibrofolliculomas, spontaneous pneumothorax, lung cysts, and colonic polyps/cancers. By combining Gateway Technology with the Ksp-Cre gene knockout system, we have developed a kidney-specific BHD knockout mouse model. BHDflox/flox/Ksp-Cre mice developed enlarged kidneys characterized by polycystic kidneys, hyperplasia, and cystic renal cell carcinoma. The affected BHDflox/flox/Ksp-Cre mice died of renal failure at approximate three weeks of age, having blood urea nitrogen levels over tenfold higher than those of BHD flox/+/Ksp-Cre and wild-type littermate controls. We further demonstrated that these phenotypes were caused by inactivation of BHD and subsequent activation of the mTOR pathway. Application of rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR activity, to the affected mice led to extended survival and inhibited further progression of cystogenesis. These results provide a correlation of kidney-targeted gene inactivation with renal carcinoma, and they suggest that the BHD product FLCN, functioning as a cyst and tumor suppressor, like other hamartoma syndrome–related proteins such as PTEN, LKB1, and TSC1/2, is a component of the mTOR pathway, constituting a novel FLCN-mTOR signaling branch that regulates cell growth/proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1977072542,"In earthquake hazard assessment studies, the focus is usually on horizontal ground motion. However, records from the 14 June 2008 Iwate-Miyagi earthquake in Japan, a crustal event with a moment magnitude of 6.9, revealed an unprecedented vertical surface acceleration of nearly four times gravity, more than twice its horizontal counterpart. The vertical acceleration was distinctly asymmetric; the waveform envelope was about 1.6 times as large in the upward direction as in the downward direction, which is not explained by existing models of the soil response. We present a simple model of a mass bouncing on a trampoline to account for this asymmetry and the large vertical amplitude. The finding of a hitherto-unknown mode of strong ground motion may prompt major progress in near-source shaking assessments."
https://openalex.org/W1999810485,"Angrites are among the oldest known pristine basaltic meteorites and record the earliest stages of planet formation and differentiation. Our paleomagnetic analysis of three angrites found that they record a past magnetic field of ∼10 microteslas on the angrite parent body extending from 4564 to at least 4558 million years ago. Because the angrite paleomagnetic record extends beyond the expected lifetime of the early circumstellar disk, these paleofields were probably generated internally on the angrite parent body, possibly by an early dynamo in a rapidly formed metallic core."
https://openalex.org/W2003108616,"Cytochrome c, a mitochondrial electron transfer protein containing a hexacoordinated heme, is involved in other physiologically relevant events, such as the triggering of apoptosis, and the activation of a peroxidatic activity. The latter occurs secondary to interactions with cardiolipin and/or post-translational modifications, including tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite and other nitric oxide-derived oxidants. The gain of peroxidatic activity in nitrated cytochrome c has been related to a heme site transition in the physiological pH region, which normally occurs at alkaline pH in the native protein. Herein, we report a spectroscopic characterization of two nitrated variants of horse heart cytochrome c by using optical spectroscopy studies and NMR. Highly pure nitrated cytochrome c species modified at solvent-exposed Tyr-74 or Tyr-97 were generated after treatment with a flux of peroxynitrite, separated, purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectrometry-based peptide mapping. It is shown that nitration of Tyr-74 elicits an early alkaline transition with a pKa = 7.2, resulting in the displacement of the sixth and axial iron ligand Met-80 and replacement by a weaker Lys ligand to yield an alternative low spin conformation. Based on the study of site-specific Tyr to Phe mutants in the four conserved Tyr residues, we also show that this transition is not due to deprotonation of nitro-Tyr-74, but instead we propose a destabilizing steric effect of the nitro group in the mobile Ω-loop of cytochrome c, which is transmitted to the iron center via the nearby Tyr-67. The key role of Tyr-67 in promoting the transition through interactions with Met-80 was further substantiated in the Y67F mutant. These results therefore provide new insights into how a remote post-translational modification in cytochrome c such as tyrosine nitration triggers profound structural changes in the heme ligation and microenvironment and impacts in protein function.

Indeed, mammalian cytochromes c contain four highly conserved tyrosines, two that are solvent-exposed (Tyr-74 and Tyr-97) and two buried internally (Tyr-67 and Tyr-48). Although the functional impact of the nitration of cytochrome c by tetranitromethane was studied by seminal early work (37Schejter A. Aviram I. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5118-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Sokolovsky M. Aviram I. Schejter A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Skov K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4003-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) and that can influence protein structure and function (for a recent review see) (42Souza J.M. Peluffo G. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In this regard, we should note that addition of a nitro group (–NO2) to tyrosine residues reduces the pKa of the phenolic –OH group by 2 or 3 units and adds a bulky moiety of 45 Da. Nitrated cytochrome c has been detected in cellular and animal models of disease associated to nitroxidative stress (43Alonso D. Encinas J.M. Uttenthal L.O. Bosca L. Serrano J. Fernandez A.P.

We have established that cytochrome c tyrosine nitration can occur via a variety of biologically relevant reaction mechanisms that include peroxynitrite (ONOO–/ONOOH) 6Peroxynitrite is the product of the diffusion-controlled reaction (k = 1.6 × 1010 m–1 s–1; (49Kissner R.

Cytochrome c3+ reacts at moderate rates withO2·_–(k = 3 × 105 m–1 s–1 (50Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, cytochrome c3+ can still be nitrated by fluxes ofO2·_ and •NO (A. Cassina, and R. Radi, unpublished data), underscoring the concept that is not possible to completely block peroxynitrite formation even by strong radical scavenging systems (31Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peptide mapping studies have revealed that during peroxynitrite-mediated cytochrome c nitration, the first nitrated tyrosine residue is either Tyr-74 or Tyr-97, consistent with the fact that peroxynitrite-derived radicals (either via homolytic cleavage to yield hydroxyl (•OH) and nitrogen dioxide (•NO2) radicals or secondary to the reaction with carbon dioxide, which yields carbonate radicals (CO3·_) and •NO2), will preferentially react with solvent-exposed tyrosine residues (40Batthyany C. Souza J.M. Duran R. Cassina A. Cervenansky C. Radi R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8038-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).

Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 441: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we have observed that the nitro-Tyr-97 and nitro-Tyr-74 cytochrome c species undergo important functional changes that include the induction of a peroxidatic activity (i.e. reduction of a peroxide such as H2O2 with the concomitant oxidation of a second substrate via a heme-dependent catalytic cycle) (40Batthyany C.

Med. 2008; 45: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), of tyrosine nitration on a variety of proteins has been under active investigation over the last decade, structural studies are almost lacking. In particular, one crucial unanswered issue is how the site-specific nitration of one or more tyrosine residues in cytochrome c is able to decrease the pKa of the alkaline transition toward the neutral region and result in a conformational switch to render peroxidatic activity; the latter effect has been related to cardiolipin oxidation (29Basova L.V.

Biol. 2005; 1: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In this study, we have explored the effect of nitration at the solvent-exposed tyrosine residues (Tyr-97 and Tyr-74) of horse heart cytochrome c on the pKa of its alkaline transition and the changes in heme ligation and protein conformation by using a combination of NMR and optical spectroscopy studies. This work allowed us to provide a structural rationale for the remote effect of Tyr-74 nitration on the alkaline transition, which results in the gain of peroxidatic activity upon nitric oxide-derived oxidants reactions. Moreover, we propose a mechanism by which tyrosine nitration is transmitted conformationally within the protein framework. These data provide novel insights into the structural changes triggered by tyrosine nitration on cytochrome c and highlight the utility of NMR of paramagnetic systems for assessing the effects of post-translational modifications and interactions with protein and phospholipids ligands on the heme ligation and conformational states of cytochrome c3+. Chemicals—Horse heart cytochrome c (C-7752) was obtained from Sigma. This cytochrome c preparation was selected because it is purified without the use of trichloroacetic acid, which otherwise leads to substantial amounts of deamidated and polymeric forms (57Margoliash E. Lustgarten J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3397-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the cytochrome c preparation used herein was >95% as determined by chromatographic, spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and mass spectrometric criteria. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was obtained from Promega. Hydrogen peroxide was obtained from Baker. D2O (99.8% 2H purity) was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were analytical grade. HPLC 7The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. solvents were of the highest available quality. Peroxynitrite, which was synthesized, quantitated, and handled as described previously (58Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contained less than 20% residual nitrite. Nitration and Purification of Modified Cytochrome c Species—A large scale nitration and purification procedure was adapted from previously described methods (40Batthyany C. Souza J.M. Duran R.

Methods Enzymol. 2008; 441: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to obtain the amounts of mononitrated cytochrome c species required for the optical and NMR spectroscopy studies performed herein. Peroxynitrite was added as a continuous flow of 0.134 mm · min–1 for 30 min to cytochrome c3+ (200 μm) by using a motor-driven multi-syringe system (Sage Instruments, Boston), making three vials of 0.5 ml each time, under vigorous shaking condition in 200 mm potassium phosphate with 25 mm NaHCO3 and 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. The final pH was always controlled and kept below 7.4. After reaction, salts were removed by a chromatography step in a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and the mixture of nitrated cytochrome c forms was passed through a cation exchange sulfopropyl-TSK preparative column (21.5 mm (inner diameter) × 15.0 cm (length); Tosoh Biosep) in order to purify the mononitrated species. The flow rate was 3 ml · min–1. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 9.0) for 20 min, and then peaks were eluted using a linear gradient of 10–400 mm ammonium acetate (pH 9.0) for 20 to 80 min and kept up to 90 min at 400 mm ammonium acetate. Peaks 2 and 3 from the elution (Fig. 1A), containing nitrated cytochrome c (note that peak 1 corresponds to unmodified cytochrome c3+) were repurified in the same column (Fig. 1B) using the same solvent gradient, to avoid any cross-contamination. The high purity of different modified cytochrome c species was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of the whole protein and monitoring of the nitration of the tyrosine-containing peptides as described previously (40Batthyany C. Souza J.M. Duran R. Cassina A. Cervenansky C. Radi R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8038-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Souza J.M. Castro L. Cassina A.M. Batthyany C. Radi R.

Mass spectrometry analysis was performed with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (model 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) on the Analytical Biochemistry and Proteomics Core Facility of the Institut Pasteur de Montevideo. Tryptic digestion of HPLC peak 2 contained only the nitrated peptide 89TEREDLIAY(NO2)LK99 (theoretical m/z = 1395.72; detected m/z = 1395.69), corresponding to the nitration of Tyr-97. Similarly, the digestion of peak 3 only contained the nitrated peptide 74Y(NO2)IPGTK79 (theoretical m/z = 723.37; detected m/z = 723.30), corresponding to the nitration of Tyr-74 (40Batthyany C.

Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Cytochrome c Mutants—The plasmid pJRhrsN2 (kindly provided by Dr. Jon Rumbley, Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota, Duluth) was employed to produce wild type recombinant cytochrome c and the Y97F, Y74F, Y67F, and Y48F mutants. Plasmid pJRhrsN2 codes for horse heart cytochrome c, as described (59Rumbley J.N. Hoang L. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13894-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), carrying the two substitutions H26N and H33N. The four single Y to F mutants were obtained using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resultant pJRhrsN2-derived plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) for protein expression. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified according to Rumbley et al. (59Rumbley J.N. Hoang L. Englander S.W.

Twenty-five ml of starter culture grown in LB medium and 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated in 1 liter of Terrific Broth with the antibiotic. The culture was grown with vigorous shaking until A550 nm = 0.8. Expression of cytochrome c Y to F mutants was induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 50 h at 303 K. The protein was purified using a CM-Sepharose fast-flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions with a 410/280 nm absorbance ratio > 4.0 were considered pure, as supported by SDS-PAGE analysis. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized samples were dissolved in 100 mm phospha"
https://openalex.org/W2052867923,"Vinblastine and other microtubule inhibitors used as antimitotic cancer drugs characteristically promote the phosphorylation of the key anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL. However, putative sites of phosphorylation have been inferred based on potential recognition by JNK, and no direct biochemical analysis has been performed. In this study we used protein purification and mass spectrometry to identify Ser-62 as a single major site in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed Ser-62 to be the site of Bcl-xL phosphorylation induced by several microtubule inhibitors tested. Vinblastine-treated cells overexpressing a Ser-62 → Ala mutant showed highly significantly reduced apoptosis compared with cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that phosphorylation caused wild-type Bcl-xL to release bound Bax, whereas phospho-defective Bcl-xL retained the ability to bind Bax. In contrast, phospho-mimic (Ser-62 → Asp) Bcl-xL exhibited a reduced capacity to bind Bax. Functional tests were performed by transiently co-transfecting Bax in the context of different Bcl-xL mutants. Co-expression of wild-type or phospho-defective Bcl-xL counteracted the adverse effects of Bax expression on cell viability, whereas phospho-mimic Bcl-xL failed to provide the same level of protection against Bax. These studies suggest that Bcl-xL phosphorylation induced by microtubule inhibitors plays a key pro-apoptotic role at least in part by disabling the ability of Bcl-xL to bind Bax.

Mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins which exhibit either pro- or anti-apoptotic properties (for review, see Refs. 1Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar, 2Danial N.N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 7254-7263Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 3Letai A.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The BH3-only pro-apoptotic members act as essential initiators of intrinsic apoptosis, whereas the multidomain pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak act as essential mediators of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Bcl-2 proteins function in a hierarchical fashion, and different models have been proposed to explain their complex interrelationships (1Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar, 2Danial N.N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 7254-7263Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 3Letai A.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The activator-sensitizer model proposes that BH3-only proteins comprise two subsets, the activators and the sensitizers. Activators, which include Bim and Bid, once activated themselves, in turn directly activate Bax and Bak. Sensitizers such as Bad and Bik, on the other hand, appear to act by neutralizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and do so by displacing activator proteins bound to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or by precluding anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins from sequestering activator BH3-only proteins. In the indirect model Bax and Bak are bound to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and become liberated and activated as a consequence of displacement by BH3-only proteins. Microtubule inhibitors are a class of compounds that bind to tubulin or microtubules and suppress microtubule dynamics (for review, see Refs. 4Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 413-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 5Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. The Chemotherapy Source Book. 2nd Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD2015Google Scholar, 6Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3498) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with these agents leads to prolonged activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, mitotic arrest, and eventually cell death, providing a rationale for their use as antitumor agents. The first microtubule inhibitor utilized for cancer chemotherapy was the vinca alkaloid vinblastine from the plant Catharanthus roseus, which was put into clinical practice to treat pediatric hematological malignancies in the mid-1950s. Currently, vinblastine is used in adjuvant and combination chemotherapy for several tumor types including breast, testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma. Another class of microtubule inhibitors is the taxanes with paclitaxel (Taxol, Food and Drug Administration approval in 1995), becoming a highly successful anticancer agent. Although microtubule inhibitors have played a key role in cancer chemotherapy for many decades, a molecular explanation of how cells die in response to mitotic checkpoint activation has proven difficult to establish. One of the complicating factors is that microtubule inhibitors activate many different signaling pathways (4Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 413-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 7Bhalla K.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9075-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, one highly consistent observation is the phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins including Bcl-2 (8Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and Bcl-xL (9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar). Although Bcl-2 appears to undergo different types of phosphorylation involved in both cell survival and cell death, extensive multisite phosphorylation occurs in response to microtubule inhibitors (for review, see Ref. 10Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. May W.S. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Expression of phospho-defective forms of Bcl-2 renders some cell types more resistant to microtubule inhibitors, suggesting that phosphorylation antagonizes Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic function (11Srivastava R.K. Mi Q. Hardwick M.J. Longo D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3775-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), whereas another study suggested that drug-induced multisite phosphorylation promotes Bcl-2 anti-apoptosis function through protein stabilization (13Brichese L. Barboule N. Heliez C. Valette A. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 278: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL phosphorylation also occurs in response to microtubule inhibitors (9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar) and other apoptotic stimuli including ionizing radiation (14Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.

In light of information that, among many apoptotic regulatory proteins, Bcl-xL expression correlates uniquely with drug resistance (15Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6101-6110PubMed Google Scholar), it is particularly important to understand mechanisms that govern Bcl-xL function. However, information on the functional significance and enzymology of Bcl-xL phosphorylation is controversial. For example, whereas several reports suggest that phosphorylation is catalyzed by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), 3The abbreviations used are:JNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHAhemagglutininMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideMSmass spectrometryMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationVBLvinblastineTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 3The abbreviations used are:JNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHAhemagglutininMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideMSmass spectrometryMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationVBLvinblastineTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine in one study phosphorylation was reported to occur on serine (serine 62) (16Basu A.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and in another study phosphorylation was reported to occur on threonine residues (threonines 47 and 115) (14Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol.

These apparent discrepancies appear to stem from the fact that potential sites of phosphorylation have been inferred based in particular on the assumption that JNK is the responsible kinase rather than directly determined. However, studies implicating JNK in microtubule inhibitor-induced Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation (12Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 14Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z. Narula J.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have been complicated by the fact that JNK also plays a key role in cell cycle progression. In a carefully designed study using synchronized cells examined over an extended time-course, we showed that when cells are treated with both a JNK inhibitor and a microtubule inhibitor, the JNK inhibitor slows the normal progression to mitotic arrest, and events such as Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation are delayed by many hours (17Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in the context of validated JNK inhibition, microtubule inhibitor-induced Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation still occurs to a normal extent (17Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, conclusions regarding the effect on Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 function of mutation of putative JNK sites are tempered by apparent misidentification of the kinase responsible. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hemagglutinin 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization vinblastine N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hemagglutinin 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization vinblastine N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine In this study we report the direct biochemical identification of a major site of phosphorylation in Bcl-xL induced by vinblastine and other microtubule inhibitors. This approach represents an unequivocal determination of the authentic site of phosphorylation and is not subject to the uncertainty that can arise when sites are inferred via indirect mutagenesis-based approaches. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that cells expressing a validated phospho-defective Bcl-xL mutant are highly vinblastine-resistant, indicating that phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for antagonizing anti-apoptotic function. Furthermore, co-expression of wild-type or phospho-defective Bcl-xL conferred resistance to Bax induced cell death, whereas a phospho-mimic Bcl-xL mutant failed to protect cells from Bax, in part due to reduced Bax binding. These studies provide mechanistic insight into the role of Bcl-xL phosphorylation induced by microtubule inhibitors. Materials—Bcl-xL antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (catalogue number 2762; for immunoprecipitation) or Santa Cruz (catalogue number sc-509, clone H-5; for immunoblotting). Bax antibody (catalogue number 2772) and active caspase-3 antibody (catalogue number 9661) were from Cell Signaling Technology, and active Bax antibody 6A7 was from Axxora. Procaspase-3 antibody (catalogue number sc-7148) was from Santa Cruz, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (catalogue number 4300) antibody was from Ambion, Cox II (Complex IV) antibody was from an OXPHOS complex detection kit (MitoSciences), and anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads were from eBioscience (catalogue number 00-8800-26). Neomycin (G418 sulfate) was from Mediatech, Mitotracker Red was from Molecular Probes, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit goat antibody and vinblastine were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture and Transfection—The KB-3 cell line was maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C and 5! CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 unit/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells stably overexpressing HA-Bcl-xL or phospho-mutants were prepared by transfecting KB-3 cells with human Bcl-xL tagged with HA epitope in pCDNA3.1 vector and maintained in 0.5 mg/ml G418 as described (18Upreti M. Lyle C.S. Skaug B. Du L. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15941-15950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted as described (17Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared using the sub-cell fractionation kit from Focus™ (catalogue number 786-260). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were permeabilized with 1! Triton-X100 for 5 min and blocked with 10! goat serum for 20 min. Cells were then incubated with Bcl-xL antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 h at a dilution of 1:100 and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at a dilution of 1:1000. All steps were performed at room temperature. To visualize mitochondria, cells were incubated with Mitotracker Red (1:1000) for 5 min at 37 °C and fixed with 3.7! formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Immunofluorescent protein and mitochondria were visualized using 488 and 568 laser lines of a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope. 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium Bromide (MTT) Cell Viability Assay—Cells (2000/well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and the following day vinblastine was added. After 72 h MTT (50 mg/well) was added for 4 h followed by dimethyl sulfoxide solubilization of the cells, and absorbance was read at 540 nm. Data are expressed relative to untreated controls. Apoptosis Assay—Untreated and treated cells were diluted to a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml for measurement of apoptosis using the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). In this colorimetric assay values are represented by absorbance at 405 nm. Immunoprecipitation—Optimization of Bcl-xL immunoprecipitation was performed using methodology described previously (19Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.3 ml of 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.12 m NaCl, 1! Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors and, after 30 min on ice, centrifuged at 9200 × g for 20 min. The extract (1.0 mg) was precleared with anti-rabbit goat IgG agarose beads according to the manufacturer's directions (eBiosciences) and to the supernatant was added rabbit polyclonal antibody (2–7.5 μg). After mixing for 2 h, anti-rabbit goat IgG-agarose beads were added and mixed overnight. After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered, and the immunoprecipitate was washed as described previously (18Upreti M. Lyle C.S. Skaug B. Du L. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15941-15950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Equivalent portions of supernatant and precipitate were subjected to 12.5! acrylamide SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting which was performed with monoclonal mouse antibodies. Preparative immunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL was carried out using the same protocol except that extracts containing 8 mg of protein, derived from ∼108 cells, were used for each condition, and the amounts of antibody and IgG beads were increased proportionally. After the immunoprecipitates were washed, elution was performed in 1 ml of 0.5 m NH4OH, 0.5 mm EDTA, and after incubation with rotation for 10 min at room temperature, samples were dried in a speed vacuum overnight. Samples were resolved by 13.5! acrylamide SDS-PAGE using separation gels 15 cm in length and stained in Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Pierce). Examination of the interaction of Bcl-xL and Bax by co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (18Upreti M. Lyle C.S. Skaug B. Du L. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15941-15950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Gel bands were excised, and Coomassie was removed by serial washing with 50! methanol, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Each gel band was divided into two portions of which half was digested with 75 ng of trypsin and the other half with 100 ng of endoproteinase AspN (Roche Applied Science). The resulting peptides were spotted in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid for MALDI-MS and MALDI-MS2 analysis (20Chang E.J. Archambault V. McLachlin D.T. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4472-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Tackett A.J. DeGrasse J.A. Sekedat M.D. Oeffinger M. Pout M.P. Chait B.T. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 1752-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A high accuracy (∼5 ppm) mass spectrum (MALDI-MS) was taken of each sample with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences prOTOF mass spectrometer. Utilizing a custom engineered sample stage, the peptides observed from the spectra collected with the prOTOF mass spectrometer were subjected to tandem mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-MS2) with a Thermo vMALDI-LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer. A single data file containing the high accuracy peptide measurements and fragmentation information was used to identify Bcl-xL via data base searching with the program XProteo (21Tackett A.J. DeGrasse J.A. Sekedat M.D. Oeffinger M. Pout M.P. Chait B.T. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 1752-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The combination of peptides resulting from trypsin and AspN digestion provided for 64! sequence coverage of Bcl-xL. Peptide Phosphorylation—A peptide corresponding to residues 58–66 of Bcl-xL containing Ser-62 with 3 C-terminal arginines (HLADSPAVNRRR) and termed FL62 (for flexible loop) was synthesized by GenScript. Phosphorylation reactions contained 5 μg of whole cell extract (17Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 40 μg of FL62 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 m EDTA to 20 mm and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and aliquots containing 10 μg of FL62 were applied to 16.5! acrylamide gels. Gels were fixed overnight in 5! glutaraldehyde, washed with H2O, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 48 h, and an image was obtained using a PhosphorImager processed using ImageQuant NT (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis—pHA-Bcl-xL/pcDNA3.1 (plasmid encoding HA-tagged human Bcl-xL in pcDNA3.1 vector) served as a template. The HA-Bcl-xL (S62A), HA-Bcl-xL (T47A), and HA-Bcl-xL (S62D) mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequences of all cDNA constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection—4 μg of pCDNA3.1 or plasmids encoding wild-type HA-Bcl-xL, phospho-mimic (HA-Bcl-xL(S62A)), or phospho-defective (HA-Bcl-xL(S62D)) mutant constructs were used to transfect KB-3 cells using Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Co-transfections were performed using 2 μgof the above plasmids plus 2 μg of Myc-CMV or Myc-Bax. 48 h after transfection whole cell extracts were made to assess the level of transfected protein by immunoblotting. To assess cell survival, non-viable (non-adherent) cells were removed and counted, and adherent cells were visualized under phase contrast microscopy, photographed, and then recovered by trypsinization and counted. Bax Activation—Assessment of Bax activation was performed as described previously (18Upreti M. Lyle C.S. Skaug B. Du L. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15941-15950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Validation of Bcl-xL-overexpressing Cells as a Model System—The KB-3 cell line undergoes a well defined mitotic arrest followed by apoptotic cell death in response to treatment with vinblastine and is readily transfectable and easy to synchronize (17Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it represents an excellent model system for understanding the molecular link between mitotic arrest and apoptosis and for examining the role of Bcl-xL phosphorylation during these processes. Based on evidence derived from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that Bcl-xL is a very low abundance protein, we generated KB-3 cells overexpressing HA-tagged Bcl-xL (termed KB-3/HA-Bcl-xL) to increase the amount of protein available for purification (Fig. 1A). Subcellular fractionation indicated that HA-Bcl-xL was primarily mitochondrial and also present in the cytosol (Fig. 1B), as found for the endogenous protein (17Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (note that under these immunoblotting conditions, endogenous Bcl-xL is not detectable, but see Fig. 3). That HA-Bcl-xL was mainly mitochondrial was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining (supplemental Fig. S1). Procaspase 3 was used as a cytosolic marker, and it is evident that it was more susceptible to loss in vinblastine-treated KB-3 cells versus KB-3/HA-Bcl-xL cells (Fig. 1B). In concert, active caspase-3 was detectable in KB-3 cells but undetectable in KB-3/HA-Bcl-xL cells after vinblastine treatment (Fig. 1C). More comprehensive studies were performed to characterize the drug-resistant properties of KB-3/HA-Bcl-xL cells. Assays evaluating cell survival and apoptosis demonstrated that cells overexpressing HA-Bcl-xL were markedly vinblastine-resistant (Fig. 2, A and B). Indeed, although 1 nm vinblastine was sufficient to kill the majority of KB-3 cells (IC50 of 0.6 nm), 50! survival was observed for HA-Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells treated with 10–150 nm vinblastine (Fig. 2A). Because these assays measure the number of viable cells relative to untreated cells (which continue to proliferate during this interval), the results are consistent with HA-Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells being susceptible to vinblastine-induced growth arrest but resistant to subsequent cell death. This notion was supported by evaluation of cyclin B levels which confirmed that vinblastine caused mitotic arrest independent of Bcl-xL expression level (see supplemental Fig. S5).FIGURE 3Immunopurification of Bcl-xL. KB-3 cells were untreated (lanes 1 and 2) or treated with 200 nm VBL for 24 h (lanes 3 and 4). Immunoprecipitations using 8 mg of protein were performed with (+Ab, lanes 2 and 4) or without (–Ab, lanes 1 and 3) Bcl-xL antibody. Immunoprecipitates were run on a long (15-cm separation gel) 13.5! acrylamide gel and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated HA-Bcl-xL bands are indicated as are IgG light and heavy chains derived from the IgG beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2HA-Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells are resistant to vinblastine.

The results shown are mean ± S.D. (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To purify phosphorylated Bcl-xL from KB-3/HA-Bcl-xL cells, it was important to establish conditions for optimal phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with 30 nm vinblastine produced a characteristic phosphorylation-induced mobility shift in endogenous Bcl-xL, but any such change in HA-Bcl-xL was obscured by overexpression (supplemental Fig. S2A). However, by reducing gel loading to 3 μg protein and increasing the concentration of vinblastine to 200 nm, a distinct quantitative mobility shift in HA-Bcl-xL was observed (supplemental Fig. S2B). These results together with those of Fig. 1 suggest that the characteristics of overexpressed HA-Bcl-xL parallel those of the endogenous protein, thus validating the system for its intended use. Purification of HA-Bcl-xL—Initially HA affinity chromatography was tested to purify HA-Bcl-xL, but yields were poor, and many impurities were apparent. Therefore, we investigated immunoprecipitation as a purification approach. Optimization was carried out by testing different amounts of antibody, and under appropriate conditions quantitative recovery of Bcl-xL in the precipitate could be achieved (supplemental Fig. S3). The procedure was scaled up, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated material was released from the beads under high pH conditions, concentrated by rotary evaporation, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 3). Complete immunoprecipitations performed with Bcl-xL antibody showed stained bands at 32–34 kDa, with the sample from vinblastine-treated cells (lane 4) showing a distinct mobility shift compared with the sample from control cells (lane 2). Prominent bands at 25 and 50 kDa were also observed, but as these were present also in incubations performed in the absence of Bcl-xL antibody (lanes 1 and 3), they presumably represented light and heavy chains derived from the IgG beads. Mass Spectrometry—Excised gel bands were processed and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Overall sequence coverage was 64! (Fig. 4A). To detect Bcl-xL peptides phosphorylated upon vinblastine treatment, a theoretical mass list of all possible phosphorylated versions of Bcl-xL peptides (containing Ser, Thr, or Tyr) was generated. We manually interrogated each of the MALDI-MS spectra for the presence of these phosphorylated peptides. One peptide (residues 61–75) showed single phosphorylation (+80 Da) upon vinblastine treatment (Fig. 4B). MALDI-MS2 analysis of this peptide revealed the phosphopeptide signature loss of 98 Da (20Chang E.J. Archambault V. McLachlin D.T. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4472-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated or unphosphorylated peptide fragments which unambiguously mapped phosphorylation to Ser-62 and not the other serines or the threonine (supplemental Fig. S4A) (20Chang E.J. Archambault V. McLachlin D.T. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4472-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS3 analysis of the –98-Da fragment provided further definitive mapping of the site of phosphorylation to Ser-62 (supplemental Fig. S4B). Interestingly, p"
https://openalex.org/W2096005515,"The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that consists of a polyhedral protein shell filled with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of CO2 fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle.To analyze the role of RubisCO in carboxysome biogenesis in vivo we have created a series of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus RubisCO mutants. We identified the large subunit of the enzyme as an important determinant for its sequestration into alpha-carboxysomes and found that the carboxysomes of H. neapolitanus readily incorporate chimeric and heterologous RubisCO species. Intriguingly, a mutant lacking carboxysomal RubisCO assembles empty carboxysome shells of apparently normal shape and composition.These results indicate that carboxysome shell architecture is not determined by the enzyme they normally sequester. Our study provides, for the first time, clear evidence that carboxysome contents can be manipulated and suggests future nanotechnological applications that are based upon engineered protein microcompartments."
https://openalex.org/W2035575053,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major causative agent of mortality throughout the world. The initial event in invasive pneumococcal disease is the attachment of pneumococci to epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. Several bacterial proteins can bind to host extracellular matrix proteins and function as adhesins and invasins. To identify adhesins or invasins on the pneumococcal cell surface, we searched for several proteins with an LPXTG anchoring motif in the whole-genome sequence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and identified one, which we called PfbA (plasmin- and fibronectin-binding protein A), that bound to human serum proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that PfbA was expressed on the pneumococcal cell surface. A ΔpfbA mutant strain was only half as competent as the wild-type strain at adhering to and invading lung and laryngeal epithelial cells. In addition, epithelial cells infected with ΔpfbA showed morphological changes, including cell flattening and a loss of microvilli, that did not occur in cells infected with the wild-type strain. The mutant strain also exhibited a weaker antiphagocytotic activity than wild type in human peripheral blood. Moreover, the growth of wild-type bacteria in human whole blood containing anti-PfbA antibodies was reduced by ∼50% after 3 h compared with its growth without the antibody. These results suggest that PfbA is an important factor in the development of pneumococcal infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major causative agent of mortality throughout the world.

These results suggest that PfbA is an important factor in the development of pneumococcal infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is also simply called pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive Diplococcus and the major pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia. It also causes meningitis, otitis, and septicemia, with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality throughout the world (1File T.M. Lancet. 2003; 362: 1991-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 2Gutiérrez F. Masiá M. Mirete C. Soldán B. Rodríguez J.C. Padilla S. Hernández I. Royo G. Martin-Hidalgo A. J. Infect. 2006; 53: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The initial phase of infection involves colonization followed by intimate contact with the host cells, which promotes bacterial uptake by the host cell. Successful conversion from a commensal to an invasive microorganism is accompanied by pathogen transmigration through tissue barriers and its subsequent adaptation to different host niches, which is a multifunctional and highly regulated process (3Hammerschmidt S. Wolff S. Hocke A. Rosseau S. Müller E. Rohde M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4653-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, to find ways to prevent pathogenic bacteria from initiating local inflammation or becoming invasive, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying bacterial adhesion to host cells. Pathogenic microorganisms, particularly Gram-positive bacteria, recognize various components of extracellular matrices to obtain access to host cells in their target tissues. The bacteria can remain in the extracellular environment, which allows them to persist in the host niche, or they can enter host cells and spread into subcellular compartments (4Talay S.R. Contrib. Microbiol. 2005; 12: 90-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Avoiding phagocytosis is also important for bacterial survival, and a variety of mechanisms related to streptococcal survival strategies for avoiding host immunity have been reported. In particular, S. pyogenes expresses a number of proteins that are postulated to play a crucial role in its colonization and antiphagocytic activities (5Bisno A.L. Brito M.O. Collins C.M.

A polysaccharide-based vaccine against S. pneumoniae is presently used; however, it is ineffective in children younger than 2 years of age and only 60% effective in older children and adults (9Butler J.C.

A newer, conjugate vaccine consisting of a protein linked to the saccharides of seven major disease-causing serotypes has been licensed for use in infants. This vaccine is effective in preventing invasive diseases caused by pneumococci expressing the capsular serotypes contained in the vaccine. Nevertheless, it cannot be expected to provide protection against other serotypes. In addition, antibiotic-resistant strains are on the rise (9Butler J.C. Hofmann J. Cetron M.S. Elliott J.A.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the characterization of S. pneumoniae surface proteins that could serve as candidate targets for protein-based vaccines and the development of new antibiotics (13Jedrzejas M.J.

One of the most promising avenues for creating effective vaccines or drugs is the targeting of adhesins and invasins that promote the adhesion of pathogens to human tissues. In the present study, we found that inactivation of the pfbA gene in S. pneumoniae significantly reduced the bacterial ability to bind human epithelial cells. We also showed that pfbA expression was involved in protecting pneumococci against phagocytosis. Finally, we found that anti-PfbA antibodies reduced pneumococcal growth in human whole blood by ∼50% compared with its growth without antibodies.

To construct the Δspr1652 mutant strain MY7, PCR products from the upstream and downstream regions of spr1652 were ligated into the pYT339 vector, and the resultant plasmids were linearized with HindIII and used to transform competent cells of the S. pneumoniae strain R6. To prepare competent cells, 0.5 ml of exponentialphase organisms in TS broth were added to prewarmed TS broth (9.5 ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. A portion (1 ml) of the culture was then removed and placed in a tube containing 100 ng of competence-stimulating peptide (17Håvarstein L.S. Coomaraswamy G. Morrison D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). After further incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, 0.2-ml portions were removed, placed in fresh tubes containing ∼0.1-μg of linearized plasmid (10 μl), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Thereafter, each culture was plated onto TS blood agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Inactivation of the spr1652 gene in the mutant strain MY7 was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification using the spr1652D, Spn9802, or Spn9828 primer pairs (Table 1). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Pneumococcal RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cultures in TS broth. Total RNA was prepared from cells using a TRIzol Max Bacterial RNA Isolation kit (Invitrogen), and then 0.8 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of random hexamers using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Rabbit Anti-PfbA Serum—All animal procedures were conducted in compliance with the Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry guidelines and approved by the institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee (accession number 05-018). On days 0, 21, 42, and 63, New Zealand White rabbits (Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized with pentobarbital, as previously described (18Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), then given an injection of 500 μg of recombinant protein in Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant. Serum was collected on day 84 and stored at -80 °C until use. Ligand Blotting—Ligand blot analysis was performed as described previously (18Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, human fibronectin (Fn, Sigma), human plasmin (Sigma), human plasminogen (Sigma), and human serum albumin (HSA, Sigma) were biotinylated using an ECL protein biotinylation kit (GE Healthcare), and the concentrations were adjusted to 10 μg/ml. Recombinant proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 10% membrane blocking agent (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 18 h and incubated with biotinylated proteins for 1 h and with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin at room temperature for another hour. Bands were detected by using ECL Western-blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare) and exposing the membrane to x-ray film (Fuji photo film) at room temperature for 5 s. Biacore Analysis—Biacore analysis was performed as described previously (19Terao Y. Okamoto S. Kataoka K. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fn, plasmin, plasminogen, or HSA was diluted to 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip using an Amine-coupling kit (GE Healthcare). Lyophilized recombinant PfbA was suspended in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20) and adjusted to 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm. For binding analysis the recombinant PfbA was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. A blank was used as the reference, the results of which were subtracted from all raw data. To fit the binding kinetics data to a model, BIA evaluation Version 3.0.2 software (GE Healthcare) was applied, and the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was chosen. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopic Analysis—Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (20Terao Y. Kawabata S. Nakata M. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. J. Biol.

Briefly, streptococcal cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 10% goat serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals). To observe the localization of PfbA, the bacterial cells were stained with SYBR green I, and surface PfbA was visualized using rabbit anti-PfbA serum followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). The stained bacteria were analyzed using an LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Flow-cytometric Analysis of S. pneumoniae—S. pneumoniae cells were cultured to the mid-log phase and harvested by centrifugation then washed twice with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, antisera were diluted 1:100 and incubated with the bacterial cells on ice for 1 h, then FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for another 1 h. After washing the samples were analyzed with a CyFlow flow cytometer (Partec) using FlowJo 8.3.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). The Fn labeling procedure was performed using a FluoReporter® FITC protein labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. S. pneumoniae cells were cultured to the mid-log phase and adjusted to 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, then incubated with 0 or 10 μg/ml of FITC-labeled Fn for 30 min at 37 °C. The Fn binding activity on the surface of live bacterial cells was analyzed with a CyFlow flow cytometer. Preparation of Streptococci for Adhesion and Invasion Assays—Pneumococci were cultured until the absorbance at 600 nm (A600) reached 0.6–0.7. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Biscarboxyethyl-carboxyfluorescein-pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen), a nonvital intracellular dye, was added to the bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 1 mm. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescent streptococci were washed 3 times with PBS and then used immediately in adhesion and invasion assays. Streptococcal Adhesion and Invasion Assays—The bacterial adhesion to and invasion of human cells were quantified by standard procedures with minor modifications as described previously (22Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fässler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi M. Terao Y. Ogawa T. Takahashi T. Hamada S. Kawabata S. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2791-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEp-2 and A549 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well and infected with 3 × 106 CFU of bacteria per well (multiplicity of infection, 1:30) for 1 h. To determine bacterial adhesion, the infected cells were washed 3 times with PBS and harvested with a trypsin solution. The fluorescence intensity in the cell lysates was measured in 96-well plates using a Wallac 1420 ARVO multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to determine the number of S. pneumoniae. To measure bacterial invasion, the cells were washed 3 times and incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 units/ml). The cells were washed and lysed, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured as described above to determine the number of invaded S. pneumoniae. To determine the Fn-dependent adhesion activity, 24 h before the addition of bacteria the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with or without human Fn (10 μg/ml). Collagen-coated plates were used in the Fn-dependent adhesion experiment. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the percentage of S. pneumoniae recovered per well from six independent determinations. The assays were repeated three times, and representative results are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. All tests were carried out using StatView J-5.0 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Adhesion of PfbA-coated Fluorescent Beads to A549 Cells—Recombinant PfbA in BSA was covalently linked to 0.5-μm-diameter fluorescent beads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A549 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and then washed twice with PBS. Next, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15 μl of PfbA-, BSA-, or non-coated fluorescent beads was added to the washed cells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with 200 μl of trypsin solution. To determine the number of fluorescent beads, the fluorescence intensity of the cell lysates was measured in 96-well plates using the Wallac 1420 ARVO multilabel counter with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. Scanning Electron Microscopic Analysis—A549 cells were grown to semi-confluence on coverslips and infected with the streptococcal strains as described above. The infected cells were incubated for 1 h, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with distilled water. The samples were dehydrated with 100% t-butyl alcohol and freeze-dried. Finally, the samples were coated with platinum and examined with an emission-scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390LVZ, JEOL Ltd.). Bactericidal Assay—Lancefield bactericidal assays were performed as described previously (23Yamaguchi M. Terao Y. Ogawa T. Takahashi T. Hamada S. Kawabata S. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2791-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Wessels M.R. Goldberg J.B. Moses A.E. DiCesare T.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 433-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains R6 and MY7 were grown, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS as previously described. Diluted cultures (10 μl) were combined with fresh human blood with or without rabbit anti-PfbA IgG or preimmune IgG (final 100 μg/ml, 90 μl), and the mixtures were rotated at 37 °C for 1, 2, or 3 h. The IgG (2.0 mg/ml) from rabbit serum was purified using a monoclonal antibody Trap kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viable cell counts were determined by plating diluted samples onto blood agar. PfbA Protein Binds to Fibronectin, Plasmin(ogen), and Human Serum Albumin—An LPXTG motif is the cell-anchoring sequence in Gram-positive bacteria, and most of the LPXTG-containing proteins work as virulence factors. Gram-positive bacterial adhesins/invasins commonly possess the motif. In the present study we selected three different LPXTG motif-containing proteins, SpR1345, SpR1652, and SpR1806, from the S. pneumoniae strain R6 genome data base because of their recombinant proteins were easily water-soluble. SpR1345 (SP1492) is a mucin-binding protein (25Bumbaca D. Littlejohn J.E. Nayakanti H. Lucas A.H. Rigden D.J. Galperin M.Y. Jedrzejas M.J. Proteins. 2007; 66: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and SpR1652 (SP1833), annotated as a right-handed β-helical protein, is a probable polysaccharide-modifying enzyme (14Rigden D.J. Galperin M.Y. Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 143-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). SpR1806 (SP1992) is a hypothetical protein. The 92–160-amino acid region of SpR1806 contained a domain of unknown function DUF1542 (E value 6.3 × 10-6), which is found in several cell-surface proteins. It has been suggested that some of these molecules function in antibiotic resistance and/or cellular adhesion. Using ligand-blot analysis, we next investigated whether these recombinant proteins bound to host proteins. Our results showed that recombinant SpR1652 bound to Fn, plasmin, plasminogen, and HSA (Fig. 1, Table 2). We, therefore, focused our study on this protein, which we called PfbA (plasmin- and fibronectin-binding protein A). We next analyzed the binding constants using the surface plasmon resonance method with the Biacore system. The KD values of PfbA binding to Fn, plasmin, plasminogen, and HSA indicated moderate affinities and specific interactions (Table 3) that were close to those of other Fn-binding proteins (26Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5709-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), PfbA (SpR1652) was characterized as a cell-wall surface anchor family protein. Indeed, PfbA possessed a typical LPXTG motif in its C terminus followed by a stretch of positively charged amino acid residues. In the N-terminal region, a deduced signal-peptidase cleavage site was located between amino acids 47 and 48. A BLAST search showed an Fn type III repeat in the 115–133-amino acid region of PfbA. In Fn itself, the first of several type III repeats binds to the type I repeat of another Fn molecule, and this interaction has been proposed as a point of regulation in Fn-Fn interactions (28Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PfbA Is a Pneumococcal Cell-surface Protein—Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that PfbA was localized to the pneumococcal cell surface (Fig. 2A; red in image). In addition, flow cytometric analysis showed that S. pneumoniae strain R6 was stained positively by the anti-PfbA serum, whereas ΔpfbA strain MY7 did not react with it (Fig. 2B). These findings indicated that PfbA is localized to the cell surface of live pneumococci. There was no significant difference in the surface expression of pneumococcal α-enolase, used as a negative control, between strains R6 and MY7 (Fig. 2B). In addition, we examined the differences between strains R6 and MY7 using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter system and FITC-labeled Fn (Fig. 3). The fluorescence intensity was substantially lower for strain R6, incubated without FITC-labeled Fn, as compared with R6, incubated with FITC-labeled Fn, whereas the histograms for strain MY7 showed similar patterns regardless of the existence of FITC-labeled Fn. However, fluorescence intensity was substantially lower for strain MY7 than R6 when the bacteria were incubated with FITC-labeled Fn. These results suggest that PfbA is expressed and functions as an Fn-binding protein on the surface of S. pneumoniae. PfbA Facilitates Pneumococcal Adhesion to and Invasion of Epithelial Cells—To investigate the function of PfbA, the adhesion and the invasion efficiencies of strain R6 and its mutant, MY7, were compared using HEp-2 and A549 cells, which are human laryngeal and alveolar lung epithelial cell lines, respectively. Strain MY7 showed half the adhesion and invasion efficiencies of R6 for these epithelial cells (Fig. 4). Next, we confirmed the cell binding activity of PfbA by using PfbA-coated fluorescent beads. The relative rates of adhesion of PfbA-, BSA-, and non-coated fluorescent beads to A549 cells are shown in Fig. 5. The PfbA-coated fluorescent beads showed at least 5-fold greater adhesion than the BSA-coated beads and 20-fold greater adhesion than the non-coated samples, indicating that PfbA functions directly as an adhesin. Furthermore, strain R6 showed increased adhesion to A549 cells after the addition of Fn, but strain MY7 did not (Fig. 6). These results indicate that PfbA serves, at least in part, as an Fn-dependent adhesin and invasin.FIGURE 6PfbA is an Fn-dependent adhesin. Experiments were performed in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml Fn. Bacterial adhesion to A549 cells in the absence of Fn was considered to be 100%. *, significant difference (p < 0.05) between the means, determined using a Mann-Whitney U test.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2046318929,"Several enzymes have evolved as sensors in signal transduction pathways to control gene expression, thereby allowing bacteria to adapt efficiently to environmental changes. We recently identified the master regulator of cysteine metabolism in Bacillus subtilis, CymR, which belongs to the poorly characterized Rrf2 family of regulators. We now report that the signal transduction mechanism controlling CymR activity in response to cysteine availability involves the formation of a stable complex with CysK, a key enzyme for cysteine biosynthesis. We carried out a comprehensive quantitative characterization of this regulator-enzyme interaction by surface plasmon resonance and analytical ultracentrifugation. We also showed that O-acetylserine plays a dual role as a substrate of CysK and as an effector modulating the CymR-CysK complex formation. The ability of B. subtilis CysK to bind to CymR appears to be correlated to the loss of its capacity to form a cysteine synthase complex with CysE. We propose an original model, supported by the determination of the intracellular concentrations of the different partners, by which CysK positively regulates CymR in sensing the bacterial cysteine pool.

Bacteria have been particularly inventive to survive in a diversity of environments by developing mechanisms of regulation of gene expression as complex as those found in eukaryotic cells (1Balaji S. Babu M.M. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 1108-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). They efficiently adapt to environmental changes by linking gene expression to intracellular pools of key metabolites in various ways. In most cases, these effector molecules act either by directly binding to transcriptional regulators or via specific receptors as observed for two-component regulatory systems and sigma-antisigma factors. However, in the cell, the enzymes are the most suitable to inform about metabolite availability. They specifically recognize their substrates or allosteric effectors and often undergo conformational changes upon binding or during enzymatic reaction. Several enzymes have evolved as sensors in signal transduction pathways controlling gene expression. These bifunctional proteins, which are active as well in metabolism as in regulation, are called trigger enzymes (2Commichau F.M. Stulke J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 692-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some enzymes can directly bind to DNA (BirA, PutA, NadR, and PepA) or RNA (CitB), whereas phosphotransferase system components control the activity of transcription factors by phosphorylation events. However, the most abundant class of trigger enzymes modulates the transcriptional activity of regulators by protein-protein interactions. For instance, enzymes MalK, Aes, and MalY form complexes with the MalT activator (3Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Joly N. Bohm A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These enzymes antagonize the binding of maltotriose, the co-activator of MalT. In the control of nitrogen metabolism in Bacillus subtilis, glutamate dehydrogenase (RocG) and glutamine synthetase are able to interact, respectively, with the GltC activator or the TnrA repressor and to inactivate them concomitantly (5Commichau F.M. Herzberg C. Tripal P. Valerius O. Stulke J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Wray Jr., L.V. Fisher S.H. J. Biol.

Here, we report that CysK, the O-acetylserine thiol-lyase of B. subtilis, has acquired a regulatory function and is therefore a trigger enzyme acting as a repressor in the regulation of cysteine metabolism by an original mechanism.In bacteria, some archea and plants, cysteine biosynthesis proceeds via a two-step pathway involving CysK and CysE, the serine acetyl-transferase. CysE catalyzes the acetylation of l-serine by acetyl-CoA to give O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS) 4The abbreviations used are:OASO-acetyl-l-serinePLPpyridoxal 5′-phosphateMBPmaltose-binding proteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidRUresonance unitsSPRsurface plasmon resonanceBDDNA-binding domainADactivation domainHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHTHhelix turn helix 4The abbreviations used are:OASO-acetyl-l-serinePLPpyridoxal 5′-phosphateMBPmaltose-binding proteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidRUresonance unitsSPRsurface plasmon resonanceBDDNA-binding domainADactivation domainHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHTHhelix turn helix. The OAS-thiollyase, CysK, then converts OAS and sulfide into l-cysteine and acetate. According to its catalytic mechanism, CysK belongs to the fold type II group of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes (7Mehta P.K. Christen P. Adv. Enzymol. 2000; 74: 129-184PubMed Google Scholar). In Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and higher plants, CysE and CysK form a bienzyme complex, called cysteine synthase (8Kredich N.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The function of the complex is not metabolic channeling but rather a modulation of the activity of each enzyme in the complex. This association of serine acetyl-transferase and OAS-thiol-lyase provides a regulatory mechanism for cysteine biosynthesis in plants (11Berkowitz O. Wirtz M. Wolf A. Kuhlmann J. Hell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30629-30634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In line with the crucial role of cysteine in cellular physiology and with the reactivity of its SH group, the transport, the biosynthesis and the degradation of this amino acid are tightly controlled in response to environmental changes. A large variety of molecular mechanisms participate in fine-tuning the regulation of cysteine metabolism in bacteria (12Guédon E. Martin-Verstraete I. Wendisch V.F. Amino Acid Biosynthesis: Pathways, Regulation and Metabolic Engineering. eds. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2007: 195-218Google Scholar). The CymR regulator has recently been characterized as the central repressor of cysteine metabolism in B. subtilis (13Even S. Burguière P. Auger S. Soutourina O. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2184-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CymR belongs to the large and widespread Rrf2 family of transcription factors, which comprises the iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis regulator IscR in E. coli (14Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 246: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CymR controls the expression of genes involved either in cysteine synthesis from sulfide (cysK), sulfonates (ssu), or methionine (mccAB) or in cystine uptake (tcyP), by directly binding a 27-bp conserved motif in their promoter regions (13Even S. Burguière P. Auger S. Soutourina O. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2184-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Choi S.Y. Reyes D. Leelakriangsak M. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5741-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a large set of genes is controlled by both CymR and CysK in B. subtilis (13Even S. Burguière P. Auger S. Soutourina O. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2184-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. Schujman G.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7631-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous experiments suggested that CysK and CymR are required to induce a DNA electrophoretic mobility shift (19Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Physiological data and gel shift experiments also show that OAS, the direct precursor of cysteine, is important in the signaling pathway controlling CymR-dependent repression in the presence of cysteine (19Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Burguière P. Fert J. Guillouard I. Auger S.

This enzyme acts as a sensor of cysteine availability in the signal transduction pathway modulating CymR activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1.

Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in plasmids pDIA5653, pDIA5647, pDIA5778, and pDIA5779 (Table 1). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains PJ69-4a and PJ69-4α (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were then transformed respectively by the bait- and prey-derived vectors. Because we failed to clone cymR into the pGAD and pGBDU vectors in E. coli, we used gap repair recombination in S. cerevisiae (23Noirot-Gros M.F. Velten M. Yoshimura M. McGovern S. Morimoto T. Ehrlich S.D. Ogasawara N. Polard P. Noirot P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to directly construct the plasmids containing the translational fusion of cymR with Gal4BD or Gal4AD.The two-hybrid assays were then performed as previously described (24Veiga P. Bulbarela-Sampieri C. Furlan S. Maisons A. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Erkelenz M. Mervelet P. Noirot P. Frees D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. Gruss A. Buist G. Kulakauskas S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19342-19354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Positive protein-protein interaction between the bait and a prey was detected by the ability of the cells to grow on plates with synthetic complete medium depleted for leucine, uracil, and histidine (SC-LUH) and for leucine, uracil, and adenine (SC-LUA). Interaction phenotypes were scored after 4 and 22 days of growth at 30 °C.Overexpression and Purification of CysE, CysK, MccA, and CymR—To obtain CysE fused to a His tag at the N terminus (His6-CysE) or at the C terminus (CysE-His6), the cysE gene (+1 to +626) was amplified by PCR using primers introducing a 5′-NdeI site and a 3′-XhoI site. This fragment was cloned into pET28a or pET22b (Novagen) to form a translational fusion of cysE with six histidine codons at the 5′ (pDIA5795) or 3′ (pDIA5794) ends, respectively (Table 1). To obtain CysK fused to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the N terminus (MBP-CysK), the cysK gene (+1 to +924) was amplified by PCR using primers introducing a 5′-XbaI site or a 3′-PstI site, and the corresponding fragment was cloned into pMAL-c2X (BioLabs), giving pDIA5796. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 strain (Novagen), which contains pDIA17 (25Munier H. Gilles A.M. Glaser P. Krin E. Danchin A. Sarfati R. Barzu O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The resulting strains were grown at room temperature in LB medium to an A600 of 1. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was then added, followed by incubations for 7 h at 20 °C and 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 300 mm NaCl and protease inhibitor (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication. E. coli crude extracts containing His-tagged CysE were loaded on a Ni-NTA-agarose column and eluted with 300 mm imidazole. The crude extract containing MBP-CysK was loaded on an amylose column (Biolabs) and eluted with 10 mm maltose. MBP-CysK was then cleaved by the Factor X. The Factor X was removed using the Factor Xa cleavage capture kit (Novagen), whereas MBP was retained by flowing the reaction mixture through an amylose column.CysK-His6, MccA-His6, and native CymR were purified as previously described (19Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CymR, CysK-His6, and MBP-CysK were subjected to a second step of purification by size exclusion chromatography on an Ultrogel AcA54 resin. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid composition of each protein.Gel Mobility Shift Assays—The ytlI promoter region (–86 to +22) was amplified using primers OS62 (5′-TGATTAGTCAAAGATCAGAGTATGC-3′) and OS63 (5′-ATCATCACTCATTTTTGTCACTCCTC-3′), and pDIA5575 as template (20Burguière P. Fert J. Guillouard I. Auger S. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The PCR product was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end-labeled primer OS63. Unincorporated oligonucleotides were removed using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Protein-DNA complexes were formed as previously described (19Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and analyzed on 20! acrylamide gels. When specified, OAS (Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture at various concentrations.In Vitro Pulldown Assays—His-tagged proteins were immobilized on the Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen). 50 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (50! (v/v) slurry) were incubated for 1 h with or without 60 μg of CysK-His6, MccA-His6, or His6-CysE in a binding buffer 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1! (w/v) of bovine serum albumin. The mixtures were then incubated in the presence or absence of 30 μg of purified CymR or CysK (obtained after cleavage of MBP). After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole.Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assays—The assays were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm PLP. To monitor proteinprotein interactions, monoclonal antibodies PentaHis (Qiagen) or anti-MBP mAb565 (26England P. Bregegere F. Bedouelle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were covalently coupled to a CM5 sensorchip, using a Biacore 2000 instrument and the Amine Coupling Kit (Biacore). Immobilization densities of ∼10,000 resonance units (RU; 1 RU = 1 pg·mm–2) were achieved. His6-CysE, CysE-His6, MccA-His6, MBP-CysK, or CysK-His6 were respectively captured at densities of 150, 1800, 2000, and 1500 RU. CymR (0.1–10.5 μm) was injected over immobilized CysK-His6 or MBP-CysK at a flow rate of 50 μl·min–1. For the OAS dissociation experiments, 800 or 250 RU of CymR were captured on immobilized CysK-His6 or MBP-CysK, respectively, followed by a 3-min injection of various concentrations of OAS or N-acetyl-serine from 0.05 to 1 mm.A 109-bp ytlI biotinylated promoter region was immobilized to the dextran-streptavidin matrix of a SA sensorchip, at a density of 340 RU. 1.75 μm of either CymR or CysK-His6, an equimolar CymR/CysK-His6 mixture or 18 μm of His6-CysE, were then injected at a flow rate of 5 μl·min–1. A streptavidin surface devoid of DNA was used as reference. Each assay was repeated with three independent preparations of each protein.The association and dissociation profiles were double-referenced using the Scrubber 2.0 software (BioLogic Software), i.e. both the signals from the reference surfaces and from blank experiments using running buffer instead of protein were subtracted. The steady-state surface plasmon resonance (SPR) responses (Req) were plotted against the CymR concentration (C) and fitted according to a model corresponding to two binding events to independent sites, Req=(Rmax1×C)/(Kd1+C)+(Rmax2×C)/(Kd2+C)(Eq. 1) where Kd 1 and Kd 2 are the equilibrium dissociation constants of the two successive binding events, and Rmax 1 and Rmax 2 are the corresponding maximal binding capacities. The CymR-CysK dissociation profiles were analyzed using the following double-exponential function of time, R=R1×e-koff1×t+(R0-R1)×e-koff2×t(Eq. 2) where R0 is the experimental SPR signal at the start of dissociation, and R1 is the fitted amplitude of the first dissociation phase.The association profiles were finally fitted with an equation describing a sequential CymR association process, R=(kon1×C×Rmax1/(kon1×C+koff1))×(1-e-(kon1×C+koff1)t)+((kon2×C)/(kon2×C+koff2))(kon1×C×Rmax1/(kon1×C+koff1))×(1-e-(kon1×C+koff1)t)×(1-e-(kon2×C+koff2)t)(Eq. 3) where kon 1 and kon 2 are the association rate constants of the two successive binding events, koff 1 and koff 2 are the dissociation rate constants (obtained from Equation 2), and Rmax 1 is the maximal binding capacity corresponding to the first binding phase (obtained from Equation 1).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments with CymR or CysK-His6 (3 μm or 16.5 μm) and the equimolar CymR/CysK-His6 mixture (3 or 16.5 μm each), were performed at 25 °C in a ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) equipped with both UV-visible and Rayleigh interference detection systems, using an An60Ti rotor and 12 mm double-sector aluminum centerpieces. The software Sednterp 1.09 was used to estimate the partial specific volumes of CymR (0.745 ml·g–1), CysK-His6 (0.744 ml·g–1), and their 1:1 complex (0.744 ml·g–1), as well as the viscosity (η = 0.903 cP) and density (ρ = 1.00587 g·ml–1) of the buffer used.For sedimentation velocity experiments, 300 μl of CymR or CysK-His6 (3 or 16.5 μm) were spun at 50,000 rpm, whereas the equimolar CymR/CysK-His6 mixture (3 or 16.5 μm each) was spun at 30,000 rpm. Absorbance (276 nm) and interference fringe displacement profiles were recorded every 2 min. Sedimentation coefficient continuous c(S) distributions and dimerization equilibrium dissociation constants were determined using the software Sedfit 11.3 (27Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar).For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, 150 μl of CymR (3 μm), CysK-His6 (3 μm), or the equimolar CymR/CysK-His6 mixture (3 μm each) were spun sequentially at 10,000 rpm for 30 h, 13,000 rpm for 11 h, 17,000 rpm for 11 h, 21,000 rpm for 11 h, and 50,000 rpm for 3 h (to measure the base-line value). The data were recorded for each speed after controlling that sedimentation/diffusion equilibrium had been effectively reached. For each sample, the radial distributions for the two most appropriate speeds were globally fitted with the Ultrascan 9.5 software (28Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom2005: 210-230Google Scholar) using a model corresponding to the number of species detected in the sedimentation velocity experiments. Monte Carlo analysis was performed on each fit to estimate the error on the measured values.Determination of CysK and CysE Activities—The OAS thiollyase activity of CysK was determined as previously described (19Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The serine acetyltransferase activity of CysE was assayed at 30 °C by monitoring the cleavage of the thioester bond of acetyl-CoA as previously described (29Denk D. Bock A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction rate was calculated using a differential extinction coefficient between acetyl-CoA and CoA of 3.2 mm·cm–1. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol CoA·min–1·(mg of protein)–1. All of the assays were performed in triplicate.Estimation of Intracellular Protein and Metabolite Concentrations—The intracellular concentrations of CymR, CysK, OAS, and cysteine in B. subtilis were determined in strain 168 in MQ-S in the presence of methionine or cystine. Crude extracts and various amounts of purified CymR or CysK were loaded on an SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, probed with polyclonal anti CymR or anti-CysK antibodies followed by an anti-HP rabbit antibody, and revealed using the ECL-Plus Kit (Amersham). The quantity of CymR or CysK contained in a given volume of the crude extract was estimated with the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) by comparison with known amounts of purified proteins. Crude extracts of strain BSIP1798 (ΔcymR) and BSIP1304 (ΔcysK) were used as negative controls. To determine metabolite concentrations, the cells were suspended in a sulfosalicylic acid buffer (3! final concentration) and disrupted by shaking for 40 s at power 5 in a FastPrep cell disruptor (FP120; Savant Instruments, Inc., Holbrook, NY). Supernatant samples obtained after centrifugation were analyzed as described (19Hullo M.F. Auger S. Soutourina O. Barzu O. Yvon M. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Intracellular protein and metabolite concentrations were estimated assuming a cell volume of 6.7 μl·(mg of total cell protein) (30Holtmann G. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1683-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or a B. subtilis intracellular volume of 5 μm3.RESULTSCysK Interacts with CymR to Form a Complex in Vitro—To investigate whether CymR could interact directly and specifically with CysK in the absence of DNA, we performed pulldown assays. CysK-His6 or MccA-His6 (used as a control as it shares 35! identity with CysK) were bound on a Ni-NTA-agarose resin, before adding native purified CymR at a 1:1 molar ratio. CymR was co-eluted only with CysK-His6 (Fig. 1, lane 2); no residual co-elution could be observed with MccA-His6 or in the absence of His-tagged partner (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). Thus, CymR was specifically retained on the Ni-NTA-agarose resin via its interaction with the CysK-His6 protein. This indicated that CymR and CysK formed a stable complex in vitro.To confirm the existence of a direct interaction between CysK and CymR, we performed real time SPR assays by flowing CymR, over surfaces on which CysK-His6, MccA-His6, or MBP-CysK had been tethered. On either the CysK-His6 (Fig. 2A) or the MBP-CysK (data not shown) surfaces, a CymR concentration dependence of the SPR signal was observed, whereas no signal could be detected on the MccA-His6 surface (data not shown).FIGURE 2Monitoring of the binding of CymR to CysK-His6 by surface plasmon resonance.

Nitro-oleic acid inhibits XOR activity in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.6 microM, limiting both purine oxidation and formation of superoxide (O2.). Enzyme inhibition by OA-NO2 is not reversed by thiol reagents, including glutathione, beta-mercaptoethanol, and dithiothreitol. Structure-function studies indicate that the carboxylic acid moiety, nitration at the 9 or 10 olefinic carbon, and unsaturation is required for XOR inhibition. Enzyme turnover and competitive reactivation studies reveal inhibition of electron transfer reactions at the molybdenum cofactor accounts for OA-NO2-induced inhibition. Importantly, OA-NO2 more potently inhibits cell-associated XOR-dependent O2. production than does allopurinol. Combined, these data establish a novel role for OA-NO2 in the inhibition of XOR-derived oxidant formation."
https://openalex.org/W2084687993,"Throughout human history, a disproportionate degree of political power around the world has been held by men. Even in democracies where the opportunity to serve in top political positions is available to any individual elected by the majority of their constituents, most of the highest political offices are occupied by male leaders. What psychological factors underlie this political gender gap? Contrary to the notion that people use deliberate, rational strategies when deciding whom to vote for in major political elections, research indicates that people use shallow decision heuristics, such as impressions of competence solely from a candidate's facial appearance, when deciding whom to vote for. Because gender has previously been shown to affect a number of inferences made from the face, here we investigated the hypothesis that gender of both voter and candidate affects the kinds of facial impressions that predict voting behavior.Male and female voters judged a series of male and female political candidates on how competent, dominant, attractive and approachable they seemed based on their facial appearance. Then they saw a series of pairs of political candidates and decided which politician they would vote for in a hypothetical election for President of the United States. Results indicate that both gender of voter and candidate affect the kinds of facial impressions that predict voting behavior. All voters are likely to vote for candidates who appear more competent. However, male candidates that appear more approachable and female candidates who appear more attractive are more likely to win votes. In particular, men are more likely to vote for attractive female candidates whereas women are more likely to vote for approachable male candidates.Here we reveal gender biases in the intuitive heuristics that voters use when deciding whom to vote for in major political elections. Our findings underscore the impact of gender and physical appearance on shaping voter decision-making and provide novel insight into the psychological foundations underlying the political gender gap."
https://openalex.org/W1972516189,"Background When preparing for fertilization, oocytes undergo meiotic maturation during which structural changes occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that lead to a more efficient calcium response. During meiotic maturation and subsequent fertilization, the actin cytoskeleton also undergoes dramatic restructuring. We have recently observed that rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton induced by actin-depolymerizing agents, or by actin-binding proteins, strongly modulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signals during the maturation process. However, the significance of the dynamic changes in F-actin within the fertilized egg has been largely unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We have measured changes in intracellular Ca2+ signals and F-actin structures during fertilization. We also report the unexpected observation that the conventional antagonist of the InsP3 receptor, heparin, hyperpolymerizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton in postmeiotic eggs. Using heparin and other pharmacological agents that either hypo- or hyperpolymerize the cortical actin, we demonstrate that nearly all aspects of the fertilization process are profoundly affected by the dynamic restructuring of the egg cortical actin cytoskeleton. Conclusions/Significance Our findings identify important roles for subplasmalemmal actin fibers in the process of sperm-egg interaction and in the subsequent events related to fertilization: the generation of Ca2+ signals, sperm penetration, cortical granule exocytosis, and the block to polyspermy."
https://openalex.org/W2055607956,"Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a multidomain enzyme that plays a central role in autophagic and apoptotic signaling, although the protein-protein interactions regulating DAPK functions are not well defined. Peptide aptamer libraries were used to identify the tumor suppressor protein tuberin (TSC2) as a novel DAPK death domain-binding protein, and we evaluated whether DAPK is a positive or negative effector of the TSC2-regulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Binding studies using death domain miniproteins in vitro and deletion analysis in vivo determined that the death domain of DAPK is the major site for the interaction with TSC2.

DAPK is composed of several functional domains, including a kinase domain, a CaM binding domain, eight ankyrin repeats, and a death domain (1Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). DAPK was originally identified as a factor that regulates apoptosis in response to various death inducing signals, including interferon-γ, TNF-α, and transforming growth factor-β (1Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Beressi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which DAPK activates apoptosis include an oncogene-activated p53-dependent pathway (1Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), inactivation of integrin and adhesion-mediated survival signaling (3Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Yao C.C. Chen R.H. J.

Overexpression of the death domain module by itself protects cells from death-inducing signals, demonstrating the importance of this domain for DAPK proapoptotic function (6Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The death domain of DAPK regulates its proapoptotic function in part by interacting with netrin-1 receptor UNC5H2 (7Llambi F. Calheiros-Lourenco F. Gozuacik D. Guix C. Pays L. Rio G. Kimchi A. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1192-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK (8Chen C-H. Wang W-J. Kuo J-C. Tsai H-C. Lin J-R. Chang Z-F. Chen R-H.

Simon R.P. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of DAPK at Ser-308 interferes with CaM binding and inhibits DAPK catalytic activity (10Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A.

UNC5H2 binding to the death domain of DAPK promotes its proapoptotic activity by reducing DAPK autophosphorylation on Ser-308 and increasing its catalytic activity (7Llambi F. Calheiros-Lourenco F. Gozuacik D. Guix C. Pays L. Rio G. Kimchi A. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1192-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of DAPK by ERK at Ser-735 also enhances its kinase activity- and death-promoting effects (8Chen C-H. Wang W-J. Kuo J-C. Tsai H-C. Lin J-R. Chang Z-F. Chen R-H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In accordance with its proapoptotic activity, recent evidence suggests that DAPK functions as a tumor suppressor. DAPK can suppress transformation in vitro (11Raveh T. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. DePinho R.A. Kimchi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and block tumor metastasis in vivo (12Inbal B. Cohen O. Polak-Charcon S. Kopolovic J. Vadai E. Eisenbach L. Kimchi A. Nature. 1997; 390: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); furthermore, in human cancers, DAPK expression is frequently lost due to promoter hypermethylation, and the attenuation of DAPK gene expression correlates with chronic lymphocytic leukemia development (13Raval A. Tanner S.M. Byrd J.C. Angerman E.B. Perko J.D. Chen S.S. Hackanson B. Grever M.R. Lucas D.M. Matkovic J.J. Lin T.S. Kipps T.J. Murray F. Weisenburger D. Sanger W. Lynch J. Watson P. Jansen M.

DAPK also plays a role in survival pathways, reflected in its autophagy-signaling activity (14Inbal I. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and its ability to counter TNF-mediated apoptosis (15Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DAPK can lead to the appearance of autophagic vesicles, and knockdown of DAPK by antisense RNA has demonstrated that DAPK is necessary for autophagy induced by interferon-γ (14Inbal I. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the regulation of autophagy overlaps with that of apoptosis (16Chiara Maiuri M. Zalckvar E. Kimchi A. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar), and it was recently demonstrated by genetic studies that in Caenorhabditis elegans, starvation-induced autophagy is regulated in part through a DAPK signaling pathway and that DAPK levels are critical to drive such cell fate decisions, leading to survival or death (17Kang C. You Y-J. Avery L. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). At present, little is known about how DAPK exerts its effects on cell survival, autophagy, and apoptosis at the molecular level. We had previously set up a peptide-aptamer screen to identify novel proteins that bind to the DAPK core kinase domain to define novel steps in DAPK function. A protein-protein interaction was defined between MAP1B and DAPK that can modify the extent of autophagy, thus linking DAPK function to microtubule signaling pathways during the autophagic process (18Harrison B. Kraus M. Burch L. Stevens C. Craig A Gordon-Weeks P. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9999-10014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this report, a peptide-aptamer interaction screen was set up for the DAPK death domain, where we identify TSC2 as a novel DAPK-interacting protein. The TSC complex, formed by two proteins (TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin)), is a major regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway (19Tee A. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). TSC2 contains a GTPase-activating protein domain that converts the small GTPase Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) to its inactive GDP-bound form (20Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). mTORC1 activity is stimulated by the active GTP-bound form of Rheb; thus, the TSC complex acts to inhibit mTORC1 function (20Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). mTORC1 directly regulates cell growth by controlling the phosphorylation of a number of components of the translational machinery. In particular, phosphorylation and activation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 are stimulated by serum, insulin, and growth factors in an mTORC1-dependent manner (21Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The pathway that regulates autophagy also acts through mTORC1. mTORC1 is sensitive to the lipophilic macrolide antibiotic rapamycin; thus, rapamycin and its analogue CCI-779 form a complex with FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12), which then bind to and inactivate mTORC1, leading to an up-regulation of autophagy (22Rubinstein D.C. Gestwicki J.E. Murphy L.O. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). We report that DAPK is a positive upstream regulator of mTORC1 that mediates its effects in part by binding to and regulating the phosphorylation of TSC2 in response to growth factor signaling. The novel linking of the DAPK and mTORC1 signaling pathways has implications for how DAPK exerts its effects on cell survival, autophagy, and apoptosis in a manner that may depend on regulation of DAPK signaling thresholds (17Kang C. You Y-J. Avery L. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The C terminus of DAPK (amino acids 1313–1431) was cloned into the Gateway system vector pDONR221 (Invitrogen) using the following primers: Fwd (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGAAACTGAGTCGCCTGCTGGACCCG-3′) and Rev (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTGTCACCGGGATACAACAGAGCTAAT-3′). For expression of glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, pDONR221-DAPK vectors were recombined with the pDEST15 vector (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer. HA-tagged DAPK-WT, ΔCAM, and K42A vectors were a gift of Adi Kimchi (Weizmann Institute). For the generation of HA-tagged DAPK deletion mutants, stop codons were introduced, as described previously (29Lin Y. Stevens C. Hupp T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16792-16802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged TSC2 was a gift from Andrew Tee (University of Cardiff). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoblotting—HeLa, A375, A549, HEK293, and primary DAPK+/+ and DAPK+/- MEFs (Dr. Owen Sansom, Beatson Institute, Glasgow) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a5%CO2/H2O-saturated atmosphere. Cells for transient transfection were plated out 24 h before transfection at ∼1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish or 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. For Lipofectamine 2000 transfection (Invitrogen), 2 μl of Lipofectamine was used for every 1 μg of DNA transfected. Cells were harvested after a further incubation of 16–18 h. Cells were lysed in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The protein content of cell extracts was measured using Bio-Rad reagent. Typically, 20–30 μg of cell extract was used for immunoblot. Samples were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis, typically 4–12% precast gels (Novex), and electrotransferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked in PBS, 10% nonfat milk for 30 min, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in PBS, 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20. After washing (3 × 10 min) in PBS/Tween 20, the blot was incubated with secondary antibody, either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Dako; 1:5000), for 1 h at room temperature in PBS, 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20. After washing (3 × 10 min) in PBS/Tween 20, proteins were visualized by incubation with ECL reagent (Sigma). Equal protein loading was confirmed with Ponceau S staining. FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. HA-11 antibody (Ascites) was purchased from Covance. Tuberin/TSC2 (C-20) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). DAPK antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (clone 55). Phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389, 1A5), p70 S6 kinase, phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235/236, 2F9), S6 ribosomal protein (54D2), phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204), p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phospho-AKT (Thr-308), AKT, Hamartin/TSC1 (1B2), and phospho-MLC (S19) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Phospho-Ser/Thr antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. β-Actin antibody was from Sigma. Immunoblots were quantified using Scion Image (National Institutes of Health). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) bound to DAPK or TSC2 antibody were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation, together with 500 μl of cell extract (∼1 mg) prepared in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). The bead pellets were then washed five times in extraction buffer before elution with 3× SDS loading buffer. Eluted proteins were then analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. For immunoprecipitation of exogenous HA-DAPK from cells, HA-11 antibody bound to 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads was incubated with cell extract (∼1 mg) overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. For immunoprecipitation of exogenous TSC2, 30 μl of FLAG-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma) were incubated with cell extract (∼1 mg) overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. For precipitation of endogenous DAPK using TSC-derived peptides, cell extract (∼1 mg diluted to a volume of 500 μl in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture)) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation, together with peptides coupled to streptavadin beads. The bead pellets were then washed five times in extraction buffer before being resuspended in 3× SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. DAPK Kinase Assays—For phosphorylation of TSC2 in vitro, HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-TSC2, and protein was immunoprecipitated by FLAG-conjugated Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with extraction buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated TSC2 on beads was then subjected to a kinase assay using purified DAPK kinase domain (1 μg) in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3× SDS LB and resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot or visualized using a STORM 840 scanner and software (Amersham Biosciences). For DAPK activity, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-DAPK-WT or K42A, serum-starved for 16 h, and then restimulated with serum for 30 min, and DAPK proteins were immunoprecipitated by HA-11 antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with extraction buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated DAPK on beads was then incubated with purified bacteria-derived MLC protein (1 μg) in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3× SDS LB and resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblot. MLC protein was visualized by Ponceau staining. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA)—For the knockdown of DAPK gene expression, cells were transfected with DAPK siRNA (Dharmacon, siGENOME SMARTpool DAPK1 human) or a nonspecific siRNA as control (Dharmacon, siGENOME nontargeting pool). After 48 h, cells were lysed in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Samples were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Peptide Library Selection—15 μg of glutathione S-transferase-tagged DAPK death domain protein in 150 μl of coating buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.6) was added to a well of a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the coating solution was removed, and the well was blocked with blocking buffer (5 mg/ml BSA in NaHCO3, pH 8.6) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by six washes with 200 μl of TBST (TBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). 10 μl of peptide aptamer library (New England Biolabs) (4 × 1010 phage-peptide fusions) was diluted in 100 μl of TBST, added to the well, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Nonbinding peptides were removed, and the well was washed six times with TBST. Binding peptides were then eluted with 100 μl of 0.2 m glycine·HCl, pH 2.2, containing 1 mg/ml BSA by incubating at room temperature for 10 min, and the eluate was neutralized with 15 μl of 1 m Tris·HCl, pH 9.1. A small amount of this eluate was titered, and the remainder was amplified. The peptides were amplified by infection of ER2738 E. coli cells for 4.5 h, precipitated with PEG (20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 2.5 m NaCl), and resuspended in 200 μl of TBS. This biopanning procedure was repeated a further three times using the amplified peptides, and a small amount of eluate from each round was titered. From the phage titers carried out for each round of biopanning, individual plaques were isolated and amplified by infection of ER2738 E. coli cells for 4.5 h. Amplified peptides were then precipitated with PEG and resuspended in 100 μl of iodine buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 4 m NaI), and their DNA from phage was precipitated with 250 μl of ethanol. After thorough washing, the DNA was amplified and prepared for sequencing using the Big Dye terminator (Amersham Biosciences) kit. The corresponding amino acid sequences of the peptides were identified using BLAST and EMOTIF. Protein-Protein Interactions Using ELISA—For the DAPK-TSC2 peptide ELISA, a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Inc.) was coated with appropriate amounts of purified DAPK death domain protein diluted in 0.1 m Na2HCO3, pH 8.0, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed six times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation in PBS-T supplemented with 3% BSA. The wells were washed six times with PBS-T prior to incubation with 5 μg/ml Biotin-labeled peptides (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) diluted in PBS-T, 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation, the plate was washed again six times with PBS-T and incubated with streptavidin peroxidase horseradish peroxidase conjugate (S5512; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by further washing and ECL. The results were quantified using Fluoroskan Ascent FL equipment (Labsystems) and analyzed with Ascent Software version 2.4.1 (Labsystems). For DAPK-ERK ELISA, a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Inc.) was coated with purified DAPK death domain protein diluted in 0.1 m Na2HCO3, pH 8.0, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed six times with PBS-T, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation in PBS-T supplemented with 3% BSA. The wells were washed six times with PBS-T prior to incubation with appropriate amounts of purified ERK protein (Upstate Biotechnology) diluted in PBS-T, 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation, the plate was washed again six times with PBS-T and incubated with antibody specific to ERK for 1 h at room temperature. Following a further six washes with PBS-T, wells were incubated with secondary rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies, followed by further washing and ECL. The results were quantified using Fluoroskan Ascent FL equipment (Labsystems) and analyzed with Ascent Software version 2.4.1 (Labsystems). Gel Filtration—For gel filtration, a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (Tricon) high performance column was equilibrated with buffer (PBS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine prefiltrated with a Millipore filter (0.22 μm)). HeLa cell extract (5 mg) was prepared in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, and 5% glycerol. Lysates were injected and eluted into fractions of 1 ml each. The protein eluted into each fraction was then concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation before being resuspended in 3× SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The equipment employed in the gel filtration was AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) and fraction collector FRAC-950 (Amersham Biosciences). The software used was UNICORN version 4.10 (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular weight markers were obtained from Sigma. RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR—mRNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit following the manufacturer’s suggested procedures. The optional step of DNase treatment using the Qiagen RNase-free DNase set was also included. 1 μl of the sample RNA was diluted in 100 μl of water and loaded into a 96-well UV plate. The absorbance was detected by the Bio-Tek plate reader at 260 nm. After the extraction, the real time PCRs were performed in the Opticon 4 machine using the Qiagen Quanti-Tect SYBR Green one-step PCR kit. Equal amounts of mRNA were loaded in each reaction. The actin primers used were as follows: L, 5′-CTACGTCGCCCTGGACTTCGAGC-3′; R, 5′-GATGGAGCCGCCGATCCACACGG-3′. The DAPK primers were as follows: L, 5′-CGAGGTGATGGTGTATGGTG-3′; R, 5′-CTGTGCTTTGCTGGTGGA-3′. TSC2 Is a DAPK-binding Protein—Dynamic regulation of protein-protein interactions in signal transduction processes is driven in part through linear interaction motifs or docking motifs interacting in synergy (23Neduva V. Russell R.B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2006; 17: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As such, approaches identifying bioreactive linear peptide binding motifs will assist in expanding the ”interactome“ of a target signaling protein. A common germ line mutation in the DAPK death domain (N1347S) disrupts its structure and oligomerization (24Stevens C. Lin Y. Sanchez M. Amin E. Copson E. White H. Durston V. Eccles D.M. Hupp T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13791-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); thus, the death domain module encoded by the N1347 wild-type allele was cloned, purified, and expressed in a bacterial expression system for presentation to a 12-mer peptide combinatorial library. Peptides acquired after four rounds of selection had significant homology to the homeodomain-containing transcription factor LBX1 and the transcription co-factor VGL-3 (Fig. 1A) that are involved in myogenic differentiation. In addition, a high affinity peptide that was repeatedly acquired showed no homology with known proteins in the data base (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, two peptides acquired showed significant homology with the TSC2 tumor suppressor protein (Fig. 1A). Using an ELISA-based assay, DAPK death domain protein binding to synthetic peptides was analyzed. A titration of increasing amounts of peptide-φ1 or the corresponding peptide derived from human TSC2 with a fixed amount of death domain miniprotein bound in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B); therefore, we determined whether DAPK and TSC2 can form a protein complex in vivo. First, gel filtration of HeLa (cervical cancer cell) extracts revealed that DAPK and TSC2 co-elute in a large molecular weight complex (Fig. 1C). Further, endogenous TSC2 and DAPK can form stable protein complexes in lysates from HeLa cells, since the immunoprecipitation of TSC2 enriched DAPK protein (Fig. 1D), and conversely the immunoprecipitation of DAPK pulled out TSC2 protein (Fig. 1E). Together, these data indicate that TSC2 and DAPK can form a stable protein complex in cells. TSC2 Binds to the Death Domain of DAPK—We next evaluated whether the death domain of DAPK was required for TSC2 complex formation. The transfection into cells of a DAPK deletion series (Fig. 2A) along with TSC2 demonstrated that deletion of the death domain attenuated the binding of TSC2 protein (Fig. 2B). These data are consistent with the binding of the minimal TSC2 peptide to the death domain miniprotein (Fig. 1B) and indicate that the death domain of DAPK contains the major determinant for the binding of TSC2 in vivo. Furthermore, the phage peptide-φ1 and the peptide derived from the sequence of human TSC2 (amino acids 578–589) were able to pullout DAPK protein from HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 2C), indicating that the central region of TSC2, which is largely undefined functionally, is involved in mediating the interaction with DAPK. DAPK Regulates Phosphorylation of TSC2—Having identified a physical interaction between DAPK and TSC2, we next wanted to determine whether DAPK could directly phosphorylate TSC2 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A, recombinant DAPK kinase domain miniprotein could phosphorylate TSC2 in an immunocomplex kinase assay. No phosphorylation was observed without the addition of purified DAPK kinase domain (Fig. 3A). TSC2 can thus be a direct substrate of DAPK in vitro. Serum-induced activation of DAPK catalytic activity has been demonstrated previously (4Kuo J-C. Lin J-R. Staddon J.M. Hosoya H. Chen R.H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4777-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Chen C-H. Wang W-J. Kuo J-C. Tsai H-C. Lin J-R. Chang Z-F. Chen R-H.

HEK293 cells expressing HA-DAPK-WT or kinase-dead K42A mutant were serum-starved and then restimulated with serum, and DAPK catalytic activity was assessed by its ability to phosphorylate recombinant MLC (myosin light chain 2), which is a confirmed substrate of DAPK (4Kuo J-C.

https://openalex.org/W1975565970,"Understanding mechanisms responsible for changes in tooth morphology in the course of evolution is an area of investigation common to both paleontology and developmental biology. Detailed analyses of molar tooth crown shape have shown frequent homoplasia in mammalian evolution, which requires accurate investigation of the evolutionary pathways provided by the fossil record. The necessity of preservation of an effective occlusion has been hypothesized to functionally constrain crown morphological changes and to also facilitate convergent evolution. The Muroidea superfamily constitutes a relevant model for the study of molar crown diversification because it encompasses one third of the extant mammalian biodiversity.Combined microwear and 3D-topographic analyses performed on fossil and extant muroid molars allow for a first quantification of the relationships between changes in crown morphology and functionality of occlusion. Based on an abundant fossil record and on a well resolved phylogeny, our results show that the most derived functional condition associates longitudinal chewing and non interlocking of cusps. This condition has been reached at least 7 times within muroids via two main types of evolutionary pathways each respecting functional continuity. In the first type, the flattening of tooth crown which induces the removal of cusp interlocking occurs before the rotation of the chewing movement. In the second type however, flattening is subsequent to rotation of the chewing movement which can be associated with certain changes in cusp morphology.The reverse orders of the changes involved in these different pathways reveal a mosaic evolution of mammalian dentition in which direction of chewing and crown shape seem to be partly decoupled. Either can change in respect to strong functional constraints affecting occlusion which thereby limit the number of the possible pathways. Because convergent pathways imply distinct ontogenetic trajectories, new Evo/Devo comparative studies on cusp morphogenesis are necessary."

These enzymes catalyze the stepwise formation of the peptide moiety of the peptidoglycan disaccharide peptide monomer unit.

Phosphorylation of proteins by Ser/Thr protein kinases has recently emerged as a major physiological mechanism of regulation in prokaryotes.

We showed that MurC was phosphorylated in vitro by the PknA protein kinase. An analysis of the phosphoamino acid content indicated that phosphorylation exclusively occurred on threonine residues. Six phosphoacceptor residues were identified by mass spectrometry analysis, and we confirmed that mutagenesis to alanine residues totally abolished PknA-dependent phosphorylation of MurC. In vitro and in vivo ligase activity assays showed that the catalytic activity of MurC was impaired following mutation of these threonine residues. Further in vitro assays revealed that the activity of the MurC-phosphorylated isoform was severely decreased compared with the non-phosphorylated protein. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a MurC ligase phosphorylation in vitro.

Due to the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant strains and the emergence of new pathogenic microorganisms, one of the biggest challenges for modern biomedical research is the continuous development of new antimicrobial drugs targeting bacterial essential mechanisms such as cell division or peptidoglycan (PG) 4The abbreviations used are: PGpeptidoglycanMurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidSTPKSer/Thr protein kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSLCliquid chromatographyESIelectrospray ionizationTEVtobacco etch virus biosynthesis (1Vicente M.

The bacterial cell wall PG is a giant molecule that sustains the shape of the bacterial cell and contains the outward forces generated in maintaining an osmotic pressure gradient against the environment. Without this PG layer the cell integrity would be ruptured, and this could lead to cell death. Therefore the PG biosynthesis machinery represents a promising source of putative targets for antibacterial chemotherapy (2Barbosa M.D. Ross H.O. Hillman M.C. Meade R.P. Kurilla M.G. Pompliano D.L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Barreteau H. Kovac A. Boniface A. Sova M. Gobec S. Blanot D. FEMS Microbiol.

Press A. Escherichia Coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 1025-1034Google Scholar). The first stage involves the assembly of the disaccharide peptide monomer unit by enzymes located in the cytoplasm or at the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (3Barreteau H. Kovac A. Boniface A. Sova M. Gobec S. Blanot D. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 168-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 5van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The peptide moiety of the monomer unit is assembled stepwise by the successive additions of l-alanine, d-glutamic acid, meso-diaminopimelic acid or l-lysine, and d-alanyl-d-alanine to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc). These steps are catalyzed by specific peptide synthetases (ligases), which are designated as MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF, respectively, all participating in non-ribosomal peptide bond formation with the concomitant hydrolysis of ATP. The MurNAc-pentapeptide motif of the resulting nucleotide precursor is then transferred by the MraY translocase onto the undecaprenyl phosphate carrier molecule, generating the lipid intermediate I. The subsequent addition of the N-acetylglucosamine motif of UDP-GlcNAc onto lipid I generates lipid II in a reaction catalyzed by MurG (6Mengin-Lecreulx D. Texier L. Rousseau M. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4625-4636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second stage of the PG biosynthesis consists in the polymerization by transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions of the disaccharide pentapeptide monomers, a reaction taking place in the periplasmic space and that is catalyzed by the penicillin-binding proteins. The PG biosynthesis pathway enzymes, which are essential and specific for bacteria, represent important potential targets for screening novel antibacterial compounds. Due to the growing emergence of bacterial multiresistance to currently used antibiotics, the discovery of new therapeutic compounds has indeed become a necessity. In recent years, an extensive search for specific inhibitors interfering with the cytoplasmic steps of this pathway, and in particular with the four steps catalyzed by the Mur ligases, has been developed (2Barbosa M.D. Ross H.O.

The UDP-Mur-NAc:l-alanine ligase (MurC), encoded by the murC gene, represents such an interesting candidate for drug development (9Ehmann D.E. Demeritt J.E. Hull K.G. Fisher S.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, different phosphinic acid derivatives and substrate analogues have been identified as Mur ligase inhibitors (11Strancar K. Blanot D. Gobec S. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Corynebacterium glutamicum is a rod-shaped non-pathogenic Gram-positive actinomycete widely used in the industrial production of amino acids such as l-lysine and l-glutamic acid (13Hermann T. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). C. glutamicum has been extensively studied as a model microorganism due to the strategies employed by this actinomycete to achieve a rod-shaped morphology. In fact, the mechanisms taking place in C. glutamicum happened to be completely different from that of Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis (14Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 15Letek M. Ordonez E. Vaquera J. Margolin W. Flardh K. Mateos L.M. Gil J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3283-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas the number of genes involved in cell division and PG biosynthesis in C. glutamicum is lower (16Letek M. Fiuza M. Ordonez E. Villadangos A.F. Ramos A. Mateos L.M. Gil J.A. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an earlier work on the phosphoproteome of C. glutamicum (17Bendt A.K. Burkovski A. Schaffer S. Bott M. Farwick M. Hermann T. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) identified MurC has being phosphorylated in vivo, suggesting that protein phosphorylation plays a much broader function in C. glutamicum than was previously expected. Recently, we described the characterization of the four STPKs from C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 and highlighted their role in cell division (18Fiuza M. Canova M.J. Zanella-Cleon I. Becchi M. Cozzone A.J. Mateos L.M. Kremer L. Gil J.A. Molle V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18099-18112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, Thakur and Chakraborti (19Thakur M. Chakraborti P.K. Biochem. J. 2008; 415: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed that MurD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was phosphorylated by the Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) PknA, although no further characterization of the role of the phosphorylation on the MurD enzyme activity was investigated. Therefore, it was tempting to speculate that MurC in C. glutamicum could also be regulated by STPK phosphorylation. The focus of this work is to study the regulation of MurC in C. glutamicum via phosphorylation. As a first step in deciphering the potential role/participation of the corynebacterial STPKs in the regulation of MurC activity, we confirmed its specific phosphorylation by the PknA kinase through a combination of in vitro phosphorylation assays and mass spectrometric identification of the different MurC phosphorylation sites. Moreover, we demonstrated that the murein ligase activity of MurC was negatively regulated upon its phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first evidence of a Mur enzyme regulated by phosphorylation. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids are described in Table 1. Strains used for cloning and expression of recombinant proteins were E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) and E. coli BL21(DE3)Star (Stratagene), respectively. E. coli cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 50 μg/ml kanamycin, when required. The murC temperature-sensitive E. coli strain H1119 was grown at 30 °C in 2YT (1.6% Bactotrypton, 1.0% Bactoyeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.0) medium and was used for genetic complementation experiments with plasmids carrying wild-type or mutated copies of the murC gene. C. glutamicum cells were grown at 30 °C in TSB (Trypticase soy broth, Oxoid) or TSA (TSB containing 2% agar) medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml kanamycin. Plasmids to be transferred by conjugation from E. coli to corynebacteria were introduced by transformation into the donor strain E. coli S17-1. Mobilization of plasmids from E. coli S17-1 to C. glutamicum R31 was accomplished as described previously (20Mateos L.M. Schafer A. Kalinowski J. Martin J.F. Puhler A. J.

Therefore, the murC gene was amplified by PCR using C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 genomic DNA as a template and the primers pair murC1/murC2 (Table 2), containing NdeI and NheI restriction sites, respectively. The 1461-bp amplified product was digested by NdeI and NheI and ligated to the pETTev vector (Table 1) generating the pTEVmurC plasmid. E. coli BL21(DE3)Star cells transformed with this construction were used for expression and purification of His6-tagged MurC, as previously described (21Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J.

Finally, the purified His6-tagged MurC was treated with TEV protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Secondly, overexpression and purification of MurC from C. glutamicum cultures was performed using standard PCR strategies. The murC gene from C. glutamicum was amplified using the primers pair murC1/murHisNdeI2 (Table 2). The PCR product carrying a His tag at its C-terminal end was digested with NdeI and subsequently cloned under the control of the Pdiv promoter into plasmid pEDiv (Table 1). The resulting expression vector, named pEDivmurHis, was introduced by conjugation into C. glutamicum R31.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro phosphorylation was performed with 2 μg of MurC in 20 μl of buffer P (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) with 200 μCi/ml [γ-33P]ATP corresponding to 65 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 3000 Ci/mmol), and 0.5 μg of kinase. Plasmids pGEXA, pGEXB, pGEXL, and pTEVGfull (Table 1) were used for the expression and purification in E. coli of the four recombinant STPKs from C. glutamicum as previously described (18Fiuza M. Canova M.J. Zanella-Cleon I. Becchi M. Cozzone A.J. Mateos L.M. Kremer L. Gil J.A. Molle V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18099-18112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After 15-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and heating the mixture at 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 90 °C, stained with Coomassie Blue, and dried. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using direct exposure films. Analysis of the Phosphoamino Acid Content of Proteins—MurC sample (5 μg) phosphorylated in vitro by the GST-tagged PknA, and unreacted [γ-33P]ATP were separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The 33P-labeled protein bands were detected by autoradiography and excised from the Immobilon blot and hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The acid-stable phosphoamino acids released were separated by electrophoresis in the first dimension at pH 1.9 (800 V/h) in 7.8% acetic acid, 2.5% formic acid, followed by ascending chromatography in the second dimension in 2-methyl-1-propanol/formic acid/water (8:3:4, v/v). After migration, radioactive compounds were detected by autoradiography. Authentic phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were run in parallel and visualized by staining with ninhydrin. Cloning and Purification of PknA Mutant Proteins—Site-directed mutagenesis was directly performed on the pGEXA expression plasmid (Table 1) using inverse-PCR amplification with the following self-complementary primers (Table 2): N-pknAT179A/C-pknAT179A, N-pknAT181A/C-pknAT181A, N-pknAT179A-T181A/C-pknAT179A-T181A, and N-pknAK49M/C-pknAK49M to generate pGEXpknAT179A, pGEXpknAT181A, pGEXpknAT179A/T181A, and pGEXpknAK49M, respectively (Table 1). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The different GST-tagged recombinant fusion proteins were overexpressed and purified as reported earlier (18Fiuza M. Canova M.J. Zanella-Cleon I. Becchi M. Cozzone A.J. Mateos L.M. Kremer L. Gil J.A. Molle V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18099-18112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The six threonine residues from C. glutamicum MurC identified by mass spectrometry after in vitro phosphorylation with GST-tagged PknA were replaced by alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis using inverse-PCR amplification. A first PCR was carried out using pTEVmurC (Table 1) as a template with the primers pair N-murC362 and C-murC362 (Table 2) to generate pTEVmurC1T (T362A). A second PCR was carried out using pTEVmurC (Table 1) as a template with the primers pair N-murC362/365 and C-murC362/365 (Table 2) to generate pTEVmurC2T (T362A/T365A). This mutant and the subsequent additional mutants were used as templates in subsequent PCR reactions using the following primers pairs: N-murC51 and C-murC51, N-murC120 and C-murC120, N-murC167 and C-murC167, and N-murC133 and C-murC133 (see Table 2) to generate pTEVmurC3T (T362A/T365A/T51A), pTEVmurC4T (T362A/T365A/T51A/T120A), pTEVmurC5T (T362A/T365A/T51A/T120A/T167A), and pTEVmurC6T (T362A/T365A/T51A/T120A/T167A/T133A), respectively. Individual mutants were generated using pTEVmurC (Table 1) as a template with the primers pairs N-murC51/C-murC51, N-murC120/C-murC120, N-murC133/C-murC133, N-murC167/C-mur-C167, N-murC362/C-murC362, and N-murC365/C-murC365 (Table 2) to generate pTEVmurCT51A, pTEVmurCT120A, pTEVmurCT133A, pTEVmurCT167A, pTEVmurCT362A, and pTEVmurC T365A, respectively (Table 1). All the resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The different His6-tagged mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified, as described above. MS Analysis—Purified wild-type and mutant MurC proteins were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by GST-tagged PknA as described above, excepted that [γ-33P]ATP was replaced with 5 mm ATP. Subsequent analyses using NanoLC/nanospray/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) were performed as previously described (18Fiuza M. Canova M.J. Zanella-Cleon I. Becchi M. Cozzone A.J. Mateos L.M. Kremer L. Gil J.A. Molle V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18099-18112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Corynebacterial MurC purified either from E. coli or C. glutamicum was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride, and detected using either monoclonal mouse anti-phospho-threonine, -serine, -tyrosine, or polyclonal rabbit anti-His antibodies used at 1:100 and 1:10,000 dilution, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution. Complementation with C. glutamicum MurC—Plasmids pTEVmurC, pTEVmurC1T, pTEVmurC2T, pTEVmurC3T, pTEVmurC4T, pTEVmurC5T, and pTEVmurC6T were used as templates for PCR amplification of the murC gene with the primers pair murH1119-1/murH1119-2 (Table 2) containing a BspHI and BglII restriction site, respectively. The resulting 1461-bp products, carrying the wild-type and mutated gene copies, respectively, were digested with BspHI and BglII, and cloned into the plasmid vector pTrc99A (22Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) between the compatible NcoI and BamHI sites, generating pTrcmurC, pTrcmurC1T, pTrcmurC2T, pTrcmurC3T, pTrcmurC4T, pTrcmurC5T, and pTrcmurC6T, respectively. These plasmids allowing high level expression of the C. glutamicum MurC and MurC mutants under the control of the strong isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible trc promoter, were transformed in the E. coli MurC temperature-sensitive mutant strain H1119 (23Lugtenberg E.J. v Schijndel-van Dam A. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 35-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were grown at the permissive temperature (30 °C) before being shifted to the restrictive temperature (42 °C). Complementation was judged by the ability of the mutant to grow at the restrictive temperature. UDP-MurNAc l-alanine Ligase Assay—The l-alanine-adding activity of wild-type and mutant MurC proteins was assayed according to Liger et al. (24Liger D. Masson A. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) by following the formation of UDP-MurNAc-l-[14C]alanine in 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.5 mm l-[14C]alanine (0.6 KBq, 5.5 Gbq/mmol, Amersham), 1 mm UDP-MurNAc, 5 mm ATP, and enzyme (25 μl of an appropriate dilution in buffer A: 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10% glycerol). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the reaction was stopped by addition of 8 μl of acetic acid, followed by lyophilization. To test the effect of the phosphorylation of MurC on its enzyme activity, the assay was performed as described above excepted that the MurC enzyme (20 μg/ml) was preincubated overnight at 37 °C with or without wild-type PknA (16 μg/ml), or with PknA_K49M mutant (30 μg/ml) in buffer A supplemented with 2 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. The radioactive product UDP-MurNAc-l-[14C]alanine and substrate l-[14C]alanine were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil 5C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Alltech France) using 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.9, as the eluent, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Detection was performed with a radioactive flow detector (model LB506-C1, Berthold France, La Garenne-Colombes, France) using the Quicksafe Flow 2 scintillator (Zinsser Analytic, Maidenhead, UK) at 0.6 ml/min. Quantitation was carried out with the Radiostar software (Berthold). MurC Is a Substrate of the C. glutamicum PknA—The peptide moiety of the PG monomer unit is assembled stepwise in the cytoplasm by the successive actions of four Mur ligases designated as MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF. These enzymes share limited sequence identity but have several highly conserved regions that map primarily to the active site. Each of them comprises three structural domains: an N-terminal domain with a Rossmann-type fold primarily responsible for binding of the UDP-MurNAc(-peptide) substrate, a large central ATP-binding (ATPase) domain, and a C-terminal domain associated with binding of the amino acid substrate (25Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11556-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on protein sequence alignments and on the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli MurC protein (26Deva T. Baker E.N. Squire C.J. Smith C.A. Acta Crystallogr D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1466-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), these three domains in the C. glutamicum MurC may extend between Met1-Gly118, Ser119-Arg334, and Arg335-Asn486, respectively (Figs. 1 and 4). By comparing the amino acid sequences of the MurC, -D, -E, and -F ligases from different bacterial genera, several conserved residues were identified. This analysis led to the characterization of the ATP-bind"
https://openalex.org/W1978612758,"PUF60 is an essential splicing factor functionally related and homologous to U2AF65. Its C-terminal domain belongs to the family of U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor) homology motifs (UHM), a subgroup of RNA recognition motifs that bind to tryptophan-containing linear peptide motifs (UHM ligand motifs, ULMs) in several nuclear proteins. Here, we show that the Puf60 UHM is mainly monomeric in physiological buffer, whereas its dimerization is induced upon the addition of SDS. The crystal structure of PUF60-UHM at 2.2 Å resolution, NMR data, and mutational analysis reveal that the dimer interface is mediated by electrostatic interactions involving a flexible loop. Using glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, isothermal titration calorimetry, and NMR titrations, we find that Puf60-UHM binds to ULM sequences in the splicing factors SF1, U2AF65, and SF3b155. Compared with U2AF65-UHM, Puf60-UHM has distinct binding preferences to ULMs in the N terminus of SF3b155. Our data suggest that the functional cooperativity between U2AF65 and Puf60 may involve simultaneous interactions of the two proteins with SF3b155.

Pre-mRNA splicing is a stepwise process initiated by the recognition of sequence elements at the splice site by specific splicing factors (1Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The branch point sequence is recognized by splicing factor SF1 (2Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M.

Although SF1 alone interacts only weakly with the branch point sequence, this interaction is stabilized significantly by U2AF65, which binds simultaneously to SF1 and to the polypyrimidine tract (8Berglund J.A. Abovich N. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the next step of splicing initiation U2 snRNP is brought to the 3′ splice site. This involves base pairing of the U2 RNA to the branch site RNA (9Query C.C. Moore M.J. Sharp P.A.

Initial contacts between the U2 snRNP and the pre-mRNA are mediated by the N terminus of SF3b155 binding to U2AF65 and displacing SF1 from the branch point sequence (13Gozani O. Potashkin J. Reed R.

Because the ULM consensus motif is rather short ((K/R)4-6X0-1W(D/E/N/Q)1-2), its mere presence in a protein sequence cannot unambiguously identify a functional ULM. Candidate ULMs are found in many proteins, but a biological function has so far been assigned only to those in U2AF65 (17Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Breger K.S. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell.

PUF60 (poly-U-binding factor 60 kDa, also called FIR, Hfp, Ro-bp1) is a splicing factor homologous to and complementary in function to U2AF65. Similarly to U2AF65, its domain structure consists of a predicted intrinsically unstructured N terminus, two central RRM domains, and a C-terminal UHM. The UHM domain is special in that it has been reported to mediate homodimerization of Puf60 in SDS-PAGE (21Page-McCaw P.S. Amonlirdviman K. Sharp P.A. RNA (N.

Its function is enhanced by the presence of U2AF65, but not by the small U2AF subunit, U2AF35 (21Page-McCaw P.S. Amonlirdviman K. Sharp P.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Puf60 and U2AF65 can interact in vitro and in yeast cells (21Page-McCaw P.S. Amonlirdviman K. Sharp P.A. RNA (N.

Cusick M.E. Hill D.E. Roth F.P. Vidal M. Nature. 2005; 437: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that Puf60 and U2AF65 mutually enhance their affinity for binding polypyrimidine tract RNA in a cooperative fashion. Moreover, the ratio of U2AF65 to Puf60 can directly influence selective inclusion or skipping of alternatively spliced exons in several genes (28Hastings M.L. Allemand E. Duelli D.M. Myers M.P. Krainer A.R. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The function of Puf60 in splicing is thus closely linked to the function of U2AF65. In addition to its role in alternative splicing, Puf60 also controls human c-myc gene expression. Under the synonym FIR (FBP-interacting repressor), Puf60 was reported to interact with and inhibit the transcription factor FBP (FUSE (far upstream sequence element)-binding-protein), an activator of c-myc promoters (29Liu J. He L. Collins I. Ge H. Libutti D. Li J. Egly J.M. Levens D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Probably because of a similar mechanism, mutations in the Drosophila homolog of Puf60, Hfp (Half Pint), lead to increased expression of d-myc genes, thus negatively regulating cell cycle progression (30Quinn L.M. Dickins R.A. Coombe M. Hime G.R. Bowtell D.D. Richardson H. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1411-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hfp mutations also lead to aberrant splicing of specific mRNAs in Drosophila ovaries (31Van Buskirk C. Schupbach T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar to its mammalian ortholog Puf60, Hfp is thus a regulator both of transcription and of alternative splicing. Here, we report that Puf60 UHM is mainly monomeric under physiological conditions, whereas it dimerizes upon the addition of SDS. The crystal structure of PUF60-UHM and mutational analysis reveal that the dimerization is entirely mediated by electrostatic interactions. NMR relaxation data show that the dimer interface involves a loop that is highly flexible in solution. Furthermore, we show that PUF60-UHM binds to ULM sequences in U2AF65, SF1, and SF3b155. The UHMs in PUF60 and U2AF65 show preferences for binding to different ULMs in the N terminus of SF3b155. We propose that PUF60 and U2AF65 may cooperatively recruit U2 snRNP by simultaneously binding to SF3b155. Protein Preparation—Recombinant Puf60-UHM (residues 460-559, wild type, and mutants), thioredoxin-Puf60-UHM, SPF45-UHM(301-401), U2AF35-UHM (residues 38-152), and U2AF65-UHM (residues 369-475) were expressed from modified pET9d vectors with a noncleavable N-terminal His6 tag. U2AF65(85-112), SF1(1-25), SF3b155 (1-424, 194-229, 210-251, 229-269, 284-307, 317-357, wild type, and mutants), and Prp16 (1-314, 201-238, wild type, and mutants) were expressed from modified pET9d vectors with tobacco etch virus protease cleavable, N-terminal His6, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags. Unlabeled proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS in LB medium. All of the proteins were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under standard conditions and buffer exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline. For the preparation of ULM peptides for NMR titrations see the supplemental data. Isotopically 13C- and/or 15N-labeled proteins were expressed in minimal (M9) medium supplemented with 13C-d-glucose and/or 15NH4Cl. NMR samples were concentrated to 0.3-1.0 mm in 20 mm Na2PO4 buffer (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The samples used for crystallization were additionally purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex™ 75 16/60 prep grade column. NMR—All of the NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer, processed with NMRPipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar), and analyzed with NMRView (33Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances were assigned with standard triple resonance experiments (34Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). 15N relaxation data were recorded as described (35Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R.

Dissociation constants were derived from chemical shift displacements in HSQC spectra upon the addition of ligands as described (36Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 1349-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (see supplemental data). Crystallization and Data Collection—For crystallization, the chimeric thioredoxin-Puf60(460-559) fusion protein was concentrated to about 70 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drops composed of 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization buffer (1.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm potassium formate) suspended over 1 ml of the latter as reservoir solution. The crystals grew to sizes of about 100 × 100 × 500 μm and were cryoprotected by serial transfer into a solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm potassium formate). Diffraction data were recorded at beam-line PX01 of the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland). Data processing and scaling was carried out with XDS (37Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the thioredoxin-Puf60 fusion protein was solved by molecular replacement as implemented in PHASER (38McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read. R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13901) Google Scholar). The structure of E. coli thioredoxin (Protein Data Bank code 2TRX) and a homology model of Puf60-UHM generated with MODELLER (39Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

The solution comprises eight Trx-Puf60-UHM monomers that were refined in alternating cycles of model correction in COOT (40Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar), and restrained refinement as implemented in REFMAC (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

Structures were visualized with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA). The eight UHM domains in the unit cell of the crystal structure can be superimposed onto a reported solution structure of Puf60-UHM (Protein Data Bank code 2DNY) with root mean square deviations of 0.9-1.1 Å over 90 of 100 Cα atoms. The solution structure, however, does not indicate dimerization of the Puf60-UHM.TABLE 1Summary of crystallographic analysisData collectionSpace groupP212121 (19Cass D.M. Berglund J.A.

Open table in a new tab GST Pulldown Experiments—GST-tagged ULMs (1 nmol) were mixed with 3 nmol of His6-tagged UHMs in 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% (w/v) Igepal CA-630 at 22 °C and mixed vigorously for 1 h. For GST precipitation, 8 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline were added and mixed vigorously for 30 min. The beads were washed three times for 1 min in the buffer described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out with α-Puf60 antibody (Abcam 22819). Puf60-UHM Is Mainly Monomeric in Physiological Buffer—Puf60 interacts with itself in yeast two-hybrid analyses (26Poleev A. Hartmann A. Stamm S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Rual J.F. Venkatesan K. Hao T. Hirozane-Kishikawa T. Dricot A. Li N. Berriz G.F. Gibbons F.D. Dreze M. Ayivi-Guedehoussou N.

Vandenhaute J. Zoghbi H.Y. Smolyar A. Bosak S. Sequerra R. Doucette-Stamm L. Cusick M.E. Hill D.E. Roth F.P. Vidal M. Nature. 2005; 437: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar), and its C-terminal UHM domain has been shown to form dimers resistant to denaturing SDS-PAGE (21Page-McCaw P.S. Amonlirdviman K. Sharp P.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the oligomerization state of Puf60-UHM in solution (50 mm Pi, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol). NMR secondary chemical shifts (Fig. 1A) show that Puf60-UHM adopts the typical β1-αA-β2-β3-αB-β4-αC topology found for all RRMs and UHMs (20Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 43Maris C. Dominguez C. Allain F.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The overall rotational correlation time (τc) of Puf60-UHM was calculated from the ratio of the trimmed mean 15N longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times of residues with heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE values above 0.65 (Fig. 1B) (44Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 45Tjandra N. Wingfield P. Stahl S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The average 15N T1/T2 ratio for these residues is 7.4 (Fig. 1C), corresponding to a τc of 9.7 ns. However, at 50 MHz Larmor frequency and 297 K, τc values of 8.3 ns (T1/T2 = 5.7) and 15.8 ns (T1/T2 = 17.7) would be expected for a 13-kDa monomer and a 26-kDa UHM domain dimer, respectively (46Fushman D. Weisemann R. Thu¨ring H. Ru¨terjans H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 47Daragan V. Mayo K.H. Prog. Nuclear Magn. Reson. Spectroscopy. 1997; 31: 63-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (220) Google Scholar) (gray lines in Fig. 1C). Thus, the observed relaxation times indicate the presence of a mainly monomeric rather than a dimeric form of Puf60-UHM. The slightly increased T1/T2 ratio, compared with what is expected for a pure monomer, might result from some nonspecific aggregation, because the T1/T2 ratio of Puf60-UHM lacking an N-terminal His tag (T1/T2 = 4.4, τc = 7.0 ns; data not shown) is consistent with a monomeric protein. To further investigate the oligomerization state of the UHM, we used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). The AUC data also indicate a largely monomeric state of the UHM domain (Fig. 1D, solid gray line), whereas partial dimerization is observed at higher protein concentrations (Fig. 1D, dotted gray line). By fitting the AUC data to a monomerdimer equilibrium model, the dimerization constant is estimated to be Kdimer = 3-4 mm. The two central RRM domains of Puf60 were reported to dimerize in the presence of DNA (48Crichlow G.V. Zhou H. Hsiao H.H. Frederick K.B. Debrosse M. Yang Y. Folta-Stogniew E.J. Chung H.J. Fan C. De la Cruz E.M. Levens D. Lolis E. Braddock D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether a construct comprising RRM1-RRM2 and the C-terminal UHM had a tendency to dimerize without DNA or SDS. Our AUC data indicate that this construct is largely monomeric as well (Fig. 1D, solid black line). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Puf60-UHM (in the absence of SDS) and Puf60 RRM1-RRM2-UHM (in the absence of DNA or SDS) are monomeric in solution. Therefore, the UHM dimerization observed in denaturing and reducing SDS-PAGE (21Page-McCaw P.S. Amonlirdviman K. Sharp P.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is presumably induced by the experimental conditions. The Three-dimensional Structure of the PUF60-UHM—Next, we determined the crystal structure of Puf60-UHM at 2.2 Å resolution. Diffracting crystals could only be obtained using a fusion protein, in which E. coli thioredoxin A (Trx) is connected to the N terminus of Puf60-UHM via a short linker sequence (49Corsini L. Hothorn M. Scheffzek K. Sattler M. Stier G. Protein Sci. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that the Trx-UHM construct dimerizes in SDS-PAGE similarly to what is seen for the UHM alone (data not shown). The asymmetric unit consists of eight Trx-Puf60 fusion proteins arranged in a doughnut shape. Eight Trx molecules are stacked in two layers in the center of the doughnut, surrounded by a ring of eight PUF60-UHM domains (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the NMR secondary chemical shifts, Puf60-UHM adopts a β1-αA-β2-β3-αB-β4-αC secondary structure. A central four-stranded β-sheet is sandwiched by helices αA and αB on one side and helix αC on the other side (Fig. 2B). As seen in other UHM structures (14Kielkopf C.L. Rodionova N.A. Green M.R. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Corsini L. Bonnal S. Basquin J. Hothorn M. Scheffzek K. Valcarcel J. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 620-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Puf60-UHM has an additional strand β3′ adjacent to β4, which forms a β-hairpin extension to the central four-stranded β-sheet. The β3′ strand comprises the conserved Arg-Xaa-Phe motif (RWF 535-537 in Puf60), which plays a crucial role in ULM binding in all known UHM·ULM complexes (14Kielkopf C.L. Rodionova N.A. Green M.R. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Selenko P. Gregorovic G. Sprangers R. Stier G. Rhani Z. Kra¨mer A. Sattler M. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 14: 620-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A unique structural feature of Puf60-UHM is the presence of unusually long β2 and β3 strands, which form a β-hairpin that protrudes out of the β-sheet (Fig. 2B). In solution, the acidic β2-β3 loop is flexible, as indicated by low heteronuclear NOE values, which drop to a minimum of 0.12 for Gly504 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, an average heteronuclear NOE of 0.74 for residues 462-501 and 512-559 indicates the absence of internal motion on subnanosecond time scales. Dimerization Interface—Because Puf60-UHM crystallizes at concentrations above the dimerization constant of 3-4 mm (1.5 mm in the mother liquor, 32 mm in the crystal lattice), we expected to detect a dimeric UHM in the crystal. Analysis with PISA (50Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar) shows that each of the eight Puf60-UHM domains contacts three other Puf60-UHM domains, two in the same and one in a symmetry-related asymmetric unit. One of the UHM-UHM interfaces within an asymmetric unit is composed of charged interactions between the residues EEE (505-507) in the β2-β3 loop of one protein monomer and Arg467, Arg540/Lys541 in the adjacent strands β1 and β4 of the other dimer subunit, respectively (Fig. 2C). As shown in the electrostatic surface representation (Fig. 2C, right panel), the residues Arg467, Arg540, and Lys541 form a positively charged surface, which is contacted by the negatively charged acidic β2-β3 loop. The electrostatic interactions involve the tips of the long side chains of arginine/lysine, which contact glutamate/aspartate residues in the mobile β2-β3 loop. Of the six salt bridges that can be formed, electron density is visible for a maximum of four contacts in any of the putative dimer interfaces in the asymmetric unit. Notably, the combina"

Yet there are other thylakoid multiprotein complexes that are essential for plant sustenance under changing environmental conditions. In higher plant chloroplasts, the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex functions in PSI cyclic electron flow and chlororespiration (1Kofer W. Koop H.U. Wanner G. Steinmuller K. Mol. Gen.

The expression and activity of the NDH complex in plant chloroplasts are highly regulated, and this complex seems to be crucial for acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus to environmental cues (3Rumeau D. Peltier G. Cournac L. Plant. Cell. Environ. 2007; 30: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Under stress conditions like heat and drought, the NDH complex diverts electrons to cyclic electron flow around PSI to avoid over-reduction of the acceptor side of the PSI complex and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus eventually protecting the photosynthetic apparatus against oxidative stress (3Rumeau D. Peltier G. Cournac L. Plant. Cell. Environ. 2007; 30: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The NDH complex in chloroplasts closely resembles the cyanobacterial NDH-1L complex (4Zhang P. Battchikova N. Jansen T. Appel J. Ogawa T. Aro E.M.

Novel Thylakoid Proteins Encoded by At1g15980 and At1g64770 Genes—A proteome analysis of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (associated with fragments of stroma thylakoids) from Arabidopsis chloroplasts revealed several novel proteins of unknown function (20Sirpio S. Allahverdiyeva Y. Suorsa M. Paakkarinen V. Vainonen J. Battchikova N. Aro E.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They may represent novel subunits of protein complexes or play a role of auxiliary proteins in the assembly and/or function of the thylakoid membrane protein complexes. Here we have addressed the functional role of two nuclear-encoded, NDH-related proteins (see below), NDH48 (At1g15980) with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa and NDH45 (At1g64770) of 45 kDa. Both of these proteins possess the chloroplast targeting signal in the N terminus of the amino acid sequence. Homology searches (NCBI Blast) revealed that the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins are conserved among higher plants, with amino acid identities up to 62 and 52% with corresponding proteins in Oryza sativa, respectively. In contrast, cyanobacteria entirely lack the close homologs of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins (data not shown). Generation of the Mutant Lines—A reverse genetics approach was taken to characterize the functional roles of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins. The SALK_111363 mutant line with a T-DNA insert within the At1g64770 gene was ordered from the SALK mutant collection. According to the immunoblot analysis, this mutant line (ndh45) did not contain the protein produced by the At1g64770 gene (Fig. 1A). The Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested DNA from SALK_111363 plants performed with a T-DNA specific probe confirmed the presence of the predicted 2.3-kb NDH45:T-DNA fragment (Fig. 1B) and demonstrated that the SALK_111363 line contains only one T-DNA insert. For NDH48, a T-DNA mutant was not available, and therefore an antisense mutant line was generated in our laboratory by a Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The majority of antisense NDH48 (as-ndh48) plants contained ∼20% of the NDH48 protein compared with the amount present in WT (Fig. 1A, lane 6). However, some of the mutant plants showed more drastic down-regulation in the amount of the NDH48 protein (∼10%, Fig. 1A, lane 5). To ensure adequate numbers of plants for biochemical experiments, plants containing ∼20% of the NDH48 protein were used for most of the experiments. Characterization of ndh45 and as-ndh48 Mutant Plants—No statistically significant differences in the Chl a/b ratio or in the total amount of Chl per leaf area were found in mutant plants compared with WT (Table 1). Immunoblot analysis of representative proteins from major thylakoid multiprotein complexes was taken as a first approach to analyze the impact of the deficiency of either the NDH48 or the NDH45 protein. The most dominant feature of both the ndh45 and as-ndh48 thylakoids was a distinct deficiency of the NDHH protein, representing the NDH complex (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the amounts of the PSI, PSII, and cyt b6f complexes as well as the ATP synthase, represented by PsaB, D1, Cytf, and Atpβ proteins, respectively, remained unaltered or at a slightly elevated level in the mutant thylakoids compared with WT.TABLE 1Characteristics of the photosynthetic apparatus in ndh45 and as-ndh48 plantsWTndh45as-ndh48Chl/leaf area24.4 ± 1.824.9 ± 1.925.3 ± 1.3Chl a/b3.7 ± 0.03.7 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.1Photochemical efficiency of PSII (FV/FM)0.82 ± 0.070.82 ± 0.070.83 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab NDH48 and NDH45 Proteins Interact with Each Other on the Thylakoid Membrane—NDH48 and NDH45 were localized exclusively to the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 1C). To investigate the interaction between the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins, the thylakoids of WT plants were treated with high salt (2 m NaBr) that detaches the peripheral proteins from the thylakoid membrane (21Carlberg I. Hansson M. Kieselbach T. Schroder W.P. Andersson B. Vener A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Such treatment indeed released the majority of the peripheral proteins, like Atpβ and NDHH, from the membrane. The PsbO protein was also partially released, indicating that the treatment was harsh enough to disrupt the thylakoid membrane in order to release PsbO from the lumenal compartment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, most of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins remained tightly bound to the thylakoid membrane after the high salt treatment (Fig. 2A). It should also be noted that those NDH48 and NDH45 proteins that released during the salt treatment were rapidly and efficiently degraded after release (Fig. 2A). To determine the membrane topology of the NDH45 and NDH48 proteins more precisely, thylakoids isolated from the WT plants were subjected to mild digestion with trypsin, allowing the degradation of only the stroma-exposed parts of the thylakoid membrane proteins. Whereas the NDH48 protein was partially degraded by the protease, the NDH45 protein remained intact, similarly to the lumenal control protein, PsbO (Fig. 2B). However, the NDH45 protein seems not to locate within the lumenal compartment, because a harsh trypsin treatment that degraded the PsbO protein had hardly any effect on the NDH45 protein (data not shown). Interestingly, the deficiency of either the NDH45 or the NDH48 protein in the two mutant plants resulted in a total loss or strong down-regulation of the other protein, respectively, from the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 1A). Thus, the accumulation of the NDH45 and NDH48 proteins seemed to be mutually co-regulated. The deficiency of the NDH48 protein from ndh45 thylakoids was more pronounced than the deficiency of NDH45 in the as-ndh48 thylakoids, which is most likely due to a small amount of NDH48 protein left in the as-ndh48 plants. To address the mutual stabilization of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins, it was examined whether the lack of the NDH48 protein in ndh45 thylakoids results from defects in transcription of the NDH48 gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the amount of the NDH48 mRNA was almost the same in WT and ndh45 plants (Fig. 2C), indicating that the loss of the NDH48 protein in ndh45 thylakoids is dependent on post-transcriptional regulation. NDH48 and NDH45 Proteins Associate with the NDH Complex—More exact location of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins was addressed by fractionation of the thylakoid membrane into grana and stroma lamellae, followed by immunoblot analysis of the membrane fractions. Both the NDH48 and the NDH45 protein were strongly enriched in stroma thylakoids with only a minor proportion of the proteins detected in grana thylakoids (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the stoichiometry of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins in grana and stroma thylakoids was similar (see supplemental Fig. S1 for the linearity tests of the antibodies). Further study of the protein complexes from intact thylakoids as well as from isolated grana and stroma membranes by BN-PAGE, enabling the separation of the protein complexes according to their size, revealed the presence of NDH45 (Fig. 3B) and NDH48 (data not shown) proteins in a large supercomplex of ≥1000 kDa, with only minor fraction of these proteins in a smaller protein complex of ∼800 kDa. For analysis of the protein composition of the ≥1000-kDa protein complex harboring the NDH45 and NDH48 proteins in the thylakoid membrane, the stroma thylakoids were subjected to two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE and subsequent identification of the protein subunits by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C and Table 2). Besides NDH45 and NDH48, the NDHH, NDHN, and NDHK proteins were found in the same complex as well as the PPL2 protein (At2g39470), essential for accumulation and activity of the NDH complex (30Ishihara S. Takabayashi A. Ido K. Endo T. Ifuku K. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 668-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, the CYP20-2 protein (At5g13120) was present in the complex, and also the PSI reaction center protein PsaB was identified by immunoblotting (Fig. 3C). Not only PsaB but also several other PSI proteins were present in the supercomplex, with identification based on our previous work (31Aro E.M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamaki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The composition of the ∼800-kDa protein complex, in turn, remained enigmatic because according to immunoblotting, it did not contain PsaB or NDHH proteins (Fig. 3C), indicating that the PSI complex as well as the hydrophilic subunits of the NDH complex might not be present in this complex.TABLE 2Mass spectrometric identification of unknown proteins from the supercomplex of ≥1000 kDa of Arabidopsis stroma thylakoidsSpotProteinAGI-codeMWaMolecular mass is predicted from the amino acid sequence.PeptidesCoverScorekDatotal no.%1.NDH48At1g1598051.312271512.NDH45At1g6477038.39221413.NADH dehydrogenase subunit H (NDHH)Atcg0111045.614301854.NADH dehydrogenase subunit K (NDHK)Atcg0043025.6515785.Peptidylprolyl isomerase (CYP20-2)At5g1312028.5625856.PsbP domain protein (PPL2)At2g3947027.2729897.PsbP domain protein (PPL2)At2g3947027.09381288.NADH dehydrogenase subunit N (NDHN)At5g5826023.7736112a Molecular mass is predicted from the amino acid sequence. Open table in a new tab ndh45 and as-ndh48 Mutants Show Impaired Function of the NDH Complex—Functional characterization of the thylakoid membrane protein complexes did not reveal any malfunction of PSII measured as photochemical efficiency of PSII (FV/FM and Table 1). Functional modification, however, was recorded in the re-reduction rate of P700 + in darkness, which was slowed down both in ndh45 (t½ = 1.76 s) and as-ndh48 (t½ = 1.85 s) mutants compared with WT (t½ = 1.27 s) (Fig. 4A). This might be related to slower cyclic electron transfer around PSI in the mutant plants, thus indirectly suggesting a possible functional flaw in the NDH complex. To confirm the malfunction of the NDH complex in the ndh45 and as-ndh48 plants, the post-illumination rise in Chl fluorescence (32Asada K. Heber U. Schreiber U. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 39-50Google Scholar), which is dependent on NDH-mediated reduction of plastoquinone pool in darkness (33Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 661-668Google Scholar), was measured. In this experiment, two earlier characterized Arabidopsis NDH mutant lines, ndho and crr2-2, were used as controls (7Rumeau D. Becuwe-Linka N. Beyly A. Louwagie M. Garin J. Peltier G. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The reduced level of F0-“rise” after light to dark transition in as-ndh48 mutant plants and especially in ndh45 compared with WT provided direct evidence of a lack or impaired function of the NDH complex (Fig. 4B). As expected, also the ndho and crr2-2 plants showed malfunction of the NDH complex (Fig. 4B). In addition, we measured the rate of NAD(P)H oxidation using thylakoids isolated from WT, ndh45, or ndho chloroplasts. In these experiments either ferricyanide or duroquinone was used as an electron acceptor. However, no statistically significant difference was found between WT, ndh45, and ndho thylakoids in the rate of oxidation of NADH or NADPH (data not shown). ndh45 Plants Accumulate H2O2 in Dark-Light Transition—NDH-mediated cyclic electron flow is important in adjusting the photosynthetic electron flow and in preventing the accumulation of ROS upon sudden changes in environmental condition. Accordingly, the production of ROS in WT, ndh45, and ndho plants was tested after transfer of 14-day-old plants from darkness to growth light conditions for 4 min and for 1 h. The DAB staining revealed a higher accumulation of H2O2 in ndh45 and ndho mutant leaves compared with WT, both immediately after the lights were turned on following the diurnal dark period and still after 1 h in light (Fig. 5), which implies higher oxidative stress in mutant plants. Accumulation and Attachment of NDH45 and NDH48 Proteins to the Thylakoid Membrane Are Distorted in crr2-2 Mutant Plants but Not in the ndho Mutant Plants—To study the role of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins in the structure/assembly of the NDH complex, we estimated the amounts of the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins in thylakoids isolated from the ndho and from the crr2-2 mutants. ndho mutant lacks the hydrophilic subunits of the NDH connecting domain (7Rumeau D. Becuwe-Linka N. Beyly A. Louwagie M. Garin J. Peltier G. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas the accumulation of both the hydrophobic NDHB subunit and the hydrophilic NDHH is disturbed in the crr2-2 mutant plants (9Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The NDH45 and NDH48 proteins were present in thylakoids of the ndho mutant in amounts similar to those in WT while the crr2-2 thylakoids contained clearly reduced amounts of the NDH45 and NDH48 proteins (Fig. 6A). This indicates that the NDH48 and NDH45 proteins do accumulate normally in the thylakoid membrane in the absence of the hydrophilic subunits of the NDH complex. Accumulation, however, is diminished when both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic subunits of the NDH complex are present in reduced amounts. The location of the NDH45 and NDH48 proteins in thylakoid protein complexes of the ndho and crr2-2 mutant plants was studied further by BN-PAGE. In WT and in ndho thylakoids the NDH45 and NDH48 proteins were fo"
https://openalex.org/W2090072665,"Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a bifunctional enzyme with two catalytic domains: a C-terminal epoxide hydrolase domain and an N-terminal phosphatase domain. Epidemiology and animal studies have attributed a variety of cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory effects to the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase domain. The recent association of sEH with cholesterol-related disorders, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity, and the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway additionally suggest a role of sEH in regulating cholesterol metabolism. Here we used sEH knock-out (sEH-KO) mice and transfected HepG2 cells to evaluate the phosphatase and hydrolase domains in regulating cholesterol levels. In sEH-KO male mice we found a ∼25% decrease in plasma total cholesterol as compared with wild type (sEH-WT) male mice. Consistent with plasma cholesterol levels, liver expression of HMG-CoA reductase was found to be ∼2-fold lower in sEH-KO male mice. Additionally, HepG2 cells stably expressing human sEH with phosphatase only or hydrolase only activity demonstrate independent and opposite roles of the two sEH domains. Whereas the phosphatase domain elevated cholesterol levels, the hydrolase domain lowered cholesterol levels. Hydrolase inhibitor treatment in sEH-WT male and female mice as well as HepG2 cells expressing human sEH resulted in higher cholesterol levels, thus mimicking the effect of expressing the phosphatase domain in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, we show that sEH regulates cholesterol levels in vivo and in vitro, and we propose the phosphatase domain as a potential therapeutic target in hypercholesterolemia-related disorders. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a bifunctional enzyme with two catalytic domains: a C-terminal epoxide hydrolase domain and an N-terminal phosphatase domain. Epidemiology and animal studies have attributed a variety of cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory effects to the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase domain. The recent association of sEH with cholesterol-related disorders, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity, and the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway additionally suggest a role of sEH in regulating cholesterol metabolism. Here we used sEH knock-out (sEH-KO) mice and transfected HepG2 cells to evaluate the phosphatase and hydrolase domains in regulating cholesterol levels. In sEH-KO male mice we found a ∼25% decrease in plasma total cholesterol as compared with wild type (sEH-WT) male mice. Consistent with plasma cholesterol levels, liver expression of HMG-CoA reductase was found to be ∼2-fold lower in sEH-KO male mice. Additionally, HepG2 cells stably expressing human sEH with phosphatase only or hydrolase only activity demonstrate independent and opposite roles of the two sEH domains. Whereas the phosphatase domain elevated cholesterol levels, the hydrolase domain lowered cholesterol levels. Hydrolase inhibitor treatment in sEH-WT male and female mice as well as HepG2 cells expressing human sEH resulted in higher cholesterol levels, thus mimicking the effect of expressing the phosphatase domain in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, we show that sEH regulates cholesterol levels in vivo and in vitro, and we propose the phosphatase domain as a potential therapeutic target in hypercholesterolemia-related disorders.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). These fatty acid epoxides (such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) have been shown to possess a wide variety of biological effects, many of which are related to cardiovascular physiology (4Larsen B.T.

Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids have been described as major components of the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors and are generally known for their vasodilator effects (6Fleming I. Busse R. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). sEH inhibitors have been shown to lower blood pressure in several animal models and have been proposed as therapeutic options for the management of hypertension (7Imig J.D.

Kim I.H. Watanabe T. Hammock B.D. Hypertension. 2005; 46: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Additionally, epidemiological studies link sEH polymorphisms with various human diseases, many of which are related to cardiovascular disorders. The R287Q polymorphism was found to be associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcification in African-Americans and was described as an emerging risk factor for atherosclerosis (9Wei Q. Doris P.A. Pollizotto M.V. Boerwinkle E. Jacobs Jr., D.R. Siscovick D.S. Fornage M. Atherosclerosis. 2007; 190: 26-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Fornage M.

Another variant (K55R) was associated with coronary heart disease in Caucasians (11Lee C.R. North K.E. Bray M.S. Fornage M. Seubert J.M. Newman J.W. Hammock B.D. Couper D.J. Heiss G. Zeldin D.C. Hum.

Interestingly, the R287Q variant was also found to be associated with increased levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in familial hypercholesterolemia patients (12Sato K. Emi M. Ezura Y.

The exact role of sEH in modulating PPARs is currently unknown; however, the documented significance of PPARs in lipid metabolism and metabolic disorders is consistent with the above described epidemiological studies. Another emerging role of sEH is based on the recently described phosphatase activity of the sEH N-terminal domain (17Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Harris T.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1558-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Cronin A. Mowbray S. Durk H. Homburg S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Oesch F. Arand M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Isoprenoid pyro- and monophosphates are substrates for the N-terminal domain (19Enayetallah A.E. Grant D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Tran K.L. Aronov P.A. Tanaka H. Newman J.W. Hammock B.D. Morisseau C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12179-12187Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These lipid phosphates are metabolic precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis and are also utilized for isoprenylation of small G-proteins involved in multiple cell signaling pathways (21Kovacs W.J. Olivier L.M. Krisans S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most current sEH literature attributes the hydrolase domain to the cardiovascular effects seen in humans. However, the human sEH single nucleotide polymorphism most often associated with cardiovascular disease (R287Q) encodes a protein with significantly lower hydrolase activity (22Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. Srivastava P.K. Vazquez-Matias J. Mohrenweiser H.W. Maxwell J.E. Hammock B.D. Bradbury J.A. Enayetallah A.E. Zeldin D.C. Grant D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, the R287Q protein has been recently shown to have an altered subcellular localization phenotype (23Luo B. Norris C. Bolstad E.S. Knecht D.A. Grant D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, solely incriminating the hydrolase domain for adverse cardiovascular effects seems premature and highlights the importance of further investigating the independent roles of the hydrolase and phosphatase domains. In this study we tested the hypothesis that sEH plays a significant role in regulating cholesterol metabolism in vitro and in vivo. First, we evaluated the effect of targeted disruption of the soluble epoxide hydrolase gene (sEH-knock-out (sEH-KO)) on plasma total cholesterol levels and liver expression of HMG-CoA reductase in mice. Second, we used HepG2 cell lines stably expressing modified sEH protein constructs and the human sEH R287Q variant to investigate the potential independent roles of the sEH phosphatase and hydrolase domains. Finally, we evaluated the effect of hydrolase inhibition on cholesterol levels in mice and HepG2 cells. Animal Experiments—Mice on a 129X1/SvJ × C57BL/6 background with targeted disruption in the Ephx2 gene were obtained from Chris Sinal (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada) under National Cancer Institute Material Transfer Agreement 1-16268-04 (24Sinal C.J.

These mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL6 genetic background five generations prior to use in this study (25Luria A. Weldon S.M. Kabcenell A.K. Ingraham R.H. Matera D. Jiang H. Gill R. Morisseau C. Newman J.W. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2891-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All of the procedures were conducted in accordance with approved IACUC protocols. EPHX2-null or wild type mice (25-30 g) were treated with sEH inhibitor TUPS (laboratory number EHI 1709) (5Chiamvimonvat N. Ho C.M. Tsai H.J. Hammock B.D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2007; 50: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Jones P.D. Tsai H.J. Do Z.N. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TUPS was given via drinking water (10-15 mg/liter in 1% polyethylene glycol 400) for 7 days. Water consumption was monitored daily, and the concentration of TUPS was adjusted accordingly to achieve equal plasma concentrations in the treatment groups. A second set of animals was treated with 1% polyethylene glycol 400 alone (vehicle). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture from the right ventricle in EDTA-rinsed syringes following lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally). TUPS was extracted from blood samples, and the concentration was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as previously described (27Watanabe T. Schulz D. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2006; 559: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Plasma was separated (10 min, 400 × g) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Liver samples were collected, frozen immediately, and kept at -80 °C. HepG2 Stable Cell Lines—The human hepatoma (HepG2) cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 95% air and 5% CO2. To prepare HepG2 stable cell lines, human sEH was first cloned into BamHI/XhoI sites of pFastBac and pCR-Script vectors. The fragment was then subcloned into the BglII/SalI site of the pAcGFP-C1 vector (BD Bioscience) to produce green fluorescent protein fusion constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the hsEH R287Q variant, the phosphatase knock-out (D9A), and the hydrolase knock-out (D335S) constructs as previously described (22Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. Srivastava P.K. Vazquez-Matias J. Mohrenweiser H.W. Maxwell J.E. Hammock B.D. Bradbury J.A. Enayetallah A.E. Zeldin D.C. Grant D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All of the PCR products were completely sequenced to verify their identity. For transfections, the cells were grown to 90-100% confluency in T75 flasks then seeded at 7 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After allowing the cells to attach for 24 h, they were transfected with sEH-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were then passaged at a 1:20 ratio into selection medium (maintenance medium supplemented with 0.7 mg/ml G418) 24 h after transfection. Green fluorescent protein-positive colonies were subsequently isolated and maintained in selection medium. sEH activity and expression in HepG2 cells were evaluated using t-DPPO (28Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (1Enayetallah A.E. French R.A. Thibodeau M.S. Grant D.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Isoprenoid compounds were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). All treatments for measuring cholesterol in the media were carried out in 1% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 Stable Cell Line Treatment—Transfected HepG2 cells (7 × 105 cells/well) were treated with the hydrolase inhibitor TUPS (1 μm) (5Chiamvimonvat N. Ho C.M. Tsai H.J. Hammock B.D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2007; 50: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Jones P.D. Tsai H.J. Do Z.N. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)y or the phosphatase inhibitor farnesyl thioacetic acid (5 μm) (19Enayetallah A.E. Grant D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for 24 h. At the end of the incubation, the medium was collected, and total cholesterol was measured. HMG-CoA Reductase Western Blot Analysis—Liver samples and HepG2 cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenates were centrifuged three times at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C discarding the pellet each time. The collected supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed using 10% resolving gels. Western transfer using polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was performed overnight at 30 V. The membrane was blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.25% Tween 20 (pH 7.4) and then incubated with either rabbit polyclonal anti-HMG-CoA reductase (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal anti-sEH (1:5000) for 2 h. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000; Sigma) was incubated for 2 h. After washing, bound secondary antibody was detected with supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The proteins were visualized with a Kodak image station 440CF. Analysis of Gene Expression—Forward and reverse primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). 5′-GGCCTCCATTGAGATCCG-3′ and 5′-CACAATAACTTCCCAGGGGT-3′ for HMG-CoA reductase, and 5′-TTCTTTGCAGCTCCTTCGTT-3′ and 5′-ATGGAGGGGAATACAGCCC-3′ for β-actin. Total RNA was extracted from liver samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was done using SuperScript reverse transcription-PCR kit (Invitrogen), and the concentration of cDNA was analyzed by real time PCR using SYBR green Supermix (Invitrogen). The experimental steps were essentially following those provided by the manufacturer. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles, and a final melting curve verified the authenticity of the target product. Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay—Aliquots of growing medium or plasma were collected for measuring total cholesterol with the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described by the manufacturer. HepG2 cells expressing inactive sEH with mutations at both active sites (sEH-D9A/D335S) were used as control cells. Furthermore, sEH-D9A/D335S was compared with normal nontransfected HepG2 cells and found to exhibit similar cholesterol levels (p < 0.05). Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were repeated in replicates with appropriate controls as indicated. Statistical significance was evaluated using t test or ANOVA with p < 0.05. The statistics were calculated based on absolute cholesterol levels and then transformed to ratios for presentation. Effect of sEH Disruption on Cholesterol Levels—We first examined plasma cholesterol in response to targeted disruption of the Ephx2 gene in mice. Total plasma cholesterol was ∼25% lower in the 16-week-old male sEH-KO mice as compared with sEH-WT male mice (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, however, disruption of sEH in female mice did not have a significant effect on plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. 1A). Next we used HepG2 cells stably expressing sEH-WT, sEH-R287Q variant or sEH protein with mutated phosphatase and hydrolase active sites (D9A/D335S). The cells were seeded in six-well plates at 7 × 105 cells/well, and total cholesterol in the growing medium was measured after 48 h. Consistent with the above findings in mice, total cholesterol was significantly lower with sEH-D9A/D335S as compared with sEH-WT, whereas R287Q had the highest total cholesterol level (Fig. 1B). The level of sEH protein was similar in each of these three stable cell lines (Fig. 1C). HMG-CoA Reductase Expression in Murine Liver—HMG-CoA reductase is considered the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo and is a common therapeutic target in the management of cholesterol related disorders. We evaluated the correlation of lower plasma total cholesterol in sEH-KO male mice with liver expression of HMG-CoA reductase. Indeed, both quantitative real time PCR and Western blot analysis indicate significantly lower liver expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase in sEH-KO male mice as compared with sEH-WT (Fig. 2). Independent Roles of the sEH Hydrolase and Phosphatase Domains—The results above indicate a significant role of sEH in modulating cholesterol levels in mice and in our HepG2 stable cell lines. However, these data do not differentiate phosphatase from hydrolase effects. Therefore, we measured total cholesterol levels from the growing medium of transfected HepG2 cells stably expressing sEH with inactive phosphatase or hydrolase domains (sEH-D9A or sEH-D335S, respectively). Protein expression levels for the two constructs were similar (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, both domains had significant but opposite effects on total cholesterol levels (Fig. 3B). The sEH D9A mutation (possessing hydrolase activity only) resulted in a modest but statistically significant lowering of total cholesterol concentration, whereas the sEH D335S (possessing phosphatase activity only) resulted in a 40% increase in total cholesterol. The independent effects of the sEH phosphatase and hydrolase domains on cholesterol levels were further verified by reversing their effects using the corresponding inhibitors farnesyl thioacetic acid (19Enayetallah A.E. Grant D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and TUPS (26Jones P.D. Tsai H.J. Do Z.N. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the results shown for the sEH-R287Q variant (Fig. 1B), which possess lower hydrolase (22Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. Srivastava P.K. Vazquez-Matias J. Mohrenweiser H.W. Maxwell J.E. Hammock B.D. Bradbury J.A. Enayetallah A.E. Zeldin D.C. Grant D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and higher phosphatase (19Enayetallah A.E. Grant D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) activities as compared with sEH-WT. Next we evaluated the correlation between the media cholesterol levels and HMG-CoA reductase expression levels in HepG2 cells expressing different sEH proteins (Fig. 3C). Quantitative real time PCR displays a ∼2-fold higher expression level of HMG-CoA reductase in sEH-WT cells as compared with sEH-D9A/D335S control cells. However, sEH-D9A (hydrolase only) and sEH-D335S (phosphatase only) cells exhibited ∼0.5- and ∼4-fold differences, respectively. sEH Hydrolase Inhibition in Vivo—Sixteen-week-old male and female sEH-WT and sEH-KO mice were treated with TUPS (10-15 mg/liter) in drinking water for 1 week. Because of observed variation in water consumption between the different animal groups, the concentration of TUPS was adjusted to achieve comparable blood drug levels (Fig. 4A). This compound is a potent inhibitor of sEH (IC50 of 5 and 3 nm for murine and human sEH, respectively) and has higher bioavailability/water solubility (13.9 ± 1.5 μg/ml) than previously used inhibitors such as AUDA and AEPU (26Jones P.D. Tsai H.J. Do Z.N. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TUPS was formulated in water using 1% polyethylene glycol 400 to increase solubility. After 7 days of treatment, TUPS blood levels were 1.3 μm (Fig. 4A), which is significantly above the IC50 value. The in vivo effects of TUPS on epoxide hydrolase activity were estimated by measuring the ratios of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid epoxides to their corresponding diols (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). TUPS treatment was effective in both male and female mice as demonstrated by similar increase of epoxide/diol ratios; however, the fold change was less than that of sEH gene disruption (Fig. 4, B and C). In agreement with the HepG2 results for the hydrolase and phosphatase effects (Fig. 3B), the total plasma cholesterol level showed a ∼25% increase following TUPS treatment in both male and female mice (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, HepG2 cells expressing sEH-WT showed ∼25% higher cholesterol levels in the growing medium following TUPS treatment (Fig. 5C). TUPS produced no significant effects on cholesterol levels in sEH-KO mice or HepG2 cells expressing inactive hsEH (Fig. 5), indicating that the effects of TUPS were caused by the inhibition of sEH. Over the past five years there has been mounting evidence suggesting a role for sEH in lipid metabolism and lipid related disorders. First, several epidemiological studies link human sEH polymorphisms with dyslipidemia (12Sato K. Emi M. Ezura Y. Fujita Y. Takada D. Ishigami T. Umemura S. Xin Y. Wu L.L. Larrinaga-Shum S.

Arand M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These isoprenoid intermediates are known to regulate various nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol metabolism, such as liver X receptor and PPARα (36Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J.

We show here that the effect of the phosphatase domain on cholesterol in HepG2 cells may also involve altering the expression level of HMG-CoA reductase. However, it is plausible that the effect of the phosphatase domain could be indirect through modulating liver X receptor activity by isoprenoid metabolites (36Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and/or downstream interactions with PPARγ (39Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. O'Neil C.H. Hegele R.A. Pickering J.G. Huff M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22212-22221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study we found significantly lower plasma total cholesterol levels in sEH-KO male mice as compared with their sEH-WT counterparts. Interestingly, the decrease in plasma cholesterol level as a result of sEH gene disruption described here is equal to or greater than what has been previously described in mice following statin treatment (40Johnston T.P. Nguyen L.B. Chu W.A. Shefer S. Int. J. Pharm. 2001; 229: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests that sEH may be a novel therapeutic target in the management of dyslipidemia. However, it should be noted that the effect of sEH gene disruption on plasma cholesterol was detected in male but not female mice. Intriguingly, the gender-specific effect of sEH gene disruption on cholesterol described here is in line with the previously described effect on blood pressure in male but not female mice (24Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown higher activity and expression levels of sEH in male mice as compared with females, and this could explain the gender dimorphism (41Inoue N. Yamada K. Imai K. Aimoto T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Pinot F. Grant D.F. Spearow J.L. Parker A.G. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Gill S.S. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the hydrolase and phosphatase domains of sEH are shown here to exhibit opposite effects on cholesterol levels, we suggest that the balance between the two domains may vary with the overall expression level of sEH. Therefore, targeted disruption of sEH in male mice results in a plasma cholesterol level similar to that of females. On the other hand and despite the lack of effect of sEH disruption on plasma cholesterol levels in females, hydrolase inhibition by TUPS in females results in a response similar to that found in males. Even though there are significant differences in cholesterol metabolism between mice and human cells, our results suggest that sEH exerts its effects through conserved mechanisms. For example, the effect of the hydrolase inhibitor TUPs on cholesterol levels had a similar direction and magnitude in both cells and mice. Similarly, knocking out sEH had the same effect in both models. However, the effect of the N-terminal domain in HepG2 cells was addressed by genetically eliminating (mutating) the C-terminal domain. Genetic ablation of the C terminus could not be performed in mice, and hence the effects of the N terminus were examined by chemically inhibiting the C-terminal hydrolase domain using TUPs. It is conceivable that significant differences may exist between the mouse model and the human cells based on differences in cholesterol metabolism and experimental conditions; however, based on our findings from this study, sEH effects on cholesterol levels appear to be consistent and therefore mediated via conserved mechanisms. sEH hydrolase inhibitors are currently being developed as potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory disorders (44Schmelzer K.R. Kubala L. Newman J.W. Kim I.H. Eiserich J.P. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9772-9777Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension (45Jin L. Foss C.E. Zhao X. Mills T.M. Wang M.H. McCluskey L.P. Yaddanapud G.S. Falck J.R. Imig J.D. Webb R.C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This is based on a growing body of research demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory and vasodilator properties of the arachidonic acid epoxide substrates of the hydrolase domain. Here we showed that treatment with the TUPS hydrolase inhibitor resulted in a significantly higher cholesterol level in sEH-WT but not in sEH-KO mice. A similar effect was found in HepG2 cells stably expressing sEH-WT. The lack of a significant effect of TUPS on cholesterol levels in gene disrupted mice and sEH-D9A/D335S HepG2 cells argues against nonspecific drug effects. The effectiveness of hydrolase inhibition was monitored by measuring plasma epoxide/diol ratios. Despite the previously demonstrated potency of TUPS as an epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (26Jones P.D. Tsai H.J. Do Z.N. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the significant change of epoxide/diol ratios with TUPS treatment in both male and female mice, it should be noted that genetic disruption of sEH had a much greater effect on epoxide/diol ratios. This might be expected with a small molecule enzyme inhibitor because of drug exclusion from some tissues or cellular compartments in an animal model. Also higher levels of epoxides are likely stored as esters in the genetically disrupted mice. Surprisingly, the higher plasma cholesterol levels following hydrolase inhibition by TUPS are not in agreement with the lower plasma cholesterol levels detected in sEH-KO mice. However, a major difference is that sEH-KO mice lack both hydrolase and phosphatase activities, whereas hydrolase inhibitor treatment inhibits only the hydrolase activity. This suggests potential roles for both the hydrolase and phosphatase domains in regulating cholesterol metabolism. This is further supported by our findings in HepG2 cells stably expressing hydrolase only (sEH-D9A) or phosphatase only (sEH-D335S) sEH. This is also supported by our findings for the R287Q polymorphism, which we have previously shown to exhibit lower hydrolase (22Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. Srivastava P.K. Vazquez-Matias J. Mohrenweiser H.W. Maxwell J.E. Hammock B.D. Bradbury J.A. Enayetallah A.E. Zeldin D.C. Grant D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and higher phosphatase (19Enayetallah A.E. Grant D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) activity. The effect of the hydrolase inhibitor on cholesterol as well as the analogous R287Q model and its association with several cardiovascular-related disorders suggests a cautionary note for developing hydrolase inhibition based therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, further understanding the effects of the phosphatase domain on increasing cholesterol levels may provide novel therapeutic approaches for dyslipidemia-related disorders. The phosphatase domain of sEH metabolizes intermediates in cholesterol biosynthesis, which would be expected to reduce plasma cholesterol. Because we observe the opposite effect, we hypothesize that the phosphatase domain influences cholesterol metabolism at the regulatory level rather than the biosynthetic level. This is further supported by the effect of the phosphatase domain on up-regulating the expression levels of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in HepG2 cells. sEH polymorphisms have a high rate of occurrence in humans (∼50% of samples tested), among which the R287Q was found to be one of the more common (14%) (22Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. Srivastava P.K. Vazquez-Matias J. Mohrenweiser H.W. Maxwell J.E. Hammock B.D. Bradbury J.A. Enayetallah A.E. Zeldin D.C. Grant D.F. Mol.

Recent epidemiological studies finding an association of the R287Q polymorphism with human disorders such as atherosclerosis and higher plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in familial hypercholesterolemia patients (9Wei Q.

Genet. 2004; 49: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) are in agreement with our findings regarding its effect on the total cholesterol level. In conclusion, our results suggest a role for sEH in regulating cholesterol metabolism in mice and human liver cells and that both the hydrolase and phosphatase domains are involved. Whereas the effect of hydrolase inhibition on cholesterol levels warrants caution with the currently proposed therapeutic targeting in cardiovascular disease, further investigation of the phosphatase domain effect on cholesterol levels may provide a novel therapeutic approach in the management of dyslipidemia and related disorders. Finally, we suggest that the association of the sEH-R287Q polymorphism with cardiovascular disease is related to its effects on cholesterol levels and that further investigation of the functional significance of the phenotypic properties associated with sEH polymorphisms is warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2013690770,"Yeast cells synthesize ∼3–6 million molecules of tRNA every cell cycle at a rate of ∼2–4 transcripts/gene/s. This high rate of transcription is achieved through many rounds of reinitiation by RNA polymerase (pol) III on stable DNA-bound complexes of the initiation factor TFIIIB. Studies in yeast have shown that the rate of reinitiation is increased by facilitated recycling, a process that involves the repeated reloading of the polymerase on the same transcription unit. However, when nutrients become limiting or stress conditions are encountered, RNA pol III transcription is rapidly repressed through the action of the conserved Maf1 protein. Here we examine the relationship between Maf1-mediated repression and facilitated recycling in a human RNA pol III in vitro system. Using an immobilized template transcription assay, we demonstrate that facilitated recycling is conserved from yeast to humans. We assessed the ability of recombinant human Maf1 to inhibit different steps in transcription before and after preinitiation complex assembly. We show that recombinant Maf1 can inhibit the recruitment of TFIIIB and RNA pol III to immobilized templates. However, RNA pol III bound to preinitiation complexes or in elongation complexes is protected from repression by Maf1 and can undergo several rounds of initiation. This indicates that recombinant Maf1 is unable to inhibit facilitated recycling. The data suggest that additional biochemical steps may be necessary for rapid Maf1-dependent repression of RNA pol III transcription.

Efficient in vitro transcription of tRNA genes and other genes with internal (type 2) promoters requires two multi-subunit transcription factors, TFIIIC and TFIIIB, in addition to RNA polymerase (pol) 3The abbreviations used are: polpolymerasePICpreinitiation complexTCternary complexBSAbovine serum albuminSRsingle roundMRmultiple roundNEnuclear extract III (1Geiduschek E.P.

These factors assemble onto the promoters of type 2 genes in an ordered and concerted process that involves conformational changes in both the DNA and the proteins (1Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 3Liao Y. Moir R.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 5946-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The basic stepwise assembly pathway entails the binding of split promoter elements by each of the two globular domains of TFIIIC followed by the recruitment of TFIIIB, which envelops the DNA upstream of the transcription start site. The resulting complex is exceptionally stable and is able to recruit the polymerase for multiple rounds of transcription (4Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Template competition experiments have shown that after the first cycle of transcription, the polymerase is committed to reinitiate on the same gene and does so more rapidly because it does not dissociate into the bulk solution (5Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is referred to as facilitated recycling and contributes to the high rate of RNA pol III transcription in yeast. Indeed, after the first round of transcription, the rate of subsequent rounds increases at least 5-fold (5Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Facilitated recycling couples the termination of transcription with reinitiation in a manner that is not fully understood. However, the coupling of these two steps requires proper termination and is transcription factor-dependent. Transcription assays that employ run-off termination on truncated RNA pol III genes or factor-independent transcription of tailed linear templates do not allow efficient recycling (5Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Ferrari R. Dieci G. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2008; 13: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Promoter-bound TFIIIB is sufficient for facilitated recycling of RNA pol III on short genes (∼100 bp). However, longer transcription units (>300 bp, e.g. the 7SL RNA gene) also require TFIIIC to achieve the high rates of reinitiation that characterize facilitated recycling (6Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In humans, several activities have been shown to contribute to RNA pol III reinitiation. The transcript release factor La was found to facilitate RNA pol III transcription and template reutilization (8Maraia R.J. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 2147-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas the NF1 protein acts through interactions with TFIIIC at the terminator region of the VA1 template to promote multiple rounds of transcription (9Wang Z. Bai L. Hsieh Y.J. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6823-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, topoisomerase I and PC4 both enhance TFIIIC interactions with downstream promoter regions and stimulate multiple but not single round transcription from preformed preinitiation complexes (10Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether the fundamental mechanism of reinitiation in higher eukaryotes is analogous to the facilitated recycling pathway described in yeast. polymerase preinitiation complex ternary complex bovine serum albumin single round multiple round nuclear extract Eukaryotic cells coordinately regulate transcription by all three nuclear RNA polymerases to maintain the appropriate protein synthetic capacity for cell growth and proliferation. Among the different mechanisms used to achieve coordinate control in higher eukaryotes, the Myc oncoprotein directly activates RNA pol II transcription of ribosomal protein genes and a wide variety of growth and cell cycle regulators along with transcription of rRNA and tRNA genes by RNA pols I and III (11White R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12Gomez-Roman N. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Kenneth N.S. Goodfellow S.J. Athineos D. Zhang J. Ramsbottom B.A. Innes F.

In nondividing cells, positive signals for cell growth and proliferation are opposed by the action of numerous tumor suppressor proteins that repress transcription by RNA pols I and III (e.g. Rb, p53, ARF, PTEN) and regulate different subsets of protein coding genes. Notably, inactivation of these tumor suppressors in different types of cancer leads to the up-regulation of RNA pol I and RNA pol III transcription (11White R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Zhang C. Comai L. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6899-6911Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Woiwode A.

Rather than being a simple consequence of cell transformation, a growing number of studies indicate that deregulation of RNA pol I and RNA pol III transcription plays an important role in the development of cancer and in the growth of tumors (11White R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Marshall L. Kenneth N.S. White R.J.

In mammalian cells, Maf1 functions to directly repress transcription by RNA pol III and a subset of RNA pol II transcribed genes including the TATA-binding protein, TBP (17Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Through its affect on TBP levels, Maf1 indirectly regulates transcription by RNA pol I (17Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The transcription of many protein coding genes whose expression is limited by TBP is also likely to be affected indirectly by Maf1. Importantly, overexpression of Maf1 inhibits the growth of glioblastoma cells in soft agar, indicating that Maf1 is able to function as a tumor suppressor (17Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Maf1 was identified genetically in yeast (18Boguta M. Czerska K. Zoladek T.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5031-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to function as an essential mediator of diverse nutritional and stress signaling pathways that repress transcription by RNA pol III (20Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the protein is conserved from yeast to humans and functions as a repressor of RNA pol III transcription in these organisms, its ability to repress TBP gene transcription and thereby influence rDNA synthesis is not observed in yeast (20Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This function appears to have evolved in higher eukaryotes. Much of what we currently know about the mechanism of repression by Maf1 derives from studies in the RNA pol III system (21Willis I.M. Moir R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The primary targets for Maf1 repression of RNA pol III transcription in yeast are TFIIIB and the polymerase. Recombinant Maf1 from budding and fission yeast binds to the Brf1 subunit of TFIIIB and blocks TFIIIB assembly directed by TFIIIC on tRNA gene promoters (22Desai N. Lee J. Upadhya R. Chu Y. Moir R.D. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6455-6462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The recombinant Maf1 proteins from yeast also inhibit RNA pol III transcription from preassembled TFIIIB-promoter complexes, presumably as a result of the direct interaction between Maf1 and the polymerase (22Desai N. Lee J. Upadhya R. Chu Y. Moir R.D. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6455-6462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).

The biological importance of these conserved interactions is demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous yeast and human Maf1 proteins with Brf1 and RNA pol III from cell free extracts (19Pluta K.

However, additional, as yet unknown steps are required to affect repression of RNA pol III transcription in vivo. This was first indicated by the properties of a nuclear-localized multi-phosphosite mutant of Maf1 (6SA) (25Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rather than being constitutively active, this mutant allele still requires the activation of cellular signaling pathways to effect repression. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism by which human Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription in vitro. Using fractionated HeLa cell components and an immobilized template transcription assay, we demonstrate facilitated recycling by human RNA pol III. Recombinant human Maf1 is a potent inhibitor of RNA pol III transcription in HeLa cell extracts. However, we find that human Maf1 is not capable of repressing single or multiple rounds of transcription in our reconstituted system once the polymerase has engaged the transcription factor-template complex. We show that Maf1 represses transcription primarily by preventing the recruitment of the polymerase to the TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complex. To a lesser extent, human Maf1 also inhibits the binding of TFIIIB to promoter-bound TFIIIC. Purification of Full-length Recombinant Human Maf1—Full-length human Maf1 was PCR-amplified from a pcDNA3.1 clone (17Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and ligated into NdeI- and HindIII-digested pET-30a-(+) (Novagen) to produce a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged hMaf1 protein. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), grown to an A600 of ∼0.7 at 37 °C, and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 15 °C. The hMaf1 protein was purified under native conditions on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The protein was dialyzed into Q100 buffer (20 mm Tris-actetate, pH 7.0, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The dialyzed protein was mixed with an equal volume of Q0 (no salt) buffer just before injection onto a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). hMaf1 was eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mm (NH4)2SO4 to 500 mm (NH4)2SO4. The peak fractions were dialyzed into Q200 buffer and stored at –70 °C. Maf1 concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated molar extinction coefficient. Extract Preparation and Factor Purification—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Nuclear extract and soluble S100 extract were prepared as described (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The nuclear extract was fractionated by phosphocellulose chromatography (Whatman P11) as described previously (29Segall J. Matsui T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11986-11991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into fractions containing TFIIIB along with RNA pol III (P11:0.35) and TFIIIC (P11:0.6). S100 extract was applied to the phosphocellulose P11 column and eluted in one step at 0.35 m KCl as described (29Segall J. Matsui T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11986-11991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This eluate was subsequently loaded onto a DEAE Sephadex A25 column, and fractions containing TFIIIB (DEAE 0.15) and RNA pol III (DEAE 1.0) were separated as described (30White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of the fractions were dialyzed against KBC100 buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine) containing 5 mm MgCl2. In Vitro Transcription—Standard 50-μl transcription reactions contained HeLa nuclear extract or protein fractions, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 600 μm of each ATP, GTP, and UTP, 25 μm CTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (GE Healthcare), 10 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and 0.5 μg of plasmid tRNALeu3 (YEp13) or 60 ng of immobilized VA1 DNA fragment (see below) as templates. Where indicated, the nuclear extract or protein fractions were preincubated with various concentrations of Maf1, BSA, or poly(dA-dT) for 10 min at room temperature. In single round reactions, Sarkosyl was added to 0.05% (final concentration). After transcription for various times at 30 °C, the RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to phosphorimaging screens (Molecular Dynamics) for capturing digital images and quantitation (ImageQuant). Assembly of Complexes and Transcription on Immobilized Templates—The pUC18-VA1 construct contains a 0.28-kb SalI-SmaI fragment of the Adenovirus 2 VA1 gene from the parental transcription construct pVA1 (31Dean N. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 3017-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pUC18. A 650-bp fragment containing the VA1 gene was generated from pUC18-VA1 by PCR using a 5′ end-biotinylated upstream primer (gctggcttaactatgcggcatatgagcagattgtac) and a downstream primer (cgcaacgcaattaatgtgagttagct). The fragment was immobilized on Streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads M-280 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The Dynabead-immobilized VA1 template will be referred to subsequently as IT-VA1. For experiments in which stalled ternary complexes (TC) were used, IT-VA1 was preincubated in KBCM60 (KBC buffer containing 60 mm KCl and 7.5 mm MgCl2) with P11:0.35 + 0.6 fractions and ATP, CTP, GTP, but not UTP. TCs were washed three times with 200 μl of KBCM500/0.015 (KBCM with 500 mm KCl, 0.015% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) and subjected to one equilibrium wash with KBCM60/0.015. Preinitiation complexes (PICs) were formed by incubating IT-VA1 with P11:0.35 + 0.6 fractions in KBCM60 without NTPs. The complexes were washed three times with KBCM100/0.015 before a final wash with KBCM60/0.015. TFIIIC-DNA and TFIIIC-TFIIIB-DNA complexes were formed by incubating IT-VA1 with the P11:0.6 fraction alone or in the presence of the DEAE:0.15 fraction, respectively, in KBCM60. Washing conditions for these complexes were the same as for immobilized PICs. All of the binding reactions were carried out for 29 min at 30 °C, and immobilized complexes were transferred to fresh tubes after the first wash. BSA (0.1 mg/ml, RNase and DNase-free; GE Healthcare) carrier protein was included in all reactions in which preformed complexes were used. After binding reactions were complete, immobilized complexes were resuspended in KBCM60. As indicated in individual experiments, the reactions were supplemented with various concentrations of Maf1, BSA, or poly(dA-dT), and preincubations were allowed to proceed as described in the figure legends and text. When appropriate, Sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 0.05%. For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, the DEAE:0.15 fraction was preincubated with Maf1 or Y for 10 min at room temperature before addition to the IT-VA1-bound TFIIIC. In the corresponding control reaction, IT-VA1 was preincubated with Maf1 or BSA and washed as described for the immobilized PICs. Where indicated, the reactions were supplemented with the RNA pol III DEAE:1.0 fraction. Transcription was initiated with complete set of nucleotides (NTPs) along with [α-32P]CTP. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for the times indicated and then processed as described above. Human Maf1 Differentially Inhibits Transcription from Unassembled and Preassembled PICs—In vitro studies have shown that the addition of recombinant Maf1 to yeast and human cell-free systems represses RNA pol III transcription (22Desai N. Lee J. Upadhya R. Chu Y. Moir R.D. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6455-6462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Reina J.H. Azzouz T.N. Hernandez N.

Biol. 2008; 378: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To investigate the biochemical mechanism of repression by Maf1 in a human in vitro system, we initially used a yeast tRNALeu3 gene template (type 2 promoter) that is efficiently transcribed in a HeLa cell extract (32Standring D.N. Venegas A. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5963-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Full-length human Maf1 was expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Increasing amounts of this preparation were first assayed to determine its ability to inhibit RNA pol III transcription prior to the formation of a PIC (defined here as a promoter-bound complex of TFIIIC, TFIIIB, and pol III). When added to a HeLa nuclear extract before the template (Fig. 1A), the Maf1 protein efficiently inhibited transcription in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). Repression activity was specific to Maf1 because at the upper end of the titration, an equivalent amount of nuclease-free BSA had no effect on transcription (Fig. 1B, lane 7). We then used an amount of Maf1 that maximally inhibited transcription under these conditions (Fig. 1C; 0.5 μg) to test whether the formation of a PIC prior to Maf1 addition would affect the efficiency of repression. PICs were assembled under equilibrium conditions during a 30-min incubation of the nuclear extract with the template DNA (Fig. 1D). Maf1 was then added (or not) followed by nucleotides to initiate transcription and the reactions were stopped at various times over a 60-min time course. In contrast to the absolute effect of Maf1 on transcription before PIC assembly (Fig. 1B), Maf1 addition after PIC assembly reduced but did not abolish transcription (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 5–8 with lanes 1–4). To determine the number of transcription cycles occurring under these conditions, we performed the same experiment in the presence of the nonionic detergent Sarkosyl. Sarkosyl at a final concentration of 0.05% has been found to selectively inhibit the reassembly of PICs and reinitiation of transcription when it is added prior to the initiating nucleotides. Thus, these conditions allow only a single round (SR) of transcription (33Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 646-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By titrating the amount of Sarkosyl in our reactions, we confirmed that a concentration of 0.05% was sufficient to limit transcription consistent with a single inititation event for each functional PIC (supplemental Fig. S1). In prolonged incubations, the absolute level of transcription remained essentially constant in the presence of 0.05% Sarkosyl (Fig. 1E, lanes 9–12). This defines the SR transcription value. Accordingly, multiple round (MR) reactions generated 24 and 33 cycles of transcription after 35 and 60 min, respectively, at a rate of ∼1 transcript every 90–110 s (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the reduced absolute level of transcription in reactions containing Maf1 (to ∼20% of the untreated control; Fig. 1E) resulted in only six cycles of transcription after 60 min (Fig. 1F). This may reflect an ability of Maf1 to decrease the overall rate of the transcription cycle on functional PICs. Alternatively, it could reflect some heterogeneity in the reactions with respect to the inhibition of transcription by Maf1. For example, the reassembly of PICs involving RNA pol III molecules in solution might be differentially sensitive to Maf1 relative to reinitiation by polymerase molecules that remain bound to the template following termination (i.e. facilitated recycling). We note however that although facilitated recycling is well established in yeast in vitro systems (5Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it has not been reported in a mammalian system. Facilitated Reinitiation of Transcription by Human RNA pol III on an Immobilized VA1 RNA Gene—To determine whether human RNA pol III is capable of facilitated recycling and to examine the effect of Maf1 on transcription of PICs, we developed an immobilized template transcription system. A linear VA1 promoter DNA fragment was generated by PCR using a biotinylated upstream oligonucleotide primer and immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (IT-VA1). HeLa nuclear extract was fractionated on Phosphocellulose P11 to obtain fractions containing TFIIIB + pol III (P11:0.35) and TFIIIC (P11:0.6) that are able to actively transcribe the VA1 gene when combined (29Segall J. Matsui T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11986-11991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these fractions are devoid of contaminating nucleotides, which is a prerequisite for stalling RNA pol III downstream of the transcription start site. Using the P11:0.35 + 0.6 fractions and ATP, GTP, and CTP but not UTP, we verified that transcription arrests after synthesis of the first six nucleotides on the VA1 template (data not shown). Two preliminary experiments were performed prior to analyzing the effect of Maf1 on transcription from purified stalled TCs. In the first, Maf1 was preincubated with the P11:0.35 + 0.6 fractions to determine its ability to repress reconstituted transcription from the immobilized VA1 template (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the experiment shown in Fig. 1B, IT-VA1 transcription was specifically and completely inhibited by Maf1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). In the second experiment, we determined the ability of a nonspecific competitor DNA, poly(dA-dT), to sequester nonassembled transcription factors and polymerase, thereby preventing them from binding to the promoter. Inclusion of poly(dA-dT) into the P11:0.35 + 0.6 fractions before IT-VA1 addition (Fig. 2A) completely abolis"

Previously, we identified caspase 8 as an effector of migration, promoting motility in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation on Tyr-380 by Src family kinases and its subsequent association with Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. Here we demonstrate the regulation of the small GTPase Rab5, which mediates early endosome formation, homotypic fusion, and maturation by caspase 8. Regulation requires the Tyr-380 phosphorylation site but not caspase proteolytic activity. Tyr-380 is essential for interaction with the Src homology 2 domains of p85α, a multifunctional adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, that possesses Rab-GAP activity. Interaction between caspase 8 and p85α promotes Rab5 GTP loading, alters endosomal trafficking, and results in the accumulation of Rab5-positive endosomes at the edge of the cell. Conversely, caspase 8-dependent GTP loading of Rab5 is overcome by increased expression of p85α in a Rab-GAP-dependent manner. Thus, we demonstrate a novel function for caspase 8 as a modulator of p85α Rab-GAP activity and endosomal trafficking.

Helfer B. Frisch S.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rab5 was recently shown to regulate cell motility, acting in concert with Rac activation at the leading edge of the cells (23Palamidessi A. Frittoli E. Garre M. Faretta M. Mione M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3239-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As caspase 8 was previously shown to associate with peripheral endosomes, we speculated that caspase 8 might influence Rab function. Here we show that caspase 8 influences the organization of Rab5-containing early endosomes via association with, and sequestration of p85α. This promotes Rab5 GTP loading, inhibits endosomal maturation, and promotes accumulation of Rab5-positive endosomes at the edge of the cell. The caspase 8-dependent GTP loading of Rab5 can be overcome by increasing the expression of p85α but requires the phosphotyrosine binding activity of the SH2 domains as well as the Rab-GAP activity within the BH domain of p85α. Thus, we reveal a new function for caspase 8 as a regulator of p85α Rab-GAP activity and endosomal trafficking.

Schmid, the Scripps Research Institute) into pcDNA3.1(+) by PCR using the primers 5′-cgggatccatggctaatcgaggagcaaca-3′ and 5′-cccgcggccgcttagttactacaacactgact-3′ and the restriction sites BamHI/NotI. The previously described “Rab5 binding domain” comprising the last 73 amino acids of Rabaptin-5 (residues 789–862) was obtained by PCR using human Rabaptin5 cloned into pCMV-SPORT6 (Invitrogen) as a template and the primers 5′-cccgcggccgctcatgtctcaggaagctggt-3′and 5′-cggtcgacaagctaaggctaccgttgaaca-3′. The PCR product was digested and ligated into pGEX-6P1 (GE Healthcare) by using the restriction sites SalI/NotI. Human caspase 8 was available in the pcDNA3.1(+) and pEGFP-N2 vectors, as previously described (13Barbero S. Barila D. Mielgo A. Stagni V. Clair K. Stupack D. J. Biol.

Bovine FLAG-tagged wild type p85α, p85α/R274A (mutant defective for Rab-GAP activity), and p85α/R368A/R649A (double mutant ΔR, defective in both SH2 domains via point mutations) were previously described (8Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48607-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown for 24 h on glass coverslips and subjected or not to treatment as indicated. After rinsing with PBS, cells were fixed in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (5 min), and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS (30 min) at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with either monoclonal anti-Rab5 IgG (1:50), polyclonal anti-Rab7 IgG (1:50), polyclonal anti-M6PR IgG (1:50), or polyclonal anti-EEA1 (1:250) primary antibodies followed by incubation with the respective Alexa Fluor® conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250). Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO®-3 (1:500). Samples were then washed and mounted onto slides with the Vectashield Hard-Set mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, VT) and visualized on a Nikon Eclipse C1 confocal microscope with a 1.4 NA 60× oil immersion lens using minimum pinhole (30 μm). Images were captured using EZ-C1 3.50 imaging software and analyzed using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. Image Analysis; Measurement of the Incidence of Cells with Peripheral Rab5—Pictures were randomly chosen, and cells were comparatively defined as “positive for periphery Rab5 staining” or “negative for periphery Rab5 staining” based on the high or low relative staining for Rab5 at cell periphery. Then the percentage of “positive cells” was calculated with respect to the total cell number. Total cell number was counted by nuclear staining (ToPRO3). For quantification of peripheral Rab5, pictures were randomly chosen, and round-shaped cells were picked for individual analysis. Cell periphery was defined as the area between the cell surface and 2–3 μm beneath (in cells ranging between 20 and 25 μm in diameter). This area corresponds to the ∼25% outer layer of the cell. Relative levels of Rab5 were calculated within this area by using the “Radial Profile Plugin” of the ImageJ software. A total of six cells per picture, five pictures per experiment in a total of three independent experiments was analyzed. For analysis, the red channel (Rab5 staining) was adjusted to a window/level of 160 pixels, and then a radial profile was drawn around the cell (outer circle). The integrated density of pixels was measured within this outer circle. Thereafter, a second radial profile (inner circle) was drawn with a radius of 3/4 of the outer circle. The integrated density of pixels was measured within this inner circle. Finally, an arbitrary estimation of the percentage of peripheral Rab5 was calculated as % peripheral Rab5 = 100 - (no. of pixels inner circle/no. of pixels outer circle). Co-localization Analysis—ImageJ software was used for analysis. First, both red and green channels to be analyzed were adjusted to a window/level of 160 pixels, and the integrated intensity of pixels for each channel was measured. Thereafter, the integrated intensity of pixels co-localized was measured by using the “Co-localization RGB Plugin” of ImageJ. Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitors, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% acrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad) by loading 25 μg of total protein per lane and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 5% milk in 0.1% Tween, PBS and then probed with anti-actin (1:5000), anti-Rab5 (1:500), anti-Rab7 (1:300), anti-EEA1 (1:1000), or anti-M6PR (1:2500) antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system. Transient Transfections—Cells were grown for 24 h in complete medium at 50–70% confluence. Transfections were performed with 10 μg of the indicated plasmids by using the FuGENE® system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Post-transfection, extracts were obtained and subjected to either immunoprecipitation or pulldown analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. Supernatants obtained after centrifugation (13,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) were used for immunoprecipitation assays (500 μg of total protein per assay) with protein A/G beads-immobilized antibody. Caspase 8 was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-caspase 8. The immunoprecipitated samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as indicated above. GTP-loaded Rab5 Pulldown Assay—The Rab5 pulldown assay was performed as previously described (27Brown T.C. Tran I.C. Backos D.S. Esteban J.A. Neuron. 2005; 45: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Liu J. Lamb D. Chou M.M. Liu Y.J. Li G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with some modifications. After treatment, cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Extracts were incubated by 5 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C). Post-nuclear supernatants were used immediately for pulldown assays by adding 150 μg of precoated beads. GSH beads were precoated with 100 μg of GST-R5BD by 1 h at 4 °C. Pulldown incubations were carried out by 15 min in a rotating shaker at 4 °C. Thereafter, beads were collected and washed 3 times with lysis buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as indicated above. Endosome Fractionation in Sucrose Gradients—Endosome fractionation and HRP uptake assays were performed as previously described (29Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 30Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 15-cm plates for 24 h in complete medium. Cell monolayers were washed in PBS and incubated at 37 °C with 5 ml of 2 mg/ml HRP in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (internalization medium), at the indicated times. Incubations were stopped on ice by washing cells thoroughly with PBS at 4 °C. Cells were scraped, collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min in a Sorvall RT 6000D centrifuge. Cells were then washed with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, centrifuged at 1700 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and finally resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors and homogenized by 8 passages through a 22½-gauge needle in a 1-ml syringe (BD Biosciences). Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifuging homogenates 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C in a bench Eppendorf centrifuge. The post-nuclear supernatants (PNS) was brought to 40.6% sucrose by mixing 400 μl of PNS with 600 μl of 60% sucrose in homogenization buffer buffer. A gradient was prepared by overlaying 1 ml of homogenate, 40.6% sucrose, 2 ml of 35% sucrose, 1.5 ml of 30% sucrose, 400 μl homogenization buffer (8% sucrose) in a SW55Ti centrifuge tube. The gradient was centrifuged at 36,000 rpm (125,000 × g) for 66 min at 4 °C in a Beckman L7–65 ultracentrifuge. Endosome fractions were collected as follows; early endosomes at the 30/35% sucrose interface and late endosomes at the 8/30% sucrose interface. For protein screening, 45 μl of each fraction was mixed with sample buffer and loaded onto 10% acrylamide minigels. To measure the relative amount of endocytosed HRP and the distribution in endosome fractions, 2–10 μl of each fraction was incubated with 2,2′ azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma) and read at 405 nm according to the manufacturer's protocol. LDL and Transferrin Internalization and Recycling Assays—NB7 and NB7C8 cells were grown at confluence in complete medium for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were detached with trypsin, centrifuged, re-suspended with 0.2% BSA in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (internalization medium), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For internalization experiments, 250 μl of aliquots of cell suspensions (5 × 105 cells) were placed in 1000-μl test tubes. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended with 0.2% BSA in internalization medium containing either 30 μg/μl Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled transferrin or 5 μg/μl BODIPY® FL LDL at 4 °C. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C and stopped on ice at different time points as indicated. Thereafter, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and resuspended with 2% BSA in PBS. For recycling experiments, cells were incubated with 30 μg/μl of Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled transferrin as indicated above for 15 min. Then samples were immediately placed in ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, re-suspended with 0.2% BSA in internalization medium, and incubated at different times at 37 °C. Cells were then collected, washed, and fixed as indicated above. Samples were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur) using the CellQuest Pro® software. Statistical Analysis—Where pertinent, results were compared using unpaired t tests of at least three independent experiments or as indicated. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Caspase 8 Induces Accumulation of Rab5 Endosomes at Cell Periphery—Emerging evidence suggests that caspase 8 influences cellular adhesion and migration (22Frisch S.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4491-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) likely via activation of Rac at the cell periphery (15Helfer B. Boswell B.C. Finlay D. Cipres A. Vuori K. Bong Kang T.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rac function is spatially regulated by the endocytic protein Rab5 during cell migration (23Palamidessi A. Frittoli E. Garre M. Faretta M. Mione M. Testa I. Diaspro A. Lanzetti L. Scita G. Di Fiore P.P. Cell. 2008; 134: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To explore this potential link between caspase 8 and endocytic machinery, we first evaluated the cellular distribution of several endocytic markers in cells expressing or deficient for caspase 8. To this end we used the previously reported neuroblastoma cells NB7, which lack endogenous caspase 8 and those stably reconstituted for “physiological” levels of caspase 8 (i.e. higher expression than NB5 but lower than NB16) (19Stupack D.G. Teitz T. Potter M.D. Mikolon D. Houghton P.J. Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Cheresh D.A. Nature. 2006; 439: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Teitz T. Wei T. Valentine M.B. Vanin E.F. Grenet J. Valentine V.A. Behm F.G. Look A.T. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). We assessed the distribution of early endosomal markers (EEA1 and Rab5) and late endosomal or lysosomal proteins (Rab7 and the cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor (M6PR)) in this model. Interestingly, the localization of Rab5 differed in cells expressing caspase 8 relative to caspase 8-deficient cells, with accumulation of Rab5 in the cell periphery (Fig. 1A). This altered distribution was selective to Rab5, with no changes in expression or distribution of EEA1, Rab7, and M6PR (data not shown), suggesting that at physiological levels of expression caspase 8 did not influence all aspects of the endocytic pathway. We were unable to determine whether overexpression of caspase 8 could further augment this effect or could induce changes to secondary endosomal pathways, as overexpression of caspase 8 induces apoptosis (data not shown). In neuroblastoma cells lacking caspase 8, Rab5 was homogenously distributed throughout the cell body, with a minor accumulation at the cell periphery (Fig. 1, A and B). The accumulation of Rab5 at the cell periphery was dependent upon expression of caspase 8, as suppression of caspase 8 with short hairpin RNA ablated the accumulation of Rab5 in the periphery (Fig. 1C). To further evaluate the extent of Rab5 accumulated at the cell periphery, we measured the relative levels of Rab5 within the area located within a distance of 2–3 μm of peripheral edge of the cell (this distance represents ∼25% of the cell; supplemental Fig. 1). As expected, a 2-fold increase of peripheral Rab5 was associated to expression of caspase 8 (Fig. 1C). These observations were confirmed in parallel studies expressing GFP-tagged caspase 8 in NB7 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Overall co-localization of Rab5 with early (EEA1) or late endocytic proteins (Rab7, M6PR) was not generally affected by expression of caspase 8 (supplemental Fig. 2), confirming Rab5 as a specific target. To extend these observations we also used A549 carcinoma cells in which endogenous caspase 8 was silenced (Fig. 1D). In agreement with the previous results, caspase 8 expression was associated with peripheral accumulation of Rab5, whereas loss of caspase 8 promoted a more homogenous distribution throughout the cell (Fig. 1E). The peripheral accumulation of Rab5 did not result from protein stabilization, as no significant differences in Rab5 protein levels were associated with caspase 8 expression (supplemental Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that caspase 8 influences localization of Rab5 endosomes within the cell. Importantly, most Rab5 (∼95%) was found associated to membrane fractions, as revealed by subcellular fractionation (data not shown). These observations agree with previous reports (31Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Only a slight variation in membrane-associated Rab5 was detected in caspase 8-expressing cells (93 or 97% total Rab5 was found associated to membranes in cells lacking or expressing caspase 8, respectively). Because most Rab5 is membrane-associated regardless the caspase 8 status, it would appear that relevant changes are in subcellular distribution of membrane-associated Rab5. The possibility that caspase 8 affects Rab5 shuttling between different early endosome populations or between early endosomes and the plasma membrane is unexpected and potentially important. Caspase 8 Alters the Targeting of Cargo from Early to Late Endosomes—Because Rab5 is involved in trafficking of cargo from the plasma membrane to early and sorting endosomes (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether caspase 8-mediated re-distribution of Rab5 influenced this process by tracking the accumulation of fluid-phase HRP in early and late endosomes. Analysis of purified endosome fractions (supplemental Fig. 4) revealed that the accumulation of HRP in late endosomes was substantially decreased in caspase 8-expressing neuroblastoma cells compared with caspase 8-deficient controls (Fig. 2A, left panel). Because substantial accumulation of HRP in late endosomes is observed only after 10–15 min of internalization (data not shown), we assayed late endosomes at 30 min internalization. Similar trends were obtained after 10 min of internalization, although variation was higher (Fig. 2A and data not shown)"
https://openalex.org/W1975169812,"IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the pivotal step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. Here we show that both IMPDH type 1 (IMPDH1) and IMPDH type 2 are associated with polyribosomes, suggesting that these housekeeping proteins have an unanticipated role in translation regulation. This interaction is mediated by the subdomain, a region of disputed function that is the site of mutations that cause retinal degeneration. The retinal isoforms of IMPDH1 also associate with polyribosomes. The most common disease-causing mutation, D226N, disrupts the polyribosome association of at least one retinal IMPDH1 isoform. Finally, we find that IMPDH1 is associated with polyribosomes containing rhodopsin mRNA. Because any perturbation of rhodopsin expression can trigger apoptosis in photoreceptor cells, these observations suggest a likely pathological mechanism for IMPDH1-mediated hereditary blindness. We propose that IMPDH coordinates the translation of a set of mRNAs, perhaps by modulating localization or degradation.

Nakamura H. Natsumeda Y. Szekeres T. Nagai M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homotetramer; each monomer is composed of a catalytic (β/α)8 barrel and a subdomain containing two CBS domains (named for the related domain in cystathionine β-synthase) (Fig. 1). Deletion of the subdomain has no effect on enzymatic activity (2Nimmesgern E. Black J. Futer O. Fulghum J.R. Chambers S.P. Brummel C.L. Raybuck S.A.

Notably, the CBS domains of IMPDH share little sequence identity with the other proteins, so it would not be surprising if their function has diverged. The subdomain does appear to coordinately regulate the adenine and guanine nucleotide pool in Escherichia coli, although the molecular mechanism of this process has not yet been elucidated (11Pimkin M. Markham G.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 342-359Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have discovered that IMPDH binds single-stranded nucleic acids and that the subdomain mediates this interaction (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem.

J. 2004; 379: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IMPDH associates with RNA in tissue culture cells, which suggests that this housekeeping enzyme is involved in translation, splicing, or some other feature of RNA metabolism (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15McLean J.E. Hamaguchi N. Belenky P. Mortimer S.E. Stanton M. Hedstrom L. Biochem.

Kajiwara T. Hatano S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Cornuel J.F. Moraillon A. Gueron M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that IMPDH has a “moonlighting” function involving nucleic acid that is mediated by the subdomain.Mammals have two IMPDH genes, encoding IMPDH1 and IMPDH2, and most tissues express both isozymes (18Jain J.

Life Sci. 1994; 54: 1917-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, only IMPDH1 appears to be expressed in the retina; in addition, retina contains distinct IMPDH1 isoforms generated by alternative mRNA splicing as follows: IMPDH1(546) (major) and IMPDH1(595) (minor) (Fig. 1; these proteins are also known as IMPDH1α/IMPDH1(13b) and IMPDHγ/IMPDH1(A+13b), respectively; the canonical enzyme is hereafter designated IMPDH1(514) (20Bowne S.J.

Both retinal isoforms IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595) contain a 32-residue C-terminal extension. IMPDH1(595) has an additional 49-residue extension on the N terminus (20Bowne S.J. Liu Q. Sullivan L.S.

This observation suggests that the C-terminal extension blocks the nucleic acid-binding site, perhaps by interacting with the subdomain (22Xu D. Cobb G.C. Spellicy C.J. Bowne S.J. Daiger S.P. Hedstrom L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 472: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Retinal cells may contain additional protein factors that interact with the C-terminal extension to regulate nucleic acid binding.Most intriguingly, mutations in the subdomain and the neighboring region of the barrel domain of IMPDH1 cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) and are also associated with a more severe hereditary blindness, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) (23Bowne S.J.

Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Zhu J. Spellicy C.J. Gire A.I. Hughbanks-Wheaton D. Birch D.G. Lewis R.A. Heckenlively J.R. Daiger S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The presence of the retinal isoforms may account for the tissue specificity of disease. Nonetheless, the underlying pathological mechanism of IMPDH1-mediated retinal disease remains perplexing. Guanine nucleotides are critical components of photoreceptor signaling, so it is tempting to attribute disease to loss of enzymatic activity and the consequential decrease in guanine nucleotides. However, several observations suggest that this mechanism does not apply. First, the RP-linked mutations have no effect on the enzymatic activity of the canonical IMPDH1(514) or the retinal isoforms in vitro (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Xu D. Cobb G.C. Spellicy C.J. Bowne S.J. Daiger S.P. Hedstrom L. Arch. Biochem.

Mitchell B.S. Farrar G.J. Humphries P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with a heterozygous null allele in IMPDH1 have no phenotype, and homozygous null mice display only a mild retinopathy (29Aherne A. Kennan A. Kenna P.F. McNally N. Lloyd D.G. Alberts I.L. Kiang A.S. Humphries M.M. Ayuso C. Engel P.C. Gu J.J. Mitchell B.S. Farrar G.J. Humphries P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, IMPDH inhibitors are widely used in immunosuppressive chemotherapy (e.g. CellCept), yet side effects involving retinal degeneration have not been reported. Others have proposed that these mutations increase the propensity of IMPDH1 to form aggregates (29Aherne A. Kennan A. Kenna P.F. McNally N. Lloyd D.G. Alberts I.L. Kiang A.S. Humphries M.M. Ayuso C. Engel P.C. Gu J.J. Mitchell B.S. Farrar G.J. Humphries P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but we have not found this to be true in our constructs (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Instead, we find that RP-causing mutations decrease the affinity and specificity of nucleic acid binding in the canonical IMPDH1(514), suggesting that perturbation of this function underlies retinal disease (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Bowne S.J. Sullivan L.S. Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Zhu J. Spellicy C.J. Gire A.I. Hughbanks-Wheaton D. Birch D.G. Lewis R.A. Heckenlively J.R. Daiger S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Here we show that IMPDH1 and the retinal isoforms associate with polyribosomes and that this interaction is mediated by the subdomain. The most commonly occurring adRP-causing mutation, D226N, blocks the polyribosome association of IMPDH1(595). Furthermore, we find that IMPDH is associated with polyribosomes translating rhodopsin mRNA in bovine retina. Because essentially any perturbation of rhodopsin expression triggers apoptosis in photoreceptor cells (31Mendes H.F. van der Spuy J. Chapple J.P. Cheetham M.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), the misregulation of polyribosomes translating rhodopsin provides an attractive mechanism for retinal disease. These observations indicate that IMPDH has a previously unsuspected role in the regulation of translation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Superfect was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Anti-GFP affinity-purified antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-CBP80 antibody was a gift of the Dr. Melissa J. Moore (Brandeis University), and anti-rhodopsin antibody 1D4 was the generous gift of Dr. Daniel Oprian (Brandeis University). Puromycin was purchased from Sigma. Anti-IMPDH BRD5 antibodies were obtained as described previously (20Bowne S.J. Liu Q. Sullivan L.S. Zhu J. Spellicy C.J. Rickman C.B. Pierce E.A. Daiger S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 3754-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The full-length rhodopsin cDNA was synthesized by Epoch Biolabs (Sugar Land, TX) following the sequence of Entrez data base NM_000539 and cloned into a plasmid under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter.Polyribosome Analysis of IMPDH—Polyribosome profiles were performed with minor modifications of standard protocols (32Nott A. Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 33Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). C-terminal EGFP-tagged IMPDH1 was expressed in mammalian cells under control of the mammalian cytomegalovirus promoter as described previously (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and lysed on ice with polyribosome extraction buffer (PEB, 0.5% Triton X-100, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 15 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1 mg/ml heparin). The clarified lysate was fractionated on a 10–50% sucrose gradient, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were probed with anti-GFP antibody or anti-IMPDH serum and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. When indicated, 100 μg/ml puromycin was added to cultures 2 h before harvesting. For RNase disruption of polyribosomes, lysates were treated with 60 units/ml micrococcal nuclease and 1 mm CaCl2 for 25 min on ice prior to loading on sucrose gradients. Data are representative of at least two individual experiments.Polyribosome Association of Retinal IMPDH1 Isoforms—Plasmids expressing IMPDH1(546)-GFP and IMPDH1(595)-GFP were expressed in HEK293 cells as described previously (22Xu D. Cobb G.C. Spellicy C.J. Bowne S.J. Daiger S.P. Hedstrom L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 472: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Polyribosomes were harvested by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. The pellets were dissolved by PEB and analyzed by Western blot analysis with the primary mouse monoclonal anti-IMPDH antibody AS37-P (Antibody Solutions, Mountain View, CA). Immunodetection was performed using goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Millipore) and visualized with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences).Identification of IMPDH-associated mRNAs—Five bovine retinas were lysed in PEB and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min, and then cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to Sepharose CL-B column with bed volume of 110 ml. Fractions in the void volume were collected and loaded onto IMP-agarose. IMPDH was eluted with 2 mm IMP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared using Super SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) and cloned into Topo cloning kit (Invitrogen).IMPDH Is Associated with Polyribosomes Containing Rhodopsin mRNA—Approximately 10 g of bovine retina was lysed as described above within 3 h of harvest. Polyribosomes were isolated by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion in PEB. The polyribosomes were resuspended in 1 ml of PEB. Polyribosome mixture (250 ml) was treated with monoclonal antibody RET-P1 (Abcam), which recognizes the rhodopsin N-terminal peptide, or 1D4, which recognizes the opsin C-terminal peptide. Antibody complexes were isolated with protein G Dynabeads and polyribosomes, and the bound proteins were recovered by treatment with 10% SDS. Alternatively, polyribosomes were disrupted by treatment with 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl. The eluted protein was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting visualized with anti-IMPDH antibody or anti-ribosomal protein L7a antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA).Co-immunoprecipitation of IMPDH1(546) and Rhodopsin mRNA—HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids directing expression of rhodopsin and IMPDH(546)-GFP (Transfectin, Bio-Rad). Cells were collected 48 h after transfection, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in PEB. Immunoprecipitation was performed as in Ref. 34Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar. Briefly, magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) coated with anti-GFP antibody were mixed with clarified cell lysate in NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with 200 units of RNase Inhibitor (New England Biolabs), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 mm EDTA. Following precipitation, RNA was recovered with TRIzol LS and DNase-treated (RQ1, Promega) according to manufacturer protocols. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using SuperScriptII One-step kit (Invitrogen) with primers for rhodopsin (5′-ccccatcaacttcctcacgctctac-3′ and 5′-cgatgaccatgatgatgaccatgc-3′).RESULTSIMPDH Associates with Polyribosomes—The co-precipitation of RNA with IMPDH suggested that IMPDH might be involved in translation or translation regulation (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether IMPDH associates with polyribosomes, lysates were prepared from cycloheximide-treated HeLa cells and fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation; polyribosome-containing fractions were identified by monitoring absorbance at 254 nm (Fig. 2). When purified recombinant IMPDH1(514) is subjected to sucrose gradient sedimentation, the protein migrates in the lower density fractions, as expected for the homotetramer. Also as expected, the 80-kDa cap-binding protein (CBP80) was observed in the cytosolic, ribosomal subunits and monosome-containing fractions, but was excluded from higher density fractions (Fig. 2) (35Chiu S.Y. Lejeune F. Ranganathan A.C. Maquat L.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unlike CBP80, endogenous IMPDH is found throughout the gradient. These observations indicate that endogenous IMPDH is part of a large complex. Puromycin terminates nascent peptide chains and disrupts polyribosomes (Fig. 2) (36Blobel G. Sabatini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and puromycin also disrupts the IMPDH complex (Fig. 2). Similarly, EDTA and RNase treatment disrupt both polyribosomes and the endogenous IMPDH complex (data not shown). Although the anti-IMPDH antisera does not distinguish between IMPDH isozymes, IMPDH2 predominates in HeLa cells (37Amit I. Citri A. Shay T. Lu Y. Katz M. Zhang F. Tarcic G. Siwak D. Lahad J. Jacob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Vaisman N. Segal E. Rechavi G. Alon U. Mills G.B. Domany E. Yarden Y. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 38Carson J.P. Zhang N. Frampton G.M. Gerry N.P. Lenburg M.E. Christman M.F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2096-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, IMPDH2, and possibly IMPDH1, associates with polyribosomes in HeLa cells.FIGURE 2Polyribosome profiles of HeLa cell extracts. Lysates were prepared and fractionated on a sucrose gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A typical profile is shown, with the corresponding Western blot with anti-IMPDH antisera immediately below. For the remaining panels, fractions were obtained similarly, and Western blots were probed with antibody against the designated protein. Puromycin disrupts both polyribosomes and the high molecular weight IMPDH complex. A single blot was split and probed with anti-CBP80 antibody and anti-IMPDH antisera. CBP80 is found in the cytosolic ribosomal subunits and monosome-containing fractions, but excluded from higher density fractions, whereas IMPDH is found throughout the gradient. The bottom panel shows the sedimentation of purified recombinant (r) IMPDH1(514).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subdomain Mediates the Association of IMPDH1(514) with Polyribosomes—To demonstrate that IMPDH1(514) associates with polyribosomes, we expressed a C-terminally EGFP-tagged version in HeLa cells. We have previously shown that the EGFP tag has no effect on the enzymatic or nucleic acid binding properties of IMPDH1(514) (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and we have also established conditions where IMPDH1-GFP is expressed at approximately the same levels as the endogenous IMPDH (10Mortimer S.E. Hedstrom L. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). IMPDH1-GFP is also found in the polyribosome-containing fractions of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3A), whereas GFP migrates in the cytosolic fractions. As above, treatment with puromycin and RNase disrupts the IMPDH1-GFP complex, indicating the IMPDH1-GFP associates with polyribosomes (Fig. 3, B and C). Deletion of the subdomain substantially decreases the fraction of IMPDH1-GFP found in the polyribosomes (Fig. 3D), indicating that the CBS domains mediate the polyribosome interaction. This observation suggests that the RP-linked mutations of IMPDH1 may perturb the polyribosome interaction. The most common RP-linked mutation, D226N, does not change the polyribosome distribution of IMPDH1-GFP. However, this assay would be unable to detect a subtle change in polyribosome distribution.FIGURE 3The association of IMPDH with polyribosomes is mediated by the subdomain. HeLa cells were transfected to express wild-type (WT) IMPDH1(514) tagged with EGFP at the C terminus (IMPDH1-GFP, WT) or IMPDH lacking subdomain (ΔSD-IMPDH1-GFP, ΔSD). Lysates were prepared, and fractions were aliquoted as described in Fig. 2 and probed with antibodies against GFP. A, IMPDH1-GFP; B, IMPDH1-GFP + puromycin; C, IMPDH1-GFP + RNase; D, GFP alone, ΔSD-IMPDH1-GFP, IMPDH1-GFP/D226N, and wild type. The IMPDH1-GFP/D226N and WT are from parallel transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IMPDH Interacts with Polyribosomes in Retinal Cells—The C-terminal extensions of IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595) appear to block nucleic acid binding in vitro (22Xu D.

Biophys. 2008; 472: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that the retinal isoforms might not associate with polyribosomes. To determine whether IMPDH1(546) and/or IMPDH1(595) interacts with polyribosomes in photoreceptor cells, we prepared lysates from freshly dissected bovine retina. These lysates contain 55- and 64-kDa proteins that cross-react with anti-IMPDH antibodies (Fig. 4); and as reported previously (21Spellicy C.J. Daiger S.P. Sullivan L.S. Zhu J. Liu Q. Pierce E.A. Bowne S.J. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 1866-1872PubMed Google Scholar), the 64-kDa protein, but not the 55-kDa protein, also reacts with antibody against the N-terminal extension of IMPDH1(595) (data not shown), indicating that these proteins are the bovine orthologs of IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595). Both bovine IMPDH1 isoforms are found in the polyribosome containing fractions, and RNase disrupts this association (Fig. 4). Thus, both IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595) associate with polyribosomes despite the fact that these proteins are poor nucleic acid-binding proteins in vitro. These observations suggest that photoreceptors may contain additional proteins that interact with C-terminal extension to regulate polyribosome association.FIGURE 4The retinal isoforms IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595) associate with polyribosomes in bovine retinal cells.

In view of their superior catalytic activity, the VL domain IgVs may help attain clearance of medically important antigens more efficiently than natural Igs. The antigen-combining sites of immunoglobulins found in higher organisms are composed of the variable domains of light and heavy chain subunits (VL and VH domains). The individual VL and VH domains can bind antigens independently of each other, but the paired VL-VH structure consistently expresses superior antigen binding affinity because of cooperative antigen-binding forces contributed by the two domains (1Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Sheriff S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). High affinity Igs are generated by adaptive V domain sequence diversification over the course of B lymphocyte differentiation, a process in which antigen binding to mutated B cell receptors (surface Igs associated with signal-transducing proteins) drives the selective expansion of the cells. Adaptive Ig maturation entails the use of one each of ∼50 inherited VL and VH genes, diversification at the junctions of the VL-DL gene segments and VH-DH-JH gene segments, and somatic mutation over the entire length of the V domains. Following initial noncovalent binding of antigen, some Igs proceed to catalyze its chemical transformation. Examples of Ig-catalyzed reactions include hydrolysis of polypeptide antigens (2Paul S.

An important limitation holding back the application of catalytic Igs for clearance of undesirable antigens is that their catalytic rate constants (turnover number; kcat) are small compared with enzymes. Evidently, Ig adaptive selection is geared toward noncovalent immune complexation (the ground state stabilization step), and the ability of Igs to recognize the high energy transition state complex that must be stabilized to accelerate chemical reactions is limited. This is supported by observations that IgMs, the first and least diversified Ig class produced during B cell differentiation, express superior catalytic rate constants than IgGs produced by the cells at later stages of their adaptive differentiation (12Planque S.

The scFv scaffold mimics the physiological structure of antigen-combining sites. A minority of clones in the library are nonphysiological V domain structures generated by repertoire cloning errors. Unexpectedly, the nonphysiological two domain and single domain IgVL fragments expressed exceptional Aβ hydrolyzing efficiency. scFv-t derivatives obtained by repairing a high activity single domain IgVL displayed reduced catalytic activity. The observations suggest that novel Ig structures freed of constraints imposed by the physiological organization of V domains can be the source of efficient catalysts to medically important antigens.

Briefly, the library consists of 1.4 × 107 IgVs cloned in the phagemid vector pHEN2 prepared from the peripheral blood lymphocyte of patients with lupus. A His6 sequence and a c-myc epitope are located at the IgV C terminus. Expression levels were 1-3 mg of IgV/liter of bacterial culture, determined by anti-c-myc immunoblotting. Soluble IgVs were purified from periplasmic extracts of HB2151 cells by metal affinity chromatography. Further purification was by anion exchange FPLC (MonoQ HR 5/5 column; 0-1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm CHAPS). Purity was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. IgV phages (1012 colony-forming units) were packaged using the hyperphage method (22Rondot S. Koch J. Breitling F. Dubel S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and incubated (2 h, 37 °C) with Bt-E-Aβ40 in 0.07 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4 (PBS). Phages with bound Bt-E-Aβ40 were captured using anti-biotin antibody coupled to agarose gel (0.22 ml settled gel; Sigma) and washed with 100 ml of PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Reversibly bound phages were eluted by incubation of the gel in 0.2 ml of 100 μm Aβ40 for 1 h with slow mixing, and the residual phages covalently complexed to Bt-E-Aβ were eluted with 0.4 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7. scFv-t derivatives of single domain IgVL-t′ 5D3 were prepared by inserting the deleted VH residues 8-115 (Kabat numbering). For this, full-length VH cDNA was amplified by PCR using as template the IgV-pHEN2 DNA library and back/forward primers containing ApaLI/NotI restriction sites (respectively, GGTAGTGCACTTCAGGTGCAGCTGTTGCAGTCT/ATGTGCGGCCGCGGGGAAAAGGGTTGGGGGCATGC), and the cDNA digested with ApaLI/NotI was ligated into similarly digested plasmid IgVL-t′ 5D3 DNA with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). Full-length light chain L-t′ 5D3 was prepared by Mutagenex by a chimeragenesis method (23Ko J.K. Ma J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1273-C1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using as starting materials the VL domain of IgVL-t′ 5D3 and human κ chain constant domain (obtained from pLC-huCκ (24McLean G.R. Nakouzi A. Casadevall A. Green N.S. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) and cloned into pHEN2 vector as the NcoI/NotI-digested fragment. cDNAs for the homodimeric IgVL2-t form of clone 5D3 were prepared by PCR by Mutagenex. Briefly, VL cDNA was amplified by PCR from the IgVL-t′5D3 template using back/forward primers containing ApaLI/NotI restriction sites (respectively, AAAGTGCACTTGAAATTGTGTTGACGCAGTCTC/AAAGCGGCCGCGCGTTTGATCTCCAGCTTGGT), and the cDNA digested with ApaLI/NotI was ligated into pHEN2 vector. The nucleotide sequence of all constructs determined by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing in the 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ directions was identical (Applied Biosystems, ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer). Following electroporation of IgV phagemid DNA into HB2151 cells, soluble IgVs were purified from periplasmic extracts as before. Total protein was determined by the microBCA kit (Pierce). For mass spectroscopy (25Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), the IgV band was excised from the SDS-electrophoresis gel stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce), subjected to dehydration in 50% acetonitrile and SpeedVac drying, reduced (dithiothreitol) and alkylated (iodoacetamide), and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) and Lys-C (Wako) for 20 h at 37 °C. Following extraction of gel fragments with acetonitrile/formic acid, digested peptides obtained by ZipTip C18 (Millipore) fractionation using 5 μl of aqueous 50% acetonitrile containing 2% formic acid were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer). Predicted monoisotopic peptide mass values were obtained using MS-Fit for protein data base searches (Protein Prospector, University of California, San Francisco). IgM was purified from human sera as described (18Taguchi H. Planque S. Nishiyama Y. Symersky J. Boivin S. Szabo P. Friedland R.P. Ramsland P.A. Edmundson A.B. Weksler M.E. Paul S. J. Biol.

The 125I-Aβ40 (∼0.1 nm, ∼30,000 cpm/tube) was treated with IgVs in PBS containing 0.1 mm CHAPS and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin; intact peptide was separated from fragments by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and acid-soluble radioactivity was counted and corrected for background values in control assay tubes incubated in diluent without Ig (mean ± S.D., 18 ± 6%; n = 7 assays). This procedure affords estimates of hydrolysis concordant with RP-HPLC separation of the reaction mixtures. Apparent kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting hydrolysis rates observed at varying Aβ40 concentrations mixed with a constant amount of 125I-Aβ40 to the following equation: v = (Vmax[Aβ40])/Km + [Aβ40], where Vmax is the maximum velocity at saturating Aβ40 concentrations, and Km is the concentration at which half-maximal velocity was observed. To identify the reaction products, reaction mixtures of nonradiolabeled synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 (100 μm; American Peptide Co.) incubated with IgVs in PBS/CHAPS were desalted by gel filtration (Bio-Rad micro Bio-spin 6 columns), lyophilized, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix (positive ion mode, 20,000 V). RP-HPLC of Aβ40-Ig reaction mixtures and ESI-MS identification of the product have been described previously (18Taguchi H. Planque S. Nishiyama Y. Symersky J. Boivin S. Szabo P. Friedland R.P.

IgV Modeling—The two VL domains of the heterodimeric IgVL2-t 2E6 located, respectively, on the N- and C-terminal side of the linker (designated VL1 and VL2) were initially modeled as monomers by sequence alignment to the most-homologous VL domains in the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes, respectively, 1MCB and 2BX5; 85-95% sequence identity) and homology modeling with DS 1.7 (Accelrys; modeler module followed by minimization in CHARMm force field; 1000 cycles). The VL1 and VL2 structures were then refined in dimeric form using as template the light chain dimer PDB 1MCW. The flexible interdomain linker peptide and C-terminal tag region were incorporated into the model, and minor steric clashes were removed by energy minimization using CNS 1.1 (200 cycles; see Ref. 27Brunger A.T.

The VL domain of the single domain IgVL-t′ 5D3 was initially modeled in its paired VL-VH scFv-t 5D3-E6 form by the WAM server. VL models in the IgVL-t′, IgVL2-t, and full-length light chain L-t forms of the molecule were prepared by superimposing the VL domain from the WAM model to the coordinates of the homodimeric light chain crystal structure (PDB 1B6D; 85% sequence identity). The structures were submitted to steepest-descent energy minimization using the Adopted Basis-set Newton-Raphson method under the CHARMm force field (2000 cycles) until an r.m.s. deviation of 0.1 kcal/mol/Å was obtained. The quality of all structures was checked using PROCHECK. Percent VL residues in the final models located in the most favored or generous regions of the Ramachandran plot were as follows: IgVL2-t 2E6, 90.8%; IgVL-t′ 5D3, 96.5%; scFv-t 5D3-E6, 97.7%; IgVL2-t 5D3 homodimer, 95.5%; L-t 5D3, 96.9%. No unacceptable atomic collisions were detected. The van der Waals energy was negative, suggesting the absence of bad non-bonded contacts. Superimposition and determination of global r.m.s. deviation and translational Cα-Cα movements were performed using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). The feasibility of Aβ40 interactions with IgVL2-t 2E6 was assessed by molecular docking as described (18Taguchi H. Planque S. Nishiyama Y. Symersky J. Boivin S. Szabo P. Friedland R.P. Ramsland P.A.

The docked model containing VL1 domain Thr105 apposed to Aβ40 Gln15 was the energetically most favored structure. Aβ40 Hydrolyzing IgVs—We reported previously the hydrolysis of Aβ40 by polyclonal IgM purified from humans without dementia (18Taguchi H. Planque S. Nishiyama Y. Symersky J. Boivin S. Szabo P.

Here we searched for Aβ40-hydrolyzing human IgVs in a library composed of ∼107 clones. A majority of the clones in the library are scFv-t constructs with the domain organization VL-Li-VH-t, where Li denotes the 16-residue peptide SS(GGGGS)2GGSA joining the VL domain C terminus to the VH domain N terminus, and t denotes the 26-residue C-terminal peptide containing the c-myc peptide and His6 tags (7Paul S.

A minority of clones possess unusual IgV structures generated by cloning errors (see below). Sixty three IgVs purified from the periplasmic extracts of randomly picked clones by His6 binding to nickel affinity columns were tested for 125I-Aβ40 hydrolyzing activity. Two IgVs with activity markedly superior to the remaining clones were identified (Fig. 1A). The activity of the empty vector control extract (pHEN2 devoid of an IgV insert) was within the assay error range (50 cpm/h, corresponding to mean background acid soluble radioactivity + 3 S.D.). The phagemid DNA of the high activity IgV clone 2E6 was re-expressed in 15 individual bacterial colonies. All recloned colonies secreted IgV with robust 125I-Aβ40 hydrolyzing activity (Fig. 1B), ruling out trivial sample preparation variations as the cause of proteolytic activity. As before, the purified extract of the control empty vector clone did not hydrolyze 125I-Aβ40. In previous studies, electrophilic phosphonate groups incorporated within polypeptides were bound covalently by catalytic Ig nucleophilic sites, with noncovalent binding at the peptide epitopes conferring specificity to the reaction (21Nishiyama Y. Karle S. Planque S. Taguchi H. Paul S. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2707-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We employed the biotinylated Aβ40 analog containing phosphonates at Lys16 and Lys28 side chains to isolate Aβ40 catalysts displayed on phage surface (Bt-E-Aβ40; Fig. 2A). Phage IgVs treated with Bt-E-Aβ40 were captured using immobilized antibiotin antibody, and noncovalently bound phage IgVs were eluted by treatment with excess Aβ40 (designated noncovalently selected IgVs), and the irreversible phage IgV immune complexes were eluted by acid disruption of the biotin-antibiotin antibody complexes (designated covalently selected IgVs). The frequency of IgVs with robust Aβ hydrolyzing activity was increased by covalent selection (Fig. 2B). Four of 7 IgVs obtained by covalent selection at 2 μm Aβ40 hydrolyzed 125I-Aβ40 at rates >400 cpm/h, compared with 2 of 63 IgVs with this level of activity identified by random screening. Phage selections conducted at increased Aβ40 concentration (10 μm) yielded less active IgVs (Fig. 2B), consistent with the prediction of more efficient selection of catalysts at the lower ligand concentration. Eighteen IgVs recovered by noncovalent selection displayed no or little hydrolytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2026617262,"Rv3868, a conserved hypothetical protein of the ESAT-6 secretion system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is essential for the secretion of at least four virulence factors. Each protein chain is ∼63 kDa and assembles into a hexamer. Limited proteolysis demonstrates that it consists of two domains joined by a linker. The N-terminal domain is a compact, helical domain of ∼30 kDa and apparently functions to regulate the ATPase activity of the C-terminal domain and the oligomerization. The nucleotide binding site is situated in the C-terminal domain, which exhibits ATP-dependent self-association. It is also the oligomerization domain. Dynamic fluorescence quenching studies demonstrate that the domain is proximal to the C terminus in the apoprotein and exhibits a specific movement upon ATP binding. In silico modeling of the domains suggests that Arg-429 of a neighboring subunit forms a part of the binding site upon oligomerization. Mutational analysis of binding site residues demonstrates that the Arg-429 functions as the important “sensor arginine” in AAA-ATPases. Protein NMR experiments involving CFP-10 and activity assays rule out a general chaperone-like function for Rv3868. On the other hand, ATP-dependent “open-close” movements of the individual domains apparently enable it to interact and transfer energy to co-proteins in the ESX-1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2036430692,"Protein C inhibitor (PCI) is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors with many biological functions and broad inhibitory specificity. Its major targets in blood are thrombin and activated protein C (APC), and the inhibition of both enzymes can be accelerated by glycosaminoglycans, including heparin. Acceleration of thrombin and APC inhibition by PCI requires that both protease and inhibitor bind to the same heparin chain to form a bridged Michaelis complex. However, the position of the heparin binding site of APC is opposite to that of thrombin, and formation of the bridged complexes must require either radical reorientation of the proteases relative to PCI or alternate heparin binding modes for PCI. In this study, we investigate how heparin bridges thrombin and APC to PCI by determining the effect of mutations in and around the putative heparin binding site of PCI. We found that heparin binds PCI in a linear fashion along helix H to bridge thrombin, consistent with our recent crystal structure (3B9F), but that it must rotate by approximately 60 degrees to engage Arg-229 to bridge APC. To gain insight into the possible modes of heparin binding to PCI, we solved a crystal structure of cleaved PCI bound to an octasaccharide heparin fragment to 1.55 angstroms resolution. The structure reveals a binding mode across the N terminus of helix H to engage Arg-229 and align the heparin binding site of APC. A molecular model for the heparin-bridged PCI.APC complex was built based on mutagenesis and structural data."
https://openalex.org/W1976809311,"Background Protein kinase (PK) genes comprise the third largest superfamily that occupy ∼2% of the human genome. They encode regulatory enzymes that control a vast variety of cellular processes through phosphorylation of their protein substrates. Expression of PK genes is subject to complex transcriptional regulation which is not fully understood. Principal Findings Our comparative analysis demonstrates that genomic organization of regulatory PK genes differs from organization of other protein coding genes. PK genes occupy larger genomic loci, have longer introns, spacer regions, and encode larger proteins. The primary transcript length of PK genes, similar to other protein coding genes, inversely correlates with gene expression level and expression breadth, which is likely due to the necessity to reduce metabolic costs of transcription for abundant messages. On average, PK genes evolve slower than other protein coding genes. Breadth of PK expression negatively correlates with rate of non-synonymous substitutions in protein coding regions. This rate is lower for high expression and ubiquitous PKs, relative to low expression PKs, and correlates with divergence in untranslated regions. Conversely, rate of silent mutations is uniform in different PK groups, indicating that differing rates of non-synonymous substitutions reflect variations in selective pressure. Brain and testis employ a considerable number of tissue-specific PKs, indicating high complexity of phosphorylation-dependent regulatory network in these organs. There are considerable differences in genomic organization between PKs up-regulated in the testis and brain. PK genes up-regulated in the highly proliferative testicular tissue are fast evolving and small, with short introns and transcribed regions. In contrast, genes up-regulated in the minimally proliferative nervous tissue carry long introns, extended transcribed regions, and evolve slowly. Conclusions/Significance PK genomic architecture, the size of gene functional domains and evolutionary rates correlate with the pattern of gene expression. Structure and evolutionary divergence of tissue-specific PK genes is related to the proliferative activity of the tissue where these genes are predominantly expressed. Our data provide evidence that physiological requirements for transcription intensity, ubiquitous expression, and tissue-specific regulation shape gene structure and affect rates of evolution."

In the present work, we used a genetic approach in chicken DT40 B-cell lines to investigate additional elements of the Vav route, the synergisms existing among the different Vav signaling branches, and the activities exerted by wild-type and oncogenic Vav proteins in B-lymphocytes. We show here that the Vav pathway is ramified in B-lymphocytes in additional diacylglycerol-dependent signaling branches such as those involving protein kinase C, protein kinase D, and phospholipase D. By using side-by-side comparisons of the activation levels of those signal transduction pathways in inhibitor-treated and knockout DT40 cells, we show that B-cells have different requirements regarding Vav proteins for the activation of antigen receptor downstream elements. Furthermore, we have detected interpathway cross-talk at the level of the most proximal elements but not among the most distal effector molecules of the Vav route. Finally, we show that the oncogenic versions of Vav1 and RhoA can activate alternative routes that could contribute to signal amplification and diversification events in transformed lymphocytes.

The Vav family is a group of signal transduction proteins involved in tyrosine kinase-regulated pathways that has single representatives in invertebrate species and usually three members (Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3) in vertebrates. The main known function of these proteins is to work as GDP/GTP exchange factors for Rho/Rac proteins, a family of Ras-related GTPases involved in a wide variety of intracellular functions such as cytoskeletal regulation, vesicle trafficking, and cell proliferation (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 2Bustelo X.R. Sauzeau V. Berenjeno I.M. BioEssays. 2007; 29: 356-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, the enzyme activity of Vav proteins is stimulated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (3Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

However, this fine-tuned physiological regulation is lost when specific deletions or point mutations are created in the N termini of Vav proteins, leading to the generation of highly active proteins whose biochemical activities are independent of upstream signals (4Schuebel K.E.

The alteration of this regulatory cycle may be of interest for human pathologies, because it has been shown that constitutively active Vav proteins are oncogenic (4Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L.

Whereas the biological activities associated to Vav proteins in non-hematopoietic cells can by ascribed to canonical Rho/Rac-dependent effects, the signaling role of Vav proteins in lymphocytes appears to be more complex. Thus, Vav proteins can promote the downstream activation of the Ras route via the PLC 3The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CPLDphospholipase DBAPTA1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidBCRB-cell receptorDAGdiacylglycerolEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinErkextracellular regulated kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMEKMAPK/Erk kinaseNF-ATnuclear factor of activated T-cellsPI3Kphosphatidylinositol-3 kinasePKBprotein kinase BPKCprotein kinase CPKDprotein kinase DPMAphorbol myristate acetateRasGRP1Ras GDP releasing protein 1HAhemagglutinin -γ-dependent activation of RasGRP1, a DAG-regulated Ras protein activator (15Caloca M.J.

Vav proteins are also involved in the stimulation of PI3K and of NF-AT in lymphocytes (18Vigorito E. Bardi G. Glassford J. Lam E.W. Clayton E. Turner M. J.

Finally, it has been shown that Vav proteins can bind to a number of signal transduction proteins via physical interactions (22Bustelo X.R.

Pages. 2008; DOI: 10.1038/mp.a002362.002301Google Scholar), suggesting that they can assemble catalytic-independent functions. In favor of this view, the activation of NF-AT by Vav proteins has been attributed to both Rac1-dependent and Rac1-independent pathways (24Kuhne M.R. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol.

If so, it is also possible that the engagement of multiple signal transduction pathways could originate in turn synergistic and/or negative feedback mechanisms that would favor the modification of the signaling output of specific Vav downstream routes by other Vav-dependent pathways. Other related questions in this area include the relative dependence (total or partial) of B-cell signal transduction pathways on Vav function, the hierarchical position of Vav downstream elements in the assembly of this multibranched route, and the level of overlap between the downstream pathways activated in lymphocytes by wild-type and oncogenic forms of both Vav and Rho/Rac proteins. To address these questions, we decided to conduct a multifaceted experimental approach based on the use of knockout cell lines, genetic rescue experiments, and the analysis of the effect of chemical inhibitors for enzymes located downstream of Vav proteins. Because mammalian B-cells contain the three Vav family members with overlapping functions that preclude an easy observation of signaling defects in single knockout animals (26Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 27Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), these studies were conducted using DT40 B-cells. This chicken cell line expresses primarily Vav3 (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Inabe K.

Another advantage of using DT40 cells is that there is a wide collection of DT40 cell clones deficient for different signal transduction molecules, thus facilitating the genetic dissection of the signal transduction pathways under study. Previous results have shown that this is an optimal experimental system for the functional characterization of both B-cell signaling and Vav family-dependent responses (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L.

Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and Cell Stimulation—Wild-type and mutant DT40 cells were obtained from the Riken Bioresource Center (Ibaraki, Japan) and cultured and electroporated as described before (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For cell stimulation, DT40 cells were resuspended in RPMI1640 media at a density of 5 × 106 cell/ml and then treated with either anti-IgM (5 μg/ml) or PMA (1 μg/ml) for the indicated periods of time. Inhibition of specific signaling pathways was achieved by incubation of DT40 cells with indicated inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C prior to cell stimulation. To inhibit PKC activities, DT40 cells were incubated with GF109203X (5 μm). To inhibit PLC-γ2 activity, DT40 cells were incubated with U73122 (10 μm) and, as negative control, with the inactive U73343 compound (10 μm). For MEK inhibition, cells were treated with PD98059 (50 μm). For the inhibition of PI3K activities, cells were incubated with Wortmannin (100 nm), p110α inhibitor 2 (0.1 μm), TGX221 (0.5 μm), or AS252424 (0.5 μm). Inhibition of PLD activities was achieved by maintaining cells in RPMI media supplemented with 0.3% n-butanol. As negative control, we used parallel cultures preincubated with 0.3% t-butanol as above. To chelate intracellular Ca2+ and to block its release from intracellular stores, DT40 cells were incubated with BAPTA (50 μm) and Dantrolene (50 μm), respectively. After the indicated stimulation conditions, cells were disrupted by vortexing in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm Na2VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, diluted 1:1 in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis with appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Activation of H-Ras was analyzed by pulldown assays using the H-Ras binding domain of c-Raf1 (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Vav Pathway Is Essential for Proper Activation of the PKC/PKD Pathway in B-cells—The activation by Vav proteins of enzymes that generate intracellular second-messengers indicates that they may have a major role in signal amplification and diversification in lymphocytes. To verify this possibility, we decided to monitor the activation of PKD in B-cells in either the presence or absence of Vav3 protein. We selected this signaling target, because PKD is dependent on DAG for membrane translocation and, in addition, requires the activity of PKC family members to achieve catalytic activation and adequate subcellular localization kinetics (32Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As previously described (33Wood C.D. Marklund U. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6245-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the stimulation of wild-type DT40 cells by BCR cross-linking with anti-IgM antibodies resulted in a rapid and stable phosphorylation of PKD at the PKC-dependent (serine residues 720 and 724) and autophosphorylation sites (serine residue 898) (Figs. 1A and data not shown, respectively). By contrast, BCR-stimulated vav3-/- DT40 cells were inefficient at promoting PKD phosphorylation in any of those sites (Figs. 1A and data not shown). These defects were linked to improper activation of PLC-γ2, because the phenotype of vav3-/- DT40 cells could be mimicked in wild-type cells using treatments with U73122 (Fig. 1B), a general PLC-γ family inhibitor. Moreover, the defects found in vav3-/- DT40 cells could be rescued by stimulating them with DAG analogs (PMA) (Fig. 1C) or, alternatively, by overexpressing in them either wild-type or palmitoylated, membrane-anchored versions of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 1D). The rescue of PKD phosphorylation by overexpressed PLC-γ1 proteins still required the engagement of the BCR (Fig. 1D), indicating that the activation of PLC-γ1 in B-cells needs both membrane translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation. The defective activation of PKD in vav3-/- DT40 cells was also rescued by the overexpression of wild-type Vav1 (Fig. 1D), confirming that the defects observed in these cells are directly derived from the elimination of Vav function on those cells. The stimulation conditions of PKD were very similar to those required for the stimulation of RasGRP1 (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Erk1 (Fig. 1, A, C, and D) (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and H-Ras (Fig. 1B) (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in the same set of experiments, further suggesting that these RasGRP/Ras and PKC/PKD cascades are under the regulation of the same Vav3/PLC-γ2 route during BCR signaling. To verify this possibility, we next performed rescue experiments in vav3-/- DT40 cells with constitutively active versions of Rho/Rac family members, because, in the case of the Ras-GRP/Ras pathway, the engagement of this route has been shown to be dependent on Vav1 GDP/GTP exchange activity and Rac1 signals in T- and B-cells (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Zugaza J.L. Caloca M.J. Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5823-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To this end, we expressed in vav3-/- DT40 cells human PKD-EGFP either alone or in combination with AU5-tagged versions of Rac1Q61L, RhoAQ63L, or Cdc42Q61L and then measured the phosphorylation levels of ectopically expressed PKD and endogenous Erk1 proteins by immunoblotting. These experiments indicated that Rac1Q61L, RhoAQ63L, and Cdc42Q61L could effectively rescue the phosphorylation of human PKD on residues 738, 742 (Fig. 2A, upper panel), and 910 (Fig. 2A, second panel from top). Those three sites are the counterparts of the phosphosites located at positions 720, 724, and 898 previously described in the chicken PKD ortholog. This pan-specific effect of Rho/Rac proteins on PKD phosphorylation was somewhat different in the case of the stimulation of endogenous Erk1, because, as previously described (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), RhoAQ63L cannot restore the activation of this Ras downstream element in vav3-/- DT40 cells (Fig. 2A, fourth panel from top). We next used Rac1Q61L effector mutants partially impaired in their signaling properties to identify the downstream routes implicated in PKD activation. These proteins included Rac1F37A+Q61L, a mutant that can activate p21-activated kinase and JNK without inducing detectable effects on the F-actin cytoskeleton or in cell transformation (34Joneson T.

Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); Rac1Y40C+Q61L, a mutant that triggers cytoskeletal change and tumorigenesis without stimulating p21-activated kinase or JNK (34Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); and Rac1Q61L+Δα3′, a mutant that lacks the α3′ insert region that promotes p21-activated kinase, JNK, and cytoskeletal change but is incapable of inducing superoxide production or cell transformation (35Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B (upper panel), the expression of Rac1Q61L+Δα3′ restored the phosphorylation of the ectopically expressed PKD fusion protein in vav3-/- DT40 cells to levels similar to those induced by Rac1Q61L. Instead, Rac1F37A+Q61L and Rac1Y40C+Q61L were totally or partially ineffective in restoring PKD phosphorylation, respectively. The inefficacy of these mutants in rescuing PKD phosphorylation is further highlighted by the observation that their expression levels are significantly higher than those of the Rac1Q61L+Δα3′ mutant protein (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). As a control, we observed that the co-transfection of wild-type Rac1 with the human PKD-EGFP protein was also ineffective in rescuing the phosphorylation of that kinase in vav3-/- DT40 cells (Fig. 2B, upper panel). To confirm the requirements of F-actin polymerization for the effective activation of PKD, we decided to study the effect of cytochalasin D, a known F-actin disrupting agent, on the BCR-dependent activation of PKD. As a control, we also monitored the phosphorylation of Erk1, because the stimulation of this kinase has been shown to be F-actin-dependent in DT40 cells (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These experiments indicated that the pre-treatment of wild-type DT40 cells with cytochalasin D does influence negatively the phosphorylation of endogenous PKD and Erk1 proteins (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that the activation of PKD in this system requires, like the RasGRP/Ras route (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Zugaza J.L. Caloca M.J. Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5823-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the Rac1 and the F-actin cytoskeleton. However, unlike the case of that latter pathway, the activation of PKD appears to be also facilitated by additional Rho/Rac family members and Rac1 effectors. Vav3-mediated PKD Phosphorylation Is Mediated Preferentially by PKCϵ—To identify the kinase directly involved in PKD phosphorylation, we performed immunoblot analysis to characterize the expression of a number of PKC family members in DT40 cells. PKCδ was not detected in those cells (data not shown). DT40 cells expressed, however, a large number of other PKC family members, although the expression of some of them was genotype-dependent. For example, we found that vav3-/- cells expressed PKCα, PKCϵ, and PKCι but not PKCβ (Fig. 3A). This lack of expression seemed to be compensated by the overexpression of PKCϵ in vav3-/- DT40 cells (Fig. 3A, third panel from top). Unlike this cell line, the parental and other knockout DT40 cell lines showed expression of the other PKC isoforms tested (Fig. 3A). The absence of PKCβ was not the consequence of the lack of activation of PKD in vav3-/--deficient cells, because PKD phosphorylation can be rescued by upstream elements to PKCs such as Vav1, PLC-γ1, or phorbol esters (see above, Fig. 1B). We then resorted to transient transfection experiments using constitutively active versions of PKCs to identify the PKC isoform(s) responsible for PKD phosphorylation in vav3-/- DT40 cells. To this end, the human PKD-EGFP fusion protein was expressed either alone or in combination with activated versions (A → E mutants) of PKCα and PKCϵ. We excluded PKCι in these analysis, because this protein, although expressed in DT40 cells (see above), is not regulated by either DAG or Ca2+ (36Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Ohno S. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 3B (upper panel), PKCϵAE and, to a much marginal level PKCαAE promoted the phosphorylation of the ectopically expressed human PKD on Ser738 and Ser743. Hence, PKCϵ is probably the main kinase that mediates PKD phosphorylation in DT40 cells. Influence of Proximal Vav Signaling Elements in the Activation of Distal Effectors of the Vav Pathway—It has been previously shown that Vav signaling in B-lymphocytes requires the participation of both adaptor molecules (Grb2 and Blnk) and downstream enzymes such as PLC-γ2 and PI3K (15Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Matallanas D. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3326-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Inabe K. Ishiai M. Scharenberg A.M. Freshney N. Downward J. Kurosaki T. J.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The availability of knockout cell clones deficient for all these signal transduction proteins allowed us to conduct comparative studies to revealing the signaling requirements for PKD phosphorylation by the BCR, the relative dependence of different BCR downstream pathways on Vav3 activity, and the possible cross-talk among the identified Vav3 downstream responses. To this end, we analyzed by immunoblot analysis the kinetics of phosphorylation of PKD, Erk1, and PKB (also known as Akt) in wild-type and Vav3-, Grb2-, Blnk-, PLC-γ2-, and p110α PI3K-deficient DT40 cells during BCR signal transduction. As previously shown (see above), the elimination of Vav3 expression led to the total elimination of the activation of PKD and Erk1 (Fig. 4, first block of panels). In contrast, these cells still displayed lower, but sig"
https://openalex.org/W2084703498,"Cryptochromes are blue light photoreceptors involved in development and circadian clock regulation. They are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes as light sensors. Long Hypocotyl in Far-Red 1 (HFR1) has been identified as a positive regulator and a possible transcription factor in both blue and far-red light signaling in plants. However, the gene targets that are regulated by HFR1 in cryptochrome 1 (cry1)-mediated blue light signaling have not been globally addressed. We examined the transcriptome profiles in a cry1- and HFR1-dependent manner in response to 1 hour of blue light. Strikingly, more than 70% of the genes induced by blue light in an HFR1-dependent manner were dependent on cry1, and vice versa. High overrepresentation of W-boxes and OCS elements were found in these genes, indicating that this strong cry1 and HFR1 co-regulation on gene expression is possibly through these two cis-elements. We also found that cry1 was required for maintaining the HFR1 protein level in blue light, and that the HFR1 protein level is strongly correlated with the global gene expression pattern. In summary, HFR1, which is fine-tuned by cry1, is crucial for regulating global gene expression in cry1-mediated early blue light signaling, especially for the function of genes containing W-boxes and OCS elements."
https://openalex.org/W2017099333,"The Giardia lamblia cyst wall is required for survival outside the host and infection. Three cyst wall protein (cwp) genes identified to date are highly up-regulated during encystation. However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms governing their gene regulation. Messenger RNAs containing premature stop codons are rapidly degraded by a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) system to avoid production of non-functional proteins. In addition to RNA surveillance, NMD also regulates thousands of naturally occurring transcripts through a variety of mechanisms. It is interesting to know the NMD pathway in the primitive eukaryotes. Previously, we have found that the giardial homologue of a conserved NMD factor, UPF1, may be functionally conserved and involved in NMD and in preventing nonsense suppression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NMD factors can regulate some naturally occurring transcripts in G. lamblia. We found that overexpression of UPF1 resulted in a significant decrease of the levels of CWP1 and cyst formation and of the endogenous cwp1-3, and myb2 mRNA levels and stability. This indicates that NMD could contribute to the regulation of the cwp1-3 and myb2 transcripts, which are key to G. lamblia differentiation into cyst. Interestingly, we also found that UPF1 may be involved in regulation of eight other endogenous genes, including up-regulation of the translation elongation factor gene, whose product increases translation which is required for NMD. Our results indicate that NMD factor could contribute to the regulation of not only nonsense containing mRNAs, but also mRNAs of the key encystation-induced genes and other endogenous genes in the early-diverging eukaryote, G. lamblia."
https://openalex.org/W2060528836,"The chromatin regulator Aiolos and the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 have been implicated in regulating aspects of B cell maturation and activation. Mice lacking either of these factors have a largely normal early B cell development. However, when both factors are eliminated simultaneously a block is uncovered at the transition between pre-B and immature B cells, indicating that these proteins exert a critical function in developing B lymphocytes. In mice deficient for Aiolos and OBF-1, the numbers of immature B cells are reduced, small pre-BII cells are increased and a significant impairment in immunoglobulin light chain DNA rearrangement is observed. We identified genes whose expression is deregulated in the pre-B cell compartment of these mice. In particular, we found that components of the pre-BCR, such as the surrogate light chain genes λ5 and VpreB, fail to be efficiently silenced in double-mutant mice. Strikingly, developmentally regulated nuclear repositioning of the λ5 gene is impaired in pre-B cells lacking OBF-1 and Aiolos. These studies uncover a novel role for OBF-1 and Aiolos in controlling the transcription and nuclear organization of genes involved in pre-BCR function."
https://openalex.org/W1990863324,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of a constitutively active Abl kinase, which is the product of a chimeric BCR-ABL gene, caused by the genetic translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib, a selective inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, has significantly improved the clinical outcome of patients with CML. However, subsets of patients lose their response to treatment through the emergence of imatinib-resistant cells, and imatinib treatment is less durable for patients with late stage CML. Although alternative Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to overcome drug resistance, a cocktail therapy of different kinase inhibitors and additional chemotherapeutics may be needed for complete remission of CML in some cases. Chlorambucil has been used for treatment of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's disease. Here we report that a DNA sequence-specific pyrrole-imidazole polyamide-chlorambucil conjugate, 1R-Chl, causes growth arrest of cells harboring both unmutated BCR-ABL and three imatinib resistant strains. 1R-Chl also displays selective toxicities against activated lymphocytes and a high dose tolerance in a murine model."
https://openalex.org/W1966455417,"Background Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) forms stable ternary complexes in which RT is bound tightly at fixed positions on the primer-template (P/T). We have probed downstream interactions between RT and the template strand in the complex containing the incoming dNTP (+1 dNTP•RT•P/T complex) and in the complex containing the pyrophosphate analog, foscarnet (foscarnet•RT•P/T complex). Methods and Results UV-induced cross-linking between RT and the DNA template strand was most efficient when a bromodeoxyuridine residue was placed in the +2 position (the first template position downstream from the incoming dNTP). Furthermore, formation of the +1 dNTP•RT•P/T complex on a biotin-containing template inhibited binding of streptavidin when biotin was in the +2 position on the template but not when the biotin was in the +3 position. Streptavidin pre-bound to a biotin residue in the template caused RT to stall two to three nucleotides upstream from the biotin residue. The downstream border of the complex formed by the stalled RT was mapped by digestion with exonuclease RecJF. UV-induced cross-linking of the complex formed by the pyrophosphate analog, foscarnet, with RT and P/T occurred preferentially with bromodeoxyuridine in the +1 position on the template in keeping with the location of RT one base upstream in the foscarnet•RT•P/T complex (i.e., in the pre-translocation position). Conclusions For +1 dNTP•RT•P/T and foscarnet•RT•P/T stable complexes, tight interactions were observed between RT and the first unpaired template nucleotide following the bound dNTP or the primer terminus, respectively."
